Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","And at this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Mark Alexee, Investor Relations Manager for Chipotle Mexican Grill. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements of our management's business outlook, forecasts for comparable restaurant sales trends, estimates of food, labor, occupancy and marketing cost trends for future periods, G&A and other cost savings for the full-year 2017, and descriptions of the impact of new technologies on our business, projections of effective tax rates for 2017, projections of capital investments and statements of our stock repurchases, as well as other statements or expectations and plans.","These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Q for a discussion of these risks.","I'd also like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period for Q1 will begin on the 15th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the first quarter of 2017, it will begin March 15 and continue to our first quarter earnings release planned for April 25. We will start today's call with prepared remarks, and then we will take 20 to 30 minutes of questions.","Because we recently presented our 2017 strategy at the ICR conference, our prepared remarks today will be brief before opening the lines for Q&A. We ask that you please limit your questions to one or two per individual.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will also have Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Marketing and Development Officer; and Curt Garner, our Chief Information Officer, available for questions.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today, I'm more confident than ever about Chipotle's future. I believe firmly in our mission to ensure that great food made with whole unprocessed ingredients is accessible to everyone. And I'm very encouraged by our rapid progress toward simplifying our operations and ensuring that we deliver an extraordinary dining experience for each and every one of our guests, in each and every one of our restaurants. I'm also confident in the significant changes we've made throughout the last year to position Chipotle for a strong performance in 2017.","These efforts include the implementation of an industry-leading food safety system, investments in digital to enhance customer convenience of ordering, expanded use of consumer data and analysis, and changes to our leadership to strengthen our culture and sharpen our focus on the customer. Our business was built on doing just a few things and doing them extremely well. As we continue to restore our economic model, I'm most optimistic about our renewed focus on simplifying our restaurant operations and delivering an excellent guest experience.","Our restaurant teams and field leaders are quickly embracing this new focus with enthusiasm. As we closed out the quarter and shifted to implementing our strategic plan for 2017, our teams are more motivated, more focused, and more energized than they have been in years.","For the fourth quarter of 2016, we generated revenue of $1.03 billion, an increase of 3.7% on comparable restaurant sales decline of 4.8%, and the opening of 72 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $0.55 per share for the quarter. Our comparable restaurant sales improved to a positive 14.7% in December, as we lapped the softer comparison from December 2015.","Since our last update at the ICR conference in January, we've continued to make progress in ensuring that every restaurant is delivering an excellent guest experience. Next week, we will roll out a series of critical updates to our Restaurateur program which identifies, validates, and rewards our top-performing managers. These updates will align the achievement of restaurateur status with the measurable elements that directly resolve in an excellent customer experience.","This was not the case in previous years when managers who achieved certain targets related to our people culture could be promoted to restaurateur despite the fact that the restaurants were not necessarily delivering excellent customer experience. All our teams now know that the path to restaurateur starts and ends with the customer experience they deliver. We've dramatically simplified the process and metrics. Our teams know that in order to become a restaurateur, you need to not only deliver A level of customer service, but also show that you can sustain that A level of service.","It's clear that this focused approach is already making a difference. I restaurateurs have demonstrated the ability to deliver the highest level of customer satisfaction, and they are achieving this success by focusing on the critical elements of running a great restaurant, hiring great people, and training them to cook and serve delicious food quickly in a clean and inviting environment.","To fully align the entire company around delivering an excellent guest experience, we're rolling out a new compensation system for our restaurant managers, restaurateurs, and field leaders. This new program is designed to reward those leaders who are delivering the best customer experience on a sustainable basis. We're implementing incentives that not only reward our teams for running great restaurants, but also for demonstrating continuous improvement in sustaining high performance. Beyond our efforts to strengthen the quality of customer service and restaurant operations, we are also making progress on our key digital initiatives.","We' have redesigned and simplified our online ordering site, enabled online payment for catering and integrated with several well-known third-party providers for delivery. And we are well into the roll out of smarter pickup times. With more than 1,200 restaurants now using this system and the remaining restaurants will roll out this technology next week. The initial results for restaurants using smarter pickup times are encouraging. Not only are these restaurants seeing increases in the number of digital orders, but customers are also seeing faster service times between the time of order and the time of pickup. This improvement in speed of service reduces the average customer's wait by roughly half as compared to our legacy ordering system.","With these significant improvements to our digital ordering experience, we are now in a position to promote digital ordering more aggressively. Just last month, we began promoting our new online ordering site, order.chipotle.com in those restaurants that already have smarter pickup times.","By marketing these offerings, we have the potential to dramatically increase digital orders. We're also working aggressively to continue to attract and convert more new and lapsed customers. Over the second half of 2016, we attracted millions of new or lapsed customers. And we are pleased with the rate at which these new customers are converting from new or lapsed to regular customers.","We're also excited about the potential to make these customers even more loyal and more frequent. After all, frequent customers start as infrequent ones. And our data shows that customers become more frequent in restaurants that are delivering a great experience. That's why it's so crucial to elevate the quality of the customer service in all of our restaurants.","To help us execute our marketing strategy, we recently hired two new agency partners, Venables Bell for advertising and MullenLowe Mediahub for media planning and buying. These new partners will support the largest advertising campaign in our history, launching in April. The campaign will focus on taste and great ingredients in a way that clearly differentiates Chipotle from the competition.","We'll also continue to build greater loyalty with our existing customers through brand marketing centered around our commitment to serving delicious food made from ingredients raised responsibly.","These marketing initiatives combined with the ongoing improvements in the customer experience, and improved digital ordering channels gives me great confidence that 2017 is teed up to be a very successful year for Chipotle.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As we start the new year we're optimistic about the direction we're headed. And we've already seen encouraging signs of improved restaurant operations. We finished the year with three consecutive months of improvements in each of our three internal customer satisfaction scores.","Our restaurant teams and field leaders are quickly responding to our recent pivot to simplify restaurant operations, and they are keenly focused on delivering an excellent customer experience. These are early days with this new renewed focus on the customer, but we are proud of how our teams have responded, and it gives us great confidence that we're on the right track.","With the change in the focus of our restaurant teams, which includes incentivizing and rewarding an elevated customer experience combined with our strategic initiatives related to digital and marketing Chipotle brands, we're are optimistic about our ability to one, grow our sales, two, improve our margins over time, and three, allow us to invest and building long-term shareholder value.","There remains a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we believe in our vision, we believe in our strategy and we believe in our team's ability to continue to drive operational improvements.","During December, we recorded positive monthly comp of 14.7%, which includes a 60 basis point benefit for deferred revenue related to Chiptopia. The sales comparisons ease in January as we're comparing to a down 36% versus a down 30% in December of 2015.","But the dollar sales trends continued from December into January, and the January preliminary comp improved to 24.6%, which included a negative trading day of over 100 basis points, slightly offset by 20 basis points positive related to Chiptopia. For the first 28 days in January, the comp was 26%. But in the last three days of January, we traded a Friday and Saturday from last year, two of our highest volume days, for a Monday and Tuesday this year, two of our lowest volume days of the week.","Of course winter weather in January often results in choppy trends day-to-day and week-to-week, but when we analyze the underlying comp trends, the January sales held up well, especially considering January had the lowest promotional activity of the past 12 months. We'll compare against a comp of down 26% in February and March, so expect the comp will ease accordingly during the rest of the quarter.","Our average check declined during the full-year 2016, primarily due to a smaller group size. But the average check began to rebound in December and January, increasing by about 2% compared to last year, which recaptured about two-thirds of our decrease in check. During the fourth quarter, we reported $1.035 billion in sales, which included $6 million of previously deferred revenue related to our Chiptopia promotion. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our trailing 12-month average unit volume was down to just under $1.9 million, and that average volume will now begin to rebuild as our comps have turned positive.","Looking to the P&L in Q4, we reported restaurant level margins of 13.5%. Our food costs were 35.3%, which is impacted by elevated avocado prices during October and November, which added about 40 basis points versus Q3. Assuming no significant change in expected food inflation, we expect our full-year 2017 food costs will be in the low 34% range. This includes anticipated cost savings from negotiations with our suppliers and our restaurant managing food costs by reducing waste and optimizing food ordering, food prep and their inventory.","Labor costs were 27.5%, during the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points versus last year. Deleverage from lower restaurant sales along with wage inflation of about 5%, combined to negatively impact our labor cost as a percent of sales by a little over 200 basis points. But we started to see better deployment of our restaurant teams including salaried managers, which reduced labor by about 60 basis points.","During 2017, we expect labor wage inflation will likely continue at the 4% to 5% level, which would add about 100 basis points or more to labor costs versus the full-year 2016. However, we are targeting to more than offset this inflation through continued better deployment of our salaried and hourly teams throughout the year and from leverage on a positive comp. Through January, we've maintained progress from the fourth quarter, and we hope to continue to build on gains and effective labor deployment throughout 2017.","Typically, our Q1 labor as a percent of sales is about the same as the fourth quarter labor percent. However, during Q1 2017, to be sure, we will fully support the higher volume of digital orders expected from our first-ever broad-based marketing of digital. We expect to invest around $2 million in additional labor, or about 20 basis points. So Q1 labor as a percent of sales will be slightly higher in Q4. Once we have the cadence and better predictability of digital sales, our labor matrix should fully fund the hours needed to support our growing digital business.","Occupancy as a percent of sales was higher due to sales deleverage, but with positive comps, we expect our occupancy costs in 2017 to decline to just over 7% of sales. Our other operating costs during the quarter were 16.3% of sales, including 4.7% of sales related to marketing and promotional activities. As we head into 2017, we are targeting an overall combined marketing and promo investment of around 3% of sales, although we will consider increasing that investment during the year based on the actual results of specific marketing efforts.","The path to restoring our economic model is not a complicated one. But the operational efficiency and cost savings opportunities we've outlined will require great execution by our restaurant teams, led by our field leaders. Our teams are more aligned than ever on priority for 2017. And our first priority is to focus on our customers and provide excellent hospitality to every customer every day. And by simplifying operation to focus on the guests, the very things that lead to a great experience, the proper training and deployment of the restaurant team at the right time throughout the day and the proper ordering, prep and cooking of the right amount of delicious food throughout the day will also lead to better business results.","As an example, we often have nearly the right number of hours scheduled for the full day, but too often we are short one crew person during peak lunch, when full staffing is imperative to deliver great throughput. And we have extra crew members during non-peak parts of the day. The overall hours are nearly correct for the day, but the deployment is not yet optimal. This can contribute to a deterioration of service levels during our critical peak hours. So consistently scheduling more effectively throughout the day will result in a better guest experience and better margins.","Our G&A costs in the fourth quarter were 6.3% of sales and for the full year were 7.1% of sales for a total of $276 million. We've worked diligently over the past year to effectively manage our overhead costs, while supporting a growing business, strategically realigning resources to the highest priority. Our underlying G&A for 2017 excluding our support staff and employee bonus program and stock compensation is expected to be flat or even down versus last year. But including these items, we expect our G&A in 2017 will increase to around $300 million.","After two years of reduced employee bonuses for our support team and no bonuses for the executive team, we expect to return to paying targeted bonuses for all employees in 2017, which will add around $20 million. We expect our stock comp will increase from around $55 million in 2016 to around $75 million to $80 million in 2017.","The $55 million into 2016 was artificially low as it included a $6 million reversal of expense related to a performance share award where the shares expired unvested. We are planning to grant a retention bonus in the form of restricted shares for our non-executive support staff. And we also plan to broaden the participation in the equity plans, which combined with the one-time retention grant, will add around $15 million to $20 million to the stock comp. Offsetting these increases in staff bonuses and equity grants, our G&A reductions, including a reduction for our All Managers' Conference, which is held biannually and will not occur in 2017, along with expected reductions in legal and other G&A expenses.","Our 2017 incentive equity programs have not been finalized, so these are just estimates at this time. A nonrecurring retention plan based on restricted shares and set of options is a great way to reward the hard-working commitment our people have put forth, and makes it much more likely they will stay and grow with us.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was higher than recent years at 48.7%, and effective tax rate for the full-year 2016 was 40.8%, compared with 38.2% in 2015. And comparing the full-year rates, our higher rate in 2016 was primarily due to higher effective state tax rate. We expect the 2017 full-year effective tax rate to return to normalized level and be in the 39% to 39.5% range, excluding possible volatility in the rate due to the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the tax treatment for exercises in the employee equity plan.","During the quarter, we generated $68 million in cash from operations, which funded our $67 million investment in capital expenditure. As of December 31, we maintain $543 million in cash and liquid investments. We also repurchased $67 million worth of stock during the quarter at a weighted average price of $392 per share. For the full year 2017, we anticipate that we will invest about $225 million in CapEx, and going forward we anticipate we'll continue to generate cash from operations sufficient to fund new restaurants, while using excess funds from operations to opportunistically repurchase shares of stock.","We faced a number of challenges over the past 14 months. We've also realigned our focus and have made important investments that are now beginning to take hold. We've reevaluated and refocused our operations. We've strengthened our marketing capabilities. We've introduced important enhancements related to digital, and we've begun to capture operating efficiencies. All of which make us optimistic about what we can accomplish in 2017.","And despite the challenges, we've never lost sight of our purpose, which is what has made Chipotle a compelling brand and a compelling company. It's an exciting time for all us at Chipotle and we look forward to what our team is going to accomplish this year.","Thanks for your time today. We'd now like to open up the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Jack, just a question about the outlook for this year. I know you gave a lot of the pieces there in your commentary, but last quarter you outlined a goal or guidance of getting to around $10 in earnings per share, and there was no comment around that figure this time around. So could you just talk about whether that number is still in play in your mind? Or whether that's changed since the last time you commented?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yes, David. We had talked about that in the third quarter that we had a stretch goal of $10 EPS during 2017, and a stretch margin of 20%. Those are still in play. We are still shooting for those. We didn't include those only because we discussed those at length at ICR and in other investor conferences. We've characterized those as reasonable, but stretch goals, and so they are still in play.","I'd like to think, for example, the 20% restaurant level margin is something that we still expect to get to that sort of a run rate during the year, to make sure that we leverage the P&L as our sales have turned positive now. Make sure we drive operational efficiencies, make sure we do everything we can to restore our economic model. And we believe we can get to a run rate of right around that 20% restaurant level margin.","Now will we get to that run rate in time so that we can deliver the full $10 in EPS and deliver an overall 20% margin? That's where the stretch comes in. So it's still a goal that's in play, David, but we're not characterizing it as normal guidance, if that makes sense.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then I guess on that last point on the run rate on the margin, can you talk about \u2013 I guess is the idea that that would be the run rate that you would carry over into 2018? Or would you exit the year at a higher rate so that 2018, all else being equal, would be higher than 2017?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, the idea behind the 20%, David, was based on kind of what our current volumes are right now and what we put out there as a comp guidance in the high-single digits is we think that our model has the potential, if we can do everything right from an execution standpoint, that we can deliver around that run rate of around 20%. If we end the year with momentum in comp and we see ourselves continuing to drive positive comps in 2018, that margin has upward potential. I've stated a number of times that if we can get all of our sales back, so if we can return to a $2.5 million restaurant company that we have the ability to fully regain all of our margin up to that 26%, 27% or higher.","Now there are pieces of that, that we've been absorbing; for example, inflation. We've not had a price increase in three years. We're not planning any specific price increase right now. But at some point over time, we'll need to pass on some of the higher costs. But we believe we'll be able to do that. And then that along with leverage from the higher sales, that along with better negotiation, that along with better management at the restaurant level and holding the line on the P&L, on individual P&L line item. We still think we have the ability to recapture the high 20% margin range. The most important factor, though, year-by-year, is sales, how much we can build in terms of sales.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And moving on, we'll hear from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Just following-up on David's questions, can you guys provide some detail on the expected timeline for your cost control efforts on both the labor and food cost lines? I'm just curious how quickly we can see those benefits. Jack, if there's anything you can tell us about the cadence in which you'd expect to see some of those initiatives pay some dividends for you guys.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Jeff, it's going to be hard and I really don't want to peg specific quarters. At ICR, we talked about, there's risk levels of everything we need to do to get to that kind of a 20% run rate. Some of the things like avocados have already come down, so that's going to happen. You're already going to see food costs improve during the first quarter. Other items, strategically doing a better job of managing our food costs during the year, that will happen over time. And so to say exactly when we will achieve the full savings that we potentially get at restaurant level, I don't want to commit to that.","We could move really quick on that \u2013 quickly on that. And what's likely to happen is that our restaurants are going to move too quickly and portion size might be reduced; holding times might increase so that the quality experience might be reduced. Instead, what we want to do is make sure that we are ordering correctly, we're scheduling the right prep, that we're scheduling people during the right time. And we want to make sure that we're doing that in the right way every time.","So I'd rather talk about it as we expect to get to a run rate during the year, Jeff and rather than commit to it in terms of specifically which quarter. And of course, the biggest variable here is the sales building. And so that's been the biggest variable in the last year, the hardest to predict. And so, our ability to recover our margins is highly contingent upon how we proceed in terms of the comps from here on out.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just one quick follow-up. You were asked about this at ICR, but just in terms of some color on the performance of those TV tests, I think it was in three markets, I think it was November-ish timeframe. But more specifically, where you tested TV, if those markets held on to any relative same-store sales performance in the weeks following the tests. So again, any color you can provide in terms of how impactful those marketing or TV tests have been would be helpful.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure, Jeff. This is Mark. The tests, as I mentioned at ICR, were \u2013 had the results I more or less expected, but it's somewhat mixed. So the results that we saw were basically an outsized level of awareness relative to the media buy, which is typical for television. But it's notoriously difficult to tease apart which part of the comp is a result of which part of the marketing or whether or not it was weather or competitive pressures or whatnot. But what I will say is that we saw a lift in two of the three markets where we tested. We actually saw a negative trend in one of the three markets. That's why I say it's mixed, so it's very difficult to tell the \u2013 to determine these things. So I can't tell you that we necessarily held or didn't hold the comp because it just wasn't big enough over that period of time for us to have seen \u2013 been able to identify the trend clearly.","But having said that, it was a relatively small test. So these were three markets and it was just over a month of run for those spots, which really isn't a lot in the world of television. So the way to look at it going forward is as we launch our new campaign in April, there will be a video component, some of which will be on television. And it will be in a much more sustained run of the buy. So that will give us a much, much better sense of how television is performing. But the test as I mentioned, did confirm for me what I more or less thought it was going to do. But it certainly \u2013 that test wasn't a silver bullet.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Moving on, from RBC Capital Markets, we have David Palmer.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good evening. You've discussed digital ordering, the new marketing, the simplification of operations. If you end up seeing your two-year trend rebuild through the year, what do you suspect will be the biggest reason for that rebuilding?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, okay. We've \u2013 I'm not sure, you might get a different answer from each of us. I think it's going to be based on the way we execute in the restaurant delivering a great customer experience, because that includes making sure the restaurant is clean, the line, the serving line is clean, that throughput is fast, that our crew is just providing an overall excellent experience. And when we execute well in the restaurant everything else is going to work well also. We have a better shot at executing digital, and so I think the single biggest thing we can do and the thing that we've been focused on really intently is to simplify our operations, make sure that our teams know clearly what it takes to deliver an excellent customer experience, which they do. That's the thing they do the best.","If anything, we've maybe complicated it in the past. We've really de-mystified that, we've uncomplicated it, we're tying incentives to delivering an excellent experience. And I think that's the single biggest thing that will drive our sales during the year.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And if you see certain metrics, what metrics will you look at this year to contemplate a potential price increase? You've talked about that being something you'll contemplate at some point. What will you look at to think about doing that?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yes, David. We would look at our strongest markets, the market that have recovered the best, the markets that weren't impacted in the first place. And we'll look at markets where our operations are strong. And then we'll look at what competitors are doing. We don't have any plans right now, specific plans, but at some point we'll dip our toe in the water, and we'll take a market where there is a very low risk. And when the trends continue to build, and again, we're confident about our teams, we're confident about our pricing power, we're confident about we've got room to do this compared to our competitors. We'll at some point decide to dip our toe in the water and see how well that goes in that market. If that goes well, we'll consider what we do from there. But no specific plans right now to do anything with price.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the comp recovering (30:07), the volumes that you are seeing in both existing and new stores. And on the existing stores, I think as was referenced, a lot of us are inclined to look at two-year trends to control for ease or difficulty of comparison. So with that in mind, it looks like you are seeing a nice acceleration. Is that how you are thinking about the volumes? That you are in fact seeing, if you control for seasonality, a pretty nice improvement versus what appeared to be no real change through last year? And then on the new unit volumes, could you just talk about productivity there? I know in the past you have said when you market around new unit volumes \u2013 or new unit openings you see some improvement. But can you just talk a bit about if that's continued?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yes, I will take the question on the comp, Sara, and then I'll turn it over to Mark on the new stores. The way I would say it is \u2013 I feel good about the comp trend. I feel like we're at least holding our own and perhaps starting to see an inflection point. But most importantly, we are doing this with very little promo. So we've weaned ourselves off of promo. Most of the improvement from December into January was we're going up against a softer comp, but I feel really good about that.","And January is not a great month to get a perfect read on the trends. When you look at it day-by-day and week-by-week, you do see some volatility because of weather this year, weather last year. But when we look at it day-by-day, week-by-week, we feel good about what we're seeing, we feel good about holding onto or perhaps building sales from the previous trends. We're also seeing geographically that the Northeast has made a nice move in January, and so they've come back to the pack. And so we talked about the coast being the weakest, but during January, we saw the Northeast really come back to the pack quite a bit. And so the West Coast is still remained to be an outlier, so that was a nice move. And so we'll, Sara, continue to watch what happens during February. And then as the weather clears, but we feel pretty good about the trend so far.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","And then Mark, you want to...","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, Sara, with regard to the new restaurants, they're performing right now at about 74% of our regular restaurants, which is an improvement, it got as low as 70% during the crisis, and we do see that the stores that we market are performing better. So now all new restaurants receive marketing at their opening. The other change that we've made with regard to new stores is the way we're choosing real estate, particularly in developing markets. As you know, we have our, or you may know, our real estate markets are categorized into four different categories, knew, proven, established, and developing. And in developing markets, we've reverted to choosing only Tier 1 sites, which we expect will have an ongoing effect on improving the ADS (33:21) in those restaurants. So all said, we're confident in where the new restaurants are headed and in the strategy around choosing those and in marketing.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Next from Bank of America, we'll hear from Gregory Francfort.","Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Just going back to the margin question, maybe looking back at 2010 to 2015, I think you guys held the 26% to 27% restaurant margins on volumes that went from 18% to 24%. Can you talk about maybe why that was? And then as you look forward to 2018, do you need $2.5 million volumes to get to 27% restaurant margins? And how does that play together?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Greg, if you look back to those periods, depending on what you look at, you're going to see a much different food cost. We in the fourth quarter had a 35.3% food cost. When you look back into those periods you're going to see a food cost somewhere in the 30%, 31% range, there's 400 basis point right there. The other piece is labor inflation.","Since 2012, we've had labor inflation totaling about 20%. We have only taken about 5% of a menu price increase in that time, and so we've eaten a couple hundred basis points worth of labor inflation, at least, maybe even more. And so the food cost is higher because of things like, we've had inflation at steak, we've invested in Food With Integrity, things like that, And because we are a little bit behind right now menu pricing, I would say our food is at an elevated level, we've been eating some of the higher food costs over time, same thing with the labor.","And so we need a combination, frankly, of getting our volume back, getting back into the $2.5 million range, delivering on some of the efficiencies that we've talked about, and passing on some of these higher costs to our customers. And if we do all that, I think we can get back into the high 20s%. If we only stayed at this current volume, $2 million, or so, I think it would be a stretch to consider getting some margin in the mid-20% range or higher, unless we wanted to just jam a very high menu price increase, but that's never been part of our strategy, because we want to be accessible to the masses. We want to remain affordable.","Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then maybe just to follow-up, like to get to the 20% margins, I guess what sort of volumes do you need to do?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, it's within our guidance range. We talked about a guidance range for the year of in the high single-digits. So if we can achieve that kind of a comp, then achieve some of the negotiated savings that we've talked about, and achieve the operational savings, principally in food and labor, we think we can get up to \u2013 in the range of that 20% run rate.","Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Very helpful. Appreciate it.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Looking at just sort of unit by unit and the initiatives to better manage cost of sales and labor, is there any sort of difference in the success rate you are having for stores that might be seeing more versus kind of less volatile week-to-week or day-to-day sales trends?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I'm not sure I understand the question, Karen, so unit-by-unit, when we see \u2013 are you trying to link our cost savings initiatives with sales building initiatives, to see if there's a correlation?","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, is there a correlation between units that might be \u2013 you had talked about just sort of week-to-week, day-to-day sales trends staying somewhat volatile. Are sort of the cost management initiatives going better or a little bit easier to wrap your heads around in stores that might be seeing a more consistent and less volatile sales trends?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Oh, yeah, yeah, yes. The answer is yes. And the volatility is not unit-by-unit; it's more market-by-market based on geography. But yes, it's a lot easier to manage food and labor \u2013 labor especially when you have predictability. And so when you have volatile weather, we have a snowstorm one day, your tendency is to probably have too many people on the staff and certainly even send people home. But generally, you are going to have deleverage, you're going to have excess labor, maybe excess food, although we don't usually \u2013 we have multiple deliveries a week, and so we don't usually have a problem unless we are closed because of a snowstorm for multiple day. But there's question about it. When we have predictability of the sales, we can do a better job of managing things like labor.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Karen.","Operator","Next from Morgan Stanley, we have John Glass.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks very much. First, in your plans to roll out and accelerate digital, does that include activating that second line you've talked about? And maybe I'm having a hard time imagining it, but is it the kind of thing where you'd have to set it up for peak periods, staff it, and then break it down when it gets quieter? Or do you not need that second line, that's not really part of the plan for the first phase of digital?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I'll start with it, and then Curt may want to add on. John, a second make line is a huge part of it. It's a critical part of it. We have the second make line in most of our stores, some 90-something percent. I don't have the exact number. It is underutilized in a lot of our stores. In the 1,200 stores that we've already rolled out smarter pickup times, all of those stores already have a second make line specialist, a takeout specialist. We rolled out specifically to those stores first because we knew that they were staffed. We already knew that they have a skill and already the habits of using that second make line and executing well on the second make line.","The stores that are going to roll out next week are the lower-volume stores. They don't necessarily have a takeout specialist, a trained takeout specialist. The $2 million investment that I described, that is an investment in labor for those teams to open up that line. It is going to be in excess of \u2013 kind of an advanced investment because if the sales \u2013 or as the sales come, our labor matrix will fully fund and fully allow those hours and we'll have normal margins. But we don't want to wait for the sales, execute poorly and then say, oh, we better start adding some labor. So we're going to front-load that a little bit, invest some extra labor in those stores. And then we'll be able to adjust. If stores stay low volume, we'll be able to adjust and make sure that we have the appropriate amount of labor. But we're optimistic that we're going to see additional digital second make line sales in all of our stores, and that will justify the labor investment that we're making in February. And it'll be fully part of the labor matrix.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And if I could just follow-up, can you just refresh our memory from last year first and second quarter when you were doing more promotional activity? Were all transactions accounted for in comps or were the free burritos not recorded in the top line?","And then was all the cost associated with that, was that all in the other operating expense line? Or was there anything else, for example in food costs, that related specifically to those promotions?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, John, when we have promotions, none of that would be in the sales because we would \u2013 it would be free. You would see the entire cost of that. So we would take the costs related to the food that we're giving away, all of that would be other and that would be in promo. And so for example, when we talk about 4.7% of sales in the fourth quarter being marketing and promo, the promo part of that is buy one, get ones or free chips and guac and things like that. So that's how you'd see the pieces.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","But to be clear, you wouldn't record a transaction if someone came in and got a free burrito?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yes. We would record our transactions. So when you saw us report last year, if we did a, say, a \u2013 where transactions outperformed sales, that would be because if you came in and you got a free burrito, we would count you as a transaction, yet there would be no sales.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a quick question on the Northeast and the improvement there. I think you might have done some leadership changes in the Northeast as well. So if you could maybe talk about what you think the causal elements have been in the Northeast.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, it's \u2013 I don't know yet, Sharon, whether I can attribute it to that. I'm very confident in the team out there, and I'm very confident that they will drive not only operational savings and customer experience improvements and that will lead to better sales. And so we may be seeing some of those early dividends. It may also be just a little volatility with the winter weather, but it looks pretty good to me. It looks like they closed the gap in a pretty meaningful way.","So I'd like to say that yeah, the folks out there, even though they've only been out there a couple months, that they're already making a difference. But I know they still got their work ahead of them. But I'm optimistic that this is the right team. They are some of our top proven leaders that have gone in other markets and done a really fantastic job of hiring great people, training them and delivering a great experience. So it probably is some early dividends on that, Sharon, but it's really hard to tease out how much is that versus how much is just other factors.","Operator","All right. And moving on, we'll take our last question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. First, Jack, just a very basic question. I even apologize for asking it. The first quarter, for a lot of different reasons \u2013 the year-ago comparisons, the promos, the closed store, leap day \u2013 there's a lot of things that make the first quarter unusually difficult to predict from a comp perspective. And I know you've given full-year guidance and you don't typically give a quarterly guidance. But with you having access to all the data and just seeing the overall trend in customers, is it fair for me to ask somewhat of a comp range for people to expect in the first quarter because I fear expectations might be a little bit all over the place?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, it's fair to ask but we're not going to give it. We're thinking about building this business over more than just a quarter at a time. We're focused on running great restaurants. We're focused on the customer. We're focused on digital; focused on brand marketing and focused on restoring our economic model. So to breakout prediction quarter-by-quarter and then being defined based on those quarter-by-quarter predictions just isn't really helpful for us right now. So sorry, John. We're not going to do that, but we'll continue to give you updates each quarter. And we'll give you as much insight as we can about what we're doing, how we're doing. And I think that's a better way to discuss the \u2013 how the trends are going.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I completely understand. I thought maybe we could get away with it just for this one quarter.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","It's always worth a try.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then secondly, if I may, separate, could we talk about the direction of employee turnover, I mean maybe where that \u2013 you kind of peaked in 2016, what's happening with turnover now and if you're starting to see a market change, or I suppose improvement in turnover? And how you think that may be influencing your execution at the store level?","Curtis Evander Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. So there's no question that we saw accelerating turnover rates post crisis for a number of reasons that we've talked about in the past. Laying on a lot of complexity to the teams, not \u2013 just a lot of new food safety initiatives, things like this. And so it's complicated for our teams, and that was one of the reasons that there was turnover. I will say, though, that since we have made it very, very clear how we find success in our restaurants now and how we get our restaurants to A and then on to restaurateur. The clarity and the understanding of how to do that has really helped morale. It's palpable. We can feel it in the restaurants.","I think our folks appreciate that we've simplified it. I think that in our past, the tools that we had were sometimes more complicated than actually running a good restaurant. So we've really allowed now our folks \u2013 with great training, with a clear path to restaurateur, we've really allowed them to thrive. And so we're starting to see a great morale. And I think this is going to contribute to lower turnover throughout the year.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","All right. And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mark Alexee for any additional or closing remarks.","Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Great. Thanks, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you to discuss our first quarter results in late April.

All participants are now in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you. ","I would now like introduce Chipotle\u2019s Director of Communications, Chris Arnold. You may begin your conference.","Chris Arnold","Hello everyone and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter 2014. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements about our business model and consumer trends and how those may influence our results in the future as well as projections of comp restaurant sales, the number of restaurants we intend to open, the impact of menu price increases, trends in food, labour, and G&A costs, effective tax rates, stock repurchases and shareholder returns, as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated on our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks.","I would like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter, it will begin December 1st and continue through our year-end release. ","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Crumpacker, Chief Marketing and Development Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells","Thanks Chris. Well I am extremely pleased with our performance during the third quarter. We have continued the momentum we build through the first half of the year growing revenue to $1.08 billion for the quarter, an increase of 31.1% on same store sales growth of 19.8% and the opening of 43 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $4.15 for the quarter, an increase of 56%. ","These results would be remarkable for any restaurant company but for Chipotle where we are now more than 21 years old with more than 1700 restaurants and average unit volumes of more than $2.4 million, we think they are extraordinary. While our performance has been particularly strong this year, our results have been solid throughout our history as a public company even through the depths of the recession and I am often asked how we continue to perform so well. The fact is there is no great mystery to it. Our ability to generate such strong sales growth is the result of our commitment to serving the best tasting food we can. Food that is made with ingredients from more sustainable sources and prepared using classic cooking techniques, and our commitment to having teams of top performers in our restaurants who are empowered to provide an extraordinary customer experience. ","It is our focus on these two key areas that will allow us to achieve our vision to change the way people think about any fast food. This formula is unique in the world of traditional fast food in some very important ways. The traditional fast food sector has traded food quality and taste for low cost and ease of preparation. It has aggressively marketed low prices to entice customers to visit more often which has resulted in the need to reduce cost by cheapening ingredients and by compromising the overall dining experience. We have not made these compromises because our fundamental belief is that in order to provide an extraordinary customer experience you cannot take shortcuts.","We have shown that we can spend more on ingredients not less and charge a fair price and at the same time, generate outstanding business results. That we can prepare food using classic cooking techniques in each and every one of our more than 1700 restaurants and have consistency. That we can provide great service and still be fast. That we can have teams of top performing managers and crews cooking in the restaurants and still maintain an efficient labor model. Rather than compromise any of the important variables involved in running restaurants, our decision is to deliver all of them and it allows us to create an extraordinary experience that is unique to Chipotle. ","This formula has worked extremely well for us since the very beginning and others are starting to notice. A July survey of fast food customers asked more than 32,000 participants who reportedly ate at more than 96,000 fast food meals at 65 chains to rank restaurants based on the quality of the food and the experience. Chipotle topped the list, while traditional fast food restaurants where ranked near the bottom, with customer citing uninspiring food as the primary reason. Despite offering dollar menus and frequent discounts, many of these chains also scored poorly in terms of value. The bottom line customer wants delicious food, served quickly and in interactive format and they are increasingly unwilling to compromise. ","Perhaps not surprisingly this survey found that younger consumers, the millennial, where more inclined to skip traditional fast food in favor of restaurants like Chipotle. Food industry research indicates that millennial are turning away from traditional fast food in favor of better food and a more enjoyable experience overall. They are more concerned with how food is raised and prepared than previous generations and are willing to seek out and pay a little more for, something they recognize as better, better tasting, better for the environment and better for their wellbeing. ","Investment analyst research also shows similar results. Over the last decade there has been a noticeable shift among consumers away from traditional fast food and casual dining chains, to fast casual restaurants as customers are looking for better quality food, served in a convenient format. The companies that have lost the most customers over the last decade are traditional fast food chains, while the biggest gains go to fast casual restaurants. Chipotle tops the list of restaurant companies gaining customers during this time period. These trends are validated looking at the performance of Chipotle and other restaurant companies. ","Our business is thriving posting the same-store sales increase of 19.8% for the quarter and 17% year-to-date. At the same time, traditional fast food companies are struggling to produce positive same-store sales growth at all. The gimmicks that have driven the fast food sectors for years, dollar menus, limited time offers, and merchandizing partnership are not producing results like they used to as consumers simply want better tasty nutritious food at a more compelling experience not gimmicks.","In some cases, these other companies are looking to revamp their branding efforts to change their customer's perception but not the food. Fundamentally these are short sighted reactions that seem out of touch with what customers want, better food and a more compelling dining experience. This is exactly what we offer at Chipotle and we think its replicable with other kinds of cuisines. We are in the early stages of developing two new fantastic restaurants, what we call our growth feed concepts, ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen and Pizzeria Locale. Using the exact same model that has driven Chipotle's success, each of these concepts shares our commitment to using only the very best ingredients, the classical cooking techniques, and to building cultures of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards. ","During the quarter we opened another ShopHouse, the eighth one in the Washington DC area. ShopHouse very much reminds me of Chipotle when I opened the first one of the restaurants. It is food that is new to many of our customers but they love it and are thrilled to enjoy a meal that is flavorable, skillfully prepared, and served in a way that is accessible and affordable. At the beginning of this month we also opened a second Pizzeria Locale in Denver. Pizzeria Locale was developed by two extraordinary restaurateurs', Executive Chef Lachlan Patterson and Master Sommelier Bobby Stuckey and we have partnered with them to bring the Pizzeria Locale experience to more customers using the same format that has worked so well for Chipotle. ","More than ever I believe this is the new fast food model. Increasingly consumers want what Chipotle is doing and they seem to be turning away from traditional fast food in favor of better food and a more compelling experience. That is what drives our business and continues to provide outstanding results for our shareholders and will continue to be our primary focus. I will now turn over -- turn the call over to Monty. ","Montgomery F. Moran","Thanks Steve. Now that our vision of changing the way people think about eating fast food, no other results we are producing would be possible without our teams top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards. We have totally changed the traditional fast food formula which depends on constantly lowering costs and simplifying the tasks in the restaurant to the point where they are essentially fool proof. Instead we are creating rewarding environments with skilled teams who do work that they are proud of. ","We ask more of our people, not less and reward them with greater opportunities when they step up to meet the challenge. This is one of the many areas where Chipotle is unique within the industry and we are performing well because we have so many sharp performers who are committed to achieving our vision and to providing an extraordinary restaurant experience. ","At the end of the quarter we had our All Managers Conference in Las Vegas. This conference which we hold every two years is a powerful way for us to teach and inspire our restaurant managers and the teams that they are building to raise the bar and to share more of our vision, changing the way people think about eating fast food. The conference also allows us to introduce new tools that helps our managers up for success. ","This year's conference focused on our vision and the importance of our food culture, people culture and unit economic model. Presentations to our managers highlighted many of our accomplishments. We discussed the importance of ingredients that are raised with respect to the environment, animals, and the farmers who produce them. We emphasize the importance of developing extraordinary leaders and how that is critical for our business. And we explained our strong unit economic model and why it is so important for our managers to remain focused and disciplined in protecting it and how they run their restaurants. ","We also use the conference to introduce new tools that help better set our managers up for success. One promising development in this area is a new tablet based training system that we are just starting to roll out in our restaurants. This new tool allows us to compile all of our training materials including text and video in a single place that can be quickly and easily updated and accessed immediately in many of our restaurants or offices. We introduced this new system at our Managers conference and are just beginning to roll it out to restaurants now but are optimistic that this new system will improve upon our already successful training programs. Ultimately better training programs help us improve how we develop people and teach specific skills. In turn this will help us deliver a more consistent restaurant experience. ","Finally we also used the conference as an opportunity to introduce our concepts, ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale to our employees. Each of the new concepts had exhibits at the conference that were designed to resemble the actual restaurants. The people running each concept first provided a thorough overview of each restaurant to all of our managers and guests and then served food allowing everyone to see and taste for themselves just how delicious these restaurants are. This was the first time most of our employees had tried either of these restaurants and they were very excited. While most of our growth will continue to be driven by opening and improving our Chipotle Restaurants, we felt it was a great time to introduce the opportunities that these concepts will provide to our teams as our operations teams will ultimately play the most important role in helping them expand. ","While we believe the conference is enormously valuable to our managers, it is also incredibly inspiring and powerful to us. The conference provides a clear and strong picture of the movement we are creating. There were nearly 3000 inspired top performing employees as well as valued suppliers at the conference, each committed to helping us achieve our vision. Being part of that is a powerful experience for all of us. ","During the quarter, our efforts to build and strengthen our cultures continue with the addition of 41 new restaurateurs. We also promoted 27 of our existing restaurateurs into our plus positions, and 15 restaurateurs into more senior field leadership positions including four new team directors. Because of the success that these extraordinary leaders have had developing the people around them we paid out nearly $700,000 in the quarter in people development offices and nearly $2 million year-to-date. ","These bonuses are paid specifically when restaurateurs develop crew in the management positions. As the rank of restaurateurs continue to grow, so does their reach. These extraordinary leaders now oversee more than 70% of all of our restaurants. This is important and the restaurateurs and their crews delivered a compelling dining experience that keeps our customers coming back. Our unique people culture is an area where Chipotle excels and that has contributed significantly to our overall performance.","One area in particular where we have seen tangible benefits in these special cultures is in the area of our throughput. Our teams are continuing to increase the speed of service we provide and by doing so are providing a better customer experience. During the quarter, throughput remained strong and actually got stronger with an increase of six transactions during the peak lunch hour and six transaction during the peak dinner hour compared to the same time last year.","We would not be able to achieve such extraordinary same store sales increases without these continued improvements in throughput during our busiest hours. The improvements we are seeing in our throughput is a result of having more top performing managers and teams that can make sure that we have the four pillars of throughput in place. Using a line linebacker during our peak hours, having proper mise en place, ensuring there are only aces in their places and using a dedicated expedited during peak hours. We have proven that we focus on these four pillars, we can serve more customers and provide a better experience. So for this reason we measure our effectiveness in this key area as well as provide bonuses to our field teams in part based upon their ability to execute these four pillars.","Finally I would like to provide an update on development. While we expect to end this year with total new restaurants openings at the high end of our guidance at 180 to 195 new restaurants. For the year about 70% of these locations will be in proven markets with 15% new markets and 15% in established or developing markets. Going forward we believe that we are well positioned to continue to find excellent real estate. While the market overall has become more competitive for the kind of sites we are looking for, Chipotle remains very desirable tenant with strong financials. Given the strength of our position, we expect to open between 190 to 205 new restaurants in 2015, which will include a small number of grocery (ph) restaurants.","We expect to see some pressure on rents in major markets, but think that we can offset some of that, with a strong supply of new smaller retail strip centers. In many cases, we are able to find developers who are willing to build 2 or 3 tenant strip for our use and believe that there continues to be great opportunities ahead in some of the smaller, more remote markets that are bit underserved, places such as Corpus Christi, Texas or Greenville, North Carolina where you recently opened restaurants. ","We have the right pieces in place, the right food culture, people culture and unit economic model to continue on our path to change food culture and we believe that our success in doing that, will allow us to generate outstanding returns for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Jack Hartung.","John R. Hartung","Thanks, Monty. Our teams top performers continue to provide an incredible dining experience to our customers and our ongoing commitment to using the very best ingredients for our food has continued to bring more customers through our doors. We are very happy to announce another great quarter with strong financial results. ","Last quarter we reported our second strongest sales comp as a public company and this quarter after 21 years in business we are delighted to report an even higher third quarter sales comp of 19.8% making it the strongest sales comp since becoming a public company in 2006. It's really quite an achievement and we are proud of these results, proud of our results, which are driven by our unique food, our unique people, and our strong business cultures.","Our third quarter same store sales comp of 19.8% has helped to drive average sales volume for the restaurants that have been open for at least 12 months to an all-time high of $2.4 million. Overall sales for the quarter increased 31.1% to $1.08 billion driven by the comp of 19.8% which includes the full impact of the menu price increase along with new restaurant openings. Year-to-date sales were just over $3 billion, an increase of 28.2%. ","The quarter and year-to-date comps sales increases are driven by increased customer visits along with a higher average check. Our average check in the quarter is up about 8.5%, driven primarily by an effective price increase of about 6.3% as well as from catering and a slightly larger group size. Although our menu prices increased, we continue to see very strong transaction growth and we are experiencing very little price resistance, just under 1% so far with very little menu trade down. We are delighted to see that the price increase we had to take after 3 years of absorbing food inflation had little or no effect on the strong customer loyalty we have worked so hard to build. ","It confirmed our belief that our customers understand and appreciate our focus on sourcing high quality ingredients and that they see tremendous value in the dining experience, they enjoy at Chipotle. We will continue our focus on developing teams of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards as we know these strong comps are not possible without them. Our teams freshly inspired by the themes presented at our All Managers Conference will help continue our success and achieve our mission of changing the way people think about and eat fast food. ","Though we will finish this year comparing to a higher comp of 9.3% in the fourth quarter of last year, we continue to expect comps for the full year of 2014 will be in the mid-teens. Of course 2015 will bring even tougher comparisons especially in the second half of the year. We expect full year comps in 2015 will be in the low to mid-single digit range and will decline beginning in the second quarter as the menu price increase begins to cycle off. ","Our new restaurants continue to perform very well and we still expect strong opening sales volumes in the $1.7 million to $1.8 million range or higher. What we are most pleased with regarding our new restaurants is that we continue to staff them with terrific leaders and teams of empowered top performers delivering the same incredible dining experience that our customers have come to expect. This allows us to continue to grow while delivering industry leading unit economics and returns for both our existing and new restaurants. ","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.15, an increase of 56% from last year. We were able to grow EPS and nearly double our sales growth rate despite higher food costs as we delivered sales leverage on the labor and occupancy lines. Our operating margins were up 250 basis points to 19.1%. Our restaurant level margins were up 200 basis points compared to last year to 28.8% due to our strong transaction trends and the benefit of the recent menu price increase. ","Year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $10.29, an increase of 29.8% over last year. Restaurant level margins year-to-date was 27.4%, an increase of 50 basis points due to higher comps offset by higher food costs. Food costs are 34.3% in the quarter down only 30 basis points sequentially from Q2 and food costs were up 70 basis points over last year despite having the full benefit of the price increase in the quarter. Without the menu price impact, the food cost would have been around 200 basis points higher and this means underlying food inflation was around 8% over last year so our 6.3% price increase did not fully cover all of this inflation. ","While expected food costs have stabilized in the second half of the year we saw costs for beef and avocados continue to rise in the quarter. Had ingredient cost primarily for beef and avocados stabilized as expected at the level we saw in Q2, our food costs would have been around 80 to 90 basis points lower and our restaurant level margins would have been approaching 30%. We expect these elevated food costs as a percentage of revenue to continue and even increase slightly in Q4 as continued inflation in beef and dairy is expected and will be offset by lower expected avocado costs. ","As we look to 2015 we hope our costs will stabilize but we expect food cost inflation will be in the low single digits from where food costs were in Q3. Beef prices are expected to remain elevated through 2015 due to strong demand and the tight supply of livestock producers continue to rebuild their herds after two years of drought conditions. Avocado cost increased significantly this year due to light California crop though anticipate avocado cost will decline in Q4 as we source from Chile and Mexico. We don\u2019t expect much of any benefit from avocado prices next year due to rising demand and supply shortages caused by drought conditions in California and Chile. ","We saw prices for cheese and sour cream increase to record highs in the quarter and we expect that dairy cost will remain high through the end of this year. But we do anticipate dairy price will come down in 2015 from these 2014 highs. Labor costs was 21.2% of sales in the quarter, decrease of 160 basis points from last year and year-to-date labor cost were down 100 basis points. Labor leverages driven by higher sales volumes partially offset by higher management, increased staffing ratios which contributed to slightly higher labor cost per store and by normal wage inflation. We expect labor cost as a percentage of sales to move higher in the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower sales. ","While we have always offered a basic low cost health insurance plan to all of our hourly employees in the past, effective January 1, 2015 we will be offering coverage that qualifies under a portable caveat to eligible hourly employees. Currently we estimate over 10,000 of our hourly employees will have the opportunity to sign up for health insurance and while we can't predict how many will choose to enroll in this new plan we estimate that total cost will not exceed 1% of sales. We also will see minimal wage increases in a number of states and cities which we expect to have only a modest inflationary impact on labor because we pay above minimum wage. ","Occupancy cost declined 70 basis points from last year for the quarter due to favorable sales leverage. Other operating costs were 10.2% in the quarter, decrease of 60 basis points versus last year and year-to-date they were 10.6% unchanged from last year. In the quarter other operating costs moved lower due to lower marketing and utility cost. Marketing was 1.3% in the quarter down 20 basis points from last year and is expected to increase to around 1.5% in the fourth quarter. ","G&A 6.6% in the quarter, 20 basis points higher than last year and the increase was primarily driven by our Biannual Managers Conference held in September. The conference cost just over $10 million with nearly 3000 Chipotle employees and suppliers in attendance including all of our GMs and restaurateurs. In 2015 we will hold our Biannual Field Leadership Conference in the third quarter, which we expect will cost around $1 million. Non-cash stock comp was about $20 million in the quarter and year-to-date non-cash stock comp was about $83 million with a small portion of that in the labor line.","We continue to expect non-cash stock comp for the full year will be around $98 million which is about $33 million higher than in 2013 due to this year options being issued at a much higher share price and as a result of much of the senior management team qualifying for retirement which accelerates the non-cash charges. As a perspective, G&A without the non-cash stock comp expense and without the cost on the All Manger Conference, G&A would have been down about 60 basis points compared to last year.","G&A in the fourth quarter will be lower as a result of the reduce stock comp charge and not having the cost of the All Manger Conference which will be offset somewhat by a $1 million donation related to our annual burrito promotion and fund raising event benefitting Chipotle Cultivate Foundation along with normal G&A additions to support our growth. In 2015, we expect underlying G&A as a percentage of sales before non-cash stock comp charges will grow at a lesser rate than our sales growth.","Effective tax rate for the third quarter was 37.2% which includes adjustments related to filing the 2013 tax return. We now expect our effective tax rate for 2014 to be around 38.5% and 2015 we expect the effective tax rate will be around 39.1%. The work opportunity tax credit and the R&D rate have not been renewed by Congress for 2014 or for 2015. If these credits are renewed, the state tax rate would benefit by about 50 basis points for each year. ","During the quarter we repurchased about $13 million of our stock or over 20,000 shares and the average annual share -- average share price was about $654. At the end of the third quarter we had about $127 million left on our share buyback program, previously approved by our Board. Overall we have invested $673 million to purchase nearly 4.2 million shares at an average price of $161 per share. ","We finished the third quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term interest bearing investment and no debt on our balance sheet. Although, we continue to believe the best use of our cash to invest in our high returning domestic restaurants, we plan to carefully nature groceries ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale and Chipotle outside of the U.S. as we expect they will provide attractive value enhancing growth investments in the future. In the meantime we\u2019ll optimistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today and at this time we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanely","Thanks very much. First, Monty I just wanted to ask you about your thoughts on unit growth, are you beginning to hit a maximum number of stores you can open in a year given the real estate availability or own ability, human capital is this 200 plus or minus about where things level off, or how do you see it over the next I guess two to three years as you think about that?","Montgomery F. Moran","Yeah John, thanks. Well, we don't really think in terms of maximums, in terms of maximizing our growth. What we do is, we continue to try to strike a balance and open restaurants when we -- at the speed with which we can find great real estate that we think will be performed well, plus the speed with which we can create or develop managers to really run those restaurants really effectively. So this month, we said, we will open 190 to 205 till next year. We talked to our real estate teams, that is where we struck the balance, that we believe we have got really strong people development throughout the country and certain markets being stronger than others. And our teams in the field feel very optimistic about this type of real estate they are finding and the prospects for those sites to do well. So, it's just a balancing act and we do think that this 190 to 205 is really a sensible growth rate. ","We are not talking yet about what we are going to do in 2016, 2017 but we suspect it will continue to strike that balance based on people and on how well our real estate performs. But if you look at our opening volume so far, like Jack said, our new stores opening about $1.7 million to $1.8 million on average and any other was trying not too far back where those were volumes that we hoped we would reach as a system. And now our brand new stores are opening at those volumes despite the fact that we are opening fewer tier one locations. So we are opening a lot more locations that in the past we might have walked by. ","Also operations are the strongest they have ever been. Our throughput is the fastest it has ever been and there is a lot of reasons to believe that we can feel good about asking our field teams to pickup and run new restaurants and to be able to do it tremendously effectively. ","John Glass - Morgan Stanely","That's helpful and Jack just a clarification, the ACA cost you are talking about for 2015, you said not to exceed 1% of sales, what does that mean, is that an incremental 100 basis points of pressure versus 2014 or what do you mean by that 1%?","John R. Hartung","","Yeah, it would be an incremental cost but we think it will not even reach 1%. We just don\u2019t know how to estimate it and so we just put kind of an upper range on it that we don\u2019t expect no matter how many. Even if more -- way more people than we think or that we estimate will elect for the new insurance that we are offering that it will still not be more than 1%. We think it is likely to be less than that. We just won't know until our people begin to enroll and that will happen here between now and the end of the year. ","John Glass - Morgan Stanely","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. ","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on great results. Jack, I wanted to ask a question about the comps momentum that you are having and could you talk specifically about potentially the trends exiting the quarter and entering Q4 and then maybe how would you frame up the outlook for Q4 given that the comparison does look maybe 300 basis points more difficult?","John R. Hartung","","Yeah, David I would say that the trends through September and then into October so far have been very consistent. We are now comparing to a tougher quarter so last year we in the fourth quarter our comp was about 9.3% and it was like 6.1% or 6 point something percent in the third quarter. So a 300 basis point tougher comparison so I would expect for that you will see our comps decline by that tougher comparison. So from a dollar and transaction standpoint, the trends are holding well as we move from September to October. Yeah but the tougher comparison is going to have an impact for sure. ","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","","Great, very helpful and then maybe one on the cost side, the commodity environment seems to be getting worse and worse, so I was just wondering on what your thoughts were on if we can see continued pressure there, what your thoughts were on sort of another round of price increases, maybe not right away but as you move through 2015?","John R. Hartung","","Yeah, David probably too early for us to consider a price increase. The way we think about the commodities right now, we are seeing pressure from three main areas from beef, from dairy, and from avocados. Avocados we think is more cyclical. It is caused by weather, it was caused by this year there was a shortage relative to the demand. While we think that is going to continue somewhat next year and so we won't get the break, and one time we thought we would get a break next year, we don\u2019t think we will get the break. We do expect that avocado cost will be relatively stable next year and we are hoping that this is going to be more of kind of upper limit for avocados but time will tell. ","Beef is going to take a couple of years to grow out for to replenish the herd is going to take a couple of years. So we think that beef is probably going to remain at this elevated level, probably have additional pressure, hopefully not too severe a pressure going forward. Dairy we think will come back. We think that dairy has hit peaks and in fact just in last couple of weeks we have seen butter costs come down pretty dramatically, just in the last two weeks that effects the cost of our sour cream. And so if that holds we think that dairy is already starting to come back to where maybe a normal, kind of a normal sustained price could be. ","So we knit it all together. It doesn\u2019t feel like extreme pressure David so it is too early for us to be even thinking about another price increase, so hopefully things will stay stable and we won't have to think about it until sometime after 2015.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","","Makes sense, thank you. ","John R. Hartung","","Thanks David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","","Thank you and good afternoon. Great comps, I am wondering if you have some of your latest survey where it is talking about usage patterns, so if this more frequency from you mostly are gas or are there some new users in the next change of the course anything you can share on that front?","Mark Crumpacker","Hi, Nicole, this is Mark Crumpacker, the Chief Marketing Officer. We don't right now have data that shows us which -- whether it's increased frequency from customers or new customers. It's our belief that it's a combination of both. We do have some feedbacks and research back on the advertising campaign we have done and we have seen increased awareness and increased purchase intent with all of our existing customers. So, that's leading us to believe that certainly a major factor, but given the level of the comps, we suspects there's got to be a large number of new customers in there as well.","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And you do want -- I don't know, if you do have your core guest, how many times they come and your most loyal, do you have anything on that as of late, how often they use you, on weekly basis, monthly or anything of that nature, probably? ","Mark Crumpacker","Well, that's actually not something that we track on a quarterly basis. We do that research regularly, we are doing it now, so we will have some feedback on that in the future but right now we don't. I can't tell you the increased frequency of the existing customers.","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","Okay, great and then just back on the comp I think Jack last quarter you said, it was 2.5 price because there was only partial price, 2.5 mix and the rest was traffic, when you said 100 basis points of resistance I am not clear is that trade down in mix like the beef, the chicken conversation or is that meant to be a traffic resistant comment?","John R. Hartung","Nicole, it looks like it's mostly traffic. We started to see some trade downs from steak to chicken like when we reported earnings in July, and we thought maybe that would increase but it really didn't. So the trade down effect, there is some from steak down to chicken was very modest. It didn't really continue to get worse and it levelled off quite a bit. So from what we can tell, it looks like maybe our comp but there is no resistance, should have been just a little over 20%, maybe 20.5% something like that. So we are looking at something less than 1% and it looks like it's driven on the transactions.","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","Fantastic, thank you very much","John R. Hartung","Thanks Nicole.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Ivankoe, JP Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi thanks, it is Gavin (ph) filling in. The first question is based on our estimates it appears you had a pretty extraordinary increase in year-over-year in unit volume and I know there were some concern back in 2012 when you might have been lapping over some very strong results in 2011. So, can you just help us maybe with, where you are opening units next year in terms of approving versus emerging new markets and how that compares to this year, if it is materially different in any way?","John R. Hartung","Yeah, it's not going to be materially different. Next year we will -- I mean, this year we opened about 70% of our restaurants in proven markets, 15% in developing markets and 15% in new markets and next year will not be substantially different. It's a very similar strategy and just to carry over what we have done this year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then with the recent announcement of some restaurant partnerships with Apple Pay, can you just tell us maybe where you stand on mobile payment and whether the infrastructure is in place to roll that out now or you have to maybe make some additional technology investment behind POS or something else at the restaurant level?","Steve Ells","Right now, we don't have imminent plants to roll out Apple Pay support. It's something that we are considering for 2015. There are considerable technological constraints implementing it, just based on the way payments are processed with our system. We are in the process of readying the launch of our new online app in November and when we do revel of that in the middle of next year, as our anticipated time, we might include Apple Pay. It's just a little bit too early for us to tell just given we haven't sorted out all of the backend issues.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next will be Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Great, thank you very much. Just two questions, one on the comp side, as you now lap, as you look to 2015, it looks you are lapping what will be mid-teens comp growth in 2014. I mean wondering how you even think about what the right number should be, it looks like you guide low single digit to mid-single digit, just lapping such strong results, how do you even arrive at something like that, what kind of history do you use, how do you even comp with that on such a heroic lap that you have and then I had a follow up.","Steve Ells","Well Jeff it's a great question and so we don't spend a lot of time trying to predict how we are going to over, to leap over that number. What we do is, we take our current sales trends and we literally just push them out over the next 14 months for the rest of this year and then for all of 2015. And if we don\u2019t increase our sales trends or if we don\u2019t decrease our sales trends we think we will be in this low to mid single digit comp range. This way we have always predicted the comps. ","As you know we had 10 years of double digit comps before the recession that was interrupted during the recession, then we had almost two full years of double digit comps again after that. And so we really don\u2019t have a magic approach or a crystal ball to predict how you are going to exceed like a 19% comp for example. We are constantly working on improving our customer experience, we are constantly working on improving our people culture, we are constantly looking to upgrade the quality of our ingredients. Throughput, we are constantly working on throughput. So we are constantly working on the things that will enhance the dining experience and over the years it has paid off that when we do a good job, when we have great teams, when they do a good job of providing a great dining experience customers want to come back to Chipotle more often and hopefully it will happen again. And hopefully we will -- the comp guidance we have today will come back and say boy it looked conservative at the time. But there is no other way for us to predict it other than to take our current sales trend and then assume they don\u2019t change and then we back into a number which falls into that low to mid single digit range. ","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Understood and just a follow-up on the food inflation side, Jack I think in your remarks you said 2015 we should expect a low single digit basket increase but I know often times I think you said you were talking about relatively to 3Q, so I am just wondering you taking the 34.3% in the third quarter and we should assume low single digit off of that prior to pricing or may be if you could just tell us what the outlook is for 2015 either for the line item or what the overall basket is versus the full year 2014 or if there is any other way to look at it just to make sure we understand it correctly, the comparison you are making again?","John R. Hartung","","What I would -- the way I would think about it Jeff is, we just finished a quarter with food cost in 34.3% range. Based on what we see today, we see hopefully relative stability with avocados. We won't get a break but hopefully it will be relatively stable. Dairy just hit a peak, just hit high, hopefully that will stabilize and maybe even come back. But beef there is going to be more pressure there and so when you net those three together and we assume everything else in what we buy is going to be relatively stable, we think there will slight pressure to next year from the 34.3%. ","We don\u2019t know exactly what the pressure is going to be. We think it looks like it will be relatively modest barring unusual things like weather or supply shortages or things that we can't predict today. And so we think there is likely to be some modest pressure on the 34.3% that we are seeing in the third quarter today. ","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","And that is even with the six plus percent pricing at least for the first part of next year but then assuming it is down for the rest of next year?","John R. Hartung","","That is right. In my assumption about food cost pressure, I am assuming no price increase. ","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Got it, thank you. ","John R. Hartung","","Okay. ","Operator","And next will be Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. ","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company","","Great, thank you. Another question on the 2015 comp guidance, I mean it seems like you are shifting off of the course or historically how you initially project the comps going into the next year. But the mathematics behind it that you just explained obviously, it seems like you are getting a lot of respect due to tougher comparison and just viably so, but it does seem like you build this time particularly this year be it throughput in a sustainable way and you really raised the base of the business and so when I think about 2015 can you talk through it a little bit more about what last could you on the throughput side of the world that has helped your comp so much this year and why maybe this time next year we could be surprised sitting here saying well that was a mid single digit comp projection was conservative?","Montgomery F. Moran","Yeah, this is kind of two pieces to it, the throughput piece and then I will let Jack answer the balance of it. But when we look at throughput I mean, you can kind of look at two different directions. I mean, it is very hard to raise throughput without additional people wanting to eat at Chipotle. But we can, even if additional people don\u2019t want to -- we get the same amount of traffic. There still are opportunities to increase throughput just by moving our lines quickly especially at the peak lunch and peak dinner hours which we were able to do once again this quarter. ","But by the same token when you have a lot more people coming to us as has been the case recently, then throughput becomes even more important especially because of those peak lunch and peak dinner hour bottlenecks and our teams in the field are very focused on this and has been working really, really hard to drill the four pillars and to have everything going that are going to increase our throughput. And we have been measuring at the field entry level and all of our field leaders are aware of it and they know, where they stand versus their colleagues throughout the country in terms of their group of restaurants and their ability to deliver exclusively on the four pillars of throughput. ","So, we have an opportunity we think to get much, much faster, because still our very fastest restaurants in the country at peak lunch hour are doing service 350 transactions an hour and sometimes even more than that on a very regular basis. So, we know it's possible to go very, very fast. Our average restaurant does something about one-third of that speed at peak lunch hours. So our ability to achieve higher throughput is enormous, but it depends on few things, obviously it depends on having plenty of customers coming through our doors, and it also depends on the type of customer and also depends whether its lunch or dinner. Because dinner people, there are going to be more children and more group orders which take longer to put through. And larger size transactions as well, which take longer to ring in. ","So we have a huge amount of ability to increase throughput particularly if we keep seeing these increases in traffic. And so that increase in the throughput will help to drive the comp but also an increased comp can help to drive throughput. So it kind of goes both directions and now we feel really, really good about throughput because of having six more transactions coming through at lunch, six more transaction coming through at dinner than happened third quarter a year ago. Plus we put through an additional five transactions about, approximately five transactions for every single hour of business during the day.","So there is not one time of the day, where we haven't managed to speed up and deliver better on the four pillars of throughput. So that gives us plenty of confidence that we can answer the call of any additional transaction that comes through the door. But that being said, I will let Jack answer the part about how we measure the comp.","John R. Hartung","And I think your question about what else can happen, such that a year from now we look back and say boy that comp was conservative, is that the essence of the question?","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company","I mean, I am just trying to think about how much respect you are giving the comparisons and really just build a bigger base, I guess more the question to Monty is like is there a percentage of the store base for instance, that doesn't have all four pillars, I am just trying to think about the run rate for comp growth from throughput even as you face tougher comparisons like this year?","John R. Hartung","So, I think maybe the way to answer that, I think maybe the cause and effect and this is what I think the point Monty was making is, the cause and effect maybe different than what you are thinking. You are thinking that if we have great throughput that's what driving the comp, well we are getting our comp throughout every hour of the day and we need to be as fast as we possibly can during lunch and during dinner because we already have a heavy concentration of customer coming through at those times. We need to get faster because as more customers want to come to Chipotle if we don't get faster, we are going to be repelling them. We are not -- they are going to be walking off the back of our line, so the demand is happening and then throughput is necessary, absolute necessary to allow the demand that come in to our doors, go through the line and be satisfied customers.","So, in terms of what's driving the comp, I think you have to back to Steve's comments that there is something going on in the industry. People are rejecting the traditional fast food model, they are, the Chipotle approach is resonating. I think what the marketing team have been doing is causing greater curiosity, especially with millenials where things like the Scarecrow and back to the start and Farmed and Dangerous, these are resonating with people that care about, where their food comes, how its raised, what's the impact on the environment, on their health, things like that. So there is a movement going on that is resonating. ","Chipotle is the only one that's doing what we are doing with food, with the people culture, where you feel like you are being treated to an authentic dining experience although it's affordable and it doesn\u2019t take that much time. And so, it's likely that these trends will continue. It's not likely that all the sudden people are going to stop worrying about where their food comes from. And stop appreciating the wonderful experience that they get by joining Chipotle. So it's likely that, that will continue. It is incumbent upon us and teams then to make sure throughput is there ready for the customers as they come in, so that we can expect them into our line.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company","Okay that makes sense and as far as the GMO free menu goes, are we any closer to an announcement date on that?","Steve Ells","Well, we don't have a specific announcement date, but we can tell you that, we are largely serving only ingredients that are free of GMOs. And so we have made a ton of progress on that, we recently rolled out all of our tortillas being GMO free and there is just no announcement date yet. ","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And next will be Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","Thanks, Jack can you share with us where chicken, beef, dairy, avocado, and whatever else matters where they stand as a percent of COGS and how should we think about the relationship between spot prices and what you are paying for lot of those higher quality inputs?","John R. Hartung","","Yes Jeff, we don\u2019t talk about the individual ingredients and the percentage because that changes overtime like steak this year would be higher than last year but if you take beef, chicken, avocados, cheese, and beans those are our top five ingredients and those account for right around half of everything that we buy. Okay, so any one of those when you have a significant impact on COGS here up or down it is going to have a meaningful impact on our cost of goods sales. ","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","And then in terms of looking at spot as a proxy for any of those, is that still a directional sort of proxy?","John R. Hartung","","It is directional, you just have to be careful of the source. Like for example if the source is the same beef that we would be using there is going to be an impact. Right now the pressure that is affecting beef is that there were these droughts and the drought affected all these naturally raised and commodity beef as well. So that is something that when you look at the source of why there is a shortage, something like weather is likely to affect both naturally raised as well as commodity. Years ago there were world factors that were affecting chicken, that were affecting like bird flu and things like that, they didn\u2019t affect us at all. So, Jeff you got to look to the source. ","Generally, when it is drought conditions, when it is general supply and demand, generally those things are at least directionally kind of impact commodity and actually raise ingredients as well and may not be on the exact same timing, may not be the exact same magnitude but everything I am telling you about dairy, about beef as well as with avocados you are seeing similar trends in the commodity markets as well. ","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","","Okay, and then you touched on it but as your brand awareness and unit volumes continue to grow, what's been the resulting impact on restaurants and the comparable store base. So are they entering sort of neutral tail end headwind and where does it sort of stand relative to where you were few years ago?","John R. Hartung","","No, the new stores still out comp existing stores. The five year old existing stores still comp like in the double digits while in the double digits. So, when we do, when we see these kind of comps it is very broad based in terms of the layer of store openings, it is broad based in terms of markets. And when our new stores, even though our new restaurants are opening out way higher volumes than they ever had before, they still out comp the stores that are two years old or three years old, really every other stores. So, they come in stronger and then they comp stronger than every other layer as well. ","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","","Thank you. ","John R. Hartung","","Thanks Jeff. ","Operator","And moving on to Bryan Elliott with Raymond James. ","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","","Good afternoon gentlemen. First couple of things, one maybe a little nit to pick, couldn\u2019t you have done something to push the comp over 20% for the quarter?","Steve Ells","It is too organized. ","John R. Hartung","We will work on that for the next quarter.","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","No, seriously my question, I guess the clarification of that question, Jack just clarifying again this 1% traffic pressure or response to pricing that you mentioned. So, you are as I heard you, you said you were kind of looking at the traffic growth rate prior to the price increase and then subsequent to the price increase there was a 1% decline or point decline in the rate of traffic growth, is that what you were saying?","John R. Hartung","","That's right Bryan. ","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","Okay. ","John R. Hartung","","Now just with that in mind when you have 1% or something less than 1% there is a lot of noise in there too until we are going to continue to watch that.","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","Sure, I just wanted to make sure I understood what exactly the message was. My question, I would like to if I could drill down a little more into ACA commentary and understand I guess you have sorted some of the details. You talked about after an ACA compliance plan to all the eligible hourly, there may be 10,000 of them and can you help us with what exactly ACA compliance means with respect to the income. And so I think to the ACA compliance if I recall correctly and it has kind of dropped out of the news and all but the portion of the premium that you can ask the employee to cover has to be I believe at something like 9% or less of their total income and so A) is that right and B) I guess in thinking about that there is going to be -- it is going to be impossible to know until after the fact how many people at certain pay grades are going to be buying into the insurance and how much your portion is going to be versus their portion, I mean if you could flush out a little of that\u2026?","John R. Hartung","","Bryan what you are talking about is to comply, you need to have a plan that's credible. Okay, so it meets the requirements, so it has got to be real insurance and there are guidelines for that, and our plan does meet that, and it has got to be affordable. And affordable, you are roughly right that it has got to be, what's tough about it, it has got to be based on household income. So we don\u2019t know whether there is other income earners in the family so we had to use some estimates. ","We feel pretty good though about the fact that everyone will be able to afford this plan. We have gone through a lot of different assumptions, a lot of different calculations. We know what our folks are making, what we don\u2019t know is how much are there other wage earners in the house are making. So we think that our plan is going to be affordable by most if not all the employees that are going to be offered insurance. It is more than 10,000 people Bryan, we don\u2019t have an exact number but I said a number more than 10. So it is for sure more than that, that are going to be eligible. And eligible means that you have worked here for a year and during this time you have averaged 30 hours or more. And what we are going to be doing throughout the year is each month as people hit their anniversary date, we are going to identify whether they qualify. So it is an estimate because each month we are going to be roughly calculating and kind of having reenrollment throughout the year to see if people, to see if our employees are eligible and if they choose to go ahead and enter the insurance roles. ","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","And are we talking just about hourly because I assume that the management staff is already on a corporate type insurance program?","John R. Hartung","","Salary of management and we have typically at least two salaried* managers, a GM and Restaurateur and then an apprentice in each restaurant. They already qualify for health insurance today. So you are talking about our hourly crew and our hourly managers in a restaurant that will not qualify. ","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","And of the total premium cost roughly what is the split between the employee and the employer?","John R. Hartung","","We are paying the majority of it and we have to, to make it affordable. ","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","Sure, I am just wondering is it like something that you are going to pay 75% or 80% of it or is it more like a little north of 50%?","John R. Hartung","","No, it depends on whether it is family or not but it is for example, it will cost an average employee a couple of hundred bucks or so a month. And in terms of the premium that doesn\u2019t count deductibles and things like that. You know in the company on average we think it is going to cost us around $3000 a year. So we are paying more than half of it for sure. And we are doing everything we can to make it affordable, as affordable as possible. I have also read about some very, very high deductible. You know these high deductible plans are reasonable deductions. You know deductible plans kind of which is considered to be normal. I was reading the other day about deductible plans that have like a $5000 and $6000 deductible. So, it is what you consider to be a normal deductible, kind of a normal monthly premium, couple of hundred bucks principally and then Chipotle is paying over what we estimate to be over $3000 per employee per year.","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","Very helpful, thank you.","John R. Hartung","","Thanks Bryan.","Operator","And next will be Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. You mentioned catering contributing to the check, can you just give us an update on what percent of sales is catering and how big a portion are you making this holiday season on that business?","John R. Hartung","","Joe, the catering we have mentioned, our catering was like 1.6% in the second quarter but seasonally with graduations we saw that as being seasonally our highest quarter. This quarter we are right around 1% catering so we did pull back a bit and I don\u2019t know if we do have anything special plan Monty. ","Montgomery F. Moran","We will be doing holiday promotions for it. It starts out as we put one of the things we have learned about Chipotle Catering is it actually is slightly more appealing to folks that are doing parties at home than it is to people that are doing things in the office. So we tend to put our marketing around events that happened at home like graduations, Super Bowl that sort of thing. I am sorry, just like we call it the big game. But keep in mind with catering too, right now we are just rolling out catering and we don\u2019t have online ordering for it. It is really just in its infancy so it has a -- there is a long way to go as we roll this out.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, thank you. And Monty just quickly because you mentioned online ordering, is that becoming a more significant part of your store business, I mean away from catering?","John R. Hartung","","Joe if you take all of the online, like the iPhone, fax, online ordering and catering together it is somewhere around 5.5% to 6%. It was like 6% last quarter so it is caught between 5.5% and 6%. So it figure, I mean three to four years ago, five years ago it was 3.5% to 4%, so it has definitely moved up. But we know that there are companies out there that are doing 7%, 8% 9%, 10% of their sales. So we think there is still lot of room to move.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, thank you. ","John R. Hartung","","Thanks Joe.

All participants are now in listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce Chipotle\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Alex Spong. You may begin sir.","","Alex Spong","Thanks John. Hello everyone and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the fourth quarter and full year 2013. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include projections of restaurant openings, comp restaurant sales increases and growth in catering sales, throughput, food cost trends, effective tax rates, investment costs and capital expenditures as well as statements regarding potential menu price increases and other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks.","Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which will be found on the presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website. I would like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the first quarter, it will begin March 1 and continue through our first quarter release in April.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","","Steve Ells","Thanks Alex. I am very pleased with our performance for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year and we delivered revenues of $844.1 million for the quarter, an increase of 20.7% and $3.21 billion for the full year, an increase of 17.7%. The revenue growth came from a 185 new restaurant openings and from comparable restaurant sales increases of 9.3% for the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. All of this led to diluted earnings per share of $2.53 for the quarter an increase of 29.7% and $10.47 for the full year an increase of 19.7%.","Of course we\u2019re particularly pleased that Chipotle\u2019s strength continues to be rooted in our focus on the key drivers of our business. Our unique food culture and our unique people culture and a strong economic model that allows us to do things in ways that are unusual within the industry. Throughout the year and during the quarter we continue to make significant progress in each of these critical areas. We continue to strengthen our food culture through our quest for better ingredients from more sustainable sources and our commitment to preparing the food that we serve using classic cooking techniques.","One example of this is our work to remove all GMO ingredients from our food; another is the addition of Sofritas the all new vegan menu item we\u2019re offering in 40% of our restaurants. We continue to make progress in our efforts to shift our ingredient sourcing to non-GMO options and we will remain focused on this throughout the coming months.","As of now all of our cooking oils used in North America are made from ingredients that are not genetically modified and there are only a few key steps left before all of our food is made without genetically modified ingredients. We\u2019re still working to eliminate them in our corn and flour tortillas a process we expect to be complete by the end of the year.","We\u2019re also continuing to expand the availability of Sofritas, the vegan item we introduced in our San Francisco restaurant last year. When we created Sofritas we wanted to develop a recipe that would satisfy vegetarian and vegan customers and that would also be appealing to meat eaters as well and we have succeeded in doing that. Right now Sofritas are in over 40% of our restaurant and amount to about 3% of our sales. What\u2019s exciting is that about 40% of the Sofritas that we sell are being ordered by people who normally eat meat. We\u2019re pleased with how customers are responding to Sofritas and expect to continue to roll them out as we secure more supply of this very special organic tofu in the coming months.","Many of the issues that concern us such as GMOs or the overuse of antibiotics in livestock farming are complex and sometimes difficult to understand that\u2019s why we create marketing designed to make people more curious about these issues. We believe the more curious they become and the more they learn the more likely they will come to Chipotle.","A recent example of this kind of communicant was last year\u2019s Scarecrow marketing program which included a three minute animated short film and a game for iPads and iPhones. Scarecrow approved very successful in terms of sparking conversation about issues in industrial food production which was a primary goal for this program. It's been viewed online nearly 12 million times and it's companion game has been downloaded nearly 600,000 times. But more than that it has sparked significant discussion about issues in food generating 500 million media impressions through news coverage of the program. Volume of coverage that would costs some $5 million to purchase as advertising. Continuing in the tradition of Scarecrow we have just announced plans to launch Farmed and Dangerous, an original scripted comedy series that hysterically explores the world as industrial agriculture in America. Farmed and Dangerous consist of four 30 minute episodes that will run on Hulu starting February 17th. The series focuses on the introduction of a new petroleum based animal feed created by the fictional agro business company Animoil.","By using satire and doing so in an entertaining way we hope to make people more curious about their food and how it's produced. Programs like Scarecrow and Farmed and Dangerous are one facet of our overall marketing designed to show customers how Chipotle is cultivating a better world and we\u2019re also making progress with other components of our marketing including our traditional advertising and our local marketing programs. We continue to run traditional advertising image totally [ph] markets around the country and just wrapped up a campaign in support of our catering program.","We also have a full slate of local marketing programs planned for markets around the country such as our cultivate festivals which we held this year in San Francisco, Dallas and Minneapolis. Last year these cultivate festivals drew nearly a 100,000 attendees in total and with advertising and PR support they reached significantly larger audiences. What\u2019s more, these programs are proving to be very popular with post-event research showing us that more than 90% of attendees in each market would attend the events again. All of these things that we are focused on our food culture, our people culture, the unique way in which we market Chipotle demonstrate how we are changing the way people think about any fast food, but we also know that to really change food culture and to reach even more people is going to require that we serve more than burritos and tacos. That\u2019s why we developed ShopHouse, which follows the same model as Chipotle by using delicious quality ingredients, classic cooking techniques and emphasizes a culture of top performers being groomed to be the future leaders we will need to support our growth. And it is why we have made an investment in Pizzeria Locale, which we just announced in December.","Pizzeria Locale began as a casual dining restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. It was started by master sommelier Bobby Stuckey and executive chef Lachlan MacKinnon-Patterson, who met while working at the French Laundry, Thomas Keller\u2019s legendary French restaurant in Yountville, California in the Napa Valley. Bobby and Lachlan are extraordinary restaurateurs. Their first restaurant, Frasca Food and Wine, is nationally acclaimed. Since meeting them over 10 years ago at Frasca, we have had recurring conversations about how we can one day work together. When that conversation led us to the possibility of developing a fast casual version of Pizzeria Locale, we knew that was the right opportunity.","In the Chipotle format, Pizzeria Locale uses the same ingredients as the original Pizzeria Locale in Boulder and makes pizzas inspired by the (indiscernible) with exceptional attention to detail. To make this concept work, where volumes are high and customers expect food to be served quickly, we designed a special pizza oven that delivers the results of the Italian wood-burning oven they use in the original restaurant in Boulder while cooking pizzas perfectly every time in less than two minutes. Like Chipotle, Pizzeria Locale has a focused menu and an interactive service format that allows customers to customize their order. In addition to a selection of classic and custom pizzas, customers can enjoy an array of salads, meatballs, sliced order prosciutto, red or Italian wine and a caramel chocolate pudding called hudino [ph].","Under our agreement with Bobby and Lachlan, Chipotle has an equity interest in this new venture and could become the majority owner over time as the concept expands. In addition to providing capital to open additional restaurants, Pizzeria Locale can also draw on Chipotle\u2019s resources and expertise in other areas such as real estate, finance, purchasing and marketing. Bobby and Lachlan and their team are driving this concept and are responsible for all facets of restaurant operations. Not only do Bobby and Lachlan share our vision to change food culture, they are exceptionally capable restaurateurs who can help us achieve that. The first Pizzeria Locale is opened in Denver and we are currently looking at a couple of other additional sites in Denver also.","ShopHouse, which was the first concept we developed to test the notion that Chipotle model could be applied to other kinds of cuisines now has six restaurants opened in Washington DC and Los Angeles. ShopHouse continues to remind me of Chipotle in its earliest days. Customers really love the food and the experience and we are eager to introduce more people to the flavors of ShopHouse. This year, we planned to open more ShopHouse restaurants in Washington DC and Los Angeles.","Finally, our international presence now consists of 16 restaurants in Canada, London, Paris and Frankfurt with few additional restaurants planned for 2014. We remain encouraged by the potential for all of our growth seeds, including the new concepts in the international locations and know that success from any one of them may give us new avenues for future growth, but for the foreseeable future, however, our growth will be driven primarily by opening Chipotle restaurants in the United States.","I will now turn the call over to Monty.","","Monty Moran","Thanks Steve. I am super proud of our results this quarter, but I am even more proud of how we achieved them. We have an amazing people culture here at Chipotle and the foundation of that culture is a group of terrific people who are all striving to make the people around them better. Our people are passionate about our mission of changing the way people think about need fast food and they know that the way to accomplish that is to have teams of all top performers empowered to achieve high standards. That is exactly the kind of culture we have been building in our restaurants and throughout Chipotle.","I am so proud to have seen the strength of our people culture become as a finding characteristic of Chipotle and to have witnessed its contribution to our success. Our special culture is responsible for a better unit economic model at nearly every level and this continues to contribute to the strength of our business quarter after quarter and year-after-year. The top performers that we\u2019re developing in our culture are becoming the leaders that we will need to support our growth well into the future. Throughout the quarter we continued to promote new restaurateurs, the elite managers who embody what our people culture is all about. We finished 2013 with over 400 restaurant tourist over seeing nearly 40% of restaurants including the home restaurants and others that they mentor.","We include the field leaders who have come up through the Restaurateur Program those who have been promoted restaurateur to apprentice team lead, team leader, team director. We have nearly 500 restaurateurs leading more than 2\/3rds of the entire company of all of our restaurants.","Well the restaurateur position remains a very prestigious one at Chipotle; the program is ultimately about much more than just prestige. Restaurateurs and the restaurateur culture that they are building allow us to deliver consistently better results. They make better tasting food with less waste which leads to lower food cost. They run better and more productive shifts which leads to efficiencies in labor. They maintain and repair equipment more efficiently leading to lower maintenance and repair cost. They are fewer costly and time consuming HR issues because our teams understand their vision for their restaurant and are empowered and happy in their jobs.","They deliver a better throughput because the teams are all top performers and of course better throughput is better customer service. Overall they are the ones who are showing us how every aspect of our business can get better and better.","So the link between our strong people culture and the performance of our company is obvious and is the key driver to our success. To help us continue to build and strengthen our people culture last year we brought our entire field leadership team together to establish very clear expectations for them and to provide them with new tools to help them understand what the most important task of their job is which is developing restaurateurs and restaurateur cultures.","At the center of this effort is a new restaurant diagnostic and planned tool that I developed to help field leaders more effectively recognize what\u2019s keeping a restaurant from achieving restaurateur status and developing a clear plan of action to help their managers achieve this position more quickly.","The diagnosis and planned tool works by promoting field leaders to use symptoms which exist in the restaurant to identify broader themes that are holding the teams back from being excellent. Once they select the appropriate themes in the tool the tool generates a specific plan of action that the manager can employ in order to more effectively establish a restaurateur culture in the restaurant.","To use the tool properly requires that all of our field leaders are in the restaurants constantly interviewing every member of our crew to determine the degree to which we have teams of top performers and power to achieve high standards. During this process our field leaders gain an intimate understanding of the performance of their restaurant and the root causes that are preventing them from being at their very best. Once the plan is written our field leaders follow-up every quarter with another plan and they are watching to see how their teams are evolving and developing towards becoming a restaurateur team.","In using the tool our field leaders become aware of a great deal of information including the strength of the team, the depth of the people pipeline to be sure the restaurant has the right people in place for continued development, the training systems that are in place, the scheduling, the financial metrics and how well the restaurant is implementing the four pillars of great throughput.","Once the plan is written the field leader and GM meet to discuss it's implementation and the field leader specifies how they plan to assist the GM on an ongoing basis. This process is repeated every quarter with the idea of symptoms decline and each store will be getting closer and closer to have a restaurateur culture.","We\u2019re hearing over and over how excited managers are to have this tool in place. For nearly all of our restaurant this tool is providing a new level of understanding as to our expectations and giving clear direction to our GMs about how to become restaurateurs by taking some of the mystery out of what it takes to build this special culture. As of now all of our non-restaurateur restaurants have plans in place to help them on the road to restaurateur and our field teams will create new plans for each restaurant every quarter.","At first having more top performers in place than ever before allows us not only to run better restaurants but also to push into new areas to improve the Chipotle experience for our customers. Most recently this has enabled to roll out of our catering program which we first introduced in our Colorado restaurants in January of 2013. Today we\u2019ve catering available in all of our restaurants except those in New York City which we will add to the program later this year.","Through our catering program customers can setup a portable version of our service line for groups of 20 or more for customers who are looking to accommodate a smaller group we still do offer our Burritos by the Box option. Catering sales are approaching 1% with most this being incremental. In some of our markets like Denver, Seattle, St. Louis and San Francisco, for example, catering sales are averaging about 1.5% of sales. To support catering going into the busy holiday season, we had advertising running at all of our markets throughout December that included digital advertising, print and outdoor. The campaign performed very well during this time more than doubling page views from the Chipotle catering site.","Given the strength we are seeing with our catering programs so far, we are optimistic that we can continue growing our catering sales in the future. Having more top performing teams also helps us drive improvements and throughput. During fourth quarter, we continue to see excellent progress in delivering faster throughput with an average increase of six transactions during our peak lunch hour and an increase of five transactions during our peak dinner hour. What really impresses me is how we achieved our fastest throughput ever, even though the fourth quarter is traditionally a slower sales quarter of the year. This tells me that we are better suited than ever to set new throughput records and have the best customer service that we have ever had as we move towards our busiest sales month, which take ways during the second quarter of the year.","I hope and expect to share good news about our continued improvement on this important aspect of our business at that time. So these increases in throughput are very encouraging and are primarily the result of having more teams, the top performers empowered to achieve high standards as well as our renewed emphasis on what we call the four colors of grade throughput. Not only are we emphasized in the importance of consistent applying the four pillars in all of our restaurants, but we now have tools in place that will help us monitor and track our throughput performance. With these new auditing tools in place, we can tell how frequently each of our restaurants is executing the four pillars and work with our key leaders and individual managers to make improvements for restaurants are not doing as well in this regard. With this added visibility, we are confident that we can address any issue or issues that exist in this area and continue to have better throughput and better service on an individual restaurant basis so that we can continue to improve service in all of our restaurants and drive additional transactions during our busiest times.","Finally, I am pleased to report that our real estate pipeline continues to look very solid and we maintain our belief that we are going to open between 180 and 195 new restaurants in 2014. That means we are building more restaurants than ever before, but importantly, we are also managing our investment cost very efficiently and our new restaurants continue to perform very well with opening volumes at or above our communicated range of between 1.6 million to 1.7 million. With volumes like these, we obviously are providing tremendous returns on invested capital.","For year ahead, we expect new construction sites will account for about 50% of our restaurant openings, up from 43% last year and we are pleased to see that new developments are creating greater opportunity and availability for new Chipotle restaurants. Helping to support this trend, we are seeing more activity for smaller two or three tenant buildings in many parts of the country. Overall, we are going to open about 75% of our restaurants in proven and established markets in 2014 with the remainder of them in the new or developing markets. As we continue to strengthen our food and people cultures with new tools in place to help us more efficiently develop restaurateurs and with the strengthening real estate pipeline, we are confident in our plans for 2014 and remain confident that we are going to advance our vision to change the way people think about any fast food.","And with that, I will turn it over to Jack Hartung.","","Jack Hartung","Thanks Monty. We are proud of the results that we achieved during the fourth quarter and for the entire year of 2013 as our empowered restaurant teams continue to provide a great dining experience to all of our guests. As a result, our comps accelerated during the year and reached a high of 9.3% in the fourth quarter. These comps help drive an overall sales increase of 20.7% in the quarter and 17.7% for the full year. And our sales totaled $3.21 billion for the year surpassing the $3 billion dollar and sales mark for the first time ever. The comp was driven primarily by increased customer visits, while our average check increased by about 1%. Average check increased as a result of our catering program which serves a minimum of 20 people per catering order along with an increase in add-ons such as chips and guacamole and extra meat. Catering has now been rolled out in all of our markets, except New York City, where we expect to add catering later this year.","Looking ahead, we will gain one extra day in Q1 due to Easter falling in the second quarter this year. So that will shift about 100 basis points of comp from the second quarter to the first quarter. As a result of the strong comp momentum in the fourth quarter, we are increasing our sales guidance for the full year 2014 from low single-digits to a range of low to mid-single-digit comps. Our comp comparisons will be easiest early in the year and progressively become more difficult as we compare against the strong comps in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. This comp guidance is before consideration of any price increase we may take during the year.","Our average sales volume for restaurants that have been open for at least 12 months reaching an all-time high of $2.170 million and in terms of new restaurant they continue to perform very well opening with sales at or above the high-end of our communicated range of $1.6 million to $1.7 million. We opened 56 new restaurants in the quarter bringing our year-to-date openings to a 185 which exceeded the high end of our guidance range for 2013 and we ended the year with 1595 restaurants and as we mentioned during our last earnings call we plan to open between a 180 and 195 new restaurants in 2014 and we expect that these openings will occur relatively evenly throughout the year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.53 an increase of 29.7%. Restaurant level margins increased in the quarter by 100 basis points to 25.6% as we leverage a higher sales comp which more than offset food cost which were 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2012.","EPS was $10.47 for the full year of 2013 an increase of 19.7% compared to 2012. For the year efficiencies from higher comps allowed to leverage labor and occupancy lines for the restaurant level but margins declined 50 basis points to 26.6% due to higher food cost which were 80 basis points higher for the year. Food cost were 33.9% in the quarter up 40 basis points from 2012 and sequentially higher by 30 basis points compared to the third quarter. Inflation year-over-year was driven mainly from higher avocados cost and to a lesser extent from higher tomato and corn salsa cost.","Avocados prices continue to remain high and are expected to remain elevated throughout 2014 as there will be increased demand putting pressure on relatively flat supply levels for Mexico and from lower supplies from the California growers. We\u2019re also expecting similar supply constraints in beans [ph] as a result of two consecutive years of drought conditions. So as a result we expect food cost to increase over the next few quarters and for the full year we will be around 34.5% of sales or higher before the impact of any menu price increases.","We made no decision on a menu pricing at least for this year and we will continue to monitor trend such as food inflation, our comp trends and general economic and consumer confidence trend but based on these elevated and rising food cost we believe a menu price increase is likely sometime during the third quarter.","Labor cost were 23% of sales in the quarter decrease of 90 basis points from 2012 most of this decline is due to leverage from the higher comp and we also benefited from lower workers comp in the quarter which provided about a 20 basis point benefit. For the full year labor cost were down 50 basis points in 2012 mainly due to leverage from the higher full year comp of 5.6%.","Other operating cost were 11.3% for the quarter which is down 20 basis points from 2012. Lower marketing cost were offset by higher printing cost related to our roll out of catering and Sofritas along with higher cost of local store marketing including local fund raising efforts. For the full year other operating cost were 10.8% were up 30 basis points from 2012 due to higher marketing and promotional cost including the local store marketing. Marketing was 1.2% in the quarter compared to 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2012 sequentially from the third quarter marketing was down 30 basis points as lower marketing levels coincided with the end of our skillfully made advertising campaign that ended for most markets in October.","While marketing was 1.4% of sales overall in 2013 we expect it will be closer to our targeted rate of around 1.7% in 2014. G&A was 6.6% in the quarter of 40 basis points higher than 2012 due to higher bonus expenses in employee taxes. The fourth quarter included higher bonus expense due to our strong company performance compared to full year bonus targets which represents about a $4 million catch-up in the quarter.","For the full year G&A was 6.3% or 40 basis points lower than 2012 and a decrease as a percent of revenue was driven by cost in 2012 for our biennial All-Manager conference and from lower stock based compensation expense and from greater sales leverage in 2013 primarily are partially offset by a higher bonus and legal cost. The non-cash non-economic stock comp was $65 million for the full year in 2013 and was about $13 million in the fourth quarter. In 2014 we expect G&A as a percentage of sales to increase about 40 basis points due to higher non-cash stock comp expense and from the cost of our All-Manager meeting. In September we will invest about $8 million in our biennial All-Manager conference where we will meet with our 2300 managers and support staff and based on today\u2019s stock price total non-cash stock comp expense for 2014 is estimated to be about $90 million an increase of $25 million. Well total G&A included in the All-Manager meeting and the higher non-cash stock comp will rise as a percentage of sales in 2014 our underlying cash G&A without these two items will be lower as a percentage of sales as a result of our continuing effort to grow our underlying G&A at a slower rate than our sales growth.","Our 2013 effective tax rate was 38.7%, that\u2019s 60 basis points lower than 2012 mostly as a result of the renewal of tax credits including the work opportunity tax credit and the R&D tax credit that were extended in 2013 for both 2012 and 2013. We expect our 2014 tax rate to be about 39.2% and the higher effective tax rate in 2014 is primarily due to the expired work opportunity in R&D tax credits partially offset by lower estimated state tax rates in 2014.","During the quarter, we purchased about $13 million worth of our stock or over 25,000 shares at an average share price of $505. For the full year, we purchased about $110 million worth of our stock and over 336,000 shares at an average share price of $327. And at the end of 2013, we still had about $90 million remaining on our current $100 million authorized share buybacks. Over the past five years, we have invested over $610 million to repurchase our stock at an average share price of $150.","In 2013, our average development costs for Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. were about $8,000. Capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursement totaled about $190 million in 2013 primarily related to new restaurants along with continued reinvestment in existing restaurants and other company initiatives. In 2014, we anticipate CapEx will be around $225 million, the majority of which relates to new restaurant construction. We expect our average restaurant development cost will increase around 5% based on opening more freestanding restaurants during 2014, which are expensive than end-caps and in-line sites and we will open proportionately more sites in our Northeast region where construction cost as well as sales are typically higher.","Our normal reinvestment for existing restaurants, which typically averages about $15,000 per restaurant will be higher in 2014 and will average about $20,000 per restaurant as we will perform a full remodel on many of our oldest restaurants. We also plan to invest about $10 million perform a significant network redesign in all of our restaurants which will enhance the way we communicate and train our restaurant employees and provide better security, improved reliability and greater capabilities including functions such as mobile payments in our restaurants.","We are able to increase our total cash and investment by $228 million during the year and ended the year with $892 million in cash and other related investments. Even after funding the opening of 185 new restaurants and repurchasing stock to our share buyback, it brings totaling $110 million during the year. We continue to believe that investing in our high-returning assets, high-returning new restaurants, remains the best use of our cash and we are confident that the growth options we are exceeding today including ShopHouse, Chipotle and international markets and most recently Pizzeria Locale will provide value enhancing opportunities in the future. In the meantime, we will continue to invest in our high returning domestic restaurants and we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today. At this time, we\u2019d be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Company.","","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you. This is (indiscernible) for Brian. Can you talk about the timing of becoming GMO free and how you expect to drive that awareness once you achieve that? And you think that the heightened awareness can drive an increasing demand for Chipotle? Thank you.","","Steve Ells","Thanks Brian. We expect to be GMO free by the end of this year. The exact timing is unclear right now, but we are making great progress. In terms of it driving the business, I guess I would answer that as the way I would answer the impact of our Food with Integrity mission overall. Certainly, historically customers come in, because they love the taste of Chipotle, they love the value, the convenience, the ability to customize their ingredients all these kinds of things. And that has always been sort of the top of mind reasons why people say they come in. Food with Integrity, our commitment to more sustainably raised ingredients, which we have been at now for a dozen years or so. And talking about it has become more and more important to customers over the years whether it drives people in or not is not always clear, but what I think is really important is that more and more of our customers are telling us that it's very important to them. They are interested in where their food comes from and how it was raised and that they want to be assured that they are feeding their families a helpful nutrition\u2019s raw ingredients. They are concerned about the environment and a lot of the problems of the commodity kinds of ingredients out there and so going non-GMO I think fits into that food with integrity mission and I wouldn\u2019t point to non-GMO as a single thing that\u2019s going to drive sales but something that\u2019s going to continue to strengthen our bond with customers and increase the trust level and get people excited about our larger mission change the way people think about any fast food and I think when you combine a mission like that with food that\u2019s absolutely delicious but people crave that they want to eat often, then I think you have a winning formula and the two go hand in hand.","","Unidentified Analyst","Can I sneak in one more? I\u2019m just wondering if you can kind of talk about how you have been able to drive such strong traffic in the fourth quarter? Most consumer company saw the opposite happening for the third quarter and the fourth quarter and maybe if you have any comments on what you\u2019re seeing in early 2014, what gives you the confidence to go from low single-digit to mid-single-digit top outlook? Thank you.","","Steve Ells","There is no one thing that we can point to say that that\u2019s what drove our sales but I think if you look at all the things that we have done including continue to strengthen our people culture so that the experience our customers enjoy when they come in is the best experience that we can possibly provide. Our throughput is the fastest it's ever been including as Monty said seasonally this is not a time when our throughput to get us peak [ph] and yet it did outperform. Our throughput resulted in the summer so our throughput was a contributor to that. Marketing has been connecting with our customers really throughout the year not just are skillfully made marketing which connected with people and people recognized and appreciated that that we really do have raw ingredients and open kitchens and they appreciate that. The Scarecrow created a lot of discussion about Chipotle so there is some awareness about that as well but catering was a part of it. We know that we\u2019re approaching 1% of sales of catering and we know the majority of that is incremental and I think those are the main, LSM we did a lot of LSM throughout the year and our teams actually did more fund raising as we approached the back half of the year which we think just created more awareness that people that haven't been at Chipotle in quite some time.","And I mentioned earlier that our people culture just strengthening our teams is the biggest piece and so if you go through, if you\u2019re going to prioritize all of those items you probably have to put the biggest piece on that even though that\u2019s tough to measure but we just think that that every time our customers come in that these wonderful teams that are anxious to serve them, that\u2019s probably the single biggest piece but to parse out how much of that 9% will be allocated to each of those pieces would be difficult to deal but we feel good about next year just because despite the fact that other restaurant companies and other retail companies have seen some softness in the fourth quarter. We seem to have been able to overcome that and so I think all things we\u2019re doing to create the special experience is working and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we will be able to continue to do that in 2014.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Buckley of Bank of America.","","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If you can clarify the comments on pricing, for some of these I\u2019m not sure if I heard you say (indiscernible) take would it slightly be for the fourth quarter but you said during the third quarter maybe just start with that one.","","Steve Ells","Yeah Joe I said during the third quarter. Right now we would like to get through this first quarter, we like to see how this current transaction momentum will continue. We just like to get through find out how this weather might affect our ingredients. Right now we don\u2019t know if any of the weather that we have seen in the south has been an affect in some of our ingredients next year and so we would like to get through at least a quarter or so and see how things are falling out both on our ingredient inflation side as well as our transaction momentum. And so we think of that we will be in a position to them raise prices on time in the third quarter.","","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then you just actually are \u2013 I got the impression you were backing away somewhat from the probability of a price increase, is that misinterpretation on my part or they didn\u2019t change the last couple of weeks? And then just one more on the pricing, you historically have a history of sort of taking in single-digit price increases when you infrequently take them when you think you be in that historical mid-single-digit range again?","","Steve Ells","Yes. Joe, I don\u2019t know that we are trying to signal either way at ICR. We have really had no intention on changing what we have said at the third quarter, which was we have not made a pricing decision. We will continue to monitor trend as I mentioned during my prepared comments. We actually take a look at our current food cost at 33.9%, continued inflation. It seems more likely. And so I would say that is the update I would say since October, which was I would say that\u2019s the last time we took a stand and we weren\u2019t continuing to change that at ICR. We weren\u2019t very sure and we still haven\u2019t made a decision, but I think right now, we are standing at 33.9% knowing that we have got pressure from stay, if we got pressure from avocados, it looks more likely. Now, things change just like last year or year ago, we were saying the same thing and things change. In fact, our food costs in the first quarter were lower last year than it was in the previous quarter. And so if that changes, we may back off, but right now, standing at 33.9% with continued pressure, it seems likely. And I think a mid-single-digit 3% to 5% Joe. Again, we haven\u2019t made a decision that\u2019s not an unreasonable assumption so maybe somewhere in that ballpark.","","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. That\u2019s very clearly makes sense. Thank you.","","Steve Ells","Okay, thanks Joe.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.","","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","I just wanted to ask about the sales drivers and it seems like you have a lot of these things on marketing and in particular, but also throughput, I know operational improvements, but you mentioned digital as a way that you have chosen to spend marketing dollars? And I think I heard you talk about mobile payments can you just talk about your kind of your approach to that, how you are thinking about that? When we would expect to see rolled out, I know in the past you said you don\u2019t want to do a traditional loyalty program, but maybe something that targets marketing. So if you could just talk about that? And then I have a follow-up.","","Jack Hartung","Yes, Sara. We still don\u2019t have much of an appetite or any appetite for a traditional loyalty program at all, but we are experimenting with mobile payments and we have kind of a rough version right now that our employees are able to use right now. And we want to expand that. We know that that there is a lot of activity going on in mobile payments and we want to be part of that. Once we have mobile payments, we can have a different kind of connection in relationship with our customers, where you think we have the ability to. We don\u2019t have this really mined out yet, the ability to communicate with them and maybe provide some kind of unique offerings, for example, the customer has not been to Chipotle in a while or they come to Chipotle often and they never buy chips and guacamole. There are things that we can do that are more unique to that customer. So I think that gives us a unique opportunity that I wouldn\u2019t call a loyalty program, but it\u2019s more of a bond that we can build, a communication that we can build with customers where we can personalize our communication and maybe some of the things we might offer to the person, but I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a traditional loyalty program.","In terms of digital, yes, I mean, we do have a number of things that we are doing. We do some advertising on a number of digital media, social media and we have a whole team of people that respond to e-mails. We have a Twitter account and we are active in the Twitter account. So we are active with a lot of the social media and the digital media, but that\u2019s something we have been doing for \u2013 that\u2019s not new, that\u2019s something we have done during 2013 and in prior years as well.","","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thank you. And then just a follow-up not on my question, but an earlier one of that sort of the ShopHouse and the Pizzeria Locale, can you just remind us again how you are thinking about growth versus the rate that you saw with Chipotle early on, just with respect to we think that you have more sort of institutionalized competencies around real estate and supply chain and all of these things. So if you could just compare kind of whether you expect some of these new growth seeds to be faster than where Chipotle was at the same stage? Thanks.","","Steve Ells","So right now with ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. We\u2019re very, very focused on perfecting the experience to introducing all the new people who come through to the uniqueness and specialness of both of these concepts. Both of these concepts are building nicely. We\u2019re expecting to open a couple of few more ShopHouse\u2019s this year. We\u2019re expecting to open a couple of more Pizzeria Locale this year. If I compare the rate of growth so far with both of these concepts it's faster than Chipotle started out. But I think you hit on something, when we\u2019re ready to expand at a faster rate we certainly have the infrastructure in place. You mentioned real estate, well we have so much information on 1600 specific sites now in the U.S. with Chipotle\u2019s and so we know exactly what regions, what markets what intersections we would want to go to with these new concepts.","We have teams who can advise on the best locations for that and I think most importantly we have an extraordinary team of top performers who are empowered to help us expand this quickly and if I think about the biggest hurdles over the last 20 years in growing Chipotle it was on the people side and so with our very, very strong team that continues to get stronger grooming the future leaders I think that\u2019s going to be a competitive advantage that we have and that will help us grow these concepts but again we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re growing these right at this point. It's not time to unleash them it's time to grow smartly and watch them and make sure that we\u2019re cooking delicious food and serving in a way that excites customers and we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019re very happy with the results.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion from Citi.","","Alvin Concepcion \u2013 Citi","Comps were obviously very strong in this quarter which is impressive but it didn\u2019t have being better if weather was an issue or customers did less online shopping during the holidays and I guess the question is did you see a noticeable impact from these items at all?","","Steve Ells","It's a great question Alvin because we have seen the same things you\u2019ve seen and we\u2019ve seen weather being brought up a lot. We have seen some comments that there has been so much online shopping that people weren\u2019t out about and so they didn\u2019t visit restaurants for example. I don\u2019t think we saw that overall. Yes of course we saw that on individual days and we saw where when there was severe weather in a certain region we saw our sales soften during that time but we have had a history where when the weather gets bad and people doing visit Chipotle one day let\u2019s say the restaurants are totally closed or they just can\u2019t go for lunches and so our sales are way, way, way off. When the weather subsides we tend to kind of over perform we tend to see a greater than average comp and so we tend to have an offsetting effect there and so on a net-net I would say the weather didn\u2019t really have much of a net effect or at least the best that we can tell when you look at the overall quarter.","In terms of the online comments I mean that will be impossible for us to tell but certainly by in fact that we accelerated during the quarter, we accelerated in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. We certainly can\u2019t point to any kind of online activity and say that that had a bad effect. And the other thing that we saw was that our sales were better in December than November and I think that once again (indiscernible) as well and I think that\u2019s just a function of our customers enjoying all the experience based on what our wonderful teams and the restaurants are doing that despite the weather despite whether people were not out and about because they are doing online shopping they still decided that they wanted to dine at Chipotle during December and we were delighted to see that trend.","","Alvin Concepcion \u2013 Citi","And you mentioned things were better in December versus November. Did you see that momentum continue to generate?","","Steve Ells","Well okay that\u2019s a little choppy now because we\u2019re talking about some really extreme weather and so it feels like the underlying trend that we saw during the quarter overall average and so let\u2019s call it the 9.3% I would say that the underlying traffic is probably in that same kind of ballpark in that 9.3% but it's very hard to tell. I mean you\u2019ve one week where the comps are not pretty at all and you\u2019ve another week where they look pretty attractive but we\u2019re going to have to let the rest of quarter unfold and see what the underlying trend is but right now I would say that they are trying to do is likely similar to what we saw on the fourth quarter overall.","","Alvin Concepcion - Citi","Great. And just one more from me, I know there is some passion in raising prices, because it may impact traffic, but with accelerating traffic growth coupled with being priced at or below your competitors, does that change your view at all on the price elasticity of the consumer or are you been accelerating the timeline for your rollout of the price increase?","","Steve Ells","No. I mean, we still think it makes sense to watch what happens with inflation and watch what happens with the economy strength of the consumer and our transaction trends for at least the first quarter. And then once we see that and most importantly during that time we will learn about our ingredient cost, we will learn what affects whether that we are seeing might have in our ingredient cost. And we would rather have that information in hand before we pull the trigger on a price increase.","","Alvin Concepcion - Citi","Alright, thank you very much.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","Yes, I think maybe a follow up on that last point, which is with your margins hovering around all-time highs and trends at reaccelerating, why you didn\u2019t take price at all, because even the food costs are higher as a percentage of sales, your labor and rent and other things are lower and you are still making all this profit, why you didn\u2019t take the risk with the brand at all?","","Monty Moran","Michael that possibility still exists. And so we have not made a decision. And you remember last year at this time we talked about the price increase being likely and then we pulled back on it. We are not in a hurry and we wouldn\u2019t hesitate if conditions suggest that we shouldn\u2019t take it that maybe will either defer it or take it off the table altogether in 2014. Now at some point we don\u2019t want to be under-priced, okay, so there is a desire to not be so far under what others are charging in the industry that people are wondering, well see I won the Food Integrity thing, how can they claim if their ingredients are better when they are charging so much less than other restaurant companies out there. So we would not want to be in that kind of a situation, but it\u2019s still possible that we may call the menu price off the table in 2014.","","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","And then on a different topic, it\u2019s been inching up little by little but your guidance suggested the third consecutive year of new unit opening being in the call it 175, 200 unit range, is there some sort of a soft ceiling that you kind of reached here, whether it\u2019s because of real estate or people for you to be able to actually do it right, location by location, it really doesn\u2019t make sense for you to open that much more than what you are opening now and we should kind of start to expect a lot of large numbers to kick in a little bit?","","Steve Ells","No. I mean, we don\u2019t really feel like there is a ceiling or a soft ceiling by the same token we sort of make the decisions based on what fuels right when we look at the kind of real estate pipeline we have and when we look at the development of our people culture around the country and the number of field leaders who are being promoted from restaurateur positions. And so we talk to our real estate teams and we find out how it\u2019s looking in terms of getting a pipeline and creating a real estate and really being very selective with the real estate, to find real estate that we believe where we can open restaurants with terrific volumes, but also reasonable cost. So we balance that and then we also look at how the people culture is developing. I would say, both are going very well, but we feel with this increased guidance of 180 to 195 restaurants that we are increasing and then kind of always sort of pushing to build more restaurants, but we also don\u2019t want to \u2013 we don\u2019t want to sort of overdo it, we want to be very careful and measured with that growth to be certain that we are opening restaurants that are of a really, really high quality with terrific customer experiences. And it all is part of our philosophy that it\u2019s much better to allow demand to sort of exceed to be in front of supply so that we are fulfilling, we are fulfilling a demand that we have created in the marketplace. And as it exists \u2013 as demand increases, we will be working hard to make sure that the supply can also increase so that we can continue to have great results.","","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","And one last one, can you Jack maybe give some figures around the constitution of your workforce and help us understand how you might potentially be affected as the minimum wage does rise to $10?","","Jack Hartung","Yes. We don\u2019t pay minimum wage. Our average wages are above $9 for hourly employees. So a move up to $9 would have minimal effect, a move to $10 would have an effect, but not too significant and I would say that the impact on us will be much less than others. And so you would see an impact on our margins, but it will be something that we could certainly absorb.","","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","Very helpful. Thank you.","","Jack Hartung","Thanks Michael.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Karen Holthouse of Credit Suisse.","","Karen Holthouse - Credit Suisse","Hi. Congratulations on a fantastic quarter. Going back to your comment earlier about technology investments in stores that would help enable mobile payments and some other things. How should we think about that? Is that more of a back end investment or does that involve actually changing out POS equipment and does it involves the latter is there any concern that there will be a little bit of a short term throughput investment as workers are training on and getting used to the new system. Thanks.","","Steve Ells","On technology I mentioned in my comments we\u2019re going to make about a $10 million investment in infrastructure. We have got to redo the networks in our restaurant we haven't done that in quite some time and that will be an enabler for any of the things that we want to do in the future including things like mobile pay. Once we have done that we at this point don\u2019t think it's going to require new POS. There is a device but we will need to add that\u2019s not very expensive, it's a matter of 100s of dollars per restaurant not 1000s or 10,000s.","","Unidentified Analyst","Similarly like to a Starbucks?","","Steve Ells","Yeah it could be like a Starbucks, it would just be a reader. Those are pretty standard those are there is nothing too fancy about that but you got to make the big investment of several thousand per restaurant with the network, redo the network in order to accommodate that. Redoing the network will give us other advantages as well more secure, it will be more reliable and so it's time to do that but that\u2019s an enabling investment that we do have to make. There is also always the possibility I mean we aren\u2019t against taking look at a new POS solution and there is lots more that are out there, there is some cloud solutions that are at least possibilities to look at and so we\u2019re open to that and we found something that would be a better business alternative but better would be better throughput, not worse. We would not make an investment including things like mobile pay that have the potential of slowing down throughput. So we just wouldn\u2019t make that investment but we would make an investment that would speed up throughput, that would enhance the intuitive ability to train our employees if the technology gave us better information or just was better from an efficiency standpoint, better from a throughput standpoint those are the things that we would look at. We would not want to compromise the customer service that we provide our customers just to be chasing the latest technology gimmick.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffery Bernstein from Barclays.","","Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays","Two questions just first on the real estate discussion before, in terms of your cost percent [ph] I think you said your cost would be up 5% in \u201914 just wondering is it more building cost or are you talking about more from competition for real estate whether it be I mean you may face causality or is there other driving prices higher just because so many people are growing so fast and is that\u2019s the case? Are you increasing the mix of potentially your A sites? How does that play out within that growth for \u201914?","","Steve Ells","Well most of the increase that we\u2019re predicting in terms of the fact that we\u2019re opening more restaurants in the North East part of the country where the construction cost are much higher as well as the fact that we\u2019re going to open incrementally more free standards which cost more money to build. So we still feel very good about our ability to efficient and economically with building our new restaurants and don\u2019t see it as just leaking upward there is a reason for it.","","Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays","And the A sites is that a bigger component this year than last year or?","","Steve Ells","With regard to A sites we opened last year in 2013, we opened about 25 A models and like I said in the last call we\u2019re always looking for those because opportunistically we\u2019re always looking for sites that have very low development cost and low occupancy cost and that we can run very, very efficiently. So I think that you will see those sort of the same and sort of numbers this year I think probably smaller as a percentage of growth because of the fact that we have gotten more of our restaurants coming from new construction. But again when we see them we will find them and we will continue to layer those into our portfolio whenever we can.","","Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays","And the follow-up with just more broadly on the category, well I\u2019m just curious how you even categorize the category in which you compete and whether you look out as fast casual or more narrowly as fast casual Mexican but just wondering how you think about the category you compete and specifically in maybe the pace of the growth of that category or how you look at your share versus others whether you see your share I\u2019m assuming you see your share growing versus declining but internally how do you think about the constituents of your category and the pace of growth for that category?","","Steve Ells","I would say that of all the people who play in this fast casual arena I think Chipotle is different in two very unique ways and that is our very unique people culture which is one that is cultivating a strong force of future leaders. It is a really, really powerful thing that ends up providing a really great customer experience but also our focus on food with integrity and our desire to make available to customers the kinds of foods that really were only available at very high end restaurants or expensive markets or farmers markets and things like this. We\u2019ve always believed that these kinds of food should be available to everybody. No one else is really doing this sort of thing so I think because of that we are sort of in a special category of our own and when I think about the category it's not really about Mexican food of course it's about a model, a model that allows you to source great ingredients and cook those ingredients according to classic cooking techniques served in an interactive format and all delivered via this team of top performers and so that is a model which Chipotle and ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale fit squarely into.","","Steve Ells","All right thanks everyone for joining us today.

All participants are now in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like introduce Chipotle\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, Alex Spong. You may begin your conference.","Alex Spong","Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the second quarter 2014. It may also be found on our Web site at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include projections of the number of restaurants we intend to open, conference comp sales increases, the impact of menu price increases, trends in food costs, marketing spend and other expense items, effective tax rates, stock purchases and shareholder returns, as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.

Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks.","Our discussion today will also include Non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which can be found on the presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our Web site. I'd like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the third quarter, it will begin September 1st and continues through our third quarter release in October.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells","Thanks, Alex. Well, I am extremely proud the performance our team has delivered during the second quarter. Not only were we able to continue the momentum we saw in the first quarter and late in 2013, we actually accelerated our momentum in the second quarter. Our revenue for the quarter grew to $1.05 billion, an increase of 28.6% and was driven by same store sales increase of 17.3% and the opening of 45 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $3.50 for the quarter, an increase 24.1%.","Our ability to generate such strong sales growth is the direct result of our restaurant managers and crews providing an exceptional dining experience, which keep the customers coming back and allows us to build such a strong customer loyalty. Ultimately our performance comes down to our continued focus on strengthening our unique food culture and our special people culture. Our food culture starts by finding the very best ingredients we can, with an eye to sustainability and great taste and continues by teaching our teams how to turn these high quality ingredients into delicious food using classic cooking techniques. We are confidently elevating and challenging ourselves to find even better ingredients and better cooking techniques so that the food we serve in the years to come is even better than it is today.","Through our people culture, we are developing the future leaders we will need to achieve our vision to change the way people think about any fast food. This starts by hiring teams of all top performers and empowering them to achieve high standards. The strength of our people culture is what allows us to provide such extraordinary customer service and maintain such strong unit economics.","During the quarter, we took some important steps to strengthen our food culture and improve the quality of the ingredients we use in our restaurants. From many months now, we have struggled to get all of the beef we need from cattle raised without use of antibiotics for added hormones which is the cornerstone of our meat and dairy verticals. When we have not been able to get enough beef that meets our high standards, we have temporarily filled that gap with conventionally raised beef and posted notices in our restaurants so customers are aware of the change. With the nation's beef supply at a 60 year low and our demand continuing to rise, it looks as if this challenge is going to continue and we want to find a better solution, one that allows us to source as much beef as possible that meets our high standards.","We believe we found that solution by sourcing some grass fed beef from Australia, a country that is ideally suited to raising beef cattle entirely on grass. We started doing this in recent months to help to fill the gap between what\u2019s available and what's needed to meet our growing demand. The meat produced by these ranchers is grass-fed in the truest sense of the term: The cattle spend their entire lives grazing on pastures or rangelands, eating only grass and forages. All this beef meets or exceed the protocols we apply to our domestic responsibly raised beef, including that the animals are raised entirely without antibiotics, added hormones or other growth promoters and by ranchers whose practices are aligned with our standards for humane animal husbandry. While our loyalty to American ranchers remains strong and a significant majority of beef continues to come from American ranchers, sourcing some grass-fed beef from outside the U.S. is an important step in Chipotle\u2019s never ending food with integrity journey.","In the short run, the grass-fed beef we are using from Australia will supplement the responsibly raised beef we have been purchasing from around the U.S. Overtime we hope that our demand for grass-fed beef will help provide an opportunity for more American ranchers to adopt a grass-fed program and help term grass-fed beef into a more mainstream product in the United States. We look forward to working with our supplier partners to meet this challenge.","During the quarter we also saw the beginning of the summer growing season around the country and with it the start of our local produce program. This year our goal is to use at least 20 million pounds of produce from farms that are within 350 miles of our restaurants. Restaurants throughout the country may serve ingredients such as romaine lettuce, bell peppers, red onions, jalapeno peppers, oregano from local farms. We are also able to serve locally grown avocados, citrus or cilantro in some parts of the country where it\u2019s possible to grow these ingredients. Our commitment to serving locally grown produce is ultimately about serving the best tasting food we can.","Quite simply, produce from local farms can arrive closer to the time it is harvested and results in fresher produce but there are other benefits as well including a reduction in food miles and economic impact to rural communities throughout the country. We are also making progress with the roll-out of Sofritas, our vegan menu item made with braised organic tofu. As of now Sofritas is available in about 1,000 restaurants. ","When we introduced Sofritas, our aim was to create a dish that would appeal to not just vegan and vegetarian customers but all of our customers and that is very much what we are seeing right now. So now Sofritas account for about 3.5% of our entrees in the restaurants where it\u2019s available. And what\u2019s exciting is that we are finding Sofritas is been ordered by people who normally eat meat. Barring any supply limitations, we expect to have Sofritas in all of our restaurants by the end of the year. While our food culture is one of the key drivers of our business, many customers, including a number of our own customers do not fully understand the issues of the food system that still heavily influences the decisions we make.","One facet of our overall marketing program is aimed at encouraging people to be more serious about their food and where it comes from. We believe that the more people understand these issues, the more they will make better choices about the food they eat. Through our day long food and music Cultivate festivals and through programs like our recent online satire series Farmed and Dangerous or short films such as last year\u2019s Scarecrow, we look to draw people into the conversation about food and where it comes from in a way that makes them more curious about the food they eat. We just held the first of three Cultivate festivals planned for this year in San Francisco with the remaining events scheduled for Minneapolis and Dallas and the response was great.","Our research shows that attendees loved the overall experience including the music, celebrity chef demonstrations, the Artisan food and brewer halls and the attractions designed to educate people about issues around food. And that an overwhelming majority of them would attend the events again. Two of our most recent content marketing programs Farmed and Dangerous and Scarecrow were just awarded 12 Lion awards between them at the Cannes Lions, the world\u2019s largest competition for creativity and communications. While we don\u2019t produce these programs to win awards, the awards demonstrate the breakthrough of these produce programs and the response customers have to them. These programs have been very effective tools for us to engage with people in way that is first and foremost entertaining but that also makes them more curious about the food they eat.","A part of our larger marketing program which also includes traditional advertising and local market programs, this approach is helping us build our brand in a more unusual way than traditional fast-food formula which relied heavily on price promotions, limited time offers and other gimmicks to bring customers in. We believe that our approach to marketing helps us build a deeper relationships and loyalty with our customers rather than just driving transactions in the short-term. To keep our restaurants top of line, we continue our traditional advertising through the quarter. Currently we have national and local advertising focused on communicating the use of better quality, responsibly raised ingredients that are prepared with care. Response to our advertising is encouraging with most of the recent research showing the increase in ad awareness and purchase intent during the campaign. This advertising will continue to run through much of the summer and into the fall. The progress we are making on our journey to change the way people think about and eat fast food is defining Chipotle in terms that unique within the industry and allowing us to provide exceptional returns for our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Monty.","Monty Moran","Thank you, Steve. It makes me proud to see our restaurant teams deliver these spectacular results in the quarter at a time when our customers have more dinning choices than ever before. Yet more and more customers are choosing the Chipotle because the top performing managers and their crews provide an exceptional dining experience that keeps our customers coming back and leads them to tell others about their fondness for visiting in Chipotle. We have amazing people culture and the foundation of that is a group of terrific people who all believe in the same dining principal, that each of us will rewarded based on our ability to make the people around us better.","","Our people are committed to our mission to change the way people think about meat fast food and they understand that the only way we will accomplish this is to have a special culture, a culture of top performers, who are empowered to achieve high standards. This is the restaurant true culture. It is the focus of every focus of every person in this company, enabling us to create a terrific dining experience and produce outstanding results.","","The strength of our culture allows us to have exceptional customer service, delicious food and an inviting atmosphere in our restaurants, all of which leads us to a strong unit economic model, while also setting us up for continued success, because these top performers strictly rise into broader leadership positions within the Company.","Throughout the quarter we continued to promote new restaurateurs, the elite managers who best demonstrate what our culture is all about. If you include field leaders who have come through The Restaurateur program, those who have been promoted to a prior team leader or team leader even team director positions, we have more than 525 of these extraordinary leaders now overseeing about 70% of all of our Chipotle restaurants.","","During the quarter, we also saw some significant progress of Restaurateurs moving into field leadership positions. We promoted five field leaders to team director positions. Jason Oaks, Karen Grayhall, Ben Castillo, Peter Garllio [ph], Emily Amdares [ph]. And with these team director promotions, we also promoted nine leaders into present team leader positions. So all of us continue to build and strengthen our people culture. We\u2019re going to host our All Manager Conference in September and as we host every two years, to help educate and inspire our restaurant managers and field leaders of teams. ","","This year\u2019s All Managers Conference will include all of our GMs, restaurant stores, field leaders and many people from our support departments as well some key suppliers and partners. In all, there are around 2,500 people who will attend the conference to support our commitment to building culture of empowered top performance.","","The conference provides one of the best opportunities for our teams to learn more about how we plan achieve our mission to change the way people think about and eat fast food and how they can rise up to be the leaders that are going to take us there. This year\u2019s conference will feature members of our leadership team discussing our vision, the importance of our people culture and unit economic model. We also help our managers develop and strengthen their culinary capabilities, teach them to create Restaurateur cultures, teach them to recruit, hire and welcome only top performers and teach them more about why food integrity is so unique and important. We will also introduce them to the ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale restaurants.","Finally we\u2019ve also added an award ceremony this year celebrating some of our team members who have made outstanding contributions to Chipotle\u2019s culture. These people continuously raise the bar in our performance and we are excited to allow their stories to be an inspiration to the rest of the audience of aspiring Restaurateurs. ","","If past conferences are any indication, I am certain that this will leave our more passionate about our vision, more knowledgeable about our business and more committed to developing the people around them and strengthening the culture in their own restaurant and with a stronger belief in what we can all accomplish as a team.","","Over the years, I believe the All Managers Conference has been one of our best tools to educate and inspire our managers and to send all of our teams away with every new sense of purpose. While we continue to build better historical cultures in our restaurants, we are very encouraged by our teams arising to meet challenges.","","One of the key operational advantages that we constantly seek to improve is our throughput. Good throughput is one way of providing great customer service and it\u2019s also well with our team to have top performers and power to achieve high standards. So it\u2019s a great sign that we were once again able to make substantial gains on this important measure of great customer service during the quarter. This quarter we posted increase of eight transactions during the peak lunch hour and eight additional transactions also during the peak dinner hour compared to last year.","","What\u2019s truly impressive is that even though we have long line to both lunch and dinner, we are able to drive a 9.4% transaction comp during our peak lunch hour and a 13.3% transaction comp at our peak dinner hour through better throughout. These are the customers who might easily walk away from our long-lines to dine elsewhere except that they know that our excellent teams are geared up and ready to serve them a delicious meal quickly. ","","Overall, we would not be able to achieve such phenomenal same store sales without these dramatic improvements in throughputs. We believe the improvements we are seeing in our throughput is a result of just a few key things. First, having more top performing managers and teams. We know from experience that top performance get more done in less time than low performers and hold themselves to a higher standard. Second, by focusing on the four pillars of great throughput, using a linebacker during peak hours, proper mise en place, having aces in their places and using a dedicated expert during peak times; and third by auditing and reporting our field leaders how well their teams are executing the four pillars and how they can improve.","","Of course great throughput does more than move people to our restaurants. It also translates into better customer service since the same thing that leads to great throughout also creates a very nice customer service and make our customers happy.","Our performance for the quarter also benefitted from growth of our catering business. For the quarter, catering sales were 1.6% of revenue, compared with about 0.3% a year ago same quarter and catering sales benefited by around 50 basis points in the second quarter from the seasonal nature of the stronger sales we have in May and June for special events like graduation parties. In markets we're catering as an operator for at least a year, sales continue to build and averaged about 2% in the second quarter. We're encouraged to see catering continue to grow and that we\u2019re building greater customer awareness and customer loyalty over time.","Finally I\u2019d like to provide a quick update on our development plans. We remain very much on track to deliver within our guidance to open a 180 to 195 new restaurants this year and we have a very solid pipeline of potential sites going forward. We expect that about 70% of our restaurants this year will be in proven markets, with about 15% in developing or established markets and another 15% in new markets, including locations in Duluth, Texarkana, Mobile and Charleston, West Virginia. Looking forward we have a strong pipeline of potential sites going into next year and beyond.","Overall we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter and our performance year-to-date and believe that we have pieces in place both in terms of our food culture and our people culture to continue to deliver an exceptional value experience for our customers and strong results for our shareholders.","With that I'll now turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Hartung","","Thanks, Monty. We\u2019re pleased to report another quarter of very strong financial results. In fact our second quarter results represent one of our strongest sales comps as a public company, second only to the first quarter of 2006, our very first quarter as a public company. Back then had under 500 restaurants averaging about $1.5 million in sales and while the 19.7% comp back then was impressive, we\u2019re even more proud of the 17.3% comp this quarter, considering we now have nearly 1700 restaurants, averaging $2.3 million in sales. In fact on an annualized basis a 17.3% comp would result in adding an incremental sales layer that is nearly equal to our entire company sales back in 2005, the year before our IPO.","But more importantly than the comp itself is that we achieved this result by continuing to focus on building a special food and people culture and a strong business model, which results in providing exceptional dining experience to our guests and creates shareholder value for our investors. Our comp of 17.3% in the second quarter helped to elevate our average sales volumes for restaurants opened for at least 12 months past $2.3 million for the first time, and the comp also helped push our sales above $1 billion in a quarter for the very first time.","Overall sales for the quarter increased 28.6% to $1.05 billion, driven by the comp and from new restaurant openings. Year to date sales were $1.95 billion, an increase of 26.6%, including a comp for the year so far of 15.5%. The quarter comp was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic, along with an increase in our average check, which includes a 2.5% benefit from our menu price increase rolled out during the quarter. Average check in the quarter was up about 5% from last year with half of this increase coming from the menu price increase and the rest of the check increase coming from catering, an increase in the group size per transaction along with additional sides such as Chips & Guac.","Our total online catering and fax orders reached an all-time high of 6% of sales in the quarter with catering adding about 1.6% of sales. Seasonally the second quarter is now strongest for catering orders as Chipotle\u2019s been a big hit at the graduation parties this time of year. So while we\u2019re pleased to see catering rise to 1.6% of the quarter, it\u2019s likely that it will taper off in the next few quarters.","Our objective in raising prices was to pass along some of the inflation we absorbed over the past three years while continuing to charge fair prices in order to remain accessible or affordable to our loyal customers. We thought a very thorough process and reviewed our menu prices on a market-by-market and item-by-item basis, compared ourselves to local competitors in each market and considered the amount of actual and expected inflation for each of our ingredients and other factors such as the cost of doing business in each market. Because we rolled the price increase throughout the quarter starting in late April and finishing in late June, the effective price increase of 2.5% in the quarter reflects only a partial impact. The actual average increase was about 6.25% to 6.5%, based on the assumption of little or no trade down or resistance. Though the average increase was 6.25% to 6.5%, the increase varied by market and by menu item.","So for example, because of the significant recent inflation in beef and expectation that beef prices will remain elevated for the foreseeable price, steak prices were raised by about 9% on average, while chicken prices were only raised about 5%. We expected some customers would trade down from steak to chicken as a result of a higher steak premium and we have in fact seen some customers shift from steak to chicken. Aside from the slight shift from steak to chicken, our customers have generally responded well so far, but it is early and we\u2019ll continue to watch for resistance in terms of fewer customer visits as well as customers trading down.","We\u2019re pleased to see our strong underlying sales momentum continue into July. The comparisons are tougher in the second half of the year as we compare two comps of 6.2% and 9.3% for the third and fourth quarters respectively. So we expect our underlying transaction comps be lower in the third quarter and fourth quarter because of these tougher comparisons. But assuming we experience little or no price resistance, we still expect comps well into the teens for the rest of this year. As a result, we\u2019re raising our comp guidance and now expect our sales comp to be in the mid-teens for the full year.","We opened 45 new restaurants in the quarter and 89 for the year so far, which brings our total company wide restaurants to 1681 at the end of Q2. We still expect to open between a 180 and 195 restaurants for the full year as our development pipeline continues to look very solid and we continue to see an uptick in new construction with about 54% of our mix being in new construction in 2014 versus just 43% last year during 2013, and that\u2019s helping our real estate team to find attractive new locations.","Our new restaurants continue to perform well very and as a result we now expect opening sales volumes in the $1.7 million to $1.8 million range, which is up from previous range of $1.6 million to $1.7 million. These new restaurants opening volumes along with our current count trends and strong margins allow us to strengthen our already industry leading unit economics and returns.","Restaurant level margins for the quarter were 27.3% or a decrease of 30 basis points from last year, and year-to-date margins were 26.7%, which also decreased by 30 basis points. Higher food cost and higher marketing cost more than offset favorable sales leverage in labor and occupancy lines for both the quarter and for the year.","Our food cost in the second quarter up 10 basis points sequentially from Q1 as the menu price increase had the effect of reducing our food cost by about 80 basis points in the quarter. Despite the menu price increase, our food cost were 150 basis points higher than Q2 of last year due to higher cost for our beef, avocados and dairy.","Sale prices leveled off a day after peaking in April and May, but they remain at an elevated level compared to last year or 20% higher due to limited supply from some of the smallest herd sizes in over 60 years while demand for beef remains high. So we expect elevated steak and barbacoa price to continue for the foreseeable future. The net food cost for 34.5% which is up 150 basis points from last year. We expect underlying food cost before the benefit of the menu price increase to remain pretty stable over the next two quarters. But since the next two quarters will benefit from the entire menu price increase, food costs should be about 100 to 130 basis points lower than in Q2, depending on the effect of any product mix shifts.","Labor costs were 21.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 90 basis points from last year and year-to-date labor costs were down 80 basis points. Labor leverage was driven by higher sales volumes, partially offset by stronger management and crew staffing ratios, which contributed to some labor efficiencies along with normal wage inflation. Occupancy cost declined 50 basis points from last year for both the quarter and the year due to favorable sales leverage. Other operating costs increased 40 basis points from last year from higher marketing promo and fund raiser costs. Marketing cost increased to 2% of sales in the quarter, compared to about 1.5% last year, and combined promo and fund raiser costs were about 20 basis points. ","We expect marketing to be about 1.6% overall for 2014 and will remain elected in the third quarter as we continue our better ingredients advertising campaign across the country in over 30 markets and 1000 restaurants. The campaign will wrap up in most markets by October and will help customers understand that the use of sustainably raised high quality ingredients, which are prepared with care result in a more wholesome and better tasting meal. Other marketing events will also include our Cultivate festivals that will be held in Minneapolis in August and Dallas in October.","In the quarter, G&A was 7.1% of revenue, higher than last year by 90 basis points. The increase was primarily due to higher non-cash, non-economic stock based compensation expense and to a lesser extent from higher bonus cost. Stock comp was about $34 million which is up $15 million from last year, a small portion of which is in the labor line. The increase over last year is due mostly from higher stock price along with more of the senior management team qualifying for retirement, which accelerates the expense recognition.","The second quarter also includes a catch-up for long-term incentive performance shares of about $1.6 million. These performance shares which were issued in 2013, by now expected to be fully realized during the earn-out period based up our strong financial performance to day and where we project to finish at the end of the three-year measurement period. As a perspective, our underlying G&A without the stock comp was relatively flat at 4.1% in Q2 of this year compared to 4% last year. G&A costs for the first six months of 2014 were 7.3% of revenue, an increase of 110 basis points, and again was primarily due to the higher non-cash, non-economic stock based compensation expense and to a lesser extent from higher bonus cost.","Year-to-date non-cash stock comp was $62 million, which is up $27 million from last year, and again the increase over the last year was mostly due to a higher stock price and more of the senior management team qualifying for retirement. Stock comp is still expected to be around $98 million for the full year, which means it will decline significantly over the next two quarters. As a result, although G&A year-to-date is 7.3%, we expect to finish the full year under 7% of sales. The third quarter will include our biennial All Manager Conference event, which will cost about $9 million and will include around 2500 Chipotle employees, including all of our GMs and all of restaurateurs.","Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 39.1% for the full year and we expect the rate to also be around 39.1% and that compares to the 38.7% rate in 2013. This rate increase is the result of the expiration of the work opportunity tax credit and the R&D credit that benefited us in 2013 and is partially offset by a lower estimated state tax rate. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $3.50, an increase of 24.1% from last year, but our underlying economic earnings growth is stronger than implied in EPS growth as our net cash provided from operating activities grew by 35%. And of course of earnings growth potential is even greater considering we have absorbed three years of food cost inflation, while less than half of the recent menu price increase has flowed through in the current quarter. So we're pleased that our business model is stronger than it\u2019s even been and we continue to have the ability to add significant additional shareholder value in the future.","During the quarter, we repurchased over $37 million of our stock or over 72,000 shares at an average share price $517. This is more than triple the number of shares purchased in the first quarter as we were opportunistic when the share price declined early in the quarter.","At the end of the second quarter we had nearly a $140 million less than our share buyback program previously approved by our board. And over the past five years we\u2019ve invested over $650 million and purchase over 4.1 million shares at an overall average price at about $159 a share. We finished the second quarter with over $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents along with short and long term interest bearing investments and no debt on our balance sheet. We continue to believe that the best use of our cash is to invest in our high returning restaurants and we\u2019ll continue to develop additional growth options by planting seeds including ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale and Chipotle outside of the U.S. and we expect each of these proceeds will provide attractive value enhancing growth investments in the future. In the meantime we\u2019ll continue to optimistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today and at this time we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Joseph Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","I guess the question about the transaction can increase being so strong, I know a couple of quarters ago you spoke about new diagnostic tools to help the multi-year supervisors analyze restaurants and help the managers become restaurateurs faster. Is that kicking in in a significant way, or are there other factors that you'd point to when you look at the tremendous transaction growth?","Steve Ells","","Thanks Jo. I\u2019d say it is kicking in, in the sense that when -- if you look at my opening comments, I talked about how a number of things are moving throughput and as we always say that the most powerful thing we\u2019re doing to move throughput along is just having more restaurateur teams and more teams of really top performing teams that were super-super empowered and so that\u2019s kind of number one. I would say that the restaurateur diagnostic tool that we rolled out is one of the very powerful tools that's helping our field leaders connect very directly with managers and helping those managers understand very clearly what they need to do in order to develop those teams with top performers that are very, very empowered.","So the teams in our restaurants are getting stronger as a result of that tool and are much more aware of what the opportunities are for them and as they build stronger teams, that's the number one thing adds horsepower to our ability to generate great throughput. But on top of that, we continue also Jo to measure the incidents by which we\u2019re achieving the four pillars of throughput in our restaurants. So we have reports to go out to our field leadership that let them know how their batch of restaurants is doing in terms of achieving the four pillars. And that continuous measurement and awareness on the part of our field leadership has really helped them to continue to move the needle on transactions. So I would say those two things are the things that have helped us the most in continuing to improve and feed up in terms of that very important aspect of our customer service.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Is your peak hour throughput at all-time record levels now?","Steve Ells","","Yes, it is. We\u2019re the fastest we've ever been at lunch time and at dinner time but the average throughout the entire day are speeding up as well. So we always talk about lunch and dinner because that\u2019s the time that it\u2019s hardest to speed up but the reality is the percentage comp that we\u2019re getting at the other times of day that aren\u2019t peak lunch and aren\u2019t peak dinner are actually better. So during the shoulder hours, after lunch and so forth, we\u2019re actually getting a better comp than our comp during those periods of time, but we\u2019re very pleased that lunch and dinner are still moving on at a clip that's very near our overall comp.","Operator","","We\u2019ll take our next question John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","","If the question was on advertising and promotion; firstly if you think you have the optimal spend or it might be a potential for you spend more money in the future -- it's hard to imagine but you get an even bigger sales lift than what you\u2019re currently getting. And that's a question not just in terms of the awareness of what makes Chipotle special differentiated to your existing customer but how big of a addressable customer market do you see out there that currently maybe hasn\u2019t experienced Chipotle, which presumably might do so under the influence of marketing.","Steve Ells","","John, we have our Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker here today who can answer that question directly.","Mark Crumpacker","Sure John. With regard to the marketing spend, I think it\u2019s pretty well optimized but our marketing doesn\u2019t rely on typical promotions and new menu items like most fast food restaurants do. So the type of advertising that we do is just top of mind awareness which we do at about 34 of our main markets around the country and that\u2019s done through billboards and radio ads and there's really only still much of that type advertising that\u2019s needed to raise the awareness to the level that we want.","The real heart of our advertising lies in the other activities which are our local marketing program which are getting people into the restaurants through fund raisers and our cultivated better world marketing, which is where we\u2019re really connecting with people on a more emotional level that really creates long term brand value.","So we really like the balance that we have between those things with regard to the spend. To answer the second part of your question, we think there is a big market of people that have not either been to Chipotle or don\u2019t come to Chipotle regularly. When we do our research, we find -- it always surprises us because the brand enjoys really high general awareness. We're always surprised at how few people really are regular customers and so there is a tremendous amount of upside for us but as I mentioned earlier our strongest marketing is the type that connects with people emotionally and so we're going to continue to invest in the type that we think is going to create word of mouth, so that one customer tells their friends and so on and so forth and that we really think is the best approach.","Operator","","We will go next to Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Just following up on that theme there, I was curious if you guys could share with us how your demographic has changed over the last several years across age and many other relevant metric and just along the same lines, getting to John\u2019s question, I\u2019m just curious if you guys have an accurate read on our frequency trends from some of these core guests? Are they doubling down on their visitation? How should we think about again some of the heart of that traffic increase over the last couple of quarters?","Steve Ells","","Well, with regards to our demographic, we haven\u2019t seen a large shift. At Chipotle of course, we have a very, very wide range of folks that come in to the restaurant. One thing that I have noticed in the research lately is that we've had an improvement in the team market across all different economic backgrounds. So we have strengthened and are actually according to our Piper Jaffray survey, the most popular brand with male teams, which is up from the same quarter a year ago. So of course we are really happy about that because those young kids become lifelong customers and they bring their kids and their parents and their friends and their parents to the restaurants as well.","What was the second part of your question?","Jeff Farmer \u2013 Wells Fargo","I am sorry, read on frequency in terms of core customer. What that's looked like over the last several years if you're seeing that number increase pretty materially?","Steve Ells","","Actually we haven\u2019t seen a huge increase in frequency of our core customer. What we have seen is increase in the types of customers that are coming in as I mentioned earlier. We are doing better with the team market. And we think what\u2019s happening is we're actually just expanding our customer base overall and I can\u2019t contribute to significant increase in frequency from a core audience.","Operator","","We take our next question from Jeffery Bernstein from Barclays.","Jeffery Bernstein - Barclays","","Just a question as we think about the units and talking about the strong pipeline in \u201914, I think you said 70% of those units are going to be proven markets. Just wondering as you think out, now that we're more than halfway through \u201914, as you look to \u201915, it sounds like that pipeline continues. I\u2019m wondering whether as you look at it, what the limitation might be or if there is none at all? Obviously you want to maintain a steady pace but I\u2019m just wondering whether people or real estate that would be the gating factors just as you consider, the strong acceleration and traffic trends that we have seen?","Steve Ells","","Well, yes. Those are both the gating factors and we actually talk about it more than you would imagine in terms of which might be the gating factor and I think that we feel really good about that type of real estate we're seeing out there. Like Jack said we were staying at 53% to 54% of our restaurants are now in new construction and that number has been ticking up over the last I would say prior eight to 12 quarters. And that enables us to find more real estate. And that being said, there is more competition for some of those new sites that are coming out and so that's something that we're always watching. But I think another thing that we keep finding is -- and we found this to our A model strategy but we find it now as well, is that Chipotle is welcome more places, in more locations than we ever would have though before and so we are able to take a little bit more risk in going into some trade areas that are a little bit off the beaten path.","And so when we look in the outer years, I think we are at a higher confidence level than we have ever been in terms of Chipotle\u2019s ability to be successful in all of the markets throughout the country and beyond, even places where -- that just weren\u2019t on our radar screen a few years ago, some of which I mentioned in my opening comments as some of our new markets for the next year, excuse me, for this year and the next year.","So, we are able to go further and further afield, and of course, that brings up the issue about how we're doing on the people pipeline and right now our ratios of field leaders to restaurants is lower than it's been before and what I mean is that each field leader has fewer restaurants they're overseeing. I think for a while our field leaders got stretched a little thin and now we've reversed that trend by promoting a lot of people from within and also hiring some others on to that team and so that\u2019s been I think a good move which is helping get more attention to the development of managers from crew positions who will be able to help carry us forward. So it\u2019s a constant struggle to make sure that we're pushing forward responsibly on the development of leadership which we're always doing as best we can and also sort of pushing to find the very best real estate we can, but not pushing so hard that we would compromise our standards in terms of the type of restaurants we like to open.","But I think given the new unit volumes that Jack referenced in his opening comments, those new store opening volumes are very, very impressive, higher than they've ever been. And that gives us -- that along with the kind of teams we're seeing in our restaurants gives us confidence that we're developing Chipotle and opening new restaurants at a very responsible pace. So while we won\u2019t say what we're going to do in the outer years yet, we feel very optimistic about our chances of continuing to build growth in a very strong way.","Operator","","We will take our next question from Sara Senatore from Sanford.","Sara Senatore - Sanford","","I just have a couple of follow-ups. The first is on sort of thinking through the comps. You talked about some of the marketing and clearly I think the catering and also obviously throughput. So people are coming because the lines are shorter. But one of the things that I think we heard from Jack is this idea that it's compared to a tougher sales momentum. Adjusted for that we wouldn\u2019t expect transaction comps to be the same. I think we have kind of heard something similar in many of the recent quarters and I'm just trying to understand if it\u2019s kind of natural conservatism or if we should be thinking about a driver that is somehow different in the coming quarters versus what we have seen really accelerate traffic in recent quarters, be it marketing or may be the ability to just improve throughput, maybe it gets somewhat diminished. So, just trying to understand if you could drill down a little bit more into the transactions and how to think about them?","Steve Ells","","Yes, I will start with the last part of your question where you said -- where you sort of made this assumption that the gains and throughput might diminish over time. I tell you, I don\u2019t accept that as being something that\u2019s going to be true in the near or even medium term, perhaps not even in the long term. And we've been able to continue to improve throughput now consistently and I think that as I said earlier in response to your question, the things that drive throughput the most are more restaurateur teams and better teams in the restaurant and also really measuring and teaching our field leadership about which aspect of the four pillars of throughput they might be missing out on.","So, I think there is a lot of room to grow that and one thing that gives me confidence about that is when we measure our 15 minute transaction counts, that which we can achieve in our restaurants during a 15 minute period rather than a whole hour, that number is higher. If you multiply that times four to cover a whole hour it\u2019s much higher than our average throughput number is, which shows that every restaurant basically has a skill to deliver throughput at a much higher level than they are currently doing. And so the fact that our restaurants have that skill and the fact we continue to see those numbers increase makes me confident that throughput is something we can improve on for a long, long, long time but that\u2019s only one aspect of what makes up our comp and certainly an important one but you mentioned other things, catering, marketing. May be Jack can talk about the rest of your question.","Jack Hartung","","So, I think the essence of your question is, is our comp forecast too conservative because we're saying that we would expect the underlying transaction to decline as we go up against tougher comparisons in the next two quarters. The challenge with predicting what our sales are going to be, what are transactions are going to in the future, is as Mark mentioned we don\u2019t have things like limited time only. We don\u2019t have special promotions. We don\u2019t have new products. So we don\u2019t have anything that we say okay, in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter, we're going to do something, some kind of a gimmick or some kind of marketing emphasis to try to get people in. So we would tell you that we'll continue the momentum. And we don\u2019t spend a ton of time, I will tell you, trying to predict what the sales are going to be. We spend most of our time trying to engage with our customers, trying build the strongest teams we can to create empowered cultures in our restaurants, so that when marketing encourages people to come in to restaurant, when a friend say hey, you ought to try Chipotle and when new customers show up at Chipotle, that they have an extraordinary experience and if that happens they are more likely to come back.","Now, I hope that we end up talking a quarter or two from now and we look back and say, yes, it turns out it was conservative. But for us to say that we will continue momentum on top of the 6.2% in the third quarter, the 9 point something percent in the fourth quarter would be difficult to do at this time. But it\u2019s more of a math challenge because of the way we do our business than anything.","Sara Senatore - Sanford","Okay, and just, what if I could throw in one question about ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. Does the fact that your core Chipotle business is so strong and you are working so hard to get the right people in place, does that have any impact on your ability to grow those or if they can all be kind of grown at the appropriate pace at the same time?","Steve Ells","","It really doesn\u2019t impact our ability to grow the teams at those restaurants. When we opened the first ShopHouse and subsequent ShopHouses, we did initially seed them with some of our very talented restaurateurs and crew from Chipotle. But really most of those people hired as brand new employees to ShopHouse other than a few of the top management people. The same is true with Pizzeria Locale. It\u2019s a group of people who, for the most part have never worked at Chipotle. And so these concepts like Chipotle Europe as well are all seeded initially with a few Chipotle people but really are growing it completely in an organic fashion, all striving towards that restaurateur culture and all trying to hire top performers who they believe can be the future of their restaurants.","So, you can look at every single restaurant we opened. Each and every one is a potential sort of people thump to create leadership for the rest of the organization and so growing more restaurants really doesn\u2019t diminish the amount of leaders we have but gives yet another opportunity to increase the amount of leadership we can choose from.","Operator","","We will take our next question from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Company.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company","","Jack, you talked about the opportunity to accelerate EPS growth as the pricing, the full effect of the price increase rolls in starting in the third quarter. You\u2019ve got a bit less than half of the benefit from your pricing rollout this quarter. Obviously, you start getting the full benefit starting in the third quarter. And you talked a little bit about the food margin dynamic. I think you said 100 basis points or more benefit in the third quarter versus the second quarter. But can you just walk us through the other line items within the four walls? And as we think about the 27% restaurant margin you put up this quarter, maybe you can help us craft and understand how that changes as the full effect takes place starting this quarter?","Jack Hartung","Yes, it depends Brian on if we see any resistance. So if we see any resistance in fewer customers coming or if we see customers trade down, where they're not buying as many sides, now buying as many drinks, not buying Chips & Guac. So far we're pleased with what we\u2019ve seen. We haven\u2019t seen much trade down. We\u2019ve seen -- in my prepared comments I talked about the fact that we\u2019re seeing some -- a slight shift from stake to chicken. But if that continues, we still have another -- I guess it\u2019s between 3.75% and 4% additional effects of the menu price increase.","So if there is no more trade down and let\u2019s say at that 3.75%, you could see another 250 basis points, maybe 275 basis points in additional margin. So if you take all the rest of the line items, you could see some significant additional margin. I mentioned in just the food alone. But the rest of the P&L is leverageable as well as the rest of the menu price increase flows through.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company","So not to be overly bullish here, but you do see an opportunity in the past to get to 30% restaurant margins, sometime in the second half, possibly by 2015?","Jack Hartung","If all goes well. Right now our projection is that we\u2019re not going to see much more food inflation that we're not going to see much more in terms of trade down, either loss transactions or trade down because of the price increase. And so if we don\u2019t see anything unusual that happens over the next few quarters, yes, just the pure math of allowing that price increase flow through is going to push us up close to if not at 30%. That\u2019s definitely a distinct possibility.","Operator","We will take our next question from David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ","My question is really about some of the commentary you made earlier on the unit growth and Monty, I think you mentioned that you are finding new places that you never considered going in the past that are working now. So I was wondering if you\u2019ve given any recent thought to what the long-term unit opportunity for the Chipotle in the U.S. is? I now you had stated some goals around the time of the IPO, but it sounds like you might be thinking something higher than that at this stage.","Monty Moran","Yeah, David, afraid to bore you with my answer because you've heard it before. It really hasn\u2019t changed much and that is that given the numbers we came up with, just extrapolating from how we view the top 150 metropolitan statistical areas even at the time of the IPO, those numbers get pretty quickly up in that sort of 104,000 sort of restaurants. And we do believe that we can build a lot of restaurants in the market that weren\u2019t on that top 150 metropolitan statistical areas that we started to do so. But we don\u2019t spend a lot of time modelling exactly how many there could be because that number of 4,000 plus restaurants, that\u2019s a number we guided towards this year of 180 to 195. That's sort of 15 to 20 years out. So obviously there is a lot of room for growing at that pace before we\u2019d ever get near that number. But I would tell you that I have a level of confidence without having going out and done a study as to whether that number is another 500 or another 1,000 more than we used to think it was. I think we that we have a lot of confidence that as we approach -- as we get closer and closer to that number that will be a moving target because the acceptance of Chipotle\u2019s brand has exceeded all of our expectations and I would say that in terms of -- if you look at some of the markets that we used to call developing markets and in fact the markets that we even thought were failing markets to be quite honest like California some years ago, California went from a developing market to a never mind we won\u2019t build in California market and then overnight became a proven market and now is the state in which we have more stories than any others -- far more stores than any other state and it kind of feels like shooting fish in a barrel. We seem not to be able to miss in California. ","So that surprise was wonderful. But we\u2019ve seen that same thing happen in a lot of other markets throughout the country that used to be relatively weak for us, markets like Indianapolis and some of the markets in Ohio that are now on fire that we used to think were mediocre and in Indianapolis where we now have better than average unit volume restaurants which was something that we used to think was not really working for us because among other things Qdoba had gotten there many years before us and had quite a few restaurants before we put our first. And so it's just every market that we\u2019ve been concerned about historically has with the passage of some time and often not much time become a market that not only aren\u2019t we concerned about but becomes market that becomes a huge development market for us and obviously Californian being the most powerful example but there are dozens of others.","So rather than model exactly how many restaurants that can be, we derive huge confidence in going into these markets that used to be developing markets and just hitting the ball out the park and having great volumes markets, like Philadelphia I\u2019m just thinking, where we went in sort of a little nervous at first and now doing really, really, really well. So, yes we feel good about where we\u2019re going and we don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything in our way in terms of being able to grow at a sensible but also speedy pace over these next years and we\u2019re excited about what we can accomplish.","Operator","","We\u2019ll take our next question from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","","I was hoping you could touch on the new formats or format that you have, the opportunity to open some equipment improvement you\u2019re making, lead certifications, things of that that nature. I\u2019m trying to understand if you view those as defensive maintenance like investments or if potentially there's a consumer facing nature to those investments and maybe that\u2019s also helping drive traffic. Can you help us think about that please?","Jack Hartung","","Nicole, this is Jack. So when you say new formats, can you clarify what you mean by that?","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","","For a while now you could have a smaller format, different configurations, upgrades, things of that nature.","Jack Hartung","","You mean like a model?","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","","Yes.","Jack Hartung","","We\u2019re giving a lot of thought to that and I think one thing that\u2019s generated some of those thoughts is some of the higher occupancy costs that we see in Europe and how it may be prudent for us to try to take some much smaller pieces of real estate in France or England where the occupancy cost is super, super high. And we\u2019re looking at some sites right now in the United States as well where these stores would be really, really, really small and where we\u2019d very-very seating and I think that there\u2019s a number of reasons why we think that that is a good idea, one of which is that, whereas we used to be mostly a dine-in restaurant 14 years ago, and I'd say about eight years ago we were 50-50 dine-in, take-out, now we\u2019re about two thirds take out.","So I think that the seating component of what we do has become a little less important as more people know who we are and also we\u2019re more comfortable with it now, now that the brand has been more established. So we aren\u2019t as worried about -- we aren\u2019t as concerned about someone coming in and not getting \u2018the full Chipotle dining experience\u2019 of being part of the restaurant atmosphere.","So, we feel good about the idea of going out and building some really, really small scrappy restaurants and we will continue to experiment with that in the future and see how those might give us yet another way to grow sensibly and quickly in some of our markets where other real estate proves difficult to find.","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","","And then just kind of as a follow up or a part B, maybe just to clarify the other part of my question is do you get credit; for example having a lead certification. I\u2019m just picking out one thing but much like food with integrity, do you see building with integrity as something that\u2019s influencing customers that you could point to and say we see this as something that they care in helping us drive trends. Is it something that shows up yet?","Monty Moran","","Not really. I think that we do a lot of these things, from food with integrity to the way we think about -- the way we build our buildings and to the way we think about just doing the right thing by way of our people culture and the way we select our leaders for our company. All of these things are things we do because we know that they\u2019re the right thing to do. Food with integrity was something we put a lot of effort, a lot of investment, lot of passion into, way before there was any evidence that anyone cared about it -- or was it a majority of people cared about. And I think that to the extent we got research back from our marketing team, it still shows that there are a whole bunch of people, probably the majority of people who come to Chipotle who, while they might think it\u2019s nice to have, it\u2019s not central to their decision to eat with us. But this is why our marketing team has worked so hard I think to just start to celebrate some of these points of differentiation and start to generate more and more conversations about where Chipotle\u2019s going, and what we\u2019re doing differently than other companies.","And so while we don\u2019t get credit on any given -- I don\u2019t think on any given day for all of a sudden, hey they\u2019re doing great with lead certification, they\u2019re building their buildings more carefully and even food with integrity. We think it\u2019s the right thing to do and we think as people get to know us in a deeper and deeper way and our marketing team\u2019s done a great job of accomplishing that, it\u2019ll be something that either causes more word of mouth about Chipotle, which will lead to additional visits or will just delight some of the people who have already loved Chipotle because it tastes good and they think it\u2019s a good deal. As they find out that we\u2019re doing things that are really special, it will just generate even more loyalty from them and even more excitement when they talk to other people who maybe haven\u2019t tried Chipotle before.","So I would say we don\u2019t do any of those things because we think it drives immediate benefit to us in terms of sales. I think we do them because they\u2019re the right thing to do and I think we\u2019re getting better and better at having Chipotle and our core values understood more broadly and as that happens I think that we will see more and more people coming to us for that reason.","Operator","","And we will take our final question from Jason Left with Deutsche Bank.","Jason Left - Deutsche Bank","","Just a couple of cost related questions, first with some of the shifting of the beef supply overseas, can you talk about how that may affect your cost structure on the food side and there\u2019s more products that you\u2019re looking at to move to international markets and then secondly on the outlook for incentive comp, if we should be planning for that to be somewhat different next year in a way that\u2019s structured at maybe lot lower costs or is it too early to say on that?","Monty Moran","No, I think what we're really doing on the beef side of things just trying to get the right beef into our restaurants that we feel good about from the Food With Integrity standpoint and the move that Steve discussed during his opening remarks with regard to getting an amount of Australian grass-fed beef as they move towards sustaining and increasing our ability to have beef that we\u2019re very, very proud of in light of not being able to enough that meets our protocol domestically. So it is not going to cost more at this point if there is not increase cost from that. So we would not suspect that'd be something that would give us pressure.","Jack Hartung","And Jason on the comp for the next year, our comp, that\u2019s in hands of our comp committee. They have been meeting to consider the vote from last year and what they would like to do with that. So that\u2019s in their hands. So nothing to report at this time.","Alex Spong","All right, thanks everyone. We have exceeded our time for the call but we appreciate and thank you for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you net quarter.","Monty Moran","Thanks very much.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Total sales grew 8.3% to $1.27 billion, driven by comparable sales of 3.3% and 34 new restaurants opened in the quarter. This positive comparable sales trajectory enabled us to expand restaurant level margins, which were up 90 basis points year-over-year to 19.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew nearly 24% to $2.87 and our GAAP earnings were $1.68.","While Jack will go through the financials in more detail shortly, I'd like to put these results into context by discussing how the work our 70,000 employees do every day contributed to these financial outcomes.","Last month, we shared with you that we would execute our strategy to win today and cultivate the future by focusing on these five areas: becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model and building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience.","Today, I'll focus on how innovation in digital and access and how improving our operations contributed to this quarter's results. Let me begin with operations. We know that strong sales growth and margins are dependent on great operations, which is the hallmark of any healthy brand. This brand was founded on outstanding operations and real food. We're getting back to our roots.","When we have the right people leading the right teams and when those teams are well trained and operating with confidence, they execute great guest experiences. It takes time to build a culture of accountability and I'm pleased that we're seeing some encouraging signs of progress in key areas; namely our restaurant AB scores, a measurement system we implemented 1.5 years ago to drive greater accountability is trending in the right direction.","We are doing a better job staffing our restaurants to match sales volumes and we have lower year-over-year hourly turnover, which tells us we are making progress on training and building great teams.","Additionally, we have seen a meaningful decline in guest complaints and with that our guest satisfaction scores have improved since we started measuring them last year. This tells us that we made progress and that our guests are noticing the difference.","We know that when the food is delicious, the field of the restaurant is great and we removed the friction from the flow of the order process, no matter the channel we delight customers.","While I'm encouraged by our progress, we still have a lot of work to do. We have an opportunity to improve through-put, consistent execution of great food and consistent delivery of a great atmosphere. I'll outline some of the initiatives underway to address those opportunities.","We are halfway through our Big Fix initiative, which is designed to bring our restaurants back up to standards and make them uniquely Chipotle. This not only improves the guest experience as the appearance of our restaurants is clean and well-maintained for every guest, but the team member experience improves as well.","We overhauled our training materials several months ago and have retrained three quarters of our field leaders through Cultivate University. That's an in-restaurant and in-classroom one week training session that we launched in April, that investment in the ongoing development of our field leadership continue to drive crew member engagement.","We are supplementing that training with a new hospitality training program in the restaurants and we are in the early innings of refining our training to teach and taste the details, so that we achieve the winning combination of great food, feel and flow with every guest experience. We are zeroing in on how to get back to great through-put as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value.","Late last year, we rolled out what we call the owner's path, a comprehensive review of our restaurants performance, equipping our field leaders with these tools improving their powers of observation and allowing them to focus on the critical details of delivering improved guest experience.","In addition, the tool creates teaching moments for their general managers and documents the corrective actions are taken when needed. We are currently rolling out a digital version for mobile phones and tablets of this previous paper-based tool, that should result in more consistent operations across our restaurants. We'll have this in place nationally by October.","We're also in the process of redesigning our forecasting and labor scheduling tool. This is significant undertaking, but necessary for us to have accurate sales forecasting and deliver the right amount of labor at the right time to meet the needs of our guests. The new tool will have a best-in-class sales forecasting component that will leverage machine learning to remove the guesswork of determining sales and labor needs for our business.","In addition, our team members will have the ability to see their schedules remotely and swap shifts from mobile phones, taking these tasks out of the hands of the manager. We believe leveraging technology such as this makes us a more desirable employer as we work to create a better experience for our crew members. We will continue to make investments in our restaurants because a better experience for our team members directly translates to a better experience for our guests.","I'd also like to talk to you about the progress we are making around the innovation in digital and access, as this was a real bright spot in the quarter. Today, our annualized digital sales are approximately $0.5 billion, and we are in the early stages of this multi-billion dollar opportunity. Our digital sales grew 33% in the quarter and now account for 10.3% of sales, an acceleration from 20% growth in the first quarter.","We now have 4 million active monthly users across our app and our website, a 65% increase since the end of last year. Delivery in group occasions were particularly strong this quarter. Delivery sales quadrupled in the quarter and we know from our customer research that improving access to Chipotle is an important growth lever, whether it be through adding more restaurants or enabling more convenience, like delivery.","Today, delivery is available from 1,700 restaurants and we expect that to reach 2,000 restaurants by year-end. We're also pleased that delivery is now an option available directly from our app.","Our group ordering business was solid in the seasonally strong quarter for catering orders. In mid-July, we expanded our Build-Your-Own catering offer nationally, whereby we lowered the minimum size and offered more price tiers for group orders, therefore expanding access for more occasions. We tested this enhancement earlier in the year and found that group order sales in our test stores outperformed the base by mid to high single digits. Delivery availability for catering expanded to two-thirds of our restaurants in the quarter.","As I've mentioned, Chipotle's second make-line enables the business to handle the incremental growth without any impact on throughput or the in-restaurant experience. I'm happy to see progress on digitizing our second make-lines, which are now in roughly 500 restaurants. We are targeting approximately 1,000 restaurants to be enabled with the digital second make-line by year-end and we are accelerating our rollout to reach completion by the end of 2019. These digital second make-lines have a direct positive impact on the team member and guest experience.","Also, the digital pickup shelf test in several New York City restaurants continues to show great promise and based on the results to-date, we will be expanding the test to a larger number of restaurants in several markets next month.","We've mentioned before that we are undertaking a wide-ranging consumer research project, with the results available this fall. I did, however, want to mention a few interesting highlights that we've uncovered so far. Access is the number one lever we can pull to drive sales, which supports our new unit growth as well as the innovation focus around access via our digital channels.","Additionally, we sit at an interesting intersection between fast food and fast casual, with many attributes such as value and speed that are typically associated with fast food and attributes such as quality and freshness, which are typically associated with fast casual.","We're particularly strong with Millennial and Generation Z customers relative to most brands and when these groups try us, our odds of repeat visits are much higher. These early insights give us confidence that new news and the more engaging marketing that you're beginning to see will allow us to drive transaction growth.","Also, I'm pleased with the speed at which we're getting transaction-driving initiatives across digital, access, loyalty and menu into test markets. The combination of these test markets and our early insights from our consumer research will inform our plans in 2019 and beyond.","Before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the country that are working diligently to serve our guests real food, cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients just the way our guests like it. This hard work is the basis for all of our future success and we appreciate it tremendously.","Now over to you, Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. I'm really pleased that our team is focused on our five strategic priorities, has contributed to a high quality quarter with comp sales of 3.3% and a 19.7% restaurant level margin. And underlying earnings were also strong after adjusting for a number of unusual costs during the quarter.","As we discussed on our call last month, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures. These charges also have a temporary impact on our tax rate, which I'll talk about in more detail later.","We generated revenue of $1.27 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.3% from last year, on comp sales growth of 3.3%. That's on top of last year's strong 8.1% Q2 comp sales increase. Restaurant level margins of 19.7% expanded 90 basis points from last year and normalized earnings per share adjusted for the unusual items was $2.87. The second quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to the transformation and that negatively impacted EPS by about $1.19, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $1.68.","In Q2, we expensed about $25 million in expenses related to restaurant asset write-offs, approximately $16.5 million related to office closures and $7 million related to the restructure of our organization and other unusual expenses. These charges were offset by a non-recurring benefit of about $6.5 million related to lower stock comp expense as a result of the restructure. As a result of these transformation expenses, our tax rate increased about 400 basis points, which I'll explain later.","The Q2 comp at 3.3% was primarily driven by higher average check due to the price increases taken over the last year as well as queso add-ons. The price increase average about 4% in the quarter and customer resistance to the price increase remains at or below 20%. The menu price impact was lower than Q1, as we lapped the first increase from April of last year in about 20% of the restaurants.","Sales trends in the first three weeks of July continue to mirror what we saw in Q2 with the comp increasing over the last week or so, as we've begun to compare against those softer trends from last year. So overall, comps should improve from the 3.3% in Q2.","However, keep in mind, that comparisons will get tougher later in Q3, as we lap the introduction of queso in early September, which initially added about 3.5% to the comp, before settling into a sustained benefit to the average check of about 2%. And in November, we will lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants, which added an additional 1.3% pro-rated impact to the comp.","Based on second quarter results and expected improvement in the Q3 comp, we're increasing our full-year comp sales guidance from low single-digits to a low to mid single-digit comp range.","We opened 34 new restaurants in the quarter and expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new opening guidance for the full-year. While we're still building inventory for next year's openings, we continue to expect 2019 openings will be at or above the 2018 levels. Our new restaurants this year have opened strong and we're continuing to emphasize high quality, high returning to restaurants as we build out our pipeline.","As mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants; and today, we're closing 29 Chipotle restaurants. During the second quarter, we closed five Pizzeria Locale in Kansas and Ohio and we also closed three Chipotle restaurants including one relocation. So, today's closures about half of the underperforming restaurants have now closed.","Food comps for the quarter were 32.6%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the 34.1% in Q2 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and more favorable avocado prices. The decreases were slightly offset by elevated prices for our steak and barbacoa.","We expect food cost to increase to the low 33% range in Q3, due to the seasonal shift to source higher cost avocados from California and an uptick in paper and packaging costs. We expect to be closer to the 33% in Q4, as we begin to shift the supply of avocados back to Mexico.","Labor costs for the quarter were 27%, an increase of 80 basis points from the 26.2% in Q2 of last year. The increase from last year was driven primarily from wage inflation of about 6% and increased restaurant manager bonus cost as we returned to normalized bonus payouts, rewarding our managers for delivering strong results. These increases were offset by leverage from the menu price increase.","I expect labor cost to increase to the high 27% range in Q3 and to the mid 28% range in Q4 and these increase are driven primarily by seasonally lower sales in Q3 and Q4 and by general wage pressures.","Occupancy cost for the quarter were 6.9%, which is flat with last year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.8%, a decrease of 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. Our marketing and promo cost were 3.2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 40 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. We expect marketing and promo cost to be at or slightly above 3% of sales for the full-year with elevated spending continuing in Q3 and Q4.","Other operating cost continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair cost, which we first discussed on our Q4 call and we expect M&R to continue with this elevated level for the rest of the year.","G&A in the quarter increased by $8 million compared to Q1 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to the stock comp forfeitures and the timing of the 2018 equity grant that we discussed on the last earnings call.","As I mentioned earlier, G&A also included $7 million in charges related to the restructuring and additional unusual charges in the quarter, but those were offset by a $6.5 million non-recurring benefit related to revising our estimates of forfeitures, related to stock grants from employees expected to leave the company.","G&A increase compared to Q2 of last year was primarily in support of our restaurant growth, digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field.","Depreciation expense for the quarter was 3.9%, an increase of 40 basis point from the 3.5% in Q2 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for items we're replacing were related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as capital initiatives that we described on our Q4 call.","We expect the increase related to the refresh to fall off in the second half of the year. However, it will be replaced by accelerated depreciation and restaurant closures we detailed earlier. As a result, we expect depreciation to remain at this elevated level for the rest of this year.","Our pre-tax income was $70 million and our reported effective tax rate was 33.3%. Our tax rate was higher than the 29% underlying rate we discussed on our last earnings call and is a direct result of the $42 million in unusual expenses this quarter. Without these charges, our tax rate would have been right around at 28.5% effective rate and we expect to return to a roughly 29% rate next year when the transformation charges are fully behind us.","This underlying rate of about 29% may be affected in future years by stock comp vesting and exercises when the benefit realized by our employees varies from our accounting treatment and we'll fully call out these impacts as they occur.","We continue to expect the transformation cost on the restructuring, restaurant closures and other unusual cost will total between $115 million and $135 million with most of that amount hitting in 2018.","We estimate that about $50 million to $55 million will hit in Q3 with most of the remainder in Q4. There will likely be some charges related to terminating restaurant and office leases that will spill into 2019. We'll also write-off about $10 million in deferred tax assets, beginning in Q4 with most hitting in 2019 as fully vested, but underwater options will likely expire as we complete the restructure of the organization.","In Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be right around 30.3%, or about 130 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. In Q4, we expect our tax rate to be as high as 43% or about 450 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. Both of these increases are due to a lower pre-tax income as a result of the transformation expenses.","As mentioned during our Q1 call, our Q4 rate is impacted by performance shares that will likely expire in that period, because their performance shares will only vest if the stock price is over $700. We took deductions on these performance shares over the years, but if they prove worthless, we won't get a tax benefit contributing to the estimated 43% tax rate.","We'll continue to provide more specifics on future transformation-related costs, when we have more certainty around the timing and we will continue to break out the unusual costs for normal cost you can follow the underlying trends.","We're encouraged by our second quarter results and the contributions of our restaurant teams have delivered an excellent guest experience. We're also encouraged by our guest response to our digital initiative so far along with the solid sales and restaurant-level margin performance during the quarter.","We're confident that significant changes we're making to our organization will enable us to continue to improve operational excellence in our restaurants to be more nimble and innovative in digital, access, menu and the restaurant environment and to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders.","And now, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi, thank you. Just on the 2Q, the implication is with four points of price, I think that you saw some negative traffic and I guess how do you turn that around? And, in particular, you talked about really a lot of growth in digital usage. But do you think you're substituting \u2013 just substituting from walk-in orders? Or can you actually tell that these orders are incremental? And are you starting to build a database of your customers that might allow for better targeted marketing? Thanks.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. Obviously, I think I did mention in the early remarks, a lot of our new transaction driving initiatives are getting ready to head to pilot and we also are working on some new marketing communication as well.","So, I think as those things start to enter markets and then we gain learnings on how to improve those programs and then plan for national execution, the goal is to use the stage gate process than to inform what our sales transaction performance is going to be going forward. The good news is our price increase that we passed-through has passed-through nicely.","We're not seeing customer accounts retreat versus anything we've seen historically when we take pricing. I mean regarding your question on digital sales, obviously there's multiple elements to that, right? There's the delivery aspect. There's our catering and then there's also the app or website orders. And we see varying degrees of incrementality across each of those spaces. The thing that we do know though is, when we get a digital orders through that second make-line, the economics of that order are very attractive and then our customer satisfaction scores also are very attractive.","So, we continue to see improvements on accuracy and speed at which we're getting people the food they want, when they want, where they want it. So, still a lot to learn and actually when we get the pilot going on our loyalty program, I think that's going to give us another level of insight in understanding on exactly how all these transactions are interacting with each other and that's a new skill we're going to be building for the organization going forward.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. Just maybe a clarification question on the comps for the quarter. Could you maybe explain how the trend transpired as the quarter progressed? It's not as if on the last call you might have started a little slow and then maybe picked up later in the quarter. But is that accurate? Or how should we think about that?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, David. I think that is accurate. We talked on the last call that in April because of weather and the seasonal shift of Easter that we got off to a slow start. May was a great month for us. That's when we had the DoorDash promotion, so May looked great.","And then June settled in right at about the overall average for the month, so I would say the overall comp of 3.3% is a good kind of gauge for what the underlying trend was, a little less in April more in May, but then we settled out right in the middle in June. So, we feel good about the way that we ended the quarter and how we're entering the third quarter now.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then I guess, Jack or Brian, that does suggest a little bit of underlying improvement in at least the way we look at the business on a sequential basis on traffic. So, could you maybe talk about what you think drove that improvement, whether it was the operations improvements you talked about? And then on the operations improvement, in particular, is there any sort of deeper look at that data that would suggest that's moving the needle as you kind of split the restaurants that are doing the best from the worst apart from one another?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I don't think it was just one thing. The good news is, though, as I mentioned earlier, we've seen improvement in our operations on all the key metrics. And we continue to hear more and more positive customer feedback on their experiences and fewer, or a reduction in customer complaints.","And we believe there's even more opportunity for us to get even better on throughput going forward, so we're pleased with the progress we're making on ops. We also saw in the quarter people really responded positively to the advertising that we put out there, and then obviously, we've seen very positive responses to varying elements of our digital program.","So, I think it was a combination of multiple things, not one thing that drove it and that's what has us excited about how we're moving forward with all the pilots across the business. We're making progress, I think, on ops. We're making progress on digital, and we're making progress on really understanding our customer base better. So that, look, we get the brands, the right message then with the right food at the right place with the right value. I think we'll continue to see improvement in our performance.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","(26:09-26:14) culture of accountability. Could you talk a little bit more about maybe how it's changed to work in the store day-to-day and how are you aligning that with incentives to have the employees make these changes?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Hey, Nicole, I think we missed the first part of your question. Could you just start from the beginning?","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Absolutely. Thank you. So asking about the culture of accountability, and I thought it was helpful how you talked about how that translated to the customer engagement or improved guest satisfaction. So, what I'm wondering is from the employee perspective, in that store, how is it different to work there today than before, and what are the incentives that you have put in place to keep them aligned with your culture of accountability?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. Obviously, one of the things that I think Scott has done a nice job in the field is the accountability is both on developing a great team as well as being accountable to providing a great experience for the customer.","So, I think we're starting to see our teams being more staffed correctly, engaged at another level than where they had been over the last couple years, and everybody has clarity on what their role is on the team. And I think we've talked about this in the past. But, we've given everybody their kind of top five responsibilities, which then gives the team the ability to trust that each other is going to be doing what they need to do for them to be successful.","And then to your question on incentives, yeah, we moved to some quarterly bonus programs. And we've seen that actually have a material impact on our employee satisfaction with \u2013 when they make great progress then they get rewarded much closer to when they have that success.","So, I think it's a combination really of making sure that we're holding ourselves accountable to great experience, but also holding ourselves accountable to develop a great team and then obviously rewarding them when they have successes.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And then just a final question, when you think about the structural framework previously of a $2 million AUV translating loosely to a 20% store level margin. You're doing that, yet you have over 3 percentage points of marketing that is at least twice as much as what it had been historically. So, it seems that there might be more leverage in the model. Is there any kind of framework you could give or update for us to think about as we model going forward? Thanks.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Nicole. We've also got M&R just a little high as well. So, I mean, the results we're seeing in the last couple of quarters, give us even more confidence that the model at $2 million gets you right about in that high-teens to 20% margin. And as we grow the volume from there, we think we can move back up into the 20-plus percent margin. So, the things that we thought the model can do, I think we're starting to see that they're coming to life.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good evening. Brian, you mentioned some statistics earlier about how the fast casual occasion perhaps overlaps with that of fast food in some ways with younger generations and that trial seems to be important with those consumers. I'm trying to understand, what you're seeing and saying about the opportunity there in the past?","I think Chipotle tried to get trial going coupons and the like with this understanding that if you get trial they'll come back. But how are you thinking about marketing perhaps different than that and using the data you're seeing? Thanks.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So, I think I mentioned this in our call a couple weeks ago. We've got a big foundational consumer study out and we're starting to get some top line in. And what we have definitely seen is when people try the brand and have a positive experience with it, their intent to stay with the brand is much higher than a lot of our competitors in both fast casual as well as fast food. And it's very exciting because when we look at younger people we're getting even more positive response to intent and then intent to stick with us. So, that's what I was referencing.","And in the brand obviously, I think we all instinctually see this, it is very much a purpose-driven brand that syncs up nicely with Gen Z and Millennials and we're seeing that play out in our research as well. So, we're going to want to continue to build on that strength as we move forward.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And Jack, you mentioned the restructuring expense that you expect. I know, it's not typical necessarily in the sector, but could you talk about the dollar savings you anticipate, or maybe the return on investment from these store closures and restructuring expenses and the timing of that? Any color would be helpful. Thanks.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, David. The restaurants we're closing, these are all cash flow losing restaurants. We've got about half of them closed right now. So kind of take before we can see the full effect, we're going to have them all closed. But we should pick-up somewhere in the 20 basis points, 30 basis points of margin once they're all closed. So, there's a definite improvement in our margin returns from that standpoint.","Most of the other costs that's more with restructuring the organization, they're going to be returned on that. It's not going to be as black and white or linear. The return is going to be on having a culture that's more innovative, a culture that's more results-oriented and we think there's going to be lots and lots of benefit there, but it's going to be less of a cause and effect where we can tell you what the actual return is.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Jared Garber - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, this is actually Jared on for Karen. Can you guys give us a sense of maybe delivery as a percent of your total sales at this point and maybe just some context about how delivery is contributing to stronger comp in 2Q versus 3Q?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, delivery is a piece of that 10% number that I mentioned earlier on our digital sales and what we're seeing is, today we're in 1,700 restaurants. We'll be expanding closer to 2,000 here shortly. Really, the delivery performance not surprising right now what we're seeing is it really is impacted by how we promote it, because we're in the early days of getting people to understand that it's available.","I think at the last number I saw we still have over 50% of customers not realizing Chipotle is available for delivery. So, we're seeing some variability in the delivery performance based on how we promote with these partners. The thing that is exciting though is, we are seeing \u2013 when we hit that bump, we don't fall below where we were. So, we're continuing to see progress. And I think over time as we build awareness, build a habit, I think we'll see this play a bigger and bigger role in getting us into an on-premise engagement.","Jared Garber - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. And if I could just follow-up with one more. Have you guys seen any learnings early on the new menu test items that you have in test right now? Thanks.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. I think I mentioned this earlier. We're actually \u2013 you've seen the products in our NEXT Kitchen where that's really just the look of operational execution and we're just getting ready to use our stage gate process to move a handful of initiatives into an actual test market, where we'll be at scale, where we'll start to really have true learnings of customer experience, team member experience and then how that plays out on total Chipotle performance. So too early to comment on any of those items right now.","Jared Garber - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Hey guys. Two things. Just on \u2013 can you help us understand as you start to lap, I think, you mentioned, Jack, the July issues last year in Virginia just how we should think about that maybe 500 basis points or 600 basis points decline in traffic kind of coming back?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Andy. There's a couple things going on right now. We're also comparing against, right now, SAVOR.WAVS. So, we did see a nice uptick in a comp in the last week or so as we compare it to the soft tail from last year, but SAVOR.WAVS happened as well which there was a big BOGO, a lot of buy-one, get-one and so that's creating a little bit of noise, but we do expect to see much more attractive traffic and much more attractive sales comps over the next several weeks. And that'll only be slowed a bit as we compare to the launch of last year, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So, yeah, we're already seeing the positive effect from the comparison to last year, to the softness from last year.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And then anything on sort of pricing as you do the research on the brand? The ability to be a more regular menu price increase taker instead of every several years as has been the case in the past?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. So one of the things, we're definitely looking to understand is exactly the health of our value equation. The good news is our value continues to be very strong, and what we're assessing right now is, what is the right approach to sequence in pricing over time, making sure, we don't ever get ahead of a great value equation. So, that's part of the consumer research, frankly, that we've got going on right now. As we get those learnings back, it will inform, how we approach pricing going forward.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question","Jeff Priester - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is actually Jeff Priester on for Jeff Bernstein. Operationally, given all these initiatives, including your potential new items coming from the NEXT Kitchen and I know in New York some of the pickup shelves around the end of your actual make line. Is there going to be an issue down the line where implementing some of these initiatives, where you need to expand the line or reorganize it to get some of these things out there? And then I have one follow-up.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. So, I think I mentioned this before. Obviously, everything we're looking at has to be thoughtfully executed, so that the throughput engine of Chipotle is not jeopardized. And I think I mentioned this earlier, there's some projects that frankly just are bolt-ons. So like a digital shelf pickup. That actually improves the customer experience and the team member experience, because it eliminates that confusion for where the mobile order person is supposed to go, that awkward moment at the cashier. It eliminates a lot of that.","So, that in our opinion is a throughput enabler, because two things happen. One, it merchandises the fact that you can do this mobile ordering and not have to go through the line. And then the second piece is, it really takes advantage of our second make-line, which is I think a huge advantage to open up an off-premise business.","But look, the varying initiatives, if it comes with needs for new equipment, we'll test out the new equipment and make sure that it works and plays nicely with the throughput engine that we have. If it doesn't, then that's why we use the stage gate process to learn and figure out how we try again.","And it's going to be an iterative process with us. So, I'm very excited that we're going to start the process of seeing some of these pilots get into market, so that we protect the integrity of what's made Chipotle great, while we figure out how we enhance relevance and dial up engagement.","Jeff Priester - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then on delivery, can you give us a sense of the average check you're seeing relative to your dining customer and then as well as the number of customers per order, the number of entr\u00e9es per order, however you want to approach it?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we see obviously a nice increase in our digital orders. So the mobile and delivery orders are in that $16 to $17 range versus our traditional check is in the $12 range. And we're still learning, frankly, what is the order size that comes with it versus additional attachments like chips and guac and queso and so on and so forth. But we're really seeing a blend right now of both. There are times we see more add-ons and then there are times where clearly it's a larger group occasion that's off-premise that's ordering through the app or through the delivery third-party.","Jeff Priester - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, this Brandon (39:38) on for John. I believe on the first quarter call, you mentioned that you expected marketing and promo to be elevated throughout the remainder of the year. Do you still expect that to play out throughout the back half of 2018 here?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yes, it will be a little elevated. We were light in the first quarter. We were 3.2%. This past quarter, we'll be right at about that same 3.2%. So, overall for the year, we'll average right at about 3% for the overall year.","Unknown Speaker","Got it, Okay. And then I just had a follow-up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks restaurant AB and guest set scores are beginning to trend in the right direction. Could you elaborate on that comment, maybe quantify some of those improvements?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yes. So, the restaurant AB is the measurement tool that we use that's a couple of metrics that are very important to us that cover financials, people, guest experience and the team, okay. And what we're happy to see is we're seeing a nice move from Bs to As, and that's a good sign. So, it's a very important metric. It's one that Scott keeps a laser eye on and it's a good way for us to understand how we're performing in our restaurants and how we're actually making progress.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, I just wanted to get a sense for how much of the initiatives are driving or how much the improved outlook in the back half is driven by the initiatives or driven by the easy compares?","And I know with in terms of the initiatives, there's a lot of unknown timing, but maybe if you could talk about what you do know. For instance, I believe when you get your study back on the consumer that that's going to be the source of a new advertising campaign, maybe some impact of the change in the new catering menu. I'm thinking about the shelf roll-out. You just mentioned how kind of a no-brainer it is. I mean is that really a test that's going on? Or is that just kind of, should we expect that to be rolled out here in the back half?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","You know what, I didn't hear the last part of your question, but let me answer the first part, which is, as we talked about our guidance, it's got nearly zero on the initiatives that we've been talking about that we are putting into pilot and that we're going to start expanding over the course of the year.","And what we're seeing right now, I think is what I mentioned earlier, which is, I think we're seeing a nice improvement in our operational performance. I think we've got more visible, more effective, more relevant marketing out there and I think we've done a nice job of expanding access to our digital efforts.","I think it's going to continue to be the combination of all those things plus as we get some learning on loyalty and potentially some new menus items down the road, that we'll see initiatives play hopefully a bigger role going forward. But as of right now, there's \u2013 I think it's very minimal. And what was the second part of your question?","Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","The second part was just your initiative like the shelves, the pickup shelves. You mentioned kind of it's a no-brainer operationally. I mean what is the obstacles to just kind of rolling that out and not considering the test, but kind of just seeing a roll out. What is there to test with them?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. So look I think as an organization we're going to be a test and learn organization before we go launch. And even though going into where we put it in these five stores, our early indication were it's a no-brainer. The good news is in the first five stores it went as we hoped. And as a result, we're expanding now four, five markets in virtual order and the goal is keep assuming we continue to see the positive performance. We'll get it across the system very shortly thereafter.","Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And Jack a clarification on the tax guidance. I'm just looking if I think about adjusted earnings and comparable to the $2.87 that you mentioned today, I look at the adjusted tax rate there and it's 28.5% is my estimate. So, when you think about the third quarter effective tax rate that you've mentioned in the fourth quarter is that more relevant to GAAP earnings? Or is that relevant to the adjusted earnings we might be focused on?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Those rates are more GAAP earnings. The underlying rates are going to be more similar to what we talked about on our last call. So, the higher tax rate that you're seeing this time compared to what we talked about on our first quarter call are directly attributable to the fact that we've got all these charges. It's just pushing our income down and so it ends up pushing our rates up. When we normalize our earnings like, for example, in this quarter, our normal tax rate would be at that 28.5% range.","Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And then last question, just because I think there is some confusion around depreciation as I look at different estimates fairly-wide range. Could you help us understand what is accelerated depreciation in 2018 and will not going to occur in 2019? And maybe whether you think that depreciation as a whole would be potentially less in 2019 than the 2018 overall?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, 2019 will definitely be less. We're at a higher level this year. Let's call it 30 basis points or so. That's due to two things. One is due to retiring assets as a result of our refresh. We're investing in operating our restaurant. So that requires accelerated depreciation on the items that are going to be taken out of the restaurant.","And then secondly part of the restaurant that haven't closed yet, we leave a little bit on the books, GAAP requires that you leave a little bit of the asset on the books and then you right that off over the remaining time that you expect to have restaurants to be open.","And so as the M&R that we're doing the refresh that we're doing as that depreciation levels off, that'll be replaced by this higher depreciation from the stores that we're going to close, but that should fall off. Most of it should fall off this year, maybe in early next year and then our depreciation should go to more than normal historical rates.","Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call back over to Chipotle CEO, Brian Niccol for closing remarks.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Okay. Well, thank you everybody. I know this is a busy earnings time, so I appreciate everybody taking the time to listening to our results and have a discussion of the business. And thanks again and I'm sure we'll be in touch.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Investor Relations Manager for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Mr. Mark Alexee. You may begin your conference.","Mark Alexee","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the first quarter 2015. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements about our potential business results, growth in shareholder returns, projections of a number of restaurants we intend to open and trends and development costs, estimates of future and comparable restaurant sales increases or comps, and supply chain and other trends affecting future comps, projections regarding trends in food, labor and general and administrative costs, our expected effective tax rate, statements about stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.","Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated on our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks.","I'd like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the second quarter, it will begin June 1 and continue through our Q2 earnings release in July 2015.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Mark Crumpacker, Chief Creative and Development Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells","Thank you, Mark. I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. 2014 was an extraordinary year for our business and we're off to a strong start in 2015.","During the quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $1.1 billion, an increase of 20% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 10.4% and the opening of 49 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $2.88 per share, an increase of 47%.","These results are particularly strong considering that we were up against 13.4% same-store sales growth in Q1 last year and faced with harsh winter conditions in much of the country, including many important Chipotle markets.","We also saw some challenges related to our decision to stop serving carnitas in some of our restaurants. However, the strength of our business has weathered these challenges and emerged to set us up for a great year in 2015.","Our performance is the direct result of our continued focus on the things that really drive our business, our unique food culture and our unique people culture. We have a strong history of establishing very high standards for food we serve. Standards that are very often hard to meet, given our requirements for the ingredients we use.","We have encountered challenges from time-to-time, since we began our journey to find the very best ingredients we can, and we do not anticipate our recent pork supply issue to be our last one. But our track record of driving positive change in these areas is unprecedented, and we believe these higher quality ingredients taste better.","In January, we suspended one of our pork suppliers after a supply chain audit found that they were not fully compliant with all of our standards. Our protocol requires that pigs are raised with access to the outdoors or deep bedding in barns and without the use of antibiotics.","These differences are in stark contrast to the way conventional pigs are raised. In many cases they spend their whole lives indoors, on hard slatted floors with no bedding, which we think is inhumane.","When we found that one of our suppliers was falling short on some of our requirements, we knew that removing this pork from our supply was the right thing to do. But our decision left us without enough pork, and the resulting outages affected more than one-third of our restaurants.","While many of our customers were incredibly proud that we took a stand to do what was right, we also knew that there was risks involved, and that we would encounter challenges in replacing this supply. There is very little cushion today in the supply system for pork that meets our standards, and ultimately the solution requires increasing the number of pigs that are available. This does not happen quickly. Recognizing this near-term supply constraint, we have been looking hard to find more pork that meets our protocols.","Our long-term suppliers have partnered with us to increase their output of responsibly raise pork. However, this alone will not be enough to remedy the situation, and our shortage will remain at more than one-third of our restaurants, as we enter the peak spring and summer periods.","We have also looked at the possibility of adding new suppliers and have explored options to use other types of pork as a way to get more supply. Each of these potential solutions has their own unique complications. That said, we now believe that we have found a solution with a new supplier to help us fill our gap.","Our team is conducting on-site visits to inspect all facets of the operation, and we're encouraged by what we have seen so far. At this point, we plan to begin introducing this new pork in some of our restaurants in the coming months. If all goes as planned, we believe that we will be steadily increasing our supply throughout the third quarter and back in full supply during the fourth quarter.","While the commitments we make and the way we run our business can be difficult, they are also helping to differentiate Chipotle and enabling us to build stronger relationships with our customers, particularly younger customers.","New research out during the quarter from investment firm shows that the fast-casual sector has surpassed casual dining in terms of frequency of visits, with 45% of consumers saying that they spend more money eating out in 2014, up from 37% in 2013, and pointing to gains in popularity amongst fast-casual restaurants. In this study Chipotle was named as the favorite restaurant more than any other, with twice as many mentions as the number two company on the list.","Another study shows that millennials, key customers for Chipotle, are eating out at fast-casual restaurants more than generation X-ers or boomers, and that their dissatisfaction with traditional fast food is higher than other generations. We believe that the loyalty that we're building with key customer groups is very much a result of our commitment to doing what is right, in addition to the excellent customer service that we provide.","As we move closer to resolving the supply issues that have left us short of carnitas, we believe the pieces are in place for us to deliver strong performance throughout the year, and to help us continue to change the way people think about any fast food.","I'll now turn the call over to Monty.","Montgomery Moran","Thank you, Steve. Our ability to continue to deliver excellent results depends on the continued success of the special people culture that we have created at Chipotle. This culture continues to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience, while simultaneously allowing us to develop the excellent leaders we will need to accommodate our future growth, and help us to maintain our strong unit economic model.","During the quarter, we continue to strengthen our restaurant teams, adding 42 new restaurateur and promoting 11 in the field leadership roles, either Apprentice Team Leaders or Area Managers. These leaders are able to attract very talented people to our company and develop them to reach their full potential.","By hiring only top-performing employees and developing them to be at their very best, we're able to do things in our restaurants that other restaurant companies simply can't do. Not only our team is running extraordinary restaurants, preparing delicious food using classic cooking techniques and providing exceptional customer service, we're also elevating the people around them. This approach to running our restaurants is what enables us to create such an extraordinary dining experience and to deliver such strong unit economics.","The strength of our culture is evident in many ways, including through a growing number of individual success stories, as more and more of our people are climbing the ladder from crew to management and field leadership positions as well. In fact, last year alone, we promoted more than 10,500 people, who started as crew, into management positions. More than 78% of our restaurateur started with us as crew, many having never even worked in a restaurant before.","During the quarter, one particular leader really captured our attention, [ph] Montel Milleage, who demonstrated his ability to assemble a team of all top performers, and then empower them to achieve high standards in his restaurant, became our youngest restaurateur ever at only 19 years old.","Montel came to Chipotle two years ago, discouraged by his first job in a fast food restaurant. He wanted to work in an environment where the circumstances were encouraging and where he saw opportunities to advance, learn and grow.","He came to our College Park restaurant in Maryland for interview and was hired on the spot. He had a group of very strong leaders such as [ph] Gabby Fertio who is now a restaurateur, and [ph] Patricia Aguila a restaurateur who has been promoted to field leader and is now actually a team leader at Chipotle.","His team immediately recognized that despite not having significant experience, Montel embodied the 13 characteristics of a top performer and the drive to empower others around him. A year later he was a Service Manager working to develop his replacement, so he can move to the apprentice role. And in 19, he was promoted to General Manager at a new Chipotle restaurant, when we opened in Maryland City.","From the beginning, Montel set his sight on developing a team of all top performers. He then shared his restaurateur vision with all of them and connected with each person on his team by getting to know them, sharing his own dreams and desires, and demonstrating to them how he could help them become leaders in their own right.","Montel's story is just one of a number of truly inspiring stories of people who come to Chipotle, are motivated by our food culture and our people culture, and who share our vision and work hard to achieve it. These stories really illustrate the opportunities we're offering at Chipotle to top performers who are able to deliver a fantastic customer experience, and elevate the people around them to help them reach their potential. These opportunities are not only very rewarding to those who take advantage of them, they also provide the people that we will need to lead our continued growth at Chipotle.","One of the greatest benefits of having such strong cultures in our restaurants is that it enables us to deliver excellent customer service, which among other things generates great throughput. Our teams understand that the qualities that makes a great throughput are exactly the same qualities that provide the very best customer service.","Having everything ready in a restaurant before customers arrive, so we're prepared for service, particularly in our busiest times, and clear authentic communication with customers to keep our lines moving quickly without making people feel rushed. We continue to increase our average transactions throughout the day, including our peak lunch and peak dinner hours.","During the quarter we increased average transactions by 21 across the entire day, a tremendous accomplishment. This continued improvement is the product of our outstanding restaurant teams and their ongoing attention to providing better service, but also our continued emphasis on the four pillars of throughput, which are using a linebacker and dedicated expo at peak times, proper mise en place, and having the very best person in each position on the line during our busiest times.","Since we started reporting on the progress, our restaurants are making and implementing these four pillars. We've seen continued improvement and throughput, which we believe will become increasingly important now, as we head into our busiest months of the year.","Finally, on the development front, we are well on track to meet our initial guidance to open 190 to 205 new restaurants during this year. During the quarter, we opened 49 new restaurants, including one new ShopHouse, bringing our total number of restaurants to 1,831, including 10 ShopHouses and two Pizzeria Locales.","We continue to have a very strong real estate pipeline and are increasing our mix of new construction deals. Building restaurants in newly constructed centers is less costly for us. So this increase in new development should help offset some of the higher development cost that we saw in 2014.","We're continuing to evaluate new market opportunities or proceeds and anticipate entering new markets for both ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale this year. We previously announced our plans to introduce Pizzeria Locale in Kansas City and also expect to open in the third market Cincinnati, later this year.","We're pleased with our results for the quarter and our start to 2015. The strong food culture, unique and empowering people culture and industry-leading unit economics, we're well-positioned to change the way people think about and eat fast food and to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Crumpacker","Thanks, Monty. The marketing we do at Chipotle is unlike that of any other fast food brand. The reason for this is simple, very early on we decided to spend more on our ingredients and less on our marketing.","It's always been our belief that better quality food prepared by hand and served by excellent teams would be the most powerful marketing of all. In fact, we were serving better ingredients, including pasteurized dairy, local produce and meats without antibiotics or hormones long before there was even significant customer demand for such things.","Over time, this has created powerful differentiation between Chipotle and other fast food brands. This approach has served us well and our ongoing marketing research makes us confident that this is the case. Chipotle has become quite buzz-worthy with awareness coming from social medial, public relations, advertising and our local and event marketing programs.","But with less reliance on traditional advertising than many of our [technical difficulty] strength of our programs in areas other than advertising, generates considerable attention and awareness and as does the breakthrough nature of our content programs, which have reached well beyond what we would get through traditional advertising.","We are also seeing greater interest among customers who are looking to eat healthier and defining healthy around such characteristics as natural and minimally processed ingredients, exactly the same kind of ingredients we use to make our food. And we are also seeing that a majority of customers, about 60%, are willing to pay more for better food, food that is made without artificial ingredients. All of these findings really support the way we run our business and our marketing, and all the trades that are reflected in various aspects of our marketing.","The vast majority of fast food brands use limited time offers, new menu items and price promotions as their core marketing strategy. These new menu items and offers rarely build long-term loyal customers, instead only provides a spike in sales during their advertising window.","In order to maintain traffic, most fast food brands need to add a steady stream of new menu items throughout the year, resulting in bloated menus filled with hundreds of menu items. Not only is this marketing approach incredibly expensive, the cluttered menus can be confusing to customers and difficult for the restaurant crews to execute.","But the most significant downside to this approach is that these new menu items are often made from cheap artificial ingredients and are highly processed. These menus of highly processed items are proving problematic, as customers are increasingly concerned with a long list of artificial ingredients found in foods today. There are more than 800 artificial ingredients, preservatives and processing aids used in processed foods. In fact, there are 85 ingredients in a single fast food burrito served by one of our competitors.","For years our marketing has touted the superiority of our ingredients, including our use of local produce, pasteurize dairy and meats without antibiotics and added hormones. But more recently we have begun to expand our marketing messages to highlight the small number of whole unprocessed ingredients used in our food.","In fact, there are only 68 ingredients used to prepare all of the food we serve at Chipotle, the vast majority of which are simple ingredients you could buy at the local market. Only our tortillas contain any preservatives or other additives, and we are diligently working to eliminate those.","The fact that Chipotle uses better quality ingredients is well-known, but the fact that our food contains virtually none of these artificial ingredients and other fast food contains literally hundreds of them will further differentiate Chipotle from the competition. That's why we have developed a new marketing platform called, collective beauty, which is our internal designation for the program that highlights the simple beauty of the minimal number of whole unprocessed ingredients in our food.","The campaign include several phases and will be rolled out over the coming years. Currently, the campaign is running in print, outdoor and radio across 30 of our top markets.","Additionally, we are running more national advertising than ever before, leveraging print, streaming radio, search and social. The campaign runs in two flights, one this spring and another this fall. During the summer break between advertising flights, we'll be launching a large online initiative for collective beauty.","Beyond this expansion of our marketing strategy, strengthening our ecommerce program is a top priority for us this year. Over the last year we worked on a project to incorporate mobile payment into Chipotle ordering apps. We had hoped that this capability would have been available in the updated app released in December 2014, but we were not happy with how it was working, particularly in light of the continually evolving landscape of mobile payment.","Our commitment to support mobile payments is not changed, but our approach has. We are broadening our view of mobile payment to include more than simply paying for in-restaurant transactions using our app.","Our near-term priorities with regard to mobile include the launch of an ordering app for Apple Watch, which will be available April 24, and the exploration of new systems for mobile payment, including the use of Apple Pay in our restaurants and our iOS app and potentially Google Wallet capability within our Android app.","We are making progress with all of these initiatives and we'll keep you apprised, as these programs evolve. Last, we also relaunched our chipotle.com website with better accessibility and functionality for mobile users.","Additionally, we have begun delivery of online and mobile orders for individual and small groups in 67 cities using the Postmates delivery app. We selected Postmates as our official delivery partner in March, and now they are currently delivering Chipotle orders in all of the markets where they operate.","Finally, with regard to our catering programs, we will begin advertising catering in a number of markets, as we get close to graduation season, historically a busy season for catering packages. And expect to see continued momentum in this area during that peak time.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jack.","John Hartung","Thanks Mark. We're very proud of our results for the quarter, as we grew our revenue to nearly $1.1 billion or 20% increase as compared to last year and EPS was up 47% in the quarter.","Our average restaurant volumes have surpassed the $2.5 million mark for the first time, and we sit to little more than three years ago that our average volumes passed $2 million for the first time, meaning that we've been able to increase our average volumes by more than $500,000 per restaurant, while adding more than 600 new restaurants during the past three years.","This obviously has had a significant positive affect on our unit economics, and it means we're serving more Chipotle to more and more people in new and existing restaurants, as we pursue our vision to change the way people think about any fast food.","As you know, this year we faced the most difficult comp comparisons we've ever had as a public company, including lapping the menu price increase from Q2 of last year. We're pleased with the 10.4% comp in the quarter, on top of the 13.4% comp from last year. And we believe the comp was affected by weather, especially in parts of the Mid-Atlantic, the North East and regions in the south, and by the pork shortage, which Steve talked about.","It's difficult to put a precise impact on the combined effect of weather and the pork shortage during the quarter, but we believe the comp could have been as much as 100 basis points to 200 basis points higher with normalized weather, and had we've been able to serve carnitas in all of our restaurants. And it's not possible to separate the weather impact from the effect of the pork shortage, since they happened at roughly the same time.","We normally talk about weather not having a net impact on our sales, because our sales typically come roaring back after big snowstorm, offsetting the lower sales caused by the storm. But the weather impact this year lasted for many weeks in most markets, so any sales bounce back could not offset the full effect of the bad weather.","Our comps were highest in January and lowest in March, similar to some macro retail trends, and consistent with the premise that the weather was likely a factor in February, March. Until so far, in April, are trending slightly higher than March, which tells us that weather was at least partially a factor in the first quarter.","So what does all that mean for our sales trend going forward? Well, comps in April so far appear on track to be in the high-single digits, and we think our pork shortage is currently impacting our sales by as much as 200 basis points. We have not seen immediate impact on sales when market first ran out of pork, but a research in our sales analysis suggest that our carnitas customers really love our pork, and they appear to be visiting less often or not at all, until they know we have carnita skin in their market.","Now, this is not surprising, as the vast majority of our customers tend to find their favorite burrito or favorite bowl combination, and then they order that favorite meal every single time they visit. We had hope that the shortage would encourage our carnitas customers to try another menu option, and some did, but many have decided to hold out until carnitas returns to their market.","And as a reminder, we rotated markets without pork about every six weeks, and so every one of our markets has been affected at some time or another. We found that when we rotated supply back to a particular market, it can take weeks before our carnitas product mix returns to previous product mix levels. As a result of our carnitas loving customers not realize we were back in supply of carnitas, until they visited less often.","In other words, this rolling blackout has caused confusion among our customers about where and when we were out of carnitas, and this has worsened the sales impact. Because of this phenomenon, we're going to stop the rolling blackout and continuously serve carnitas in our markets, where the carnitas product mix tends to be the highest, starting later this month.","Based on actual April trends and factoring in a tougher comparisons in May and June, including the lapping of last year's menu price increase, Q2 comps overall are likely to be in the low-to-mid single digits. So that comp assumes that we continue to see as much as 200 basis points negative impact from the pork shortage.","As Steve mentioned, we expect additional pork to be returning to our restaurants beginning in the third quarter, with a full return of carnitas during the fourth quarter. It also assumes no incremental menu price increase in Q2 related to the elevated beef prices, which I'll talk about in a few minutes. And also as before any potential sales lift we might get from our marketing campaign that Mark talked about or from other impact such as faster throughput.","By the way, of the 10.4% comp in the quarter, about 6.1% relates to the price increase from last year, and most of the rest is due to higher traffic with a small increase in average check due to positive mix, including greater group size and catering.","Of course, we're as disappointed as our carnitas loving customers that we have not been able to satisfy their craving, and we don't love the fact that are sales have been impacted by the shortage. But we remain committed to our food integrity mission, and we are as confident as ever that we made the right decision to suspend a pork supplier based on our animal welfare protocols. And we're optimistic that the new pork supplier Steve talked about will help us at least reduce the impact of this shortage on our customers and on our sales soon.","Overall, for the year, we continue to expect comps in a low-to-mid single digit, which is consistent with the outlook we initially provided for the year. And again, this does not factor in any menu price increases related to beef or any sales recovery from eliminating the pork shortage.","We're pleased to finally see some relief on our food cost line, with food cost declining from 35% in the fourth quarter to 33.9% in Q1. The main contributors to the decrease were from relief in dairy cost and favorable pricing for avocados. Dairy pricing had largely been expected to be realized with a broader commodity market increased supply during the fourth quarter of 2014, and the trend was relatively stable throughout the quarter.","With avocado pricing, we have observed a slight increase in supply, and that temporarily helped to keep the prices reasonable through the early months of 2015. However, we anticipate that normal seasonal shifts will pressure the avocado market in Q2 and Q3, as we buy more avocados from California growers.","Beef prices remain at historically high levels, although beef inflation was largely contained during the quarter. We currently believe that the pricing for beef will remain at these elevated levels well into 2016 and perhaps even into 2017. As a result of this increased inflation, we expect to raise prices on steak and barbacoa this year, most likely by the end of the third quarter.","And while we're still carefully reviewing our options, we anticipate an average increase of around 4% to 6%, which would have a net effect of about 150 basis points based on the current product mix of our steak and barbacoa. And as you'll recall, our intent last year was to cover the inflationary cost pressures of beef, but we undershot this level in hindsight, as beef cost continued to rise.","And while it's important to our vision that we remain accessible or affordable to our customers, we also want to charge our customers the going rate for the ingredients that we use. And as a reminder, we saw virtually no trade down from steak and barbacoa last year, when we increased prices for these entrees more than other menu items.","One final note related to food cost in the quarter. We included a one-time write-off to the cost of sales associated with the carnitas inventory of $1.7 million. We chose to donate rather than serve the pork which did not meet our protocols. This write-off was offset by a small change in the classification of miscellaneous kitchen supplies, which shifted from the food cost line to the other operating cost during the quarter.","Labor costs for the first quarter were 22.4% of sales, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. Leverage for the quarter was largely driven by higher sales volumes, which include the benefit of the higher menu prices and that was slightly offset by wage inflation. Occupancy costs were 5.8% of sales, a decrease of 30 basis points from last year. And other operating costs were 10.4% of sales or 10 basis points lower than last year.","Marketing expenses during the quarter were 0.9% of sales compared to 1.3% in the prior year, and that's in line with expectations and lower than our full year outlook, as we will ramp up additional marketing costs during Q2 and Q3 related to the campaign that Mark discussed.","Restaurant level margins increased 160 basis points to 27.5% benefiting from strong revenue growth compared to last year. G&A was 5.8% of sales in the quarter, down from 7.4% last year and was driven by the lower non-cash stock comp. For the full year 2015, we expect non-cash stock comp expense to be about $80 million, which is down $18 million from last year.","Executive comp was restructured resulting in an estimated $33 million reduction, and exec comp for the full year, while additional grants to restaurant management and staff are expected to offset the non-cash stock comp by about $15 million. Total stock comp in the first quarter was about $16.6 million compared to about $27.6 million last year.","As Mark mentioned earlier, we are refocusing our ecommerce program to build a mobile platform that moves beyond simply incorporating mobile payment into our ordering app. We incurred a loss on disposal of assets, about $2.8 million associated with some of the prior development work.","Effective tax rate during the quarter was 38.4% and for the full year we estimate our effective tax rate will be 38.7% compared to 37.6% for the full year in 2014. 2014 benefited from our estimated usable federal and state credits and from the work opportunity and R&D federal tax credit, which have not been renewed for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 30 basis points.","We finished the quarter with 1,831 restaurants and our average unit volumes have helped push our return on investment up to nearly 80%, an economic return that we're very proud to achieve.","As of March 31, we held cash and investments of about $1.4 billion including short and long-term interest bearing investments and we continue to have no debt on our balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased $23 million of our stock on average share price of $675 and we currently have $179 million remaining on our share buyback program, which was previously approved by our Board.","We continue to believe that reinvesting into the growth of our business remains the best use of our cash, although we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today and we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we'll take a question from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co.","Brian Bittner","So a question on comps, and I'm just trying to understand the way you are thinking about it. Over the next two quarters, you're facing very similar traffic comparisons that you faced in the first quarter. So are you assuming that over the next couple of quarters, you see very similar traffic growth that you saw in this first quarter, which I'm assuming is in the low-singles, and then you're just rolling in the loss of the pricing as it falls off? Is that kind of how you're thinking about comps going forward?","John Hartung","No, I think the comparisons get tougher, and so I would expect that the transaction comps are not going to hold up at the same level as the first quarter. The way I would think about it is, in April so far we're seeing comps in the high single-digit range, and that includes menu pricing of about 6.1%.","That menu pricing will fall off over the next few quarters. And so as that 6.1% falls off, you're going to see transactions that are going to be moving down into the low single-digits. And then we continue to compare it to tougher comparisons as the year rolls out. So I would not expect to see the same transaction growth as you saw in the first quarter continue as we move to the rest of the year.","Brian Bittner","And then, second and last question. How much is your online orders as a percent of your sales mix today? And as you focus on it, what really are the benefits and where could it go in your mind as a percent of the business?","John Hartung","What I include as kind of all online and catering and burritos by the box, they're all kind of non-traditional orders. That was about 6.6% during the quarter. That's at or near an all-time peak. That number will vary quarter-by-quarter, because catering has seasonality. Mark mentioned in his comments that we're approaching our peak catering season. And so I would expect that catering would move up in Q2, and I would expect that 6.6% to increase along with the higher catering expected in the next quarter.","We don't know where it can go, but we do know some competitors talk about their total catering in the 8%, 9%, 10% range. And so we think we've got a lot of room to grow. Catering is very young. We still think that our mobile ordering as Mark talked about, we could do a lot more with the ordering, with the payment, with the way that we accommodate those orders in restaurants. So we think we have a lot of room to do a better job with all that. In terms of where it can go, we don't know. We just know others when they're in high single-digits, low double-digits, that gives us optimism that we can move that number up from the 6.6% today.","Mark Crumpacker","And just to add on to that, with regard to catering, keep in mind that catering currently does not have online ordering or delivery or online payment. So it's in its very early stages. So if we add those things, we expect to see catering become more popular.","With regard to online orders, I can't give you one statistic with regard to the Postmates delivery service that we're using. We're seeing a 30% month-over-month growth on those orders, and we have not publicized this. So there is a tremendous amount of potential for individual orders, but it's a little bit too early for us to predict what long-term impact that will have.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Joseph Buckley with Bank of America.","Joseph Buckley","Can I just ask you to clarify the last discussion, so the 6.6% is the percent of online orders, but if I understand correctly, that does not include catering? Is that correct?","John Hartung","Joe, that does include catering. So catering is a little over 1%, so of that 6.6% catering is about 1.1% or so. But we didn't cater in the second quarter, it could increase by as much as 50%, so it could be in a 1.5% or 1.6% range or so, but the 6.6% does include catering.","Joseph Buckley","And then just a question on the food costs, which you are commenting remarkably good for the quarter, given the recent run rate. Was there some unusual letup on the pressure from beef during the first quarter or was that simply dairy and avocado and some other things coming in more favorable than you expected?","John Hartung","Joe it was all dairy and avocados. Beef just kind of held constant. We pickup about two-thirds of the benefit from dairy, and about a-third of the benefit from avocados, and then we just had no other surprises. We've been kind of snake bit in the last several quarters just by surprising continued increase, whether it was beef or some other ingredients. And this quarter everything remain calm, and we got the benefit that we hoped we would get from avocados and dairy, so nothing else out of the ordinary.","Joseph Buckley","Is there any unusual split between advertising expense for the balance of the year? I know, you said, it was down as a percent of sales in the first quarter?","John Hartung","Yes, Joe, I would expect Q2 and Q3 to probably be at the peak. This quarter was closer to 1%, just under 1%. Q2 and Q3 will be closer to 2%. And then a overall for the year, fourth quarter will dropdown to something maybe closer to 1%. Overall for the year, we'll probably be in the 1.6% range or so.","Operator","At this time, we'll go to Jason West with Credit Suisse.","Jason West","Just one, I guess, going back on the delivery rollout. You said that's going to be delivery to individuals as well. Is that something you guys have offered? I mean, I'm guessing you can do it on like seamless and places like that, but is that sort of a new initiative and how widespread will that delivery be? Is that a nationwide opportunity?","Mark Crumpacker","Yes, it is relatively new -- let me put it this way. There have been a lot of people that have been delivering Chipotle through various services over the years. And we've tried to in a lot of cases shut them down, because we weren't sure whether the quality was going to be sufficient or whether they were following our rules. This is different because we've made an official deal with Postmates and they have been delivering Chipotle for a quite a while too. So we have them as our official partner, and they will be delivering Chipotle, they are delivering Chipotle in all of their markets which are -- its 64 cities and about 24 big metropolitan areas. So it is nationwide.","Jason West","And I guess going back to the comp question. The underlying, I guess, trends, do you guys assume the two year is going to deteriorate for any reason, particularly looking at maybe the traffic specifically on that? And I guess, around that question, is there anything you're seeing outside of the weather and the pork issues that suggest there to be any reason for a deceleration in the underlying trend of the business?","John Hartung","Well, I don't know that I will look at a two-year trend. I think when you combine years you have to combine years that make up the full trend that we're seeing. And in our case, I go back to the current trend we're in. We're in a third-year of a trend that started in early 2013. If you remember our comp in 2013 was 1% and the year before that we were on a kind of deceleration as we were finishing up a three-year trend that started in 2010.","And so if you go back to 2013 and you look we grew comps from 1% and 5% and 6% and 9% and we went to double-digits and now we're comparing against those strong double digits. And I think if you combine those three years together, you will see a three-year trend that for the first quarter with 2015 being the third year, the comp was about 24.8%.","Now, we know that was affected by weather and pork and so it was depressed a little bit. But if you make an adjustment for weather and pork, I think for the rest of the year, you can think in terms of a three year combine sales comp and that would put you in kind of 25%, 26% range or so. And I think that's the better way to think about it. So in those terms I think that we should stay in that same kind of ballpark. And again that doesn't take into account anything we do with menu prices on beef and it doesn't take into account the replenishment of supply with the pork that Steve talked about later in the year.","Operator","At this time, we'll hear from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino","Just maybe a follow-up on that question, Jack. I guess, if you think about the trends on a multi-year basis and apply that logic, would you expect this year's traffic or the one year traffic number to turn negative at any point during the year? I guess, does that imply sort of a flattening out of the traffic or a turning of the traffic to negative territory?","John Hartung","I don't think, David, it will turn negative, but when we compare against the third quarter that's going to be our toughest comparison. And it's going to be low-single digits. So I don't think it will turn negative. I hope that we see a balance from things like creating greater awareness with the campaign that Mark talked about, and just general increase in awareness that we from time-to-time get with Chipotle.","It's amazing to me that some people still have never visited Chipotle. I just met one over the weekend. I just can't believe it that somebody has never been to Chipotle. And so the third quarter will be the toughest test, but I would say right now I don't expect it to turn negative.","David Tarantino","And then, I guess, getting back to your point there that you just made, in the past I think this is pretty similar to how you've given guidance yet in the past. Chipotle, time and time again has found a way to drive more traffic into the business through, whether it's marketing or just initiatives around food or throughput. So I guess this year, it sounds like maybe you're less optimistic about your ability to drive more traffic or maybe I'm reading it the wrong way, but what are your overall thoughts on the ability to continue driving this up and kind of hurdle over the great trends you had last year with positive momentum?","John Hartung","David, it's very hard to predict quarter-by-quarter. I look at this as a very substantial three-year trend where we now have 1,800 restaurants; we're now $2.5 million. In fact, that we've had a $500,000 in volume, while adding the 600 restaurants I talked about, over the last three years I think is pretty substantial.","If you go back to the three years before that that was a three-year trend as well that had a start and a stop. And it was pretty clean. 2010, 2011, and 2012, during that three-year period, and you see where it started, you can see where it ended and that was about 27% or 28% or 29% increase. And so we seem to have these waves.","And if you go back even as we were private company, these waves where people figure out that Chipotle exist, they will like it, that they come back more often. And so we have this kind of surge and then we have a leveling off, then a surge and a leveling off, very tough to predict.","Will we have another surge? When will we have it? What will the magnitude of that surge be? But we continue to believe that there's a great appreciation and a growing appreciation for what we do at Chipotle. We do think millennials in particular are very appreciative of what we do. We think this campaign that's designed to reinforce the idea that not only do we source sustainable raised ingredients, but we do really cooking with real whole ingredients. And we largely don't use things like preservatives and stabilizers and things like that.","So we believe that that is not something that is short-lived, that's over. We think that we'll probably benefit from that, but in terms of then breaking that down into exactly what that's going to do for next two or three quarters, it's tougher to predict and the comparisons are tough, but over the longer term, we're optimistic about where we can go from here.","Operator","And then we'll take a question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Jack, just first on the food cost outlook for the full year, just to be clear, is the $33.9 million -- I know there's lots of pushes and pulls, but is that a good number? Doesn't that also include the write-off of the pork, so was that even better or is that a loss on this asset or something?","John Hartung","Well, the write-off of the pork is offset by re-class. And so I would look at those as largely a loss. So I would think of it, John, as we're going to see pressure in the next two quarters from avocados, and so I think they will be in that pressure. Hopefully that pressure will be relieved in the fourth quarter. So I would say generally, we will probably be up a little bit from this first quarter, but hopefully not too significant.","John Glass","So still below, say, the 35% that you're running at the end of last year, is that a fair way to think about -- ?","John Hartung","We expect to see below the 35%, yes.","John Glass","And then are your restaurant set up now that take mobile payments? Do you have to invest more in the POS systems or different POS systems? How do you envision this new mobile payment system working with your existing systems?","Mark Crumpacker","The restaurants currently are not set up to accept mobile pay, although with Apple Pay, in particular, the investment on the hardware side is relatively minimal. So that's not a significant barrier. The main challenge there is making the POS software compliant with Apple Pay. So we're working on that.","And that's the type of payment that's of most interest to us, so people being able to pay at the POS with their phone. We're also of course pursuing putting Apply Pay in our mobile app as well as Google Wallet in our Android app. But the priority is going to be mobile payment at the POS. But it's not as if the POS hardware has to change, there's just an additional piece of equipment.","John Glass","And do you envision that being available this year?","Mark Crumpacker","That's our hope to have that implemented by the end of the year.","Operator","And this time we'll move to Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company.","Andrew Charles","Monty, with the combined power of increased field leadership oversight in diagnostic tool, do you see the 21 transaction gain sustainable for the remainder of 2015?","Montgomery Moran","Do I see the, what transactions?","Andrew Charles","The 21 transactions you gained from the throughput initiatives. Do you see that's sustainable with the tools you're putting in place?","Montgomery Moran","Yes, in fact, I would like to see us actually improve on that over the next two quarters. That's a nice result especially during the first quarter, which from a transaction standpoint is one of our slowest two quarters. And over the second and third quarter we usually see a significant pick up in our business seasonally. And it's during those seasons that we really make sure to emphasize with all of our teams, the importance of having those four pillars in place.","And in fact, at this time we've just started a national sort of throughput contest just to sort of make it top of mind with our restaurant teams, have some fun with it and bring awareness to those who are doing the best job just like we did with the reporting at nationwide from team director to team director, but this way we're actually having a little bit of a contest for bragging, right. And we'll see if we can keep pushing the needle, but I think it's going to get stronger over the next two quarters in terms of throughput.","Now, of course, our ability to put through more people depends on having more people come to our doors as well. So throughput will not in and of itself drive transactions, it's just that when you have transactions come in, if you don't have the throughput, you are stifling your ability to allow those additional transactions to come in the door. But yes, we're excited about hopefully continuing to improve on our execution of the four pillars and our execution of throughput.","Andrew Charles","And Mark, with the new digital initiatives what can we expect from one-to-one marketing efforts? And how can Chipotle build efforts to strengthen this form of marketing?","Mark Crumpacker","I missed out the second part of the question.","Andrew Charles","Yes, sure, just kind of curious about how Chipotle can build efforts to strengthen the one-to-one marketing?","Mark Crumpacker","Well, I mean, we've been doing that actually for a couple of years. We've significantly improved our one-to-one marketing through mobile. What we're doing now is doing more marketing campaigns that enable people to participate by opting in either through email or via text. As I mentioned in my comments earlier, we just relaunched chipotle.com yesterday, which makes it mobile-friendly, much easier for people to opt into our emails and follow us on our social media accounts.","We're also, as Jeff mentioned, I think on the last earnings call, doing a large data project at Chipotle, which will give us even more capability in terms of reaching out to these folks, but we have seen a shift in our marketing toward more one-to-one marketing in terms of what we're spending anyway. So I think we're already underway in that regard.","Andrew Charles","But it seems like the digital initiative will give you more firepower behind that.","Mark Crumpacker","Well, anything that we do that's digital has the potential for people to share it them by themselves, so it adds a viral element. And at Chipolata, we're very judicious with our offers. And when we combine our mobile initiative with an offer of some kind, we see a tremendous amount of viral pickup of that. And so, yes, these digital initiatives have given us more leverage for our dollars than traditional advertising do or does. We use them always in conjunction with one another, but you're right digital gives us more leverage because of the potential for it to be shared.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","I had a question about the supply chain and obviously with carnitas, it's had a little bit about a bump more recently. But given the size of the company and the growth path, can you talk about maybe the potential or the partner with larger entities to ensure the supply chain going forward? It just seems like you'll be a very attractive partner and maybe you already are doing that, and it's just not obvious to us on the outside is try to ensure the consistency of the supply.","Steve Ells","Well, our suppliers are some of the larger suppliers in the country. Our suppliers are also very small independent family farms that are sometimes part of larger cooperatives. But we buy from some of the very, very bigger suppliers.","With the bigger suppliers we've encouraged them to adopt our protocols, and some of them have, and some have chose not to do so. But we know in order to continue to ensure a supply of our top quality ingredients that are more sustainably raised, we're going to have to use all different sizes of farmers and ranches out there, and we have been doing that for years.","Operator","At this time, we'll take from David Palmer with RBC.","David Palmer","A quick follow-up and then another question. With regard to pricing, Jack, you mentioned that you think the traffic will remain positive. If traffic were approaching negative territory, does that change your resolve to raise pricing or do you think of this independent of what your traffic is doing?","John Hartung","Well, trends don't change. We're likely going to increase prices, if something happened in the economy or something happen with our trends, we might differ it. I mentioned that we'd probably get it done by the end of the third quarter. So if we saw something unusual happen, we might differ it, just so that we don't exasperate the challenge. But if the trends stay as they are, we're underpriced on steak right now.","We're just not charging to going to rate. We actually lose money anytime somebody comes in thinking about getting chicken and instead gets steak for example. So we'd like to fix that. But if we decided, if there were some trends that we were little concerned about, we might decide to fix that a quarter or two later. But right now, unless things change, I think we're going to get this done by the third quarter.","David Palmer","And then just a follow-up to your previous comments about the cycle, this three year ebb and flow that you seem to see. Looking back at the last slowdown, we came to see or at least we did, that there was perhaps some throughput constraints and then the throughput focus, and also that the marketing efforts that were breakthrough perhaps made a better case for this acceleration than you might have had otherwise.","You're talking about a new campaign, but is there a little bit of an introspection, where you're seeing perhaps that whole campaign has perhaps lost its energy, and that's going to be a big part of your hope going forward. And then you're talking about this competition with throughput, is there a sense that perhaps some of the throughput metrics are perhaps not improving the way that they were?","John Hartung","I think the throughput is improving very nicely, and we're really proud of what our teams are doing. Like I said, we think we can continue to go faster as the pressure of a busy second and third quarter comes to us.","Over the last couple of years, even three years now sort of in a row, we've consistently set a new high watermark on throughput during our second and third quarters particularly each year. So we're getting faster and faster, and we think that we're not sort of close to being at the point where we can't get faster. That is to say, there is a long sort of a lot of runway on our ability to get faster.","But I just want to sort of caution on the throughput thing, that you know throughput is something that's very important, when a lot of people come through our doors. It's always important, because it's part of good customer service. And it's always important, because when our throughput is fast, our food taste better, because our burritos are rolled and assembled and served to customers, while they're still hot.","But throughput doesn't happen in a vacuum. When we have more pressure on our teams, longer lines, more customers, then it is a time when you're going to see our throughput numbers get better. That being said, throughput doesn't -- if we don't have people come through our doors, there is opportunities on throughput in some stores. If we're not going fast enough, we're not going to see as much of an ability to ramp up throughput.","So great throughput over time will cause, I think, more customers to enjoy Chipotle, because they're going to trust that we can get them to more quickly, and that is more of a convenient experience. But great throughput doesn't sort of -- it will not add any comp in a vacuum during any given quarter. You have to have the transactions coming through your door.","Mark Crumpacker","And with regard to your question regarding marketing, we have had a series of successful advertising campaigns, but I wouldn't look at it as if those campaigns or for example, I wouldn't look at it in a way to suggest that this current campaign can't achieve those same goals. If you look at what we're doing now -- in the past we've touted what we call our hero ingredients. We talked a lot about naturally raised or responsibly raised meats, local produce, pasteurized dairy, that kind of thing.","But there are a number of other competitors who are trying to say similar things. The approach we're taking now is to expand that platform to include essentially what's not in our food. These 800 or so chemical additives, which are used to make processed food that is sold at most fast food, and the fact that Chipotle only have 65 ingredients in our entire, or 67 ingredients in our entire company, is really remarkable.","So the new campaign is designed to prove that to people to show that to them in a very interesting compelling way. That will further differentiate Chipotle in a way that frankly the competitors can't mimic. I mean, you keep can't take all of this junk out of these other processed menu items in other fast food companies. They just can't do it. While they can mimic some of our past marketing, I think it would be very difficult for them to do this. So I expect this new approach to have potentially even greater impact than the ones previously.","Operator","At this time, we'll move to Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","I just have a couple of follow-up questions if I may. I guess, one is, I doesn't believe with the comp issue, but Jack, I guess the two-year trend actually or the three-year trend you're talking about, I don't know if you're adjusting for kind of the 1Q calendar shift in 2013, but the implication would be in fact negative. The process is certainly traffic. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile some of the commentary.","And the other piece I had about marketing is, so I think in the first half of last year, you had a pretty big increase in marketing dollars and it seems to have helped, along with your good initiatives that saw the lines really shorten through 2013. Is that something that you think about in terms of marketing spend is down between brand building and traffic driving?","John Hartung","Sara, I'll take the comp issues first. When I look at the first quarter, you're right that in 2013, there was we lost a day. So that 1% comp is really like a 2% comp, so you can make that adjustment. There is also an adjustment to be made and I'm suggesting it's 100, 200 basis points in the first quarter and that's an estimate. It's our best estimate right now.","And so the three year comp if you make those adjustments you're talking about something in 26%, 27% or so range. And if you do that and if you look out at the rest of the year, and listen, we do things like we adjust for trading day and things like that, I think the third quarter and the fourth quarter will be tough comparisons. I don't think the traffic will turn negative, but it will get close. So the margin for error is very, very small, but right now I wouldn't expect it to be a negative comp, but it's going to be close. So we're hoping for the best.","Mark Crumpacker","And with regard the marketing spend, you need to be careful when looking at when the dollars are spent. We typically do the same type of marketing each year. That is to say, we do traditional advertising, outdoor print radio that sort of thing in the spring and the fall. That's what we did last year. And we're doing it at the same time this year. We're actually spending more than ever this year.","You can see lumps in the spend because of how we developed the brand building content, like the short films or the television series, you can see that impact to marketing budgets in ways that make it look as if we're spending more at that moment when we're not. So I don't think there is a meaningful correlation between the spent of marketing and what we're seeing right now. What we're doing with marketing is pretty exactly what we did last year.","Sara Senatore","And so one last thing, did I miss, did you give the mix for this quarter -- mix contribution?","John Hartung","Yes, it was like 6.1% was menu price. That most of the rest of the transactions, it was a small piece, Sara, that wasn't transaction, but even that was greater group size than catering, which even now they're like transactions, because you're serving more people. There wasn't anything in terms of the people buying different items on a menu that caused the check to go up, so menu price is the biggest piece, 6.1%. Most of the rest of the transaction and a small piece related to group size and catering.","Operator","It's all the time we have for questions.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you.","I would like to turn the conference over to Chipotle\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, Alex Spong.

Well, I am extremely pleased with our sales performance during the first quarter. We ended 2013 with nice sales momentum and that momentum strengthened in first quarter as our restaurant teams continue to do a great job of delivering our customers who visited Chipotle during the quarter. Our revenues were $904.2 million for the quarter, an increase of 24.4% driven by an increase in same-store sales of 13.4% and from the opening of 44 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $2.64 for the quarter, an increase of 7.8%. What I\u2019m pleased about is that our constant pursuit of creating an extraordinary dining culture along with the best people culture in the restaurant industry is resonating with our customers, and they\u2019re rewarding us with their loyalty.","Our food culture continues to focus on finding the very best ingredients with an eye towards sustainability and great taste and preparing them using classic cooking techniques. This allows us to constantly improve our already delicious food. Our unique people culture is centered around hiring top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards and developing them to be the future leaders of the Chipotle. Although our focus and emphasis on these two key areas is not new. We are more confident than ever that building a strong food culture and a strong people culture is helping us change the way people think about and eat fast-food while leading to significantly better business results.","During the quarter, we announced plans to continue to rollout Sofritas. This is our delicious vegan tofu offering and we expect to have Sofritas in all of our restaurants by the end of the year. Sofritas is an organic tofu and it\u2019s braised with chilies, chipotle adobo, garlic, cumin and oregano. It\u2019s been very popular with our vegan and vegetarian customers but we\u2019re delighted that about half of our sales come from customers who are meat eaters. Sofritas is in nearly 1000 restaurants and accounts for 4% of our entr\u00e9e product mix in those restaurants. We continue to make progress on our quest to use non-GMO ingredients in our food. Just over a year ago, we became the first national restaurant company to voluntarily disclose GMOs in our ingredients and about to find non-GMO replacements.","Today, we have eliminated virtually all of the GMO ingredients in our food. Our corn and flour tortillas are the only foods we currently serve that are made using ingredients that contain or could contain trace amounts of GMOs and now we\u2019re testing new non-GMO recipes for these tortillas and we hope to be able to roll them out by the end of the year. Removing GMO is just one of the many improvements we\u2019re making as we continue to pursue the sourcing of high quality sustainably graced ingredients. We\u2019re proud of these efforts. And we\u2019re also proud of the marketing which is designed to encourage people to be more curious about their food and where it comes from and how it\u2019s raised.","We also want to educate our customers so they\u2019ll appreciate that these better ingredients prepared using classic cooking technique is the reason our food taste so good. Ultimately, it\u2019s our belief that the more people know about their food and how it was raised and where it comes from, the more likely they will be to eat at Chipotle. Farmed and Dangerous is a good example our commitment to entertain while creating curiosity about how food is raised in this country. Farmed and Dangerous is a four-episode satire we produced which ran online on Hulu and Hulu Plus. The day the first episode posted to Hulu alongside some of the most popular television shows, it was among the top five viewed shows. After the first episode was released, the show exceeded Hulu\u2019s audience projections for the entire run of the show and coverage of the show and related issues in the news media generated millions of impressions.","So we\u2019re really pleased about the attention that Farmed and Dangerous is getting. But more importantly that it is creating curiosity and spots the dialogue about how food is raised. Another great opportunity to engage people in a celebration and dialog about food is our Cultivate events. Recall that our Cultivate festivals are daylong festivals of food, music and ideas and bring together great bands some of the country\u2019s best known chefs and other attractions. These festivals speak to issues like the difference between whole and process foods, the use of GMOs and the difference between pasture based versus more industrial based animal agriculture. We recently announced that our Cultivate events will be held in San Francisco, Dallas and Minneapolis this year.","Last year about a 100,000 people attended Cultivate events in Chicago, Denver and San Francisco but millions of additional consumers were reached through related advertising, social media and PR. We continue to be encouraged by the reach and response of these events with more than 90% of attendees and saying that they would attend again in the next year and would recommend the event of others. We\u2019ll also continue to do more traditional advertising which is designed to keep Chipotle top of mind with our customers. Our new campaign entitle better ingredients is currently running in many Chipotle markets around the country. The creative content focuses on our use of great ingredients and classic cooking techniques and includes print, online ads and outdoor.","Finally, we\u2019re encouraged by the growth seeds that we have planted including our international expansion ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. Since our last call we recently opened our third restaurant in Paris and we now have 10 restaurants open in Europe including six in London and one in Frankfurt. I should remind you however that we review our portfolio of growth seeds as opportunities for long term growth potential and that our growth will be driven by the development of Chipotle restaurants in the United States for the foreseeable future.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mont.","Monty Moran","Thanks Steve. I am really proud of the results our restaurant teams delivered during the first quarter. While many restaurants and retailers have talked about a tough consumer environment not because of the weather the type of economy our teams have created such a warm and welcoming environment that our customers visited at an accelerated rate during the quarter. This terrific environment our customers discover when they visit Chipotle is the result of the special people culture our managers are creating in our restaurants.","It\u2019s a culture that emerges when you hire only terrific people who believe in and are committed to work Chipotle is having who have a desire to learn how to create delicious food made from high quality ingredients and who drive in a culture when they are empower to contribute to their absolute fullest potential including becoming the future leaders of Chipotle. Of course this is the culture that customers discover when they visit our restaurant to restaurants and every one of our managers throughout the country is intently focused on creating this very same restaurateur culture in their own restaurants.","Today we have more than 500 restaurateurs including over 90 in field leadership positions but we have more than 1,200 managers who are working hard to become restaurateur soon. In fact every single one of our managers has targeted becoming a restaurateur within the next 12 months most of them sometime during this year. We know this because the plan tool that you\u2019ve heard me talk about during the past two earnings calls identifies a specific plan of action by which each GM will create a restaurateur culture in their restaurant.","These are realistic plans created based on themes our field leaders have identified when visiting each restaurant and meeting with each and every crew member on the team. Executing the plan helps our managers ensure they have the right people on their team but they have a compelling vision that everyone on the team is committed to their culture of empowerment exists in the restaurant and that the entire team understands our high standards. When all of that exist in the restaurant top performers who empower to achieve high standards with a compelling vision that restaurant can count on the visits from Steve or me one of our other officers for a restaurateur interview.","I am really excited about the positive impact this planned tools having in creating a clear roadmap for achieving this elite level of restaurateur. I am more confident than ever that our field learners are spending their time wisely and productively by helping to create special people cultures rather than swatting away symptoms. And I am more confident than ever that each of our restaurants has the opportunity to become restaurateur very soon. Each restaurant has already received two quarterly plans and they will receive an updated plan from their field leader each quarter so that they can see the progress they\u2019re making and reducing the amount of negative themes in their restaurants and advancing towards restaurateur.","As restaurateur program is the cornerstone of our people culture where our very best managers run extraordinary restaurants and have demonstrated the ability to elevate and develop the people around them. Many of our restaurateurs have expanded their leadership beyond their home restaurant showing they can elevate the people and culture in nearby restaurants and many have advanced into field leadership positions such as ATO where they oversee the cultures and as many as eight restaurants or the team leader where they oversee an average of 12 to 15 restaurants. A few of our restaurateurs have even gone beyond team leader into team director roles with leadership response ability for around 50 restaurants and overseeing over a 1,000 people.","And I\u2019m pleased and proud to announce that we\u2019ve achieved the first during this quarter. For the very first time we\u2019ve had a leader who started out his crew advanced to GM then restaurateurs through the field leader ranks to the position of executive team director. Pedro Huichalaf (Ph) is the first person at Chipotle to make the journey from crew member to executive team director and we\u2019re certain there will soon be more. Pedro began working as a crew member in Denver. He proved himself to be a top performer with a knack of making the people around him perform at their very best and became a restaurateur at our Almeida and Logan restaurant in Denver in 2007. In 2009, Pedro was promoted to apprentice team leader, after all three of the restaurants he mentored as a restaurateur become restaurateurs themselves on the very same day. From there Pedro progressed to a team leader position in very short order, in 2012 he was promoted to the team director in Arizona where he helped develop a deep bench of strong future leaders, now he has been named executive team director where we will lead our restaurants in Arizona, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Portland and Vancouver. We\u2019re extremely proud of Pedro and his accomplishments and are certain that he will have an even bigger impact on the company in his new capacity, where he\u2019ll continue to do what he does best, which is elevate and develop the people around him. Pedro\u2019s story is special in that he\u2019s the first person at Chipotle to make the journey from crew to exec team director, but others are ascending all the time, from crew to restaurant management and field leadership. In fact we recently promoted along with Pedro, four other long time leaders to exec team director positions. Ron Cedio became an exec team directory as did T. Old, Frank Evans and Barry Coke, bringing us to nine executive team directors nationwide and giving us a stronger field leadership team and better development opportunities in markets around the country. Empowered teams of top performers do everything better, they prepare and serve better tasting food, they create a wonderful environment where the restaurant is clean and inviting, they lead a team that\u2019s warm and hospitable and they deliver terrific customer service. One important element of delivering great customer service is you\u2019ve heard us say over and over is faster throughput and once again faster throughput contributed during the quarter as we saw an average increase of seven transactions at our peak lunch hour from 12 to 1pm, and we also saw seven additional transactions during the peak dinner hour between 6 and 7pm with the dinner count during that hour growing faster than the all-day count. And in one of our busiest days of the week, Friday we saw an increase of 11 transactions during our peak lunch hour between 12 and 1pm. Our restaurant teams have focused on great execution of what we call the four pillars of throughput which has once again led to record throughput during the season the first quarter when throughput is historically at a low point during the year. We attribute this better execution to our ability to observe and report on how well each restaurant and each field leader is delivering on each of these four pillars. As a reminder the four pillars of throughput are using a linebacker at peak hours, proper mise en place, having aces in their places and using a dedicated expeditor at peak times. By knowing exactly what\u2019s happening in each of our restaurants and where to focus our efforts to drive better execution and understand what might be holding us back, we have been able to make consistent progress in this very important area of our customer service. Over the past year we\u2019ve seen our execution for three of the four pillars of throughput, that is to say expo, linebacker and mise en place, improved from an average score of around 65% to 70% during the first review to over 90% during the most recent review, so we think our field teams have done a great job focusing on and driving this important initiative over the past year. We\u2019re excited that our teams are ready to break new throughput records in the second quarter of the year, which is typically our busiest time of year and we can build on the throughput momentum that we\u2019ve developed during the past few quarters. Customers in all of our markets except New York City and can now enjoy Chipotle catering and we plan to roll catering to New York City later this year. Catering sales continue to approach 1% of our total sales and we\u2019re optimistic that catering will ramp up in the second quarter with the graduation season approaching. Some more people can have a chance to try it. As we gain momentum with our catering we still think we can get better at improving the program from an operations perspective. While most of our customers really enjoy the customer experience we\u2019re providing with catering we want to focus on making sure that orders are ready on time that they\u2019re sealed completely and accurately and if there\u2019s a seamless handoff to our restaurants from the customer order process. As we continue to execute this program through our high standards, and as more customers discover and experience catering for themselves, we\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019re going to see continued growth in catering. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the first quarter and believe that we have the pieces in place both in terms of our food culture and people culture, to continue to deliver a terrific dining experience for our customers and strong results for our shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over the Jack.","","Jack Hartung ","","Thanks, Monty. We\u2019re delighted that more and more people are choosing to visit our restaurants every day, our top performing crews and managers continue to provide an exceptional dining experience to our guests by providing great service and serving delicious meals made from premium ingredients. And this has led to our strong sales momentum which accelerated into the first quarter. Our sales increased 24.4% in the quarter to $904.2 million, the sales increase is driven by a very strong sales comp of 13.4% in from new restaurant openings. We\u2019re very happy to report that the 13.4% sales comp represents the highest quarterly comp we\u2019ve experienced in nearly eight years since the second quarter of 2006. Back then our average restaurant volumes were under $1.5 million while this strong comp has pushed our average restaurant volumes above $2.2 million for the first time. The comp was driven primarily by increased customer visits and while weather in the quarter certainly created volatility we believe there was not a net overall negative impact from weather in the quarter. While sales were understandably down during days of extreme winter weather when the weather improved our sales recovered to a higher level than before the extreme weather for a few days, before settling back into a normal sales trend. The comp also benefited from an increase in the average check of about 2% and we benefitted by about 1% from an extra trading day as Easter was in the first quarter of last year. Average check in the quarter was up from last year due to an increase in side orders mostly chips and guac and extra meat and from an increasing catering. Catering continues to represent just about 1% of sales and the average catering order is nearly $300 so it has an obvious positive impact on the average check.","Based on the strong comp momentum, we have increased our comp guidance and now expect our comp to be in the high single-digit for the full year before the impact of any price increase which I\u2019ll talk about a little later. Q1 comp benefited by 100 basis points from initial trading data share, we will lose that day with Easter moving to the second quarter, so there is effectively 200 basis points expected drop when moving from Q1 to Q2 just based on this trading day shift. And comp comparison become more challenging each quarter as the Q1 comp from last year was 1% and a comp momentum increase each quarter to 5.5% in Q2, 6.2% in Q3 and 9.3% in Q4 of last year.","Restaurant level margins decreased 40 basis points to 25.9%; the lower margins were driven by higher food cost partially offset by favorable sales leverage in labor and occupancy costs. Operating margins decreased by 150 basis points to 15% primarily from higher G&A costs and lower restaurant level margins. G&A costs were higher by 130 basis points than a year ago, which I\u2019ll talk about in more detail shortly.","Food cost rose a little faster than expected to 34.5% in the quarter up 150 basis points from the first quarter of 2013, and sequentially they were up 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2013. The sequential increase was due to higher beef and dairy costs and in terms of the year-over-year increase food costs were higher primarily due to inflation in beef, avocados and cheese.","Beef prices are expected to continue to move higher as supplier remains tight while livestock producers try to rebuild the herds and recover from two years record droughts. And generally U.S. beef prices has set recent all-time highs. And our steak prices have also hit all-time high recently, rising 11% in the quarter compared to Q4 and despite another 14% in April so far. So our steak is up 25% already since the fourth quarter. Cheese prices are also expected to be up over 10% this year and avocado costs will also continue to rise as we\u2019re just now entering the season of buying avocados from California again.","California production of avocados is expected to be down about 30% compared to last year even though demand is expected to increase. And while we haven\u2019t felt the effects of the recent hog virus on the supplier front, supply challenges and pricing pressure may happen later this year. With all of this rising inflationary pressure our food costs will be nearly 36% during April and are likely to push past that 36% over the next two quarter before the impact of any price increase.","With all of this food inflation we have seen so far and expect to continue to see, we\u2019ve decided to increase our menu prices. It\u2019s been nearly three years until last company wide price increase and while we want to remain successful to our customers, we need to pass along these rapidly rising food costs.","We\u2019re currently reviewing our menu price on a market-by-market basis compared to competitors and based on our analysis so far we plan to increase prices on average somewhere in the mid-single-digits. We expect we will start installing the menu boards with higher prices later this quarter and finish installation by early in the third quarter.","Labor costs were 23% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. Labor leverage was driven by higher sales volumes partially offset by stronger management staffing ratios and normal wage inflation. Our restaurant teams have done a better job of having the right number of staff and managers in the restaurants which leads to developing a stronger pipeline of future leaders as well as better restaurant execution including better throughput.","Occupancy cost for the quarter were 6.1% of sales a decrease of 50 basis points from last year due to favorable sales leverage. Other operating costs were 10.5% for the quarter flat as a percentage of sales. Marketing was 1.3% in the quarter and our combined marketing and promotional costs as a percent of sales were the same as last year.","Overall for 2014, we expect our marketing expense to be around 1.6% to 1.7% of sales with relatively higher marketing costs expected during the second quarter and third quarter, as we kick off our better ingredients advertising campaign in over 30 markets and over 1,000 restaurants. The campaign will help customers better understand and connect how cooking with natural and high quality ingredients leads to better tasting food.","G&A was 7.4% in the quarter up 130 basis points from last year. G&A was higher as a percentage of revenue primarily from higher non-cash non-economic stock comp and from about $2.5 million in higher legal costs in part due to a recent settlement. Stock comp expense was $28 million in the quarter which is up $12 million from last year. For the full year 2014, we expect non-cash stock comps to total about $98 million or an increase of about $33 million over last year.","Now this is higher than our guidance than last earnings call of $90 million as the non-cash accounting charge related to stock options increased when our stock price surged after our fourth quarter earnings release but just before the options were granted.","The number of options granted has grown only modestly each year but the non-economic non-cash stock comp has increased significantly over the years as a result of the accounting charge being calculated based on our rising stock price. As a result of the higher non-cash stock comp expense and our all manager conference in third quarter, we expect our G&A costs in 2014 to increase about 50 to 60 basis points overall over 2013.","Now this is slightly above the 40 basis points increase we talked about in February and that\u2019s due solely to the higher non-cash stock comp I just described. So just one last point about the stock comp, as I mentioned the full year noncash charge will total about $98 million but a disproportionate or about $62 million will be expensed in the first half of the year. This is because of the accounting rules require that we fully expensed the charge for any employee was eligible for retirement over six months rather than amortized the charge over the three-year vesting period. Most of our senior management team qualifies for retirement or they will qualify before the end of the three-year period.","During the quarter, average restaurant volumes increased to a new record of $2,226,000 and we\u2019re optimistic that our averaged store volume can continue to improve as more people discover Chipotle and become loyal customers. Our new restaurants continue to perform very well with new restaurants volumes opening at or above $1.6 million to $1.7 million communicated range. During the quarter, we opened 44 new restaurants compared to 48 restaurants at this time last year. And our full year guidance remains at opening between 180 and 195 new restaurants in 2014.","Our effective tax rate was 39.1% in the quarter and we expect our annual effective tax rate will also be 39.1% and that compares to 38.7% in 2013. This rate increase is the result of the expiration of the work opportunity tax credit and the R&D tax credit that benefited us in 2013 and is partially offset by a lower estimated state tax rate. Effective tax rate of 39.1% in the quarter is 270 basis points higher than Q1 of last year, as remember last year\u2019s first quarter reflected the tax benefit from the work opportunity tax credit and R&D credit on a retroactive basis for all of 2012.","Diluted earnings per share of the quarter was $2.64, an increase of 7.8%. Our balance sheet continues to remain very strong and we finish the quarter with over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents for the first time ever including short-term and long-term interest-bearing investment and with no debt. We continue to believe the best use of our cash is to invest in our high returning restaurants but we\u2019ll also opportunistically buy participate in share buybacks and we\u2019ll continue to nurture our growth seeds. ShopHouse, Chipotle and international markets and Pizzeria Locale each of which we expect will provide future opportunity to invest in growth.","During the quarter, we purchased about $13 million in our stock over 23,000 shares at an average share price of $548. At the end of the first quarter, we still have about $77 million left in our share buyback program previously approved by our Board of Directors and our Board recently approved another $100 million share buyback. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve invested over $622 million to repurchase stock at an average price of $153.","Thanks for your time today, and at this point, we\u2019d be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from David Palmer with RBC. Please go ahead.","Eric Gonzalez - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, this is actually Eric Gonzalez in for David Palmer. Congrats on the strong traffic growth in the quarter. We were wondering if you could focus on marketing for a second. You recently mentioned how you were changing your local store marketing efforts and maybe if you could talk about the changes you made and maybe assess what has worked well for you? And then on the digital side, do you expect to increase usage of digital marketing in the near term? Is that something that could be a 2015 event? And then maybe what you've learned on the digital side so far?","Steve Ells","So in terms of the local store marketing, we revamped the way we deploy the team. We now have 36 marketing specialist across the country. They each create detailed plans based on the market experiences and the needs of the restaurants. Most importantly though I think most impact has been derived from the marketing specialists spending time with restaurant managers and the restaurant teams developing ways that they can customize programs and reach out directly to individual customers, local businesses, schools, sports teams, hospitals, community events like races, foot races, bicycle races things like this. So there are a number of customized programs that they developed, and then we usually developed custom currency that we can distribute during these events. So it\u2019s not a one size fits all, in fact it\u2019s for a company the size of Chipotle it\u2019s very unique and in that super-super nimble and able to reach out on folks on a very individualized basis which I think has really gone to creating a very, very strong bond and trust with our customers. It reminds me of the way I used to reach out to the local community when I ran just one restaurant. And I think to be able to have 1500 restaurants in United States that act like individual modern hops where the restaurant manager and restaurateur and his or her team can be a part of that community and that fabric just helps to strengthen the specialness of Chipotle. ","So on digital, there is really a lot of elements on digital and so I\u2019ll try and touch on all of them. First of all, we\u2019ve always done some marketing on a number of digital outlets. We\u2019re active on Twitter, we\u2019re active on Facebook. We provide digital offers as well. So we\u2019ll continue to do that I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily that will ramp up. But one of the things I think that we\u2019re really proud of is that our marketing has smart conversation. And so when we do things like Farmed and Dangerous so we do things like the Scarecrow, it creates conversation that people are curious about people are interested in. And so we see lots of activity that our customers are engaging in through Twitter, through Facebook, kind of on their own.","And so is that really marketing? I guess not technically but it\u2019s really exactly what we intended when our marketing team when Mark Crumpacker and his team come up with things like Farmed and Dangerous it really says very little bit about Chipotle it\u2019s not really marketing in the traditional sense at all but boy oh boy its sparked conversation and that sparked that conversation with social media such as Facebook and Twitter really cascade very, very quickly and so there is discussion about where food comes from and how it is raised. And we have this belief that the more that curiosity is sparked and more than conversation carries on the better it is for Chipotle.","And then the final piece here is you\u2019ve heard us talk about we\u2019ve been testing mobile payments opportunity. That\u2019s going well. We expect that we will introduce that to our customers at least in one market, sometime this summer and we think that once we start engaging in a mobile payments opportunity like that with our customers we now have an opportunity to have personalized conversation with them as well and we communicate with them through text messages and through other opportunity once we have kind of this relationship between us and their mobile payments apps.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird Co.","Good afternoon, and congratulations on the sales momentum here same. May be...","Steve Ells","It\u2019s still morning David.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird Co.","I wanted to ask about may be the cost outlook and Jack I think you mentioned that you\u2019re continuing the effort put pressure on commodity prices you\u2019ve decided to take a price increase. Could you frame up where you think the cost ratio might be heading without that price increase in the second half? I thought you said over 36%. But maybe if you can provide some more granularity on how you think this plays out so that we can model it more precisely.","Jack Hartung","Yes we think David that April alone even though we\u2019re not done with the month but just based on the commodity costs we\u2019ve seen so far with avocados are up because of buying from California stake is up for the reasons I mentioned and that\u2019s not Chipotle only thing beef prices in U.S. in general are at all-time highs right now. And so those have really spiked recently. And then based on expected price increases in cheese we think April will be right at about 36% we think we could push in the second and third quarters, pushed half of that hopefully not too far pas that. We\u2019re hopeful by the fourth quarter that will settle a little bit the avocado pricing pressure we\u2019re seeing is more of a cyclical based on buying from California and based on this year in general, supply is going to be a little bit low you\u2019ve heard us talk in the past that avocado supply tends to be in every other year thing that when you have one good year the next year seem to be a little bit light and we\u2019re in kind of that light year this year. So we\u2019re hopeful that the fourth quarter will settle a bit and be something under 36% I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do a very good job of predicting it precisely but I would guess it would be in may be 35% to 36% range before considering the price increase.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird Co.","Okay, thank you. And then as I think about pricing so you haven\u2019t raised prices in three years and I just want to kind of come back to your long term philosophy on raising prices and what you implement this price increase you could continue to see pressure it seems like on some of these item. So I\u2019m just kind of curious to know how quickly you\u2019re willing to come back to the market on pricing if you needed it in 2015 or \u201916 or is this going to be more kind of an every couple of years type of strategy?","Jack Hartung","Well I would say neither David and what I mean by that is we don\u2019t focus very much on the timing and so we don\u2019t kind of think today let\u2019s raise prices and then raising again or let\u2019s raise prices now and not raise them again for two or three years. What we think more about is making sure that we earn pricing power. And if we focus on that, if we focus on creating a wonderful restaurant experience and cooking and serving delicious food that we have the permission to raise prices. And if we know as we do the job with that, then picking the timing of it is less relevant it\u2019s just not that important. And generally we\u2019ve been patient in terms of raising prices we have this luxury of being patient.","Now what we seen so far and looking at market by market pricing we believe we\u2019ve got a lot of pricing power, we feel very comfortable that if we raise prices somewhere in that mid-single digit range we still got room. So we\u2019re not going to spend all of the pricing power we built up over time we still have some in the bank. And so if we need to come back at some point in the future let\u2019s say next year we would have the ability to do that and then we will go through the normal process that we go through considering inflation, considering transactions trends, considering remaining accessible because as you know we want to remain accessible to our customers so that everyone can enjoy to dine at Chipotle. We\u2019ll go through that same consideration but the thing that we\u2019re most pleased about is that we have built up quite a bit of information to raise prices and yet we won\u2019t cash in on all that pricing ability, right now. So we\u2019ll still have some in the back.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","","I was probably trying to find fault in great quarters. But in this case there were I think a number of cost issues and they didn\u2019t just relate to the foods I just want to explore those. First, Jack when you look at the labor ratio your labor dollars per store grew at the highest rate it\u2019s grown in several years, even in other quarters we\u2019ve had very strong transaction driven comp. So was there something unique in -- did we run out of initiatives this quarter, so you\u2019re seeing labor inflation, was there some inefficiencies and sort of what happened in labor this quarter?","Jack Hartung","","A couple of things John, one last year we were benefiting during most of the quarters from a reduced over time compared to the year before and so that ran out that ran of course. And so we\u2019re not getting any kind of benefit from doing a better job at managing over time. We had parts of the country mostly in the Northeast that had excessive overtime cost in 2012 and so as we compare it in 2013 and doing a better job in managing over time our labor leverage was better to those quarters, that kind of ran its course.","In terms of inefficiencies, we probably have about 20 or 30 basis points or so, in ideal theoretical calculation of what\u2019s possible of additional labor leverage. And the reason that didn\u2019t happen is our teams have been focused on doing a better job at staffing the restaurants. And so if their sales volumes suggest they should have 28 people on their team instead of 24, we\u2019re now doing a better job of getting close to that 28 and are giving down the hours. They are staffing for the four pillars and so we\u2019re doing a better job of having the right number of people on the roster and both at the crew level and at the manager level. So we have a deeper bench of top performers that we now are confident can be promoted up to kitchen manager, service manager, et cetera. And so our teams are better staffed are scheduled and we\u2019re scheduling a full team, especially during our peak hours.","And so we\u2019re getting better results and so I will trade that 20 or 30 basis points, that\u2019s theoretical for better throughput for a deeper bench and a fuller staff of crew and managers. It\u2019s possible over time but we\u2019re not going to rush into it, it\u2019s possible over time, we might be able to capture that 20 or 30 basis points. But I would consider that to be a relatively small inefficiency or investment to get the operating results that we\u2019ve seen.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s helpful. And then on the G&A line I think even excluding the stock based comp and the litigation, G&A dollars grew and rough calculation was like still up 30%, no matter if that\u2019s right or not but is there anything unusual of G&A other than those two items that would have grown faster than it will grow through rest of this year?","Steve Ells","No I mean we did have, our bonus is up a little bit John probably because the quarter was good, it was up a little bit as a true up from last year\u2019s bonuses a couple of small things here and there. I think if you take out the non-cash stock comp and take out for the full year I am taking about now. If you take out the non-cash stock comp take out the manager conference which will cost $8 million this later year, and you look at it year-over-year. I think we\u2019ll have some slight leverage in our G&A. so I think our spending is in pretty good shape.","We have added a number of people to our ranks in the past year to support our growth. But I would say there is nothing out of the ordinary underneath our G&A, it\u2019s still leveraging slightly and overtime, hopefully we\u2019ll have the opportunity to leverage even more as we kind of grow into the recent headcount additions.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","And then just I guess the, does the pricing take care of all this in other words operating margin expand in the back half given food inflation and given all the other things you just talked about enough to do that?","Steve Ells","It depends on what happens in the back half of the year but based on our expectations I will expect our margins will expand.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","","Jack I didn\u2019t quite hear if you said any sort of update on where things are running in the second quarter, short-term but just what the comparison and 200 basis points on the trading day, just any help you can offer on kind of how\u2019s the second quarter so far?","Jack Hartung","In April so far I would say that the underlying trends are comparable to what we saw in the first quarter. And so I think if you take into account that we\u2019re losing a couple of hundred basis points compared to the first quarter in terms of trading day and it\u2019s a tougher comparison. But it you adjust for those, the underlying kind of transactions that I am seeing and the underlying sales that we\u2019re seeing are comparable to the first quarter.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Great, and then just when you enter the pricing timing, can you run through that just one more time in terms of when the pricing will be fully rolled out to the system the kind of mid second quarter and things like that.","Jack Hartung","I would expect it will be fully rolled out to all of our markets by early in the third quarter, I mean I suppose it\u2019s possible we might be able to accelerate and get it done by the end of the second. But I would say by early into third quarter we\u2019ll have new menu boards with new prices in all our markets.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. And then just one other quick one. Monty, you talked about the throughput improvements at peak periods. Can you remind us what your average peak lunch transactions are and peak dinner transactions just so we have kind of a foundation there?","Monty Moran","Yes, we talk about specific what those numbers are, but they\u2019re sort of in that between 110 and 120 range during the Friday\u2019s at peak lunch and a little lower than that when you look at Monday through Friday. And that\u2019s for the first quarter we expect that in the second quarter and probably third quarters as well. We will see those increase hopefully even substantially because the first quarter is our slowest time of year in terms of what we would expect in terms of throughput and yet we\u2019ve derived these wonderful throughput improvement where even our peak lunch and dinner hours nearly kept up with all day comp numbers in terms of being able to put more people through at those peak hours.","So it\u2019s really difficult in fact in terms of the absolute number we put through. The number of people per hour the day we have bigger games during lunch and dinner than any other time of the day. We have seven more people they\u2019ll be put to the line on average per restaurant during those times of the day when our lines are longest. So we\u2019re very-very proud of our field teams for accomplishing that, but we also know that our field - and our field teams know that now is really when that game begins because now is when our peak season is descending upon us when will be busier and we\u2019ll have an opportunity to really-really hit the ball out of the park on these throughput numbers as we execute the four pillars hopefully as flawlessly as we ever have and thereby giving much-much better customer experience to everybody. So we\u2019re proud of the absolute numbers of I think particularly in light of the fact that the first quarter is not one of the places where we usually set records and we did.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","Awesome quarter. When you think about catering what kind of customer feedback are you getting? And I\u2019m specifically wondering if you would consider delivery or test it.","Steve Ells","Thanks Nicole, and with catering most of our customers comments -- a lot of customers comments are coming in that are just very delighted that we have it in the first place. It\u2019s something less than 1% of comments are still frustrated where they\u2019re being late or things not being put together correctly. And I think that we\u2019re still working out some bugs in that regard but we\u2019re proud generally how our restaurants teams are accomplishing catering. In terms of delivery, it\u2019s not something we\u2019re particularly to get involved with at this point throughout the country with the possible exception as Manhattan, but with really catering right now and our customers are pleased to be built the comment and carry these very - and we package things in a very easy way where our customers can carry even a fairly large catering order out and taken home with them.","And I think that while some people would like us to deliver, our fear would be that putting in place at delivery model we change unit economic of the catering program and make is more difficult for us to price it competitively. And I think if you put delivery in, I mean, let\u2019s say one out of ten people would like delivery right now, I think that if you offer delivery, six out of ten might take it. And so I think that something like that and we\u2019re just making these numbers up basically we don\u2019t want put delivery in place and end up costing the ability to be really competitive and to deliver this food to folks at this terrific price in this really fun way. We don\u2019t want to drive the prices up by breaking the unit economics of it. So I don\u2019t think you will see us doing wholesale delivery programming in catering for foreseeable future.","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","Very helpful. And I also forgot to ask, are most of those catering orders coming in online?","Steve Ells","Well, it is a combination of online and also through a call service that we have in place.","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","Right. Does it -- is it weighted towards one or the other?","Steve Ells","It comes to a call center at the third party down there and then they decide -- they pass it onto the restaurant and make sure that it is taken care.","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","Oh, okay. I just didn't know if there was online. ","Steve Ells","Catering per se doesn\u2019t come in, we have online orders for multiple orders and Jack is telling me right now it\u2019s coming. So in terms of being able to do online orders for catering that\u2019s still something we\u2019re working on.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Andy Barish - Jefferies","A couple of things just wondering your impressions on sort of has the value gap for Chipotle kind of widened, meaning the time you\u2019ve taken between pricing increases has shown up in customers\u2019 perceived value being a lot higher? And then secondly, just on the throughput, again sort of more theoretical, but how are you balancing speed versus kind of the hospitality side of things in the restaurants if you could?","Steve Ells","All that\u2019s to the throughput question and pass on to Jack to talk about the pricing value proposition, but with regard to throughput I think the notion of fast throughput somewhat degrading the customer experience is the wrong -- we look at that as being the wrong way to look at it in fact the way we work on throughput it basically to understand that those things that that best in terms of hospitality things like clear communication, great eye contact, friendliness along the line, efficiency along the line, sense of urgency. All of those things are the things that compose a great customer experience at Chipotle. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so insisting on having top performers in that places on the line and all that.","However, not only are those things, the things that generate the best possible customer experience, those same things happened to be the things that generate the fastest throughput. So, I would literally tell you that as our throughput gets faster you can count on our hospitality not only not the grading but actually getting better us having better and better communications and more and more prepared, so that our actions on the line look not hurry, but fluid. And we\u2019re not operating with the sense of panic but rather we have a team of top performers who look very, very comfortable and are very comfortable serving customers.","If you look at our fastest throughput in our restaurants in the whole country, those restaurants tend to be the ones that actually have the best customer service. So, if you were to go survey everyone in our lines, they would all want faster throughput. And while occasionally we do get a comment from someone who is perhaps very new to Chipotle says I felt rushed through the line. When we look into those comments and contact those customers it\u2019s almost really never that they were rushed it\u2019s because we did something wrong, we didn\u2019t listen to them carefully or didn\u2019t give them what they wanted, not because of speed, so faster food equals great customer service through and through.","Monty Moran","And Andy on the consumer view of the price value, when we dig into why consumers think that Chipotle is a good value sure price is the piece of it but the bigger piece of it is the experience, it\u2019s [indiscernible] who they trust where the ingredients are coming from, they can see the open kitchen and so they feel good about seeing their food made in front of them. And so, and they love the taste of it, of the food. We get lots of comments about how friendly our crews are, how hospitable our crew are and so most of the value comes from the experience. Our pricing certainly is affordable and in fact when you compare our pricing to others in the fast casual (Ph) we\u2019re often cheaper and we should be able to be more expensive because we spend more on our ingredient for sure.","But our customers don\u2019t place a big part of the value that they -- value scores that they gave us which are very, very high. A smaller part of that is attributed to price alone which is different than what customers of other restaurants might say. So we feel good that if we focus on the things that we focus on, great experience, great food, great teams they\u2019re creating a wonderful dining experience that our customers will continue to see Chipotle as a great value and they\u2019ll continue to be willing to spend a little bit more money and really it\u2019s just a little bit more money for this wonderful dining experience that we offer them.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Keith Siegner with UBS. Please go ahead.","Keith Siegner - UBS","Thank you, and congratulations for the restaurateur that are the ones out there managing that transaction growth on a day to day basis this is very impressive. Monty thank you very much for all the color around the four pillars how this is helping increase serve independent throughput. Asides the four pillars are there other opportunities to grow the transaction how is the users say the online order ahead is this helping contribute to the traffic growth, are there other alternatives aside from just the four pillars it could be an opportunity to keep that transaction growth is that growing? Thanks.","Monty Moran","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I mean we looked at it in different ways over the years. I think when we first really started to put our eyes on throughput in 2006 we were a little I would say a little bit gadget focused. We were concerned about having a second cash register and how that would increase throughput and if you look back corner you will see a comment from me seven or eight years ago stating that the second cash register can increase our throughput 40% and in fact that was true at the time. But then what we started to discover is there were places where we\u2019d add the second register and throughput would go up 40% and we removed the second registered and throughput would stay the same although be the higher.","And so we knew there was something more to it. Then later we added cash -- change machines that would automatically dispense the change to the customer and that did increased too further bit because it took a second or two or three of the job that our cashier had to do and so that was an effective thing. And then we try to handheld ordering system which is still in operation in few restaurants. But what we kept finding is no matter how much of the sort gimmicks we added or how much we used, tried to use technology to increase our throughput nothing could compete with the restaurants that had I guess I\u2019ll say two things. One is having a restaurant tour team, having a team of all top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards.","To make a long story short, great teams are just faster and better. But another thing was the teams, the best of the teams that we\u2019re aware of and efficient at implementing these four pillars of throughput and so as we started to notice that the four pillars dwarfed any other efforts that we put in place to increase throughput we decided that has to be our focus particularly because we still have a significant number of restaurants but don\u2019t consistently execute the four pillars. There are some other things though that we\u2019re looking at one I guess credit cards continue to be a more and more significant part they grow in terms of the percentage of our transactions that are paid from their credit cards and that helps us because credits cards are still faster than cash. And we\u2019ve done a lot to make sure that that\u2019s true over the years and making sure that the time between swipe and a print out of the receipt is very, very fast and now it\u2019s just a few seconds at Chipotle. And as you know we don\u2019t require signatures except over a certain dollar amount, so that\u2019s up. I think also through online ordering that gives us a great opportunity to increase throughput as well because we prepare those orders on our second line and when those folks when they come in they are not in our main line and so that allows us the throughput to go quicker. So certainly online ordering is an ongoing opportunity that we\u2019re consistently working to increase.","So those are number of things, I think also in time we\u2019ve worked of course the technology to make credit cards go faster, taping the credit cards and what not. So anyway there is a lot of things we\u2019re focused on, but I think you\u2019ll see for the foreseeable future execution of these four pillars will be our top priority while I should say the second priority, the first priority is sending a restaurant team carried off.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities.","Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities","","I want to ask a question on the minimum wage specially in California, I mean ex pricing how we should think about that impacting the labor line going forward and there is another one coming next year again plus we have the healthcare headwinds kicking in little bit more. Maybe you can just kind of remind us what the impact we should expect?","Jack Hartung","Yeah the California minimum wage this summer is going to increase to $9 and it\u2019s actually not next year it\u2019s two years from now in 2016 we\u2019ll increase again to I believe to $10. We have already being paying, we\u2019ve always been above minimum wage, we have been hiring in California between $8 and $9 and starting at the first this year, we\u2019ve been hiring at $9. So we\u2019ve already been kind of early adopting this first, until there is very little effect I would call it at a companywide level negligible effect. There will be a bigger effect when the minimum wage increased to $10 in California in a couple of years, but even that is in the range of few million dollars not tens of million dollars. So we can certainly absorb that.","And I am sorry, Nick what was the second part of your question?","Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities","It\u2019s the healthcare impact, if you guys could remind us what that is expected?","Steve Ells","So the healthcare impact, that will depend -- we are planning on offering healthcare to all of our hourly crew that meets requirements that work to 30 hours or more per week, which most of our crew more than half of our crew do work more than 30 hours, we\u2019re planning on offering an insurance plan, a credible insurance plan to those folks. What we don\u2019t know is how many will accept it. Our estimates is that this will cost somewhere around or below 1% of sales. But we won\u2019t know that for sure until we offer insurance and then we can see how many people adopt it versus how many people decide not to take the insurance.","Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities","Got it. And I am just shifting a little bit on the unit growth side. Are you guys seeing more opportunities with some of the construction increasing, I know in the past that\u2019s been a little bit of the limit on how fast you can add new units, but does seem like it\u2019s becoming a little bit more of the tail wind. So can you potentially see the unit growth or the additions at least increase little bit going forward?","Steve Ells","I mean right now what gives us great optimism is the fact that impact from new restaurants is very, very low; it\u2019s below 1% and has been below 1% every year for quite some time. And so in terms of the pipeline of new restaurants that we\u2019re able to find and build we have a significant new pipeline and believe we\u2019ll be able to level our restaurant openings throughout the rest of this year, and which will put us well on Phase 2 to hit the numbers that we\u2019ve suggested that we\u2019ll hit in terms of new store openings.","So we feel very, very good about that. Now in terms of being able to accelerate that number, there is always a possibility to accelerate that number and what we always do is sort of balance the quality the real estate we\u2019re able to find with our ability to have great people to run those restaurants and we\u2019re feeling as I talked about during my opening comments we\u2019re feeling very, very good about the pipeline of leaders that are moving up to the ranks. And the probabilities having even faster pace of restaurant development due in large parts of use of the plan tool and our use of that device to help people make sure they have plans in place.","And so the people pipeline we feel is really strong, the real estate pipeline is very strong. I think you\u2019ll see us continue to be careful and measured in terms of how we add restaurants, so we continue to add these joyful new store openings that deliver great customer experiences.","Operator","Thank you. And we do have time for one final question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Matthew Difrisco with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is Katherine in for Matt here and thanks for taking my question. I just have a question on the G&A line, I think you said it will be up 50 to 60 bps but you\u2019re keeping the 90 million non-cash stock based comp. So since you have higher in 1Q, does it mean it will be evenly spread out meaning lighter in the reaming quarter. And then also can you talk about the litigation cost, like what\u2019s in it? And then should we consider as a one-time nature?","Jack Hartung","So on the non-cash stock comp, and it\u2019s actually 98 million in total for the year, 28 million hit in the first quarter, 62 million will hit in the first half of the year that means 34 million will hit in the second quarter and that will level up to around 20 million in third quarter and around 50 million in the fourth quarter. And so by the time we get to the fourth quarter the non-cash stock comp is close to half of what it was in the first quarter, so that\u2019s why G&A in the first quarter is quite high, but it will level off over time and normalize over time and keep in mind that\u2019s all non-cash to journal entry you know those amounts are never paid and so but it spread unevenly throughout the year and then your second question I\u2019m sorry was\u2026","","Unidentified analyst","","It\u2019s on the allocation.","","Jack Hartung","We\u2019re not going to comment on specifically what that was about, we did have more activity during the quarter and so we don\u2019t feel like the activity that happened in the quarter will be something that will occur, litigation is hard to predict perfectly but we do think that the quarter was a little bit unusually high and we would hope that it would settle back down to normal charges for the rest of the year.","","Unidentified analyst","Okay, if I can just have one more follow up, can you talk about the volume that you\u2019re seeing in ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale and also the international.","Steve Ells","When I comment specifically you know, the volumes there\u2019s lots of - actually it\u2019s really important about Pizzeria Locale above ShopHouse and Chipotle international and the volumes is just one of them. What I can tell you is that the volumes for all of our proceeds they\u2019re behaving similarly in general to how we saw Chipotle going into early markets back when Chipotle was kind of unknown, you know back in the early 2000 or so, and so there\u2019s a discovery process and so restaurants don\u2019t open up at the same levels the Chipotle in US does but as the discovery process happened we\u2019re seeing more and more people come in, we\u2019re seeing the traffic increase and we\u2019re seeing patterns that are very similar to what we saw with Chipotle in the early days and we find that to be very encouraging and so, but we\u2019re not disclosing volumes, that\u2019s just one very small piece, one little sound bite of everything that we\u2019re looking at in terms of the quality of the food, the quality of the people, the quality of the customer experience. So we\u2019re not talking about specific volumes.","","Alex Spong","All right thanks everyone for joining, and we\u2019ve exceeded our time for the call but we thank for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.

For customers who are interested in something smaller, we also offer catering option of chips and salsa with guacamole; and for customers who need smaller group meal options, we are continuing to offer our Burrito by the Box for groups of six or more. Overall, we are pleased with how our catering program is progressing in the Denver market. ","On April 15, we expanded it to 144 more restaurants, including the rest of our Rocky Mountain region as well as restaurants in Philadelphia, Nashville, Wisconsin, and Las Vegas. And we are now on track to launch catering to all of our restaurants nationwide by the end of August. Over time, we believe that catering can help us expand our business while also providing our customers with a fun and convenient way to enjoy Chipotle. ","Sofritas, which we began testing in seven San Francisco Bay Area restaurants in late January, has also been performing well. On April 8 we expanded the test of Sofritas to include nearly 100 additional Northern California restaurants. Our marketing team is working on several different fronts to improve our customer awareness and appreciation of Chipotle. ","In March, our marketing team launched our skilfully made advertising campaign which coincides with the start of our busier times in our restaurants. The campaign focuses on the preparation of fresh ingredients and cooking by hand. This outdoor print and radio advertising is planned  for 26 markets throughout the year and supports about 900 of our restaurants around the country. Advertising buys such as this one are intended to keep Chipotle top of mind with customers, which is one of the key elements of our overall marketing strategy. ","In addition to this top of mind advertising, our marketing team is also using local marketing to connect with customers on a local level to help make our restaurants part of the fabric of the communities they serve. This local effort is made up of market-wide programs implemented by our team of more than 30 marketing strategists in 26 key markets around the country. Our marketing team is also using brand marketing to build deeper connections with our customers and create a dialog around issues that are important to Chipotle and to demonstrate how we are working to cultivate a better world. ","Activities in this category include films such as last year\u2019s Back to the Start animated short film as well as events such as our Cultivate festivals and social media and PR efforts. We've just announced the dates for talent line-ups for 3 Cultivate events this year in San Francisco in June, Denver in August, and Chicago in September, and we are also developing other programs for later this year. These programs help customers understand why it\u2019s important to know where their food comes from and how it\u2019s prepared. The more they know, the more likely they will be to appreciate everything we do at Chipotle. ","Finally turning to our longer-term growth opportunities, we plan to open three ShopHouse restaurants in the coming months. With one in Washington DC\u2019s  Georgetown neighborhood and two in Los Angeles, one in Santa Monica and the other in Hollywood. Similarly, the second Chipotle in Paris is under construction, and we expect to open our first restaurant in Frankfurt, Germany later this year. This comes in addition to the six restaurants we currently have in London, five in Canada, and one in Paris. While we continue to be optimistic about these future growth options, including ShopHouse and Chipotle in Europe, the focus of our growth for the foreseeable future will be Chipotle in the United States. ","I will now the call over to Monty. ","Monty Moran","Thanks Steve. Throughout the quarter we continued to make significant strides developing our people and establishing cultures of top performers in our restaurants. I am very happy to have our two new restaurants support officers Gretchen Selfridge and Mike Duffy helping to lead and develop our field and restaurant teams as well as helping to identify and promote the 45 new restaurants that we added during the quarter. ","I am also glad to be seeing a higher percentage of candidates being accepted into the program than ever before as our field teams get better and better at communicating Chipotle\u2019s vision to our restaurants teams. One leader who has demonstrated a special ability to lead his teams to create restaurateur\u00a0 cultures is Doug Netzhammer who was recently promoted to the position of executive team director over our newly created Southwest region. ","Over the past five years, Doug and his team have developed 31 restaurateurs with an amazing selection rate of 94%. As with any of our most successful leaders, Doug knows his success comes from making the people around him better and by developing our field  leaders who impact the restaurants everyday by coaching and inspiring others to be great.","During the quarter, we also promoted forty three restauranteurs to mentor additional restaurants as well as five new apprentice team leaders, eight new team leaders, and two new team directors. To help ensure our restauranteurs are successful when they begin to mentor other nearby restaurants, our training team is developing an R-PLUS training course for them.","We believe this new R-PLUS training, which is taking place in all of our regions will set new restauranteurs up for success by helping them become more effective leaders over multiple restaurants. The accelerated success that we are seeing in developing our people and advancing our culture demonstrates that we have a deeper and stronger bench, and our teams are getting better at understanding what it takes to develop a restauranteur culture.","Elevating and empowering these extraordinary field leaders, allows them to have an even greater impact on developing and leading special people cultures, and these restauranteur cultures result in better, more efficient operations and the special dining experience for our customers.","Of course, one of the ways that Chipotle provides a great customer experience is through excellent throughput. Recall that in 2012, we were able to provide faster throughput during the peak hours of the day as compared to the all-day comp. As we lap the throughput gains we made from last year, these comparisons become more difficult.","In the first quarter of this year, our peak lunch comp from 12 to 1 grew more slowly than our all-day comp, but our peak dinner hour comp from 6 to 7 p.m. did grow slightly faster than the all-day comp. As the second quarter is the busiest time of the year for us, we have asked our field and restaurant teams to bring particular emphasis to the things that lead to excellent throughput. Specifically, we are tasking our restaurant teams and field leaders to make sure that we are fully staffed, so that we have solid teams that are capable of serving the additional customers that visit our restaurants at this time of year.","Next, we are making sure that our field teams and restaurant teams implement the four pillars of great throughput ensuring that restaurant teams have excellent meals (indiscernible) plus that they are ready for the peak hours and having everything prepared and the line set up to serve customers quickly, making sure we have expediters working at all of our restaurants during the peak times who are totally focused on helping our customers move through the cash out process quickly and efficiently.","Scene two is that we always have lined back up position in place to allows our team on the line to focus their full attention and quickly, and efficiently creating a customize meal for each of our customers. And finally making certain that we have aces in their places, meaning that we have our best people at each station and we are not training new hires during rush times. We know from our own experience that when a restaurant follow these four simple steps, our customers will enjoy not only faster throughput but a much better overall customer experience.","At our next earnings call in July, we will know much more about the success of our efforts since some of our busiest time are upon us now. And we expect to report to you that we are better at delivering fast throughput, as our top performing teams work to capitalize on this key advantage that Chipotle has in terms of delivering delicious food quickly.","I want to also update you on our development progress. In addition to the strength of our people culture and operations, our development pipeline remains strong and based upon our great performance, we are confident -- based upon our great performance in the first quarter, we are confident that we are going to deliver on the high end of our guidance range of 165 to 180 new restaurants this year. Of those openings, we expect about 30 restaurants will be A Model locations, those being restaurants which typically have a slightly smaller footprint and lower development occupancy and operating costs.","And you will gradually see more Chipotle restaurants developed in non-traditional locations such as mall food courts. But we have just a few food courts right now. We've been very pleased with the unit economics of those as well as our ability to provide a great Chipotle experience in these venues.","We continued to see a slight increase in the pace of new real estate construction, which we hope will give us even more attractive locations for our development teams to consider. In 2013, we estimate that new construction as opposed to remodel sites will represent 40% of our new store openings, which is up from a lowest 30% in 2010.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Jack, I want to give you an update on the government\u2019s investigation into our hiring practices and related disclosures. This week, we received an additional request for documents from the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys\u2019 Office for the District of Columbia, requesting work authorization documents for all of our employees since 2007 plus employee list and other documents related to work authorization matters.","While, this is just one of numerous requests we have received from the government on course of these three-year investigation, we wanted to make you aware that due to the expanded geographical scope of the latest request. We will continue to cooperate with the government in its investigations, which we believe will be ongoing for quite a while, as it will take some time to comply with these most recent requests and it will also the government some time to digest all the information that we are providing.","I will now turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Hartung","Thanks Monty. We\u2019re very proud of the results we achieved in the first quarter despite an uncertain economic environment and with the difficult comparison. Our top performing crews and managers continue to delight our customers by providing great service while serving delicious food skilfully made with premium ingredients. ","Our sales increased 13.4% in the quarter to $726.8 million driven by new restaurant openings and a sales comp of 1% and the comp was driven mainly by increased traffic and was impacted by two pure trading days compared to last year as our restaurants were closed on Easter and due to lead day in 2012. So without the negative impact of Easter and [Lead Day] our underlying sales comp for the quarter was around 3%. ","Average sales in the quarter was up just 30 basis points as the remaining menu price increase of 70 basis points was offset by selling slightly fewer drinks as a few more customers purchased their meals a go than last year. We\u2019ve now fully lapped the menu price increase taking in Pacific in March 2012. So we will lose 70 basis points in the comp going forward. In the second quarter, the loss of the menu price impact will be offset by taking up one extra day with Easter shifting to the first quarter this year. Taking all these factors into account and considering the still uncertain economy, we reaffirm our full year comp guidance of flat to low single digit before the impact of any future menu price increase. ","Restaurant level margins decreased 110 basis points to 26.3%. The lower margins were primarily driven by higher food costs along with higher occupancy costs. Operating margins increased by 50 basis points to 16.5%. Despite the lower restaurant level margins, SG&A costs were 160 basis points lower than a year ago which I will talk about in more detail shortly.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.45, an increase of 24.4%. Food costs were 33% in the quarter, up 80 basis points from the first quarter of last year. But sequentially food costs were down 50 basis points from Q4 primarily due to lower avocado and dairy costs. In terms of the year-over-year increase food costs were higher due to inflation and our salsas and other produce, chicken and diary which are was partially offset by lower avocado costs. Over the next few quarters we expect food costs will be relatively stable and will remain at or perhaps only slightly above the 33% we saw in Q1. If we do see increases, it\u2019s likely to come from our stake and from seasonally higher avocado costs as we return to buying avocados from California this summer. ","In terms of our future menu price increase, we will continue to monitor food inflation, comp transaction trends, general economic and consumer confidence trends and the menu prices of competitors. Based on our food costs declining from Q4 and the still uncertain economic environment, any price increase we decide to take won\u2019t occur before late summer or early in the fall. ","Labor costs were 23.6% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 10 basis points from last year. Labor leverage is driven by higher sales volumes which includes the benefit of higher menu prices and from more efficient labor-management. We would normally expect labor to delever as just a 1% comp but the effective comp was really more like 3% after taking into account the loss of two days in the quarter which is in the ballpark of the mid-single-digit comp we typically need to hold our labor as a percent of sales. ","Our food costs for the quarter were 6.6% of sales, an increase of 30 basis points from last year primarily due to the deleveraging effect from two less trading days in the quarter. Other operating costs were 10.5% in the quarter, up 20 basis points compared to last year, driven by higher promo and slight delevering in other restaurant related costs. Marketing was 1.2% in the quarter or about the same as Q1 of last year, and overall for 2013 we still expect our marketing expense to be around 1.7% of sales with relatively higher marketing costs during the second and third quarters. ","G&A was 6.1% in the quarter, down 160 points from last year. Recall that Q1 of last year included a one-time catch-up adjustment of $5.6 million for long-term incentive performance shares that were issued in 2010. And last year G&A also included about $3 million related to employee payroll taxes and stock option exercises. For the full year 2013 we expect non-cash stock comp to total about $66 million or about the same as last year. This is lower than our previous guidance of $72 million to $77 million as the calculation of the non-cash accounting charge related to stock options includes the lower volatility rate than originally estimated. ","In the quarter average restaurant volumes remained very strong at $2.1 million and we are confident that our strong unit economic can get even better as more customers discover and choose to visit Chipotle.","Our new restaurants continue to open at or above $1.5 million to $1.6 million communicated range. During the quarter we opened 48 new restaurants compared to 32 restaurants at this time last year.","Effective tax rate was 36.3% for the quarter, which reflected the tax benefit from the work opportunity tax credit and the R&D tax credit related to 2012. In January of this year these credits were renewed by Washington for both 2012 and 2013.","Our first quarter tax rate will be lower than the overall tax rate in 2013 because we recognize all of the 2012 tax benefit from this credit in the first quarter, which benefited earnings by about $0.10 and resulted in Q1 tax rate of 36.3%.","Each of the remaining quarters for this year will have a higher tax rate of approximately 39.1% with the overall blended rate for the year estimated to be about 38.5%. We finished the first quarter with over $700 million in cash and cash equivalent including short-term and long-term interest bearing investment and no debt on our balance sheet.","During the quarter we repurchased about $51 million in our stock or 164,000 shares at share price of $310. Also during the quarter, we received an additional 21,000 shares from our accelerated share repurchase program which ended and settled at an average share price of $287.","At the end of the first quarter we still have about $149 million left on our share buyback program previously approved by our Board of Directors. While we believe that investing in high returning restaurants remain the best use of our cash, we\u2019ll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today and at this we\u2019d be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Steve Ells","You there Sara?","Operator","Caller, your line is open. If you are on a speakerphone, please check your mute function. We\u2019ll move on to Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","Hi. Good morning. I\u2019m just curious, I think, Monty, you\u2019re talking some about throughput and maybe the lunch throughput not quite as robust as the overall comp throughout the day. Can you talk about staffing and whether or not there is some sort of, kind of a logjam with the new governmental requirements you are kind of having to go through or how we think about labor in the stores and whether there is a step up investment necessary to kind of push the volumes beyond the $2.1 million per box?","Monty Moran","Yeah. Thanks Sharon. The answer is no, that nothing that the government is doing, none of their regulations are preventing us from getting plenty of applicants and plenty of new hires for our restaurants.","The reality though is that all of our teams in the field have a vision of creating these restaurateur cultures, and the attributes of a restaurateur culture are to have a team of all top performers who are empowered to achieve very high standards, and the top performer piece of that means that they are getting better and better, being very, very selective in who they bring aboard on and their teams.","So, while we are getting literally 100s and 100s of applications for every available crew position nationwide, especially in light of our new hiring software and Taleo  system, still our teams in the field are being very, very selective in who they bring on Board, and sometimes that can lead to them running with teams that are a little bit more lean than they would like to have because they would rather wait to hire the -- to hire someone who has all of the characteristics of a terrific performer.","So, when we look at the staffing levels of our restaurants, we are always working to have them more -- always working to elevate the staffing, always working to make sure that we have full teams. And when we do that, yeah, that tends to lead to us being much better implementing these four pillars of throughput, particularly in having the expediter position available and the linebacker position available in all of our restaurants.","So, we are constantly looking at staffing. We are wanting to increase our staffing in our restaurants, but we don\u2019t want to sacrifice having terrific people in the restaurants in order to do so. So, it is just a matter of all of our restaurants having a vision of staying ahead -- staying ahead of the game on staffing, particularly as we get in these sort of busier times of the year like the second quarter that we are in now, and so when we do that, we\u2019re very optimistic that we\u2019re going to continue to be able to move the throughout needle that we\u2019ve moved so well over the last seven quarters or so, even though this quarter was, I think, a little disappointing in terms of our ability to move the lunch throughput. ","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair","Can I ask a follow-up? I mean what kind of ballpark figure percentage would you say is kind of ideally staffed in Chipotle system at this point?","Monty Moran","Well, when you talk about percentage, I don\u2019t really know how to put in percentage terms in the sense that we have -- our restaurants have all sorts of different volumes, and so we are talking about numbers of people per restaurant, and so I don\u2019t really understand how I put it in percentage terms.","Jack Hartung","Sharon, there is not -- this is Jack. There is not -- we don\u2019t need to move our labor as a percentage of sales up to get the throughput gains that Monty is talking about. Often times we\u2019ve got enough people, but somebody will call out on a day, and so they don\u2019t show up at the lunch shift or we have got new people and they are not ready to be an ace in their place on the frontline. But in terms of labor as a percentage of sales, we don\u2019t -- there is no need for that percentage to go up in order for us to get the throughput gains that we know are possible.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. ","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","Looking at the results, trying to understand the share repurchase and how that would work for modeling purposes for the rest of the year, can you talk to us about if in fact you are a serial share repurchaser, can we model it and what would be the magnitude because to your point Jack, you now you have accelerated development and really you\u2019re still sitting with $700 million on the balance sheet?","Jack Hartung","Right, yeah, Nicole, we\u2019ve always been opportunistic since we are still a growth company, and we still think that we\u2019ve got significant opportunity over the long term to invest in some high returning assets. We plan to grow seeds which aren\u2019t growth strategies today but we think will turn into growth strategies in the future. And so we know that the best way we can add shareholder value over time is to invest in these very high returning assets. The share purchase has been more of an opportunistic thing for us. While we got the cash on the balance sheet, we\u2019ve taken advantage of inflection points in our stock when the stock has pulled back like it did last year, we got very, very aggressive. The stock has run up recently, and so, we\u2019re less aggressive when the stock has run up. ","We don\u2019t consider ourselves to be perfect at figuring exactly what our stock should be worth at a particular point in time. So, because it moves up and down throughout the year, we get very aggressive on the way down and we get less aggressive on the way up. I would not extrapolate our purchases over the last quarter or two where we\u2019ve been very, very aggressive, maybe it\u2019s been last three quarters now. I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate that and say we will continue that unless there is an inflection point of the stock based on the fact that now we\u2019ve recovered, I think, it\u2019s about $100 million since the low point back in October. That should lead you to expect that we would be less aggressive in the buyback, but every dips that we see throughout the year, we\u2019re going to be in there buying aggressively. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","Jack, I was just looking to see if you are willing to provide any additional color on the intra-quarter same-store sales trends, sort of how it played out as you moved through the quarter and then as you rolled into April, anything would be helpful?","Jack Hartung","Jeff, in terms of during the quarter, it was -- there\u2019s not really a pattern, I can share with you that would add a lot of value. I have seen a lot of other companies say that it got tougher, then it got better. Frankly, January was a better month in the quarter than we expected and it looks like better than other companies as well. But when I look at kind of the underlying take out whether this year, whether last year, taking into account that you have got a holiday and we lost a day here and there, I think an underlying 3%, just the  1% back up to 3% is a pretty good guide of what the underlying comp was throughout the quarter. ","April has been a tough read as well because the first week where post Easter, we always do really well post Easter and when we close our restaurant for a day, the very next day is a very busy day for us and then a few days are busy as well. So, the first week of comp in April was a nice week for us. The second week though we are comparing against the week after Easter from last year, and so we are comparing against the tough week last year.","But when I saw through that, I don\u2019t see anything, Jeff, that tells us that there has been a change in trend either up or down from kind of the underlying 3% debt that we saw in the first quarter.","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","Okay. Helpful. Thank you.","Steve Ells","Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. First, Jack, could you just clarify your comments on the food cost outlook. So 33% is better than it was last quarter. Was this a good run rate to think about, and is it before contemplated price increases or did you get some one-time benefits because avocados were less expensive, and maybe it goes up from here?","Jack Hartung","Yeah. John, when we talked in the last quarter, food costs in the fourth quarter rose faster into a higher level than we expected. And so, at that point, we\u2019re thinking okay, here we go, and we expected additional inflation on top of that. Although we did say in the quarter that food costs peaked during the middle of the fourth quarter and then were starting to retreat a little bit, it continued to retreat. And so, we are pleased to see that came -- instead of holding flat, which is about what we though it might do at 33.5, it came all the way down to 33.","And now, our outlook right now looks reasonably stable, looks more stable at this 33 than it did early in the year. We do think that there is some pressure. It doesn\u2019t seem that severe, but there is some pressure with our stake. We will see seasonally higher cost for avocados, but that\u2019s where we see the pressure.","So it seems like it\u2019s fairly benign. And the increases don\u2019t seem like there are going to be two terribly significant over the next quarter or two. And if that\u2019s the case, we like to, kind of, stand path on any kind of menu price increase with that kind of inflation.","It doesn\u2019t mean that menu price increase is off the table but I think at one point we\u2019re thinking it could be kind of linear price increase. And we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll do anything that quickly.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","So it changes your timing view. Does it also your magnitude view of pricing then as well?","Jack Hartung","No. Because when we do increase prices, John, we will take a new count inflation. And if inflation -- the actual inflation and the expected inflation is high enough to suggest or lead to a menu price increase. I think we are still in kind of order of magnitude that we talked about, kind of, in that 3% to 5% kind of range. And if inflation is more benign, we\u2019ll just hold off and wait.","And the other key factor is that our prices are light compared to our competitors. And so we\u2019ll want to make sure that one we have pricing power, which we like we do. And so we don\u2019t want to be overly greedy. So I think the range of the price increase will probably be similar. So it\u2019s more -- at this point, more of a timing.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Okay. If you just let me explain the G&A one more time, it sounds like if the core G&A actually is still growing at the rate that was prior. It sounds like this is the evaluation change where other options, not an underlying change in the number of options. It was one time as a voluntary or does this carry through to future option grant as well if you change the volatility assumption?","Steve Ells","Okay. So I\u2019m going to assume you are not talking about the one-time stuff of last year. You just talk about the fact about stock. Stock options are going to be $66 million instead of $72 million to $75 million. This is every year that we recalculate the accounting chart for the grant for that year. We did that this year.","Relatively, we did move down and it looks like it was because we do a 3.5 year. It\u2019s a fairly complicated calculation but the biggest part of it is based on a 3 year to 3.5 year volatility. And by cutting off, kind of, the oldest part of that 3.5 year and replacing it over the last year, volatility moved down.","If our volatility stays at that kind of rate, we would expect similar kind of calculations n the future. We didn\u2019t change materially the number of options that we granted. That number was about the same. And so it\u2019s really just watching the volatility. And so we\u2019ll do this every single year. And if volatility stays in check, I would expect some similar kind of results in the next year or two as well.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Steve Ells","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on that last question. So there wasn\u2019t sort of catch up in the calculation that helped you materially in the first quarter, sort of, a lower level throughout the year than you originally thought it would be?","Steve Ells","Yeah. Again, we\u2019re just talking about stock comp for this year, $66 million.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Right.","Steve Ells","There is no catch up. That as we took the number of options that we granted just like we did last year. We value them just like we did last year. This will happen at evaluation for each ops that we granted was lower than we expected and was all just because of the formula, in the formula using a lower volatility rate, just resulted in a lower value. This is all non-economic to the journal entry, it has no impact on our cash flow whatsoever. ","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","And can you remind you how guys target the core G&A growth excluding options? I mean that\u2019s still expected to be some percentage of sales growth or how do you guys think about that now?","Steve Ells","Well, our target is always to have our underlying G&A growth, not only stock options probably at slower rate than sales and we\u2019ve been successful in doing that pretty much every single year as long as you take out the stock options. And that would be our Goal going forward. We don't want to grow our G&A or headcount either at the sales growth rate or at a faster rate than sales growth. We always want to grow our G&A at something less than our sales growth.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","And then last thing on the marketing spend, I think you're lapping a crew level of spend in the second quarter, so I am assuming that line is going to be under some pressure this quarter as we lap that and then just overall you guys talked in the last call a lot about more traffic driven initiatives and more outdoor thing. Can you say how that\u2019s still running? Is it moving the needle, is it something that is tough to measure, can you just talk a bit about the success rate on that incremental marketing and some changes you made there?","Jack Hartung","This is Jack and I will start on the marketing spend, and you\u2019re absolutely right. In the Q2 of last year we spent 0.7% on sales and marketing. This year we will spend quite a bit more, the fact that we think that we will overall for the year spend about 1.7% and we think we will spend more than that in the second and third quarter. So I would think in terms of something in the 2% perhaps even more than that in the second and third quarter. So you are right, there is at least 130 basis point or more incremental marketing that we will spend in the second quarter this year. And then I will let Steve talk about your other question about marketing.","Steve Ells","Sure, Jason, in regards to more traffic driving marketing, let me back up a little bit and say that we sort of lumped our marketing into three different categories, the top of mind kind of advertising, which would be more traditional transaction driving stuff, outdoor, radio, print, direct mail, that kind of thing, our local marketing and our brand marketing. And in terms of our top of mind advertising, on outdoor, radio and print and so forth we have a new campaign that we are calling skilfully made and it\u2019s really building on our last campaign that talked about the quality of the raw ingredients, it talked about where our ingredients come from and the importance of sustainability and things like that. ","The skilfully made campaign that just started recently and it will carry us through summer into fall, into early fall in some markets, really speaks to how we prepare our food in the restaurant which we think is really unique and the differentiators. We have really great pictures and great taglines to accompany these pictures that show how we prepare food in our restaurant. And they are not a typical kind of food pictures that you would see. They are sort of close-up shots of prep where you see cutting-boards, knives, and pots and cans and peoples making salsas, people adding herbs to salsas, people grilling chicken in saw-chain to heat the vegetables, it really is sort of mouth watering and very appealing. And it has a very sort of reality kind of look to it in that it\u2019s not staged, we just took a camera into one of our restaurants and short pictures. So that\u2019s all very, very much traffic driving kind of advertising. ","But what we are doing with our brand marketing is we are adding a traffic driving components to that. And the brand marketing includes things like our last year you saw us introduce our Back to the Start video. We have two more videos that we are doing, or two more films that we are doing this year that are in production. One is a series called Farmed and Dangerous and it\u2019s a series that is going to come in September. And there are traffic drivers that are embedded into that, that include ways to redeem currency and photos and things like that. The other video is a short in duration similar to back of the start that builds on that theme also and it also has the traffic drivers built into that, and so this is something different then we were doing last year.","And then, of course, in our local marketing, there is traffic driving in that and that were connecting with customers on one sort of way. We have 30 local marketing strategist around the country and as we build relationships with our communities through different organizations or sport teams or schools, things like this, we use, again our marketing currency to drive traffic.","So, really this year definitely emphasis on doing things that drive traffic. But, again, we are just sort of starting are top of the mark -- top of the mind advertising and that\u2019s going to be running all the way through summer and into fall. So results to come later.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","Hi, guys.","Steve Ells","Hi, Michael.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","I want to. How are you? I want to ask, you said that underlying run rate of same-store sales was running in the 3% range and you take that all the kind of the moving parts and that\u2019s below the rate of growth that you previously said you need to hold profitability levels? And so, I guess, my question is, in the absence of price increase, if things are running at 3%, should we expect deleverage on margins for the balance of the year?","Steve Ells","3%, food costs, currently, what food costs is going to do. 3% is a little lower, Michael than normal. I\u2019ve always talked about we need kind of, more of a mid single-digit and so we did add a little bit of leverage at that 3% in labor, but that could have gone other way, we picked up 10 basis points that could gone the other way.","Normally, occupancy costs at 3% or so, we should be able to hold on to that line. I know, you talked about the other line items. So 3% is right around where we are either slightly delever or maybe just hold on to our margin. It would be handy especially if its all transaction, if we are getting 3% and none of its priced, that is right around where its touching on whether we can hold on to our margin or whether we might delever slightly.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","And then on the different topic, could you just talk more about experience with catering so far? Obviously it\u2019s doing well, if you roll out across the system, maybe you can give us some metrics around it at the store level?","Steve Ells","Well, I don\u2019t think, we are ready to give specific numbers but what I can say is that, customers are really enjoying, we are getting tons of positive feedback. I\u2019ll also say which I think it\u2019s very important that our crews are having a really, they are successfully rolling -- helping to roll this thing out. It is, I don\u2019t want to say, easy, but its relatively easy to serve our customers through catering rather than have them come in through the line, through the regular service line. It\u2019s much more efficient.","But in terms of breaking down sort of detailed numbers at this point. I think, again, its too early to do that, but I can say that we are happy with the success so far and we\u2019ll continue to roll that out. And as we are in more and more markets, I think we will be in a better position to talk about how that\u2019s effecting the economics.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","And then one last one, as I understand that you are experimenting more with breakfast hours? And I guess, I\u2019m curious, two questions on that. One, is it just extended hours or are you considering some breakfast specific items at this point? And then, secondly, where you have extended the breakfast hours, what is that done the other hours -- productive hours for you before 11 o\u2019clock?","Steve Ells","Well, so, let me talk about breakfast specifically. We only have two restaurants that we open up at sort of traditional breakfast time. They are both in airports. One in Dallas Airport and there we are serving our regular menu and then at the Baltimore Airport, where we serve a breakfast menu which includes a new item that we have, which is actually really, really delicious, it\u2019s called frittata, we have two varieties of frittata, a chorizo frittata and vegetarian -- vegetable based frittata, and that very, very popular and gaining more popularity as we continue to serve it. Those are the only two places really that I would consider as having breakfast.","Now we do open our restaurants earlier in areas where there is demand. And so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you are referring to when you say more breakfast hours. But our restaurant managers watch carefully the traffic and the activity in their particular neighborhoods and we have opened up as early as 10 o\u2019clock, I am not sure if we open up much earlier than that. But there is demand in those areas, they certainly do take advantage of that and open up. And that\u2019s in a number of restaurants in all of our markets.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.","Amod Gautam - JP Morgan","Thanks guys. This is Amod filling in. The first question was on new unit volumes and kind of the trend over the next few years. 2012, you obviously had some difficult laps I think from the 2011 portfolio. But can you talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes? I think Monty, in the prepared comments, you remarked about considering more mall units, also considering more A models and new construction versus remodeled construction. What are some of the kind of puts and takes behind the new unit volume trend?","Monty Moran","As we have said we opened 48 restaurants during the first quarter and we are confident in the real estate pipeline that\u2019s coming for the rest of the year. In terms of your question about the mall locations we have only opened in few of the mall locations so far, what we are really pleased about it is that investment costs of those locations tends to be substantially below what a traditional outlet costs to open and the volumes are those restaurants tend to be at or above what a traditional location brings in so that unit economics of those mall locations is really really good. And so that has given us the confidence to look more aggressively towards mall locations where we can open them in a way that is really good for our trade address and really good for our brand and where we can have the confidence with the relatively low investment we can get really nice return. So you will be seeing us do a substantial number of those during 2013 which will increase our portfolio of mall locations quite a lot during this year over the handful that we have done historically.","Other than that, our real estate portfolio is sort of very similar in terms of the types of locations we are going into with mostly encaped locations with a decent mix of freestanders as well and then [slow] locations and a few in-line locations. So that balance should stay relatively similar. We have also seen the amount of restaurants we are putting into new centers increase as more money becomes available for developers to build those sites and that was depends on the swing back towards the way it was several years ago when the vast majority of our restaurants something like 70% of our restaurants were being built in new developments, new structures. Short time especially during the recession depends on swing such that we are building most of our restaurants in remodel locations. But despite the fact that most of these new centers might be coming online and I think I said during my comments that might be as much as 40% for our 2013 portfolio. Despite that fact, we are very optimistic and aggressive about what we can do with the continued focus on our remodel strategies. So we are going to be continuing to bring emphasis to really looking for these locations that may have been less attractive to us in the past because of being off to the path or having demographics, less demographic certainty and looking to open that remodels because our experience in doing so has shown us that we can derive very, very, favorable returns on investments by doing into those locations. ","So I think that thing will be a continued for us. So it\u2019s --- I think it\u2019s all very positive, our new store unit productivity has been really terrific and it\u2019s been terrific despite the fact that we\u2019ve opened up our willingness to experiment with different types of locations, quite a bit of more of those few airport locations with the mall locations with lot of the remodel locations and continuing to pursue the traditional either in new construction or in remodel locations. So yeah and that\u2019s why we are bullish on why I suggest that we probably succeed in being towards the top end of the guidance of 165 to 180 restaurants this year and with hopefully, very favorable returns.","Amod Gautam - JP Morgan","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And just from a different tack, could you talk a little bit about the learnings from formed team and whether or not some sort of revamp or increased emphasis on loyalty should be expected at some point this year?","Steve Ells","So, I think that we are going to maintain our position that doing a sort of a traditional loyalty program as one would expect, it looks like sort of a buy nine get one free or however they were. It\u2019s probably not the way we think about building loyalty. If I think about the best way to build loyalty it\u2019s not through, perhaps the specific program but by doing what we do really, really well.","I mean, we have -- really, we score very, very high when we do research and interview our customers relative to our competition because of the kind of experience that we provide. And it\u2019s really based on the sourcing of great food, preparing it from the customers and served by an empowered team of top performers. So, when I think about loyalty that\u2019s probably the most important thing that we can do.","So formed team was a way to engage our customers and bring them in and teach them more about how we source our food. It sort of got this loyalty program, somehow got attach to that and I will take responsibility for it. It was not meant to be a traditional loyalty program though. But again, again what we do really, really well in our restaurants builds great loyalty. And I think we are going to continue over the years to build on that by providing people with very best sustainedly raised foods and served by a team of top performers that they won\u2019t be able to find anywhere else in any other kind of fast food environment.","Amod Gautam - JP Morgan","Thanks, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities.","Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question.","Steve Ells","Yeah. Hey, Nick.","Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities","Just kind of look outside the U.S. your international business and just kind of look at ShopHouse, it does seem like you guys are accelerating the pace of development there. I mean, how can we think about the contribution in terms of the unit growth going forward, when should we think about becoming a more meaningful contributor? Maybe you can talk about sort of the kind of economics you are seeing in the different geographies, international as well.","Steve Ells","Yeah. Nick, we don\u2019t really have a projection or a forecast to tell you that, okay, next year or the year after, so it\u2019s going to contribute meaningfully to our unit growth or to our growth overall. Right now, our focus is on building the team, building customer awareness, allowing people discover what\u2019s special about Chipotle, making sure the brand, the Chipotle brand really comes through in a special way, the way it does in the U.S.","So far that is going well. But we need to be very patient before we turn the dial. And when you say, looks like we are accelerating, we don\u2019t think about that we are accelerating at all. We think about it in terms of we are still think planting seeds. So ShopHouse is one restaurant, we are planting few more seed.","Now sure, we are going from one restaurant to four and that might seem like that\u2019s going really, really fast. But to us it\u2019s still planting seed. It\u2019s another seed in a different trade here in D.C. It\u2019s planting a couple seeds and introducing the ShopHouse brand to new customers in the L.A. area. And so that\u2019s again just building customer awareness, allowing people to discover ShopHouse.","Customers that have been to ShopHouse in D.C. so far will love it. The people that have come to our Cultivate events where we\u2019ve had some sampling at ShopHouse food, they like it as well. And so we are really pleased with the response so far, but we are still in this very early stage another growth strategy.","When it\u2019s time, where we think that it's time to ramp it up meaning we feel like the teams are ready, the customer acceptance is ready, the awareness is ready we will then provide that kind of a forecast with you. But that\u2019s not a near-term horizon right now and I would say the same thing for the international development as well. There is a lot of seed planting and there is a lot of introducing the brand and building the teams, but not growth mode for the foreseeable future.","Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities","Thank you.","Steve Ells","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","We will go next to Matthew Difrisco with Lazard Capital Markets.","Matthew Difrisco - Lazard Capital Markets","Thank you very much. One of the things that I noticed with the catering was in a couple of markets that we\u2019ve tried it out, you've done some things sort of a bounce back helping and incentivising people to bring back the sternos and bring back some of the materials, like giving a free burrito, is there a sort of let\u2019s weld them first and worry about cost later approach or the margin is pretty strong already on the catering business as far as looking into that and say executable, not just leveraging the costs of the store but looking at the amount of labor that you put into it and the equipment costs, I know some other peers, maybe the casual dining guys had problems before they take out with the packaging being a little bit unwieldy and expensive. So I am just curious on what your learnings have been early on so far on the cost side of it?","Jack Hartung","Sure, there is no question that there is a cost associated with the setup for catering. How that\u2019s offset by the more efficient -- the catering labor wise is much more efficient. We would rather sort of 30 people through catering rather than bringing them through the line. That is very, very easy, it\u2019s very, very fast and it does not take the same amount of labor by a long shot. The desire to have people bring back some of the catering equipment sets us up, by offering them burrito really wasn\u2019t driven by economics so much as we don\u2019t want to waste, we don\u2019t want to throw these things into landfill, it\u2019s just a part of being a more green company I suppose. Additionally anything that we can do to bring customers back into our restaurants I think helps and we think that perhaps there is an opportunity again to just bring people back to who might not be a regular Chipotle customer but who might have tried catering to bring them in for an instore experience.","Matthew Difrisco - Lazard Capital Markets","I also thought the reusable bags obviously were pretty strong. I thought that was appealing that you're not using a lot of waste. I appreciate it as well. Looking at it as far as structurally, is there anything that would inhibit you from or preclude you from looking longer-term maybe to do delivery, or are you thinking right now you like the guy coming -- you like the person coming into the store and having that connection with them rather than delivery?","Jack Hartung","Well I don\u2019t know there is so much of a connection but I think about it perhaps this way. When we offer catering and I will make this up, let\u2019s say that there are sort of 8 out of 10 people will sign up for your catering and maybe there is only two people who would not use it because we don\u2019t deliver. However if we started out by delivering maybe eight people will take the delivery option and then you add up all that expense. So I think as we are introducing this it\u2019s a much economic model to have people come in, and then at a later time it could be years down the road when we want to build catering business even more then there is this delivery option. But the extent of delivery I think is not something that makes sense at this point. There are plenty of people who will stop and to pick up their catering order.","Matthew Difrisco - Lazard Capital Markets","Jack, you said in the past about pricing roughly. I don't think you don't like sort of taking baby steps. You sort of like to get it done with and then move on. So I guess the number sort of thrown out there in the past was a little north of 3% would be something if you were to take price. Given the current environment where COGS have come down a little bit now, a little bit more favorable maybe than the last time you guys have spoken, is your strategy still to take that meaningful sort of price increase but maybe take it later in the year now, or have that option to take it rather than take something but take less of a price increase?","Jack Hartung","Yeah I think you said it well, and you said if it\u2019s an option, right now taking price increases has always been an option and leading is an option meaning don\u2019t pull the trigger and that\u2019s why in my prepared comments I said if we do anything it won\u2019t be before late summer early fall. The fact that inflation has stabilized a bit, the fact that our food costs actually improved in the quarter, and the fact that the economy is sending mixed signals again. It seems like economy is off to a great start and then every time about this time every year for the last few years in the spring, we have mixed signals on consumer confidence and job creation and things like that. I think the idea of being patient and let some time pass and let\u2019s see what happens with inflation over the next few months. Let\u2019s see what happens with our transaction trends. Let\u2019s see what happens with consumer confidence in the economy. And then when we do an increase, I still think we\u2019d like to do kind of one increase and not multiple per year. We don\u2019t want to keep nickel on dinning table.","And I think in terms of the order of magnitude, this is a decision that we\u2019ve made. I think some where in that 3% to 5% that I mentioned earlier is probably the order or magnitude considering inflation and considering it will be a fair increase considering what our competitors are charging.","So nothing -- nothing this summer but we\u2019ll keep an eye on it. And the earliest we would do something would be late summer, early fall.","Matthew Difrisco - Lazard Capital Markets","Excellent. Thank you.","Steve Ells","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick ones. I guess, first on the quarter and the comps in the quarter. Jack, I think you talked about an underlying trend of 3%. But you didn\u2019t really talk much about the weather impact in the quarter. So I was wondering if you took a stab at maybe quantifying what the year-over-year impact of the weather might have been during Q1?","Jack Hartung","Yeah. David, I can\u2019t tell, to be honest. It\u2019s look like we probably got a weather benefit in January. January was a great month but it wasn\u2019t -- a super bad winter. And I think the winter before may have been a little bit more extreme. And I think that went against us in February. The February last year was really, really mild.","And so I don\u2019t see that weather stands out as a significant negative even though it was a tough comparison. And I guess, if what -- when we look at what our trends are in the second quarter, I might have a better idea depending on what the second quarter ends up being.","But right now, it\u2019s feel like, David, that weather bounce around a lot during the quarter. But I don\u2019t know t that it had a net impact that I could -- that we could point to stay for sure. Here is what the impact was.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe one more quick one on the pricing and the cost relationship there. I think, I guess I\u2019m just wondering right here overall philosophy is on managing the cost line. And if I look at the 33% that you\u2019re running on the food cost line. That is the high -- that would be the highest level you\u2019ve seen in 10 years. And I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s a level that you find acceptable or is that something you\u2019d like to see manage lower over time. I guess, I\u2019m just trying to figure out how you\u2019re thinking about that longer term.","Jack Hartung","Yeah. David, 33% is little on a high side. We\u2019ve had. I think we had quarters at higher numbers than that. Maybe you\u2019re talking about for the whole year. We have had it asked or in the ballpark of the 34% or so. We think our model was better when it\u2019s more like in the 32% range. Of course, it\u2019s even better still at 31% or lower. So this is more on high side. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re thinking else, 33% is perfect and so we\u2019re just going to never increase prices as long as we are 33%.","But it\u2019s more of -- it\u2019s stabilized. And let\u2019s see what the next chapter of inflation is. Our margins are still extraordinarily high. Returns are still extraordinarily high. We do think we\u2019ve got pricing power. We think that we are priced at or below our competitors. And we think we have the ability or we should be able to charge higher prices because of our food integrity, the higher cost of our ingredient.","And so I like to be lower than 33%. We\u2019re just not going to get hurry to push it lower right now.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Jack Hartung","Okay. Thanks David.","Operator","Due to time restraints, this concludes our question-and-answer session.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you.","I would now like introduce Chipotle\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, Mark Alexee. You may begin your conference.","Mark Alexee","Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the fourth quarter and year end 2014. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include projections of a number of restaurants we intend to open, new restaurants that [indiscernible] and new restaurant volumes.","Statements about potential shareholders or projections of comparable restaurant sales increases or comps, trends in food, labor and G&A costs, our expected effective tax rates, statements about stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.

I would like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues over the next earnings conference call. For the first quarter, it will begin March 1st and will continue through our Q1 earnings release on April 21, 2015.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Crumpacker, Chief Marketing and Development Officer.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells","Thanks Mark. I am extremely pleased with our performance during the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. During the quarter we generated revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.7% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 16.1% and the opening of 16 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $3.84, an increase of 51.8%.","For the full year we generated revenue of $4.1 billion on comparable restaurant sales growth of 16.8% and the opening of 192 new restaurants. While those results would be strong for a Company of any size I think they\u2019re particularly impressive considering how we now have nearly 1,800 restaurants averaging nearly $2.5 million each.","Quite simply, I do not think that we would be able to deliver these results without such a compelling and broader vision we have made it our mission to change the way people think about any fast food and we have created an extraordinary food and people culture, and a very strong unit economic model that is allowing us to do that. Recently we\u2019ve seen strong evidence that our commitment to sourcing sustainably raised ingredients is resonating with many consumers. In January we decided to spend one of our pork suppliers after a routine audit reveal that they were not following all of our animal welfare protocols. Choosing to suspend the supplier meant that we would not be able to supply carnitas to about one third of our restaurants.","While we could have chosen to replace this supply with pork from conventionally raised pigs, we decided not to because most conventionally raised pigs are subjected to conditions that we find unacceptable. Conventionally raised pigs are typically raised indoors with no outdoor or access to [indiscernible] and are typically given antibiotics non-therapeutically to simulate growth and to prevent illness from spreading due to harsh crowded living conditions. These conventional practices are unacceptable to us and we refuse to serve pork from animals raised in that manner.","Since we made this decision the majority of sentiment from our customers has been very supportive in the email and web comments along with social media posts, customers are applauding our commitment to our vision, thanking us for standing on principal, commending us for taking action against the inhumane treatment of animals and congratulating us for standing by our business values. We certainly appreciate what we are hearing from our customers and are great full for their continued loyalty.","We\u2019re also pleased to see this response that shows that our vision and our commitment to sourcing responsibly raise ingredients including respecting animal welfare are resonating with people in a very real and powerful way. People care about where their food comes from and how it is raised.","And we are proud of the tremendous progress we have made over the years. Last year we served more than 165 million pounds of responsibly raised meat more than a 20% increase from 2013. All of our responsibly raised meat comes from animals that are raised in more humane ways and without the use antibiotics or added hormones. Meat from animal raised to these higher welfare standards still accounts for a small percentage of the total meat production in this country. Yet we continue find ways to increase our supply year-after-year.","Because meat raised in this way is such a small portion of the overall supply system we will see disruptions from time-to-time. But these disruptions just reinforced and strengthen our commitment to continue to look for ways to increase the supply that is available to us whether from existing suppliers who can grow with us, exploring additional cuts to add to our supply well, enhancing the quality of flavor or finding new suppliers that meet our high standards.","Our commitment to sourcing food that is raised responsibly is not limited to pork, chicken and beef. During the year we continued our use of [indiscernible] an organically grown beans and we eclipsed our 2014 goal of serving 20 million pounds of locally grown. In a food system that is so heavily dominated by relatively few large producers its extraordinary progress and our teams has encountered and overcome numerous hurdles to reach each of these milestones. I\u2019m certain that we will continue to face challenges in this area, that our commitment rate remains the strong as ever and we will find ways to keep making progress simply because we believe that serving food from these great ingredients is the right thing to do.","While the customer response to how we handle our pork situation is encouraging it\u2019s not the only sign that more and more people are becoming more curious and more discerning about where their food comes from. For example our vision is really resonating with teens, millennials and generation x. According to industry research Chipotle is one of the most popular restaurant chains among teens and has been growing in popularity among this demographic. This report from 2014 ranks Chipotle as the third most popular brand among teens up from number eight 2013. Gen x consumers were 33% more likely than average to use Chipotle, with millennials Chipotle was even more popular with customers in this group 75% more likely been average to choose Chipotle over other restaurants.","We believe that our popularity among these younger consumers is tied to our vision and the growing interest in issues related to food and how it is raised. Our own research shows that these issues are clearly becoming more relevant and important when customers choose where they will dine.","Based on our ongoing tracking research 87% of fast casual diners say they prefer to eat foods that are grown locally up from 70% in 2011. 86% ingredients raised or grown in a more responsible way taste better, that\u2019s up from 76% in 2011. 73% feels it's important to buy organic for certain food items up from 61% in 2011. And 69% try to eat meat that has been raised responsibly and that\u2019s up 53% in 2011.","From the very first Chipotle restaurant nearly 22 years ago we have chartered our own path for how a restaurant company should be run in every single way. We have shown that you can own and operate all of your restaurants rather than franchise and still grow at a rapid rate, that you can spend more on ingredients not less, still serve high quality food at reasonable prices and have industry leading margins and returns, that you can build teams of top performers and power them to deliver high standards while still maintaining an efficient labor model and that you can remain focused on doing just a few things extremely well rather than trying to be all things to all people or engaging in a kind of marketing gimmicks that it become the hallmarks of traditional fast food and still continue to attract new customers and profitably grow the business over the long-term. ","We believe this is the new fast foot model. But this model is not limited to just burritos and tacos and as you know we are in the early stages of developing two new concepts ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen and Pizzeria Locale that embrace the principals that have made Chipotle successful over the years. We believe operating these cuisines following the Chipotle model is a great way to offer variety to our customers elevating the dining experience for pizza and Asian Cuisine just as we have done with Chipotle and we believe this is a much better way to create additional compelling shareholder value as compared to the traditional restaurant model of flooding the menu with so many items that is impossible to serve anything that is extraordinary.","During the quarter we opened the newest shop house in Washington DC's Union Station, the ninth ShopHouse so far. And in January we finalized the deal to open the first Pizzeria Locale outside of Denver this one in Kansas City\u2019s Waldo neighborhood. While we are pursuing additional sites for each of these concepts I will remind you that most of our growth for the foreseeable future will continue to be driven by opening Chipotle Restaurants in the United States. ","Chipotle has created the new fast food model and it\u2019s the underlying principles of that model that continue to drive our financial success. Increasingly our vision of changing the way people think about any fast food is resonating with consumers many of whom want a better, more responsible alternative to traditional fast food.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Monty.","Monty Moran","Thanks Steve. Our ongoing ability to deliver impressive financial results arises from a special culture that we\u2019ve built at Chipotle that has led to the development of strong leaders. These leaders are able to attract very talented people to our company and to develop those people to be at their best.","Because of this we\u2019re able do things most of our competitors can\u2019t do. For instance other restaurants rely heavily on automated systems to reduce the amount of training and skill that is necessary to do their work in an effort to simplify training and make operations full proof. On the other hand at Chipotle we hire energetic and ambitious people who have a desire to learn classic cooking skills, how to be a successful leader in the business acumen necessary to run a highly successful business. But we ask even more of our people we ask them to elevate the people around them and we judge all of our leaders based on how positively they do that. By rewarding this behavior we elevate the dining experience our customers enjoy each time they visit which leads to excellent operations.","One of the rewards of this kind of enlightened leadership is the rapid promotion of our talented leaders into positions within the restaurants where they can have a greater effect on more of our crew people. Over 90% of our general managers come from crew positions so people are really starting to understand the kind of opportunity that awaits them at Chipotle.","The extraordinary culture that we have created with the restaurateur program as a cornerstone is one of the areas where we are unique within the restaurant industry. That\u2019s one of the key drivers of our business and this culture is growing stronger.","We\u2019ve made important investments over the past year or so to further strengthen this culture and our ability to develop restaurant tourists at a faster rate and across more restaurants. ","First we have reduced the field leadership ratios from a high of around 15 restaurants for a field leader just a few years ago to about eight restaurants per field leader today. ","Secondly, we created the restaurateur diagnostic and plan tool which helps our field leaders properly diagnose inadequacies and weaknesses in the culture of each restaurant they supervise. Also this tool generates a clear and actionable plan which helps the GM address the underlying causes that are preventing that restaurant team from becoming a restaurateur.","The combination of these two investments is just now beginning to pay off. While we promoted a similar number of restaurateurs during the past two year we\u2019re currently approaching the largest backlog of GMs ready to be interviewed to become restaurateurs that we\u2019ve ever had at one time. This gives me great confidence that 2015 will be a breakout year for us in terms of restaurateur development which means that even more of our restaurants will be better than they are today, with better throughput, better food and a better overall customer experience. I am confident about this because our restaurateur shows us time and time again that the special cultures they create lead to better restaurants in every way.","Better field leadership ratios alone might not accelerate restaurateur development but with the development and plan tool in place and better ratios that allow our field leaders to dive deep into and better understand each restaurant\u2019s culture we feel that we\u2019re in a position to accelerate the proliferation of this powerful culture quickly into more restaurants. So I am excited to see the dividends from this combined investment payoff this year and in the coming years.","One of the benefits of having great teams and great cultures is the ability to deliver superior throughput. When done well throughput isn\u2019t simply about moving people to the restaurant as quickly as possible instead it\u2019s about outstanding customer service with clear, authentic communication with customers as they efficiently move down our serving line.","During the quarter we continued to make progress in terms of throughput on top of the outstanding throughput we drove in the fourth quarter of 2013. We increased our average peak lunch hour transactions by three and out of that average of five more transactions during the peak dinner hour. We attributed this to our continued emphasis on the four pillars and the effectiveness of our auditing of and reporting to our field teams who get frequency back on how well they\u2019re executing these four pillars.","Since beginning of the four pillars reporting effort we\u2019ve seen significant improvement and we recently expanded our reporting to include peak dinner hours in addition to peak lunch hours. With this standard reporting we continue to better execute the four pillars of both and dinner which we expect will pay-off as we head into our busiest season in just a few months.","Finally I\u2019d like to provide an update on development. During the quarter we opened 60 new restaurants bringing our total to 192 restaurants opened during the year coming in at the higher end of our guided range of 180 to 195. Nearly 80% of these new restaurants opened and proven for established markets while the remainder opened and developing are new markets. This makes allowed us to expand our footprint in markets where we have strong presence and strong teams while also introducing our unique dining experience to customers in new markets.","For 2015 we expect to open 190 to 205 new restaurants with a similar distribution between proven, established, developing and new markets. And a small number of [indiscernible] restaurants as well. Overall we\u2019re seeing more competition per site given the relative health of the economy but Chipotle remains a very desirable tenant and so we continue to have success in obtaining great real estate locations. In 2014 our total average development cost including international, ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale locations was about $849,000 net of land reimbursements.","The increase in our development cost this year was driven by opening more free standing restaurants along with higher cost locations in the northeast. And improving commercial real estate and construction market has also contributed to an increase in development cost. In 2015 we expect our average restaurant development cost to decrease based on opening more traditional in-cap and in-line restaurants which are generally easier to build and cost less in the free standing restaurants. ","I\u2019m more confident now that we have the right pieces in place, a strong food culture, a strong and empowering people culture and an industry leading unit economic model to continue on our path to change the way people think about and eat fast food. I know that our success in doing that will allow us to generate outstanding returns for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John.","John Hartung","Thanks, Monty. We\u2019re proud of results we achieved during the fourth quarter and for the entire year of 2014 as our empowered restaurant teams continue to delight our customers with great service, while preparing and serving a delicious meal made from responsibly raised ingredients to each and every customer. ","In the fourth quarter we compared against 2013's highest quarterly comp at 9.3% and we\u2019re delighted to be able to serve many more customers and delivery fourth quarter comp of 16.1% on top of that 9.3% comp in 2013. This 16.1% comp help to drive our total quarterly revenue to $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.7% and our full year revenue totaled $4.1 billion and increase of 27.8% on a full year comp of 16.8%.","These increased sales are driven primarily by increase customer visits along with an average check increase of 8.3%, increase in average check was primarily driven by the menu price increase we took mid-year of 6.3% and to a lesser extent by continued growth in catering and in group size. ","We\u2019re maintaining our full year 2015 same-store sales guidance in the low to mid-single digit range, while we\u2019re bullish about the sales trends and the growing consumer awareness and appreciation for our sustainably raised ingredients, in 2015 we will compare against the toughest comps we\u2019ve ever had as a public company. We expect our comps will be the highest in the first quarter and then become more difficult as we begin to [indiscernible] the menu increase starting in the second quarter and then begin to flatten out as we compared to the 19.8% comp in Q3 and the 16.1% in the fourth quarter.","As a result of this strong comp our average sales volume for restaurant that have been opened for at least 12 months is now $2,472,000 the highest we\u2019ve ever achieved. This average volume along with our industry leading restaurant level margins help us deliver among the highest restaurant level returns in the industry and nearly double the very attractive returns we earned when we first became a public company.","Our new restaurants also continue to perform exceptionally opening above our communicated sales range of $1.7 million to $1.8 million and in fact we now expect our new restaurants to open in the range of 1.8 million to 1.9 million and grow from this initial opening level.","We opened 16 new restaurants in the quarter bringing our year-to-date openings to 192 which is at the high-end of our guidance range for 2014 and we ended the year with 1,783,000 restaurants including 17 Chipotle restaurants outside the U.S., nine ShopHouse and two Pizzeria Locales. As Monty mentioned earlier we plan to open between 190 to 205 new restaurants in 2015 which we expect will be reasonably level loaded throughout the year. ","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $3.84, an increase of 51.8%, restaurant level margins increased in the quarter by 100 basis points to 26.6%. Margins were impacted by strong transaction trends and the menu price increase from the middle of last year. ","Diluted EPS was $14.13 for the full year 2014 an increase of 35% over 2013. EPS growth outpaced our sales growth as the higher comps in food and menu increase allowed us to leverage labor and occupancy lines at the restaurant level.","Margins for the year increased 60 basis points to 27.2% in 2014. The full year margin impact included underlying food inflation of about 7.5% and because we increased prices around mid-year our effective price increase for the full year was only about 3.8% which did not fully cover all of this food inflation.","Food cost were 35% in the quarter up 110 basis points from 2013 and sequentially higher by 70 basis points from the third quarter. While avocado cost decline in the quarter as we shifted away from buying California avocados that benefit was more than offset by higher beef, and dairy cost during the quarter. Beef prices are expected to remain elevated throughout the year and into 2016 due to continued supply constraints and avocado prices are expected to be slightly higher in 2015 as increased demand is projected to exceed the higher yields we expect from California and Mexico during the year. ","We expect dairy price to come down during Q1 from record highs for our cheese and sour cream from late 2014 and remain at normalized levels throughout the remainder of 2015. We also expect about a $2 million charge in the first quarter on our food line related to the suspension of one of our pork suppliers. As Steve mentioned decision to stop serving this pork was driven by commitment to principals underlying food with integrity including animal welfare protocols and the response from our loyal customers has been very supportive. ","So all things considered we expect our food cost in 2015 to remain at about the 35% level we saw in the fourth quarter as the continued pressure in the prices of beef and avocado will be roughly offset by lower prices for dairy with full year food cost remain in that 35% range.","We don\u2019t have any plans for an across the board menu price increase in 2015 since we just increased prices and because we\u2019re currently earning at or near record margins and returns. In addition it's important to us that we remain accessible or affordable to our customers as this is the core to our ability to change the way people think about any fast food.","But had we known earlier last year that beef prices would continue to rise we may have increased the prices for our Steak and Barbacoa more than we did. We did increase the price of these two items much higher than any other entr\u00e9e in an effort to charge the fair going price for our Steak and Barbacoa. And we expected to see some trade off from Steak and Barbacoa as a result of the higher relative price. But we saw virtually no trade down.","The continued rise in beef prices has resulted in the up charge for these entr\u00e9es not covering the higher ingredient cost. So we\u2019re open to considering a targeted price increase later in 2015 on our Steak and perhaps Barbacoa to help cover the rising cost of beef. Because Steak and Barbacoa account for less than one third of the entr\u00e9es we sell we expect any increase we might consider to have a relatively modest impact on our overall results. But our Food With Integrity mission depends on our ability to charge a fair price for the ingredients we serve and we\u2019re not quite doing that with our beef right now, so while we\u2019re open at a possibility we\u2019ve not made a decision to raise beef prices at this time and we\u2019ll keep you updated if and when we decide to so.","Labor costs were 22.2% of sales in the quarter a decrease of 80 basis points from 2013. And for the full year labor cost were down 100 basis points from 2013. These decreases were mainly due to leverage from the higher full year comp including the menu price increase partially offset by increased wage inflation and hire manager and crew staffing.","While Chipotle has always offered a simple streamline health insurance option to all of our hourly employees on January 1, 2015 we began to offer medical coverage that qualifies under the Affordable Care Act to full time hourly employees, that is those employees working 30 or more hours per week and with at least 12 months of service. Over 10,000 hourly employees were eligible for this plan based on service length and actual hours work and more than 1,000 employees have enrolled so far.","The enrollment number is likely to increase going forward as additional employees will qualify each month as they hit the full time status and as they hit their one year anniversary. And based on the over 1,000 enrolled so far our estimate of expected number and the estimate of expected additional enrollees going forward we expect the additional cost of this health insurance in 2015 to be in the $4 million to $8 million range and all of that will hit our labor line.","Other operating costs were 10.5% for the quarter which is down 80 basis points from 2013 due to leverage from the higher comp in the quarter and slightly lower marketing cost. For the full year other operating costs were 10.6% or down 20 basis points from 2013. Marketing was 1% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our marketing expenses dropped sequentially by 30 basis points as our skillfully made advertising campaign ended for most markets in October. For the full year marketing was 1.4% of sales in 2014 in line with 2013 and we expect it to increase slightly to around 1.5% to 1.6% in 2015.","G&A was 5.7% at quarter or 90 basis points lower than 2013 due primarily to the timing of the accrual for our annual bonus program and the increased acceleration of stock compensation expense in the first three quarters of the year as another one of our officers achieved retiree status. ","For the full year G&A was 6.7% or 40 basis points higher than 2013 primarily driven by higher non-cash non-economic stock comp and from our biennial All Managers\u2019 conference held in September where nearly 3,000 Chipotle employee and suppliers were in attendance.","The non-cash non-economic stock comp expense was $15 million in the quarter and $98 million for the full year which is about $33 million higher than in 2013 due to options granted in 2014 being issued at a much higher share price and as a result of more of the senior management team qualifying for retirement which accelerates the non-cash charges. These items accounted for about 50 basis points of the increase in G&A so without these items underlying G&A would have been lower for the full year 2014. In 2015, we will hold a biennial Field Leadership conference in the third quarter and we expect that will cost around $2 million.","The compensation committee of our Board is actively evaluating our executive comp for 2015 and until that is finalized and approved we\u2019re unable to project and communicate the stock comp expense expected for 2015. Our comp committee expects to finalize the plan in the next week or so and we\u2019ll communicate the impact when we\u2019re able to.","Our 2014 effective tax rate was 37.6% and this is lower than the rate projected at Q3 because of adjustment and our state tax rate due to a change in estimate of usable employer credits and the renewal of the work opportunity and R&D credits in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately the renewal was only approved for 2014 so without the state tax adjustment and without the work opportunity in R&D credit we expect our 2015 tax rate to return to about 39%. These federal credits are renewed the effective tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points in 2015.","During the quarter we purchased about $25 million worth of our stock for over 37,500 shares at an average share price of $650. For the year we purchased about $88 million worth of stock and over 153,000 shares at an average share price of $572. At the end of 2014, we still had about $102 million remaining and a previously announced share buyback program and we're announcing today that the board is authorizing additional share repurchase program of another $100 million.","Overall since 2008 we've invested more than $700 million to purchase more than 4.2 million shares at an average price of $166 per share. Capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursements totaled about $240 million in 2014 primarily related to new restaurants along with continued reinvestment existing restaurant and other company initiatives including a significant upgrade of our restaurant network infrastructure. For 2015 we anticipate CapEx will be around 220 million, the majority of which relates to new restaurant construction.","In 2014 we increased our total cash and investments by $362 million to $1.250 billion even after funding the opening of 192 restaurants and repurchasing $88 million of stock through our share buyback agreements and we still have no debt on our balance sheet. We continue to believe that investing in a high returning new restaurants remains the best use of our cash and we're confident that the growth options we're developing today including ShopHouse, Chipotle and International markets and Pizzeria Locale will provide value enhancing growth opportunities in the future and in the meantime we'll continue to invest in our high returning domestic restaurants and we'll optimistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today and at this time we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.","John Glass ","Thanks. First John, could you just clarify your comment around food cost particularly that you're not going to take pricing but you might take some pricing and that pricing is against targeted, when would you make that decision if not now, because it sounds like beef is going to stay elevated and maybe you can just frame if you did cover that cost increase what the implications for overall cost inflation might be in that scenario?","Unidentified Company Representative ","Yes John, I know that I can be that precise because we haven't made a decision but when we raised our prices in the middle of last year, we double the increase or the difference between our chicken burrito for example and our steak and Barbacoa burrito, historically we've had about $0.30 or $0.35 up-charge for that and we doubled that to about $0.70 and that at the time came closer or is in the ballpark of covering our additional ingredient cost for serving a steak burrito for example.","We'll now get cost as an extra dollar or so to serve steak versus chicken and so, we're actually not covering that up-charge and so it's that situation that causes us to think that we're subsidizing steak and Barbacoa with other items on the menu and that doesn't make sense to us so recognizing that kind of shortfall, we're at least considering raising prices on right now our steak and our Barbacoa. We don't expect to do anything before midyear John, we don't want to have a second increase even though it would be just on a few menu items. We'd rather not do that within a 12 month period, we don't want to double up on price increases.","We think in order for us to remain accessible, we want to hold off as long as we can so we'll look and see watch what happens to these prices throughout the next quarter or two and then around the middle of the year we'll decide whether it makes sense to go ahead and do some kind of a targeted price increase as I just described. In terms of the impact John, we did a $0.30 or $0.40 impact or increase that would be a roughly a 5% or so increase as the order of magnitude steak and Barbacoa and say they account for less than a third of our menu, that would be somewhere between maybe 100 to 150 basis point menu price increase across all of our menu.","So, it's not a huge impact to our overall menu, not a huge impact to our margins but just kind of gets our individual margins for the entr\u00e9es that we serve a little bit more in line.","John Glass ","And just a follow up on the food question, you remove pork from about a third of your restaurants and you said the customers received it well, does that have an impact therefore on sales or no impact on sales and is that also in any way feeding into your view on food cost for '15.","Unidentified Company Representative ","John, at this point it seems to have mostly just -- people are just trading off for chicken or beef or in a few cases our other offerings and it doesn't seem to hit sales at all but certainly yet we'll have more time to analyze that.","John Glass ","Thank you. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino ","Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on a great 2014. Jack, I was wondering if you could comment on how that comp trended throughout the quarter and while there are very strong in an absolute basis they did slow a little bit from Q3 on a one and two year basis so, just wondering what your thoughts are on that sort of modest slowdown that you saw there and then secondly if you could comment on what you're seeing so far in the first quarter that would be helpful. Thanks.","Jack Hartung","Okay, David, during the quarter sales were lower, accounts were lower in November than they were in the other two months and as we can look back at the quarter and as we look back, our sales trends during November, whether was cold through much of number and I think a lot of restaurant companies all saw the same thing and so we think there might have been a temporary weather impact during November. Now we typically don\u2019t ever say that our comp was negatively affected by the weather because usually when the weather improves or returns to more normal weather our customers come back and it kind of makes up for it. So I don\u2019t know that there was a net impact of weather during the quarter but we did see that our comps did dip November and then rebounded back in December. And then into January so far we\u2019re seeing similar sales and transaction trends not necessarily the same comp, in fact not the same comp because as moved in the first quarter we\u2019re now comparing against 13.3 or 13.4. So obviously that comparison is a tougher comparison but in terms of just absolute transaction at dollar levels in January we\u2019re seeing similar trends to what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Operator","(We'll go to) [ph] John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi, great, thank you. Also a question on pricing and how you think about COGS. 35% in the history of Chipotle is the high number so I just wanted to get a sense of why you don\u2019t consider taking at price increase across the menu as opposed to just isolating that as B to I guess acknowledge the A, you could do in a six or nine months ago and didn\u2019t affect customer traffic at all and secondly just to expect what might be a new economic reality that pricing in general is going up across the economy weather because of commodities, because of labor what have you, and if you can just touch on the point that Steve made in his prepared remarks I think there was a comment about the number of Chipotle imitators that were coming into the market place. You\u2019re seeing any kind of competitive impact what so ever on a local basis I mean we certainly can\u2019t see it on a national basis in your comps that are giving you at least somewhat of a hesitation of the amount of pricing that the concept can handle.","Unidentified Company Representative ","John, I\u2019ll take the menu price concept first. First of all in terms of raising menu prices, we just don\u2019t put a very high importance on our food cost percent as a percent of sales what we\u2019ve always focused more on is what is our overall margin and when we apply that margin to our sales what is our unit economic return which at these sales and these margins and with the investment that we\u2019ve got we\u2019re talking about a 70% or so return on investment which is roughly double what other successful chains are delivering. And so we don\u2019t feel this urge with these margins and these returns to increase price just because our food cost happen to be higher. ","[indiscernible] our food cost were going to be 40% but we generated 80% return. So our margins will be higher and our returns will be higher, will that be something that investors would expect, I think the answer would be yes. And so our focus is less on individual line items and more on our margins and our returns. ","The second reason why we\u2019re not in a hurry and never been in hurry to raise prices is part of our vision is to remain accessible. So it\u2019s important that we\u2019ve got to source these high end premium ingredients, sustainably raise ingredient. But we want to be affordable. We want people to feel like they can come to Chipotle as often as they want once a week multiple times a week. And so we would rather err on the side of being more patient and not rushing to raise prices every time some of our ingredient costs move up so that as many people as possible can enjoy Chipotle and I think overtime that strategy has worked well for us. ","And then some of the other one was on competitor impact. We generally don\u2019t see any sustained impact, when we have a competitor open up right next to us we might see a week, one week, maybe 10 days or something where we see sales will drop a little bit, there might be just curiosity where some of our customers may pick in and may grab meal at another fast casual competitor but those sales come right back, so we\u2019ve not ever seen any restaurant open at near us where they\u2019ve taken sales away from us on any kind of sustained basis. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. ","Jeff Bernstein","Great, thank you very much. Two questions, one just Monty on the development side just kind of connecting the dots around what you said on the people side it seems like find the right people of what\u2019s the inhibitor and they talked about a large backlog and what not. So from a development standpoint is it really it would seem like real estate or like you said maybe increased competition to get those sites that\u2019s kind of the biggest constraint. Is that fair to say or should we assume similar to this year some of the \u201814 that you\u2019re able to upside on the unit growth or at what point maybe would we see an acceleration as the people side is well equipped. And then I had a follow up.","Monty Moran","I guess I wouldn\u2019t say that real estate or people, I wouldn\u2019t really pick one of them as being the greater obstacle right now to continue growth. Our people, we feel very good about our people culture like I mentioned in my prepared remarks the ratio of the number of restaurants per field leader is much lower than its tenant in the last several years and we think that gives us a great opportunity to develop more restaurant tours and even where we\u2019re not developing restaurant tours we\u2019re developing a lot of our GMs to get much, much closer to that level. So we feel like there are (very strong) [ph] restaurants if you want to call them that are much, much better and they were getting a lot more they\u2019re getting close to that restaurant tour level. So we feel really good about that. But likewise in talking to our real estate gains they feel really good about what\u2019s out there in the real estate world granted some of the prices are going up because a lot of other concepts are also expanding and growing more quickly due to a better economy but also by the same token Chipotle is a really-really well-known name and landlords are excited to get us on their centers because they believe that we provided real boost to the excitement of their center. And so we find that we\u2019re able to get more than our fair share of deals.","But in both the people side and on the real estate side we have very high standards and we want to make sure that we have loads of restaurants tours and excellent general managers and really good field leaders to open up new restaurants. And so we\u2019re always watching that carefully and not wanting to overstress the cultural side of what we do. But likewise on the real estate side we want to open aggressively but also in a measured way where we\u2019re being careful to make sure that we\u2019re selecting great-great real estate.","And while we are able to go into more secondary sorts of locations than we were say 10, 11, 12, 13 years ago with much more success we still want to do that in a balanced way. So yes we agree we can over time grow faster but we don\u2019t find it super important to rush anything in that regard.","What\u2019s most important to us is to continue to do a great job with our real estate and a great job with our managers and run terrific restaurants such that the demand for what we\u2019re doing continues to outstrip the supply such that when we open new restaurants we have this really great success with our new restaurant openings which I think you heard in Jack\u2019s remarks but now we\u2019re looking at sort of the 1.8 million to 1.9 million for those new restaurant openings and a great return pretty much out of the box which very quickly catches up over the next few years with these very high average unit volumes that we now have which are somewhere in the $2.47 million range per restaurant.","So, by continuing to create demand we continue to have a huge opportunity out in front of us and that allows us to feel really good about our future and our growth.","Jeff Bernstein","And then just to follow up on that as you mentioned kind of the increase in volumes you often talk about I guess around throughput you talk about maybe a second line that you sometimes are catering and online. Just wondering whether there is any potential or maybe in any markets you might offer two lines just some more traditional foot traffic that would seem like that would increase throughput meaningful during peak periods. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s ever an option kind of like a (double enjoy) [ph] to for a drive through concept but the ability to just have a second line at least during certain hours of the day to really help the throughput? Is that a (brand) [ph] option?","Monty Moran","Yes, Jeff I think the answer is it is an option and it\u2019s an idea that has occurred to us and we even experimented with it. But really what\u2019s most important for us is to continue to implement the four pillars of throughput because right now our average restaurant in the country does something about one third of the transactions during lunch as our fastest restaurant in the country does and so the number one opportunity for us along the main service line is that we can go much-much-much faster and we continue to -- and like I said in my remarks we have gotten quicker even though fourth quarter we\u2019re at a pace that while it\u2019s not as quick as our busiest season is close to and faster than our busiest season used to be at throughput.","But we continue to make these throughput gains but we think that there is so much low hanging fruit still in terms of speeding up our restaurants in order to accommodate additional folks that adding a second line would be more disruptive to our operation and to the design of our restaurants than it would be helpful to the economic model at this point.","That being said we do have to keep in mind in almost all of our restaurants a secondary client that we\u2019ve historically referred to as the fax line where we can serve catering orders out of store orders, iPhone orders and such that keeps those orders many of which are larger orders off our main service line. ","Early in my comments just now I mentioned that we had tried the two line method. We have a restaurant in France at [indiscernible] which is a business center in [indiscernible] Paris where we do have -- its one really long line but people tend to go in two directions so it is two service lines with two separate areas, two separate cash registers and so forth.","It works and it works just fine, like I said it\u2019s just not a strategy we need to implement right now and in that location we had a situation where we had a lot of additional square feet where we could put that in to place without losing other aspects of the operation. So, at this point we\u2019re going to continue to focus on the main service line implementing the four pillars of throughput and driving great throughput so that we can have a nice tiny efficient unit economic model.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller","Thanks. Good afternoon. Entr\u00e9e from a company or concept perspective why don\u2019t you just dictate something more structural and then you price practice that kind of systematically takes 1%, 2%, 3% a year and there is certainly patented statistical ways to do that that protects the value proposition? Also thinking about the stock perspective it seems to create a lot of volatility in the share price just from not always fully understanding or appreciating when you are or when you\u2019re not going to take price. So could you comment on it from both perspectives please?","Jack Hartung","First of all, Nicole, none of our discussions about price and what we should charge and ingredients to source and what the going rates of that -- how should price additional food integrity initiatives what kind of price we should charge, none of that ever involves a discussion of the stock price. And so our belief has always been that we have the vision to change food culture the past food culture in this country and if we're successful at that we just believe that we can have lots and lots of value and we've done. We've done that I think even maybe more than a lot of people including ourselves thought were possible 8 years ago when we first went public and so we think that our vision is working or is becoming a reality.","People more than ever care about where their food comes from. Recognize that Chipotle is offering something that many other restaurant companies don't or are unable to offer and so we've always been guided more by our vision than the stock price knowing that the stock price will take care of itself if we're successful. ","Then back to why not choose to kind of an every year thing. It's not linear, food inflation is not linear and so we don't think our price increases should be linear and in addition to that even if you did have regular inflationary pressure, we're constantly investing in our food and so we might have significant investments that we want to make one year and in the early days when we were first introducing that for the rates needs to our market that would dictate the timing of when we will go ahead and raise prices.","And so we don't think that the way our cost either because of food integrity or because of inflation is ever going to be kind of a linear one to 2% or 3% per year and so we don't think the pricing should be linear as well so that would be the way I would describe it.","Nicole Miller","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley ","Hi, thank you. Jack, did you mention a $2 million first quarter charge in connection to the pork issue and if so, could you explain?","Jack Hartung","Yes, we had supplies of pork that were in various -- some of the supplies were in our restaurants, some was in our distribution centers and so the cost of removing all of that pork and disposing of it we were able to donate a lot of it, we're able to sell some of it but in that we've to take a loss Joe and so that loss will total about $2 million, we don't think it will be more than 2 million but we think it will cost about 2 million and that will here our food line during this the first quarter.","Joe Buckley ","Okay, is there any breach of contract this year that you should pursue?","Jack Hartung","Possibly, we haven't done that yet, our first concern was what are we going to do? How are we going to make sure we don't serve this pork and we're now working with our supplier [indiscernible] what the next step is, so there is a possibility but as of right now Joe, we're going to take the hit and if there is any kind of -- the other thing is rather than go and make this a legal issue we'd like to do is we'd like to find a way to get this supplier to rise up to our protocol on a more consistent basis and so rather than this being a legal issue we'd rather look at this as how can we make sure that we can assured supply going forward and that would be more important.","Joe Buckley ","Okay, then maybe just one on development side Mark, I think you said you opened some lower -- the cost you decided to be a little bit lower in 2015 as you should shift away from free standing, away from the Northeast in '14 but the new store volumes are still expected to be higher. Does that again is that the message and could you just explain a little?","Mark Alexee","Yes, I mean we didn't make a specific comment on where we think the new store opening levels are going to be but we're very confident in the pipeline of real estate that we have in front of us and our real estate people feel very good about it, so we have no reason to believe that we won't continue to open restaurants in that 1.8 million, 1.9 million sort of range. ","The reason that we believe development costs are going to come down is people, one thing is that just in 2014 we had an unusually high number of free standards. Sometimes we sort of take what we can get that's not necessarily the result of a strategic objective to open more of them we just happen to find more of them in 2014 that met our screens and look like exciting pieces of real estate that we should build Chipotle restaurants in. In 2015 it's looking like a lot more of our mix is going to end [indiscernible] locations which tend to do wonderfully well but also tend to cost less to build, more of our bread and butter you might say.","So, also we think we can get development cost down because we're working very hard from a design standpoint to implement some of our new better design methodologies but to do it in a more efficient way and to gain some economies of scale on what we're doing so we're approaching the development cost puzzle from a number of different directions but strategically we're not trying to eliminate free standards, we just understand that the [indiscernible] locations that we do very, very well with them and during 2015 it looks like more the pipeline is comprised of them than it was in 2014.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Karen Houlthouse from Goldman Sachs.","Karen Houlthouse","Hi, so the commentary on sequential trends and the quarter and end of January, are we to take that basically as if sales per week seasonally adjusted were flat and if so if there is still incremental opportunities on the throughput side why isn't that continuing to grow and I'm also curious it relates to sequential trends as well if you thought you were seeing any sort of benefit from the stronger low income consumer that's kind of become a buzz word across the restaurant industry given what I think is very legitimate possibility and value even to lower consumer compared to what you typically think of as a fast casual company.","Jack Hartung","First of all on the sequential trends I think the answer is yes, but let me clarify that we\u2019re talking in the same language yes, for the first -- end of January for the first -- the next four and half weeks or so end of the quarter similar sales in more transactions seasonally adjusted that we saw in the fourth quarter, that would be at higher level than last year. So when you say flat yes flat sequentially but not flat compared to last year. ","In terms of higher throughput, higher throughput really comes in to play more or so as we move into the spring month. This is seasonally our lower average daily sales period and so throughput's important throughout the year but it becomes even more important as the weather gets nicer as more and more people are out and about and our lines tend to get a little bit longer and if our throughput is excellent at that time the lines actually won\u2019t get longer and so people will walk in a Chipotle, we serve quickly and so at that point we expect to see a benefit.","In that sense Karen for us to change that trend line we\u2019re going to have to invite more customers in have faster throughput as I mentioned as we hit more of our seasonally higher sales month and hopefully we will see a trend change, very often we do see a trend change or two or three during a year was just happen to see one as we\u2019ve moved just a few weeks of the fourth quarter and into January so far. ","And then in terms of the impact on the customer Chipotle has never really seen a lot of sensitivity in terms of when customers -- when the recession first hit. We weren\u2019t the first in fact we were one of the last ones to see any impact on our sales and when the recession was ending and we were coming out of recession we were one of the first ones to see a sales increase and we returned to double digit comps pretty quickly as the recession was ending. And so generally our customers come to Chipotle sure they say its great value when we do research our customers give us very, very high scores on the great value. But we have very loyal customers such that they don\u2019t stop coming to Chipotle when they have few less dollars in their pocket and then all of a sudden say, boy I\u2019m going to start going to Chipotle more often because I've got a few more bucks. I think the good news here is that people find ways to visit Chipotle and it\u2019s not necessarily affected by whether they\u2019ve got an extra bucks in their pocket. Our customer loyalty kind of overcomes these what I will call relatively minor changes in our customers' spending ability.","Karen Houlthouse","And as a quick follow up, you really haven't seen sequentially trends sort of stabilized, what\u2019s the thought process around if not more explicitly addressing that with you on their spend of marketing versus the peer group, you are more explicitly addressing it in some of the -- nuts and bolts ways to get more people in the door. ","Jack Hartung","Well, geez, the comp was 16.1% so are you saying spend more money to get a higher than 16.1% comp? I\u2019m not sure I understand the question.","Karen Houlthouse","Well sequentially things have stabilized week over week or month over month, there aren't more people coming in the door, you basically are just staring down or perpetually decelerating comp, why not be more proactive about putting things in place that will -- prevent that.","Unidentified Company Representative ","Well, for about -- I don't -- for over 20 years we\u2019ve been working very hard to improve every aspect of the customer experience. So for instance we've got roughly speaking the same menu we had 20 years ago. During all of those 20 years and particularly during the years since we\u2019ve been public we\u2019ve been hearing a crescendo of people wondering why we don\u2019t add additional menu items and change other aspects of what we do and yet we\u2019ve had the highest comps I think in the history of the restaurant business during that time and likewise we keep trying to improve the quality of our cultures so we have better people serving you. ","We\u2019ve been increasing -- improving the quality of our average raw ingredient, every ingredient we have has been under our scrutiny, in order to make sure the food test as good as it can take. Then we work on throughput to make sure that that aspect of the customer experience also improves and what we find is that by focusing on those things that we do really, really well but yet getting even better at them we\u2019ve been able to sustain a much stronger comp than any other restaurant company has done. So it may look like we\u2019re staring down the pike at sort of flattening sales and no increase in comps, it looks that way 10 years ago and nine years ago and eight years ago and seven, six, five, four three, two, one years ago I think even a year ago if you looked at what our guidance was for the year I believe at the very beginning of 2014 we said that there will be a low single digit comp I think are flat to low single digit comp and that looked like what it was going to be at the time.","How did we get to a mid-to-high-teen comp doing that which we do even better and so it is possible of course that our comp will flatten out and there won\u2019t be sequential trend changes to the positive but we hope that our continued focus on trying to do everything we do better will work out just super.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to next question from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer ","Jack you touched on it but you increased your labor staffing ratios in early \u201814. I think you addressed largely the double digit transaction growth and some other things but as we\u2019re modeling the labor line in \u201815 how should we be thinking about staffing levels relative to what we saw last year, meaning you think there is another little bump in staffing levels? Are you going to hold tight with what you saw in \u201814?","Jack Hartung","Jeff I wouldn\u2019t expect another bump, now we\u2019ll add people as we see more transactions so as our comps continue to be in the high single or low double digit we\u2019ll add people at kind of a normal level, I would expect that it would not be as much as we saw in the last year or so. We talk on other calls that we have some labor inefficiencies and so we have more staffing at restaurant level and I think we have just more approved that we can schedule. We have more managers, hourly or salary managers and hourly managers on our teams than ever before. And so the hours that were to appoint are higher than we think they normally should be even at these very high comps that we\u2019ve been delivering. ","But we\u2019ve also said we\u2019re not going to be in hurry to go shape those inefficiencies out of the restaurant. It\u2019s been an extraordinary year in terms of throughput, in terms of transaction, we\u2019ve moved to a whole another sales level here. And so the fact that we\u2019ve had some what I call relatively modest labor inefficiencies somewhere in the maybe 50, 60, 70 basis points kind of range. We\u2019re not going to be in a hurry to shape that loose. We\u2019re aware of it, our teams are aware it and so I wouldn\u2019t see additional inefficiencies creep in and at some point in the future I just wouldn\u2019t want to pinpoint when, we believe we will get this efficiency back but I wouldn\u2019t see a similar kind of step up for the reasons I just mentioned. I think you will see another layer of inefficiency creep in like you\u2019ve seen in the last year and half.","Jeff Farmer ","Just one quick follow up, so excluding stock-based comp, which means that clearly that we still need to figure out what that number potentially could be, so again excluding stock-based comp how should we be thinking about G&A dollar growth in \u201815 or even absolute sort of G&A dollars in \u201815?","Jack Hartung","Yes, I would expect at this level Jeff, that our G&A excluding non-cash comp and excluding any kind of one-time things that might happen will be at a similar but hopefully slightly lower as a percentage of sales. There is not a ton of leverage but I would say there is slight leverage that hopefully we will get as I would expect the G&A as a percentage of sales anything stock comp should drift slightly lower over the coming years.","Operator","And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mark Alexee for any additional or closing remarks.","Mark Alexee","Thank you for joining us. We really appreciate it. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter for our first quarter financial results. Thanks. ","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you.","I would now like to introduce Investor Relations Manager for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Mr. Mark Alexee. You may begin your conference.","Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the second quarter of 2015. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements about our potential business results, growth in shareholder returns, projections of the number of restaurants we intend to open and trends and development costs, estimates of future comparable restaurant sales increases or comps, and supply chain and other trends affecting future comps, projections regarding trends in food, labor and G&A costs, our expected effective tax rate, statements about stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.","These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated on our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. I'd like to remind everyone that we had adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the third quarter, it will begin September 1 and continue through our Q3 earnings release planned for October 20, 2015.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Crumpacker, Chief Creative and Development Officer.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Mark. I'm pleased with our performance during the second quarter and first half of 2015. On the heels of what was arguably our best year ever as a public company in 2014, we have continued to post strong results. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 14.1% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 4.3% and the opening of 48 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.45 per share, an increase of 27.1%.","These results are particularly strong considering the very difficult comparisons we face and keep us on pace with the guidance we provided for 2015. The strength of our business is the result of our focus on our unique food and people cultures, and in an increasingly crowded and competitive industry, these unique and compelling attributes continue to differentiate Chipotle and drive our success.","During the quarter, we took a significant step to improve the food we serve when we completed our transition to using only non-GMO ingredients to make all the food we serve in our restaurants. We began this effort two years ago when we made the decision to voluntarily disclose the GMOs in our ingredients. Following that move, we worked to eliminate the limited number of GMO ingredients we were using to make our food, which included soybean oil and some ingredients in our tortillas. Today, all of the food we serve at Chipotle restaurants is made with non-GMO ingredients.","While that decision was made with some criticism, most of which was tied to the notion that GM foods do not present any health risks to people who consume them, the majority of the response to our decision was overwhelmingly positive, and we believe it was the right thing to do for a number of reasons. First, we believe that a few GMO ingredients that were on our menu were not making our food any better in any way; second, that there was considerable debate about long-term impacts associated with GMO farming systems; and third, that more research is necessary to fully understand the impacts of GMO foods, particularly studies that are long-term and independent in nature.","Our position on GMOs very much aligns with consumer sentiment on this issue, and quite simply, Chipotle is the only national chain where consumers can eat anything on the menu without worry about eating GMOs. This direction is not new for us, and the decision is very consistent with our overall culture of serving food with integrity. There are a number of ingredients that have been declared safe to eat, including artificial flavorings and colorings for example, that are also not in our food. Simply because something is deemed safe doesn't mean that it's necessary or that it makes our food better in any way.","With our food now made entirely from non-GMO ingredients, we have set our sights on making better tortillas. These artisanal tortillas are made using only five ingredients: flour, water, starter, vegetable oil, and salt. And when you consider that the starter, which is the leavening agent, is made from flour and water, it's really just four ingredients. While this might sound like a relatively simple undertaking, it's actually quite a challenge because one has to account for a number of variables: moisture in the flour, temperature and humidity in the bakery, strength of the starter, et cetera. And many of the chemical additives in commercial tortillas are designed to mitigate these variabilities.","So, while our tortillas necessitate the keen eye and hand of our bakers, we know that skilled bakers can make better tasting tortillas, more similar to homemade tortillas than we currently get at commercial scale. Tortillas made commercially generally contain artificial additives, including preservatives to extend their shelf life and dough conditioners to give them strength and the ability to stretch in order to eliminate the need for natural fermentation process of the dough. The new tortillas we are working to develop through a partnership with Washington State University's Bread Lab would have no artificial ingredients, but rather will have only a few real whole ingredients that have traditionally been used to make tortillas.","Returning to this fresher, simpler tortilla essentially requires that we reinvent the way tortillas are made on a large scale, and that's exactly what we're doing. While we're in the very early stages of this project, the tortillas that we're making are delicious and perform very well. Later this fall, we'll be scaling the project up for continued testing. This is consistent with our overall Food With Integrity mission, one that respects the environment, farmers, the bakers, our customers' health, and ultimately their taste buds.","We have also made significant progress to resolve our pork shortage which began in January. As you'll likely recall, we suspended one of our primary pork suppliers when a routine audit found that the supplier was not adhering to all facets of our animal welfare protocol. We have found the new supplier, Karro Food Group of the UK, and have begun serving pork from Karro in most of our Florida restaurants, a little over 100 restaurants in total. While it has always been our preference to source meats domestically, the quantity of pork that meets our standards is simply not available right now from domestic suppliers as the vast majority of pork raised in the United States, more than 95% based on our estimates, is not raised to our standards.","The pork we are getting from Karro Foods meets or exceeds all of our animal welfare standards including that this pork comes from pigs that are born on pasture and raised in deeply bedded barns. However, Karro adheres to a different antibiotic protocol. Under Karro's program, pigs can be given antibiotics under veterinary supervision and can remain in supply. What is important to note is that antibiotics cannot be used sub-therapeutically to promote growth at Karro. This program is common in the UK and has been endorsed by a number of animal welfare, scientific and veterinary organizations in the United States.","During the coming months, we'll be sourcing more pork from Karro and returning carnitas to the restaurants around the country on a market-by-market basis until we're fully supplied again, which we expect to happen before the end of the year. We knew when we made the decision to suspend the pork supplier that it would leave us without enough pork for all of our restaurants and that our decision could impact customers' perceptions of Chipotle and have an impact on our sales. We're extremely pleased by the reaction from our customers, many of whom applauded us for taking this principled stand. As we continue to ramp up our pork supply, we expect to regain any lost sales tied to this outage.","We're making these changes to improve our ingredients as we continue on our Food With Integrity journey. For more than 15 years, we've been working hard to change the way people think about and eat fast food. In recent months, a number of food companies have made pledges to remove some artificial ingredients from their food, primarily things like artificial colors and preservatives. This reality, however, is that these ingredients make up only a portion of the thousands of additives used in processed foods. Aside from our tortillas, none of our foods include any of these additives.","With competitors making vague pledges, we're strengthening our marketing message to continue to show the contrast between what Chipotle has always done and the changes others are pledging. We've always and will continue to make our food with the very best ingredients we can find. And once our tortilla project is complete, we will not rely on any of the artificial ingredients that are so prevalent in processed foods.","To highlight this differentiation, today we launched a new program called Friends or Faux, which is an integrated campaign that includes an interactive digital game that invites customers to learn about the difference between Chipotle's ingredients and those commonly used to make fast food and processed\/packaged foods. To play the game, consumers choose a Chipotle menu item and a representative traditional fast food item, and they compare and match the ingredients, identifying which items contain which ingredients. The online game will include a limited-time BOGO promotion for participants, while encouraging customers to learn more about Food With Integrity mission. In addition to the game, the campaign is also supported by extensive online advertising, which begins today.","Constantly working to improve the quality and taste of the food we serve is embedded in our culture and our track record to improve our food is unmatched in the industry. With the strength of our food culture and a unique and compelling people culture that further separates Chipotle from other restaurant companies, we believe we have the pieces in place to continue to change the way people think about and eat fast food and to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Monty.","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Thank you, Steve. Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our very special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are providing a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience, while also running our restaurants in a way that helps us maintain a strong unique economic model. Having the best teams requires that we provide extraordinary opportunities for our people. The most unique benefit that we provide is the opportunity for our people to develop into the most effective leaders they can be with the most rewarding career possible, and this is at the core of our culture. But we also invest in benefits and compensation packages that match the talent of our teams.","During the quarter, a number of up and coming leaders took advantage of new opportunities, as we promoted 39 managers into restaurateur positions and also promoted 16 new field leaders including nine apprentice team leaders, three team leaders, and two team directors. These promotions are what we've come to expect at Chipotle. Currently, more than 90% of our restaurant managers come from within the ranks of our crew and we've promoted 5,900 people who started as crew into management positions just this year, on top of the 10,500 people who started as crew and were promoted into management positions last year.","With our strong ability to develop our leaders from within and the importance of establishing restaurateur cultures in all of our restaurants, our people culture continues to be a primary asset leading to our growth and also gives us great optimism that we will continue to experience strong growth going forward.","The leaders we are developing are able to attract other talented people to our company and are deeply committed to having these new people reach their full potential. By hiring only top performing employees and developing them to be at their very best, we are able to do things that other restaurant companies simply can't do. Not only do our teams run extraordinary restaurants, preparing delicious food using classic cooking techniques and providing exceptional customer service, they also elevate the people around them. This approach to running our restaurants is what enables us to create such an outstanding dining experience and to deliver such strong unit economics.","To help perpetuate our culture and the development of our top performers, we held a meeting during the quarter with field leaders, some of them new to the company and others with long careers here, to discuss and clarify the role of all field leaders at Chipotle. We were pleased at how committed our leaders are to the concept of achieving success by making others better. Our field leaders see more clearly now than ever that their success depends on the success of the people they lead. There's no ambiguity as to the priorities we have for our leaders at Chipotle. They know that their job is to develop restaurateurs and they have a very clear understanding as to how to do that.","We've told our field leaders that we define their success by looking at three things: first, that each general manager that they lead must know exactly why they're not a restaurateur; second, each of their general managers must be able to clearly state exactly what their plan is to become a restaurateur and what their priorities are in order to do so; third, the general managers must be actually developing into restaurateurs. The most important tool field leaders have to help them succeed in this task is the Restaurateur diagnosis and plan tool. Using this tool allows our field leaders to uncover the positive and negative themes that may exist in each restaurant and to make a specific plan for how to best eliminate those negative themes.","With the tool now well established, field leaders are using it as the basis for each visit to a restaurant, and with the proper progress updates, it is allowing our field leaders to chart the development path for restaurateur cultures, with each visit and each revision to the plan serving as a new chapter in the development story for the general manager. Of course all of these stories should have the same ending, another team establishing a restaurateur culture and adding to our group of elite leaders who are changing the way people think about and eat fast food.","During the quarter, we took some important steps to strengthen our compensation and benefits programs, particularly at the crew level. We completed the first installment of our twice-annual merit increases for crew and made a one-time compensation adjustment for our kitchen managers and service managers to ensure compensation for those positions is consistent with the very high expectations that these roles carry. We also made improvements to the benefits we offer hourly crew by increasing paid vacation and adding paid sick days, and by expanding our tuition reimbursement program to include hourly employees in addition to the salary managers to whom this benefit was already available.","One of the greatest benefits of having such strong cultures in our restaurants is that it enables us to deliver excellent customer service, which generates great throughput. Our teams understand the qualities that make for great throughput are the same qualities that provide the very best customer service, having everything ready in the restaurant before customers arrive so that we're prepared for service, particularly at our busiest times, as well as clear authentic communication with customers to keep our lines moving quickly without making people feel rushed.","During the quarter, we held a national throughput competition to emphasize the importance of the four pillars in our restaurants. We achieved a number of new one-hour throughput records by reiterating the fundamentals of throughput and we continue to increase the number of restaurants that are implementing the four pillars during our peak dinner periods. As a result, we were able to largely maintain the substantial gains we made during 2014 to our throughput during our peak lunch and dinner hours. This is significant because last year was a tremendous year in which we delivered double-digit transaction comps that created the very tough comparison for this year. Our restaurateurs continue to find opportunities to improve our standards and increase throughput, and we know that we're in a stronger position today as we're better prepared to utilize the four pillars to provide a more favorable customer experience.","Finally, on the development front, we are well on track throughout the first half of the year towards our guidance of opening 190 to 205 new restaurants. Actually the pace of openings during the first half of the year gives us confidence that we'll finish 2015 at or above the high end of our guidance range for the full year. During the second quarter, we opened 48 new restaurants. That's a total of 97 so far for the year, bringing our total number of restaurants to 1,878.","After the end of the quarter, we also opened one new restaurant in London where Chipotle continues to build a strong customer base. With the first week of opening of our seventh restaurant in the UK, our team has already beat the existing UK throughput record with 229 transactions during its peak lunch hour, which is very encouraging. And finally, Canada's performance has been so successful that we no longer consider it to be a growth seed, but rather a growth strategy. This means we now view Canada as a proven market and will look to accelerate our pace of development in Canadian markets over the next year.","We also just completed the second of our three Cultivate Festivals for the year as the most recent festival concluded in Kansas City last weekend. This year's event in Kansas City was a terrific success and consumers were able to try out Pizzeria Locale at the festival ahead of our new restaurant opening tomorrow in Kansas City. We continued to further develop our growth seeds with a Pizzeria Locale opening in Cincinnati and a new ShopHouse to open in Chicago. So heading into the third quarter, we're in a great position from a development perspective and we continue to have a very strong real estate pipeline.","We're excited about our results for the quarter and for the first half of 2015. With a strong food culture, a unique and empowering people culture and the best unit economics in the industry, we are changing the way people think about and eat fast food and we're delivering outstanding results for our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Monty. We're proud of our performance through the first half of 2015 in which we continue to have positive comp sales on annual restaurant volumes that now average more than $2.5 million each. While our comparisons this year are the toughest we've faced as a public company, I'm confident that our top-performing teams will continue to attract more customers as they prepare and serve delicious food made from high quality, sustainably-raised ingredients.","I've been very active since our last earnings call, visiting five of our eight regions and spending time with our field leadership and restaurant teams and promoting 17 new restaurateurs during that time, which gives me great confidence that we have a strong bench of up and coming future leaders to support our growth.","Our sales increased 14.1% in the quarter to $1.2 billion driven by new restaurant openings and a sales comp of 4.3%, which is right in line with the Q2 guidance of low-to-mid single digits we provided in April. The comp was driven mainly by our price increase from last year, which contributed 4% to the comp.","We've now fully lapped the price increase taken in the second quarter of 2014, so the 4% pricing benefit we enjoyed in Q2 is gone. Comp sales transaction counts in July so far remain in positive territory in the low-single digits. We're still without pork in about 40% of our restaurants today, but July sales are benefiting slightly by about 60 basis points from a targeted price increase on steak and barbacoa.","As we discussed during prior earnings calls, we decided to take this targeted menu price increase in steak and barbacoa as beef pricing remains at historically high levels and our menu price gap between steak and barbacoa versus other entrees did not cover this higher cost. The average increase was just about 4% or about $0.30 per entree.","We've not yet increased beef prices in about 40% of our restaurants, which have not been resupplied with carnitas. We held off in those markets because we want to avoid the unintended consequence of having customers trade from carnitas to steak or barbacoa and then be forced to pay more for their meal. Our intention is to raise beef prices in these markets once carnitas is back in supply. The price increase was effective earlier this month and while it's still early we have not seen any resistance so far.","For the full year we continue to expect comps to be in the low to mid-single digits, including the targeted price increase on beef I just discussed. This assumes our comps will remain in the low-single digits for the rest of this year. As Steve mentioned, we recently added a new pork supplier and we hope to be back in full supply of carnitas in all markets by early in Q4.","In April we estimated a pork shortage may have impacted our comp by as much as 200 basis points and we believe the net impact for Q2 was in line with this estimate. And while we're optimistic that bringing pork back to all markets will help our comp, we have not included any bounce back related to carnitas in our guidance.","Restaurant level margins increased 70 basis points to 28%, among our highest margins as a public company, despite being a less than stellar quarter for our labor execution. The higher margins were driven by our lower food cost at 33.1% which were 150 basis points better than last year and 80 basis points better than the first quarter. The lower food costs are tied to our menu price increase from last year along with lower pricing for dairy and avocados as lower dairy was driven by continued strong production and a strengthening U.S. dollar, and the avocado supply has benefited from an increased harvest of Mexican avocados.","Beef costs held relatively stable in the quarter, but remain substantially elevated from historical levels and added nearly 100 basis points to our food costs compared to last year. We hope our food costs can remain at about this level through the back half of the year, but we do expect some pressure from avocados as we purchased more from the California growers and perhaps also from beef, which has been difficult to predict and could remain volatile.","Labor costs were 22.6% of sales during the quarter, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year. While labor rates are increasing at a faster rate than they have in a very long time, which I'll talk about a little later, the majority of this higher labor relates to ineffective labor scheduling and execution. We were hampered during the quarter by an interruption in our labor management reporting as a result of implementing a new workforce enterprise system. Our investment in our operational systems are a long-term investment that will allow for more effective scheduling in the future but is not without some short-term hurdles that can be typical of these integration efforts.","This has caused us to temporarily lose some oversight of our labor scheduling. We've now reestablished most of the management reporting now. And so far in July we recaptured about half of the opportunity or about 40 basis points and we expect to capture the rest of the opportunity during the third quarter. So the third quarter will still have somewhat elevated labor as we're recapturing the lost labor efficiency throughout this quarter, but we expect to be back to normal for all of Q4.","We believe this labor challenge has negatively impacted EPS during the second quarter by about $0.16. While we're disappointed with our labor execution, our field teams are committed to bring our labor back in line quickly and they're going well beyond that to ensure that all of our restaurant managers and our field leaders become experts at writing and executing great schedules, so our labor deployment will be great with or without the availability of oversight reporting in the future. So I'm confident we will fully recapture this opportunity.","Hourly labor rates including our hourly managers increased 4.2% in the quarter, the fastest we have seen in many years. There has been a general increase in wage rates in many of our markets and because we desire and expect to attract and reward only top performers, very important for us to stay ahead of the curve and pay attractive starting wages. We also continually monitor the pay of our top performers already in our restaurants as they progress through the manager ranks to ensure we're paying fair wages in light of their significant contributions and so this is also a contributing factor to the increase in the quarter.","As Monty mentioned, we also enhanced the benefits off to our crew by adding a tuition reimbursement program and by paying for sick time and increasing the vacation pay. By far the greatest benefit we offer to our people is a significant opportunity to advance into leadership positions within Chipotle, but these enhancements represent important investments to ensure we are attracting, retaining, and elevating the very best people into these leadership positions. We know that our special people culture with the restauranteur as a centerpiece leads to a better dining experience for our customers, better tasting food, faster throughput, the development of extraordinary future leaders, better business results, and ultimately the creation of significant shareholder value.","So it's important to note that improving our special people culture occurs through great leadership and having a restauranteur vision and cannot simply be bought by throwing additional dollars at our team, but a key component of our people culture is to attract and retain great people. So we make these investments knowing it will make our company stronger. We expect the incremental costs of these investments to be about $2.5 million incrementally on a quarterly basis beginning in the third quarter.","We typically pay above minimum wage in all of our markets, so a normal increase in local wages usually has little effect on us. But in some local markets the minimum wage has been or soon will be pushed well above our national average rate.","In the San Francisco Bay Area for example, the minimum wage was recently increased to over $12 an hour. This increase coupled with higher occupancy and other operating costs excluding food costs contribute to an overall cost of doing business of 30% or more compared to 30% or more higher than our average Chipotle. But our menu prices in the San Francisco area were until recently only about 4% above the typical Chipotle and were lower than most competitors in the area. So as a result of looking at all of these factors, we decided we were underpriced in San Francisco and we recently increased prices by 10% in the 10 restaurants within San Francisco and by 7% for the 74 restaurants outside San Francisco in the Bay Area.","These relatively modest increases effectively pass along only some of the higher cost of doing business in that area. Because only 84 restaurants were affected, the impact on the overall company will be about 30 basis points on an annual basis. We'll take a similar approach when the overall costs of doing business in a market are escalating on a case-by-case basis, whether these higher costs are driven by legislative changes or by market forces. As an example, although the minimum wage in Maryland recently increased to over $10 an hour, our overall cost of doing business are reasonable there. And so we do not plan to increase our pricing in those restaurants.","Our objective will always be to keep our menu accessible to our customers while being able to recruit the best people we can with competitive wages in each market and also while considering the overall cost of doing business and competitive prices in the area.","Occupancy cost for the quarter were 5.4% of sales, flat compared to last year. Other operating costs were 10.9% during the quarter, down 10 basis points from 2014. Marketing was 1.8% during the quarter, slightly lower than the second quarter of last year, and we continue to expect our marketing expense to be around 1.7% of sales overall for the year. G&A was 5.9% in the quarter, down 120 basis points from the prior year due to lower non-cash stock comp expense. Full year non-cash stock comp is expected to be slightly below the $80 million we previously forecasted. And this expense will be more evenly weighted throughout the year.","Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 38.8% and we estimate our effective tax rate for the full year will be about 38.7% and that compares to 37.6% for the full year 2014. Last year benefited from an increase in the estimated useable state credits and from the work opportunity and R&D federal tax credits which have not been renewed for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 30 basis points.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.45, an increase of 27.1%. We finished the second quarter with nearly $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including short-term and long-term interest bearing investments and no debt on our balance sheet.","Since our last earnings call on April 21 and through yesterday, we invested more than $100 million to repurchase nearly 164,000 shares of our stock at an average share price of $621. This is more than four times the dollar amount invested during the first quarter and nearly five times the number of shares purchased during Q1 when the average purchase price was $675. And this is a good example of what we mean by being opportunistic with the timing and the magnitude of our share buybacks.","While we continue to believe investing in our high-returning restaurants remains the best use of our cash, we'll also continue to invest opportunistically in repurchasing our stock. And today we announced that our board has authorized the investment of an additional $100 million to repurchase our stock, which brings our current unused authorization as of yesterday to $170 million.","Thanks for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go first to David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Jack, I just wanted to follow up on some of the commentary about recent sales trends. I think you said July had stayed positive on comps. Could you confirm that that also implies that traffic is trending positively or at least flat so far this quarter?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, David, both sales and transactions are positive in July. They're in the low-single digits, but they're both positive.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. And then my other question is around the carnitas issue, and I was just wondering if you could share what you've learned so far about the customer reaction to that in terms of the traffic trends. And then I think you've brought that back in at least one market recently, Manhattan. So could you talk about how long it takes for customers to respond to that coming back and your confidence level that you'll be able to win that business back when you get the full chain rolled out on pork?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, David, it's really early to know what the exact response is going to be based on this new supply that Steve talked about from Karro in the UK. But when we saw other markets, you remember since January when we first ran out, we had this rolling blackout. So every several weeks we would have one market run out of carnitas, and then we would replenish the supply in another market. And what you saw, that it took several weeks to get the full product mix back. And I would say that's anywhere between three weeks at the low side up to five or six weeks on the high side.","So we're optimistic that we'll start to see some of that recovery as we continue to roll markets, but we're going to roll markets with this new supply of carnitas from now throughout the summer and then into early in the fourth quarter. And so hopefully what we'll see market by market is that the product mix will recover over several weeks and that we'll start to see sales comps recover as well.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll now go to our next question from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. I had a couple of questions actually, more about on the mobile side. I know you've been making some investments there. I was wondering if you could talk about that. Is the progress a potential comp driver, and related to that, maybe anything you've done on loyalty. It occurs to me that that's probably a rich source of data on your customers. And particularly now when the carnitas has been in shortage, you could communicate with customers directly and you would know who is or who isn't buying carnitas at your stores. It just feels like an untapped data pool that maybe you could use. So just an update on mobile, Apple Pay, loyalty, that whole kind of ecosystem, please.","Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative and Development Officer","Sure, Sara. This is Mark Crumpacker talking. Yes, in fact we've been investing in mobile on an ongoing basis for quite a while. We're still in the process of evaluating the level of effort that's going to be required to implement Apple Pay in particular. And we certainly see that as being a significant benefit to us once we can get that enabled, especially if it in any way speeds throughput at our restaurants. But we're also on a continuing basis updating our mobile ordering app to be more efficient.","In fact, we did an update just a couple of months ago and we have another one coming up which make the ordering more accurate, which we're looking at having a significant impact. And one thing I'll direct you to that's not necessarily related to mobile that is also our efforts around catering, which currently cannot be ordered online, nor can it be paid for online. That's another initiative that we're working on which we expect will have an impact.","With regard to loyalty, that's a tricky subject. We've studied this in-depth, and we don't believe the general supposition that loyalty will make less frequent customers more frequent. We've studied that and just simply don't believe that to be true. However, what you said is true, in that you learn a tremendous amount of information about your customers. And so we're planning on doing that, but not through a traditional loyalty program but rather through mobile payment. So we will provide our customers at some time various options through which they can pay for their food and we will capture data from them, whether that's through a third party or through the ability to use our own gift cards. And that will give us a tremendous amount of data about those customers. So, I can't tell you right now when those things are going to be complete, but we're investigating and pursuing all of them.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from David Palmer with RBC.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Just building on that, I just did that Friend or Faux quiz online, which I guess was kicked off today or recently, and at the end it included a BOGO coupon which could be texted to me and then it also signed me up to get text updates four times a month. What will be the nature of those texts that we'll be getting? Are those going to be also value-oriented deals?","Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative and Development Officer","Well, I mean, we've actually had a text database of a number of our customers for quite a long time, and we send them a variety of different communications. They sometimes are promotion based and it really depends obviously on what we're trying to accomplish. Other times we'll send them information about upcoming events like our Cultivate events, if it's in their city. For most of our text database subscribers, we know where they are, so we can localize those messages. But we are constantly trying to expand our mobile database. It's a very effective way for us to efficiently reach our customers.","In fact, the Friend or Faux game that you mentioned, just since it launched today, more than 0.5 million people have already played the game. So it's really got extraordinary power. So, yes, there will be offers in those, but certainly not every one of the communications will be an offer.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to better understand what comps you need to offset inflation. I hate to call or ask in a \"normal\" environment, but can you help us gauge the second half store level margin in what is presumably a low-single digit comp environment, given that in Q2 you still did concentrate (36:51) leverage on store level margin?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Nicole, food cost will not change based on our comps. So food costs will either change or remain stable just based on commodity pricing, the pricing of the ingredients that we buy. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're hoping that those will remain stable and stay at about the level we just saw in the second quarter. So the rest of the P&L has some variable and some fixed costs in there.","From a labor standpoint, we typically need kind of a mid-single digit comp in order to just hold our labor as a percentage of sales, so it's somewhere in that 4% to 6% range. So low-single digit comps would imply that we're going to delever on the labor line.","The rest of the P&L, a low-single digit comp, it depends on whether it's a 1% or a 3%. If it's in the 2% or 3% range, unless there is something unusual with energy costs or something unusual which would affect utilities, we should be okay. We should be able to about hold the rest of the costs on our P&L as a percentage of sales. So it really comes down to labor.","Now keep in mind we did announce all these benefits. And so regardless of the comp, we are going to see an incremental $2.5 million added to both the third quarter and fourth quarter, and that will continue as an additional cost of providing the benefits. And so that will cause some slight delevering as well.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Nicole.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jason West with Credit Suisse.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes, thanks. Just wanted to come back to the pricing outlook. Jack, you talked about a couple different pieces with San Francisco and then some of the beef cost pressures. But then some of that's going to get delayed as you wait for carnitas to roll out. So could you help us out with maybe what the aggregate price increase is going to look like over the next few quarters with these different timing issues?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, as we roll carnitas, there's about 40% of our restaurants don't have carnitas today. And so that's going to be a price increase that will be in the ballpark of this 4%. And our beef, our steak and barbacoa is somewhere in the 30% range in terms of product mix. So we're right now running about 60 basis points of incremental comp because of raising prices on beef. When we roll the rest of the 40% that will get us somewhere in the 100, 110 basis points or something like that. And then any other things that we do related to local cost of doing business, I would expect to be relatively modest.","The example I gave you was San Francisco and the Bay Area. That adds an additional 30 basis points. There's not much else going on really between now and the end of the year. So I would say we're going to be between the \u2013 if you take the 60 basis points on the higher cost of steak and barbacoa, add the 30 basis points from San Francisco, that's 90 basis points. There might be another 30 basis points or 40 basis points or so that will roll in over the next several months. And that would be about it for this year.","There are some additional structural costs, higher costs of doing business that we will look at next year like we did in San Francisco. But just because minimum wage is increasing in a market doesn't mean we're going to raise prices. The example that I gave in Maryland is a great example. Another one is in Chicago. Chicago just recently implemented higher minimum wage, and we don't expect to raise prices there in the near future, probably not at all this year. And so we'll look at it market by market and there might be some cases where when you look at all of our higher cost of doing business that we might deem that it's necessary to take a price increase in those markets. But I wouldn't expect that to be a significant add-on to our comp or a significant add-on to the menu price increases.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful, by the way. On the labor side, the incremental $2.5 million per quarter, is that inclusive of some of the wage inflation that you're talking about that stepped up lately, and I think you've raised wages for certain positions, or is that separate from the wage inflation that we're seeing?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","It's inclusive of the stuff that Monty talked about where we looked at our kitchen managers and service managers, where we took a look at all of our folks that are already on board. Some of that hit in the second quarter and then incrementally adding $2.5 million onto the third and fourth quarter will cover all of that. What it doesn't necessarily include is if there is just general market forces. In a market where wages are increasing faster than expected, that isn't necessarily included in that, and that would be dealt with case by case. But the $2.5 million will consider all of the adjustments that we've done from a benefit standpoint and from a wage standpoint to all of our internal folks.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, Jack. Just want to follow up on the San Francisco example. I mean, what has the consumer reaction told you in San Francisco so far about the ability to take that kind of targeted price increase, if it makes sense given the pressures in the market? And then secondarily, on the pork from England, is that a similar margin profile to what you get in the U.S.?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So on San Francisco, Sharon, I was just out in San Francisco a few weeks ago, visited a bunch of our restaurants, talked to our teams there, talked to some customers as well. No reaction whatsoever from what I can tell. We don't see it in any of the sales trends. We don't see it with any of the anecdotal feedback we're getting. Frankly, I think we've got lots more room to increase prices if we need to. The costs of doing business are so extraordinary in that whole market that I think we're underpriced, and we could increase prices more.","As you know, we've never wanted to be too aggressive at any one time, but there's more room to do that. And so if the cost of business continue to remain elevated or if they increase further, we've got more room. I wouldn't expect us to do anything inside of 12 months. I don't think we would do two within a year, but I think we've got lots more room. And then the margin on pork very similar to our margin for the domestic pork.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Sharon.","Operator","And we'll go next to Karen Short from Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Just a question to follow up on the loyalty philosophy. I guess I don't know that I necessarily understand your philosophy on being reluctant or unwilling to introduce some form of loyalty or affinity program, because I guess the way I see it is you incur costs associated with the BOGOs or the Friend or Faux free burritos and things like that, so you could recoup costs if you are introducing some kind of affinity program that does involve some free giveaways, but then you get the benefit of having that much more robust data and analytics, I guess. So maybe just some color there.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","I'll take a shot at part of this and then I think Mark will want to add something in. Karen, we have done a very thorough analysis of kind of the traditional loyalty programs and the problem is Chipotle already has so many loyal customers that the fixed costs of implementing an ongoing loyalty program were so extraordinary that you had to get a pretty big incremental comp just to cover those costs and then you had to get a comp on top of that and then maintain it for it to be profitable at all.","What we've found is we've been able to build loyalty through more organic methods by encouraging people to learn more about Chipotle, by piquing their interest about how food is raised, by having them come into Chipotle and be treated to an extraordinary dining experience.","And so we've seen our loyalty go up over the years, and we think that's a better way to do it than putting in a structural framework that we didn't think was going to be profitable at all and or maybe it would be a breakeven or you'd have to go to an (45:27) extraordinary comp to make it pay off. Now having said that, the customer data is valuable, and so, I don't know, Mark, if you wanted to make a comment about that. We definitely treasure that information.","Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative and Development Officer","Yeah, with regard to our traditional loyalty program, in the past the thinking there is that if you can take an infrequent or lapsed customer and make them come to your restaurant just one more time, you would pay for the program. Our research has indicated that there are virtually no loyalty programs that actually achieve that. What they do is they reward your most loyal customers, and so we figured out other ways to do that. You know, we have ongoing ways to give our most valuable customers ways to interact with Chipotle where they learn a little bit more and we give them some free food in exchange.","But on the data side, you're absolutely right. That's what we want and we believe that we can achieve perhaps not the same level of granularity in the information, but enough information through a payment system that will give us what we want essentially without the downsides that's sort of the ongoing way of the loyalty program. So it's not quite as much data that you get in a loyalty program, but it's enough the way we envision it that it will do the trick.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks.","Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative and Development Officer","Sure.","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Karen.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll now go to John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just first a detailed question. Jack, can you just be explicit about the traffic and the mix in the second quarter?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so they're very small numbers, John. You know, the comp was 4.3%, menu pricing was 4%. Of the 0.3%, it was a very slight negative traffic, 0.3% negative traffic, and that was offset by 60 basis points or 70 basis points of mix. And the mix improvement was generated a little bit by catering, a little bit by sides, and a little bit by kid's meals. We reformatted the kid's meals and we're now serving a few more of them and the pricing structure happens to be a little bit higher, especially the ones that our customers are choosing. They're choosing to build your own more frequently and that's a little bit more expensive, so those are the pieces, but they're all very, very small numbers.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. The bigger question is on the newer concepts; if I recall correctly the history of Chipotle, you got a real first mover advantage in many markets by entering before your key competitors, and when you did so, you did better and when you were second you did less well. Maybe eventually did better, but maybe initially not as well. When you look at the newer concepts in particularly pizza, you're now badly lagging behind several chains that are in that category. Why isn't that incentive to be more urgency to develop faster? Is there other concerns you have about the concept and you're not ready to do that? Do you think it's going to be different for pizza than it was perhaps for your core concept, or is this first mover advantage maybe an overblown advantage?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Well, it's interesting. You know, we used to pay a lot of attention to the first mover advantage theory. When we were partnered with McDonald's, they were telling us how important it was in their development. Although, if you look at our history and our sales trends when we come into markets and we're not the first mover, we definitely pass them, I mean, California is the best example where we had two big competitors, and we severely lagged behind them. Over time though, through great execution and through a great people culture and sharing with our customers what makes Chipotle food special, we quickly took the lead.","I think the best, the most important thing we can do is to have concepts that really resonate with customers. And we have spent a lot of time refining the Pizzeria Locale concept. We've gone through a couple of iterations of dough, and we think we have perfected it now. It's really excellent, and that's been in the restaurants now for a couple of months. And we feel confident that as we start with this dough in two new markets, in Kansas City and in Cincinnati, Kansas City just in a couple of days on Wednesday, actually tomorrow, and then Cincinnati in the fall, that we're going to prove to customers that our pizza, our dough, our method of this new way to serve pizza is superior to the competition out there.","How long it takes to lap their sales volumes? I don't know. But if history is any indication, sticking to the things that really matter, like putting teams of top performers who are really empowered to achieve extraordinary things and giving them leadership opportunities sets the foundation, so they can deliver an excellent dining experience. And that's exactly what we're doing.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I have two questions. First is on just the cash. It looks like you have almost $600 million on the balance sheet today, and you're on track to do over $500 million in free cash flow. And I definitely appreciate the share repurchases that you've done and announced, but with that much cash, why not be more aggressive with repurchases rather than be opportunistic? And why not do that rather than have it sit on the balance sheet?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Well, Brian, I think the answer is that we do want to buy our stock back, but we don't want to just buy it back at any price at any time. We're much happier and we think it's a better boost to shareholder value to be patient. Our stock has always been volatile. It's always had run-ups. It's always had corrections. And we think the best thing to do is buy in the corrections. And I think the example that we just shared, where over the last three months when the stock had corrected for a period of time, we bought $100 million worth. So it's many multiple times what we bought in the first quarter. Now, had we just decided to buy $100 million in the first quarter, it would have just not gone as far. And so we think it's a better way to do it.","We will get more aggressive as the price does drop. We do have more cash than we need. We know that the best way to add to shareholder value is to ready these growth seeds to be promoted to growth strategies, just like Canada was. We know that as we open up more Chipotles, we're opening the Chipotles at extraordinary returns and on cash returns in the 70% to 80% range. We know that's the best way to capture shareholder value. With the cash that we have, we'll buy back, but I think we'll continue to buy opportunistically. And we think that's a better way to build shareholder value over time.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And my second question is on the comps, again. You've clearly seen an acceleration in traffic. Obviously on a one-year but even on a two-year basis, it appears as though you've seen an acceleration in traffic. When you look at things internally, which you can do and we can't, what do you think has really driven that improvement in the trends?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Well, if you're looking at \u2013 the trends that I would encourage you to look at are a three-year trend. And I talked about this on the last call, so I won't go into it again. But this current trend that we're in is kind of the third year of a three-year trend that started in 2013. If you look at the three-year trends, the three-year stack for the second quarter is more than 200 basis points better than the three-year stack for the first quarter. I think that that's more weather driven.","So I would say right now we're not necessarily seeing an acceleration other than in respect to the worse weather in the first quarter. We still think we're being hampered by not having carnitas and we think that could be as much as a couple hundred basis points. And so we look at it as more the year is unfolding the way we thought it was. We thought that we would do 4% in the quarter. Our guidance was exactly that. We were predicting internally about 4% during the second quarter, and that's what it's doing. We'd also predicted that in the third quarter, while it's early, that we would be in the low single-digits, that it wouldn't be negative, that it would be close. And so things are, I would say, more playing out as we expect.","Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","We'll now go to Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Actually, just following up on that question with regard to the three-year trends, which I know you gave us a lot of color last quarter, I know the idea being the goal to reaccelerate those trends, presumably going into 2016 perhaps and maybe start a new cycle. I'm just wondering if you're any closer to considering or how you would prioritize the opportunity, whether it's \u2013 I know there's talk about a new protein like chorizo or a new daypart like breakfast or a greater push on catering. I'm just wondering how you prioritize those different opportunities to maybe just set the next path for a re-acceleration in the comp?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","So, Jeff, most of our focus and the vast majority of our attention is to have the best teams we can, developing the best leaders in the restaurants, hiring and developing top performers in every restaurant, because we know that there's a dramatic difference between experience, the quality of food, taste of the food, just the throughput, the business controls, everything when we have great leaders, restauranteur leaders that have all top performers, where there's a culture of empowerment, and these teams can deliver high standards in every single way. And so that's still and always will be the vast majority of where our attention goes.","We are testing chorizo in a market right now in Kansas City. It's early, we've only had it in market for several weeks right now. We just this week, Mark, I think started advertising. If that's something that looks like it's either attracting new customers, or it's encouraging existing customers to visit more often, that might move up in the priority list. If all chorizo does is take our existing customers and split them among additional menu items, that will be less appealing to us because that just means we have more menu items serving the same customers and that makes it more complicated and more difficult to serve all this delicious food.","So I come back to, in terms of priority, the difference between a great running restauranteur restaurant with an amazing team, compared to one that has a lot of themes that \u2013 Monty talked about the DPT \u2013 a restaurant that has a lot of themes, and they have some low performers on the team and empowerment is not great, the difference in the quality and taste of the food, the difference in how clean that restaurant is, just the difference in when you walk in, you feel like you're welcomed by a team of people that know you and are glad you're there, the difference when you compare that experience to a restaurant that doesn't have all top performers, and doesn't have the culture of empowerment is dramatic. And we believe that that's the single biggest thing we can do to build our sales over time.","The other thing with marketing is we still believe that \u2013 or we still know that there's lots of people that have never been to Chipotle, something like 35% or 40% of people have never been to Chipotle. We know that when we study our existing customers, that there is like 55% of our customers only come a couple times a year. And so the more we can educate and entertain and things like this, this BOGO where if we can entice customers that don't come very often, once or twice a year, to learn more about our ingredients versus competitors, traditional fast food, and get a BOGO to entice them to come in, and that caused them to say, oh my God, I mean I haven't been in six months, this food is delicious, and I didn't know all this information about the ingredients.","If we can convert that person into coming three times a year or four times a year, we think that's a big opportunity as well. So the vast majority of our attention goes on doing what we do, but do it better than ever.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company.","Andrew M. Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Just curious what you're attributing the traffic bounce back to? I mean obviously during the quarter it was slightly negative, but you just picked up so far in July. What do you think is driving that?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Other than comparisons, it's really hard to tell. Because it feels like we're still at a disadvantage by not having pork. So it still feels like we're being held back a bit. But I can't point to any specific reasons why we were slightly negative in the second quarter compared to so far in July. We're happy with the results, but there's nothing specific I can point to.","Andrew M. Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And, Monty, just I know traffic obviously was a little bit of an issue, but did you see any improvement or any work or anything to call out on the throughput initiatives this quarter in terms of how many incremental customers you got through the line?","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","In terms of incremental what?","Andrew M. Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","In terms of incremental customers you got through the line.","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","The improvements we saw in this quarter were spotty throughout the country as certain teams responded really, really well to our throughput contest. But company-wide and overall, like I said in my opening comments, basically I think we were glad to hang on to the significant gains we made during 2014 when we had very significant increases in throughput. But we didn't see an increase in overall throughput company-wide during the quarter, which it's always disappointing not to see that. But I think like Jack said, with even slightly negative comps what happens I think with our teams is, it's more difficult for them to break throughput records and it becomes a little less top of mind for them as they start to focus on other aspects of the business waiting for that traffic to increase.","So it certainly is a lot more fun to go out and set throughput records when they're shattering them on a daily basis, and when there is a slight falloff in traffic even if it's just a flattening of traffic even for a short time, I think that sometimes our eye is not on the ball to the degree it could be. So we do see improvements in a lot of our four pillars execution which is great. We see some really good 15-minute transaction numbers and records in areas. But overall, I think that I would be eager to see our teams push harder on the throughput such as to deliver even incremental increases in the third quarter. So we'll keep working on that.","Andrew M. Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Mark Crumpacker, Chief Creative and Development Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. Chipotle has always been a company that is focused on a long-term vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food. As we move forward, we believe it is critical that we continue to focus on the things that have driven our success for so many years, our unique food culture and our unique people culture. It's been our focus on these key drivers of our business that has differentiated Chipotle in a crowded and competitive field and it has allowed us to develop a strong loyalty among our customers.","These key attributes are what has served us \u2013 what has allowed us to serve delicious food and to provide outstanding customer service. Never has it been more important for us to delight our customers on each and every visit and we have great confidence in our managers and crews to remain focused and to provide the extraordinary customer experience our customers expect from us. We're also encouraged by the long-term opportunity that still exists for Chipotle both in terms of adding new restaurants and attracting customers who have never tried our restaurants.","In each of these ways, there is still so much untapped growth potential for Chipotle, and as we continue our efforts to restore lost sales tied to last year's food safety issues, there is significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our business by attracting new customers and opening new restaurants. We begin to see sales recover in the second half of the first quarter as our transaction trends reversed course from the lows we saw in January. Since the beginning of February, we have seen an 18-point improvement in comp transactions compared to the full month of January. We have worked to invite our customers back by reminding them of the things they loved about Chipotle, such as our delicious food, our high-quality ingredients and being treated to a friendly, fast experience inside of our restaurants.","While we have used promotional programs to entice many of our customers to return, we are encouraged to see signs that the promotional traffic has translated into repeat paying customers. Return of customers to our restaurants improved our same-store sales comps by 11% from January to recent levels. Of course, we would like to see our sales recover more quickly but we remain confident in our long-term strategy to welcome customers back into our restaurants.","Right after the food safety issues we encountered last year, we took several bold steps to ensure our food was as safe as it could possibly be. That included a systematic evaluation of each ingredient and the implementation of interventions to make them safer. Some changes were made at the suppliers and others were made in the restaurants. Since all of the initial changes were implemented, we have continued to evaluate and refine each procedure. Some of the procedures like blanching many of our produce items in the restaurant have proven to be very effective and our crews are doing a great job at executing these new procedures.","In fact, we were able to add bell peppers to the blanching program which meant that we are once again able to slice the bell peppers in our restaurant rather than at a central kitchen. We have also refined the way we are washing lettuce which will once again allow us to cut lettuce in our restaurants while still ensuring that it is safe. We're also continuing to refine many of the other procedures in ways that maximize safety while simultaneously making our food taste better.","During the quarter, we hired Dr. Jim Marsden as our Executive Director of Food Safety. Jim has been a tremendous asset as we continue to evaluate all of our safety protocols. Jim was previously a member of the faculty at Kansas State University in their Animal Science and Industry Department. He is working with a number of experts that have advised us in the past and has also worked closely with the U.S. CDC and FDA and other food safety authorities as we continue to implement our industry-leading protocols. Jim's expertise and viewpoint has had a significant impact in a short period of time and we continue to look forward to his leadership in furthering our food safety program.","We recognize that it will take us some time to rebuild trust with our customers and to fully recover from the issues we faced late last year. And while we are encouraged that the recovery is underway, we know that there's still a lot more work to be done. We will continue to make it our top priority to entice customers to return to Chipotle through effective promotions and marketing, and when they do return, we're committed to providing the very best experience that we can to help ensure that they will keep coming back. We know that the very best marketing we can do is to provide an exceptional restaurant experience and our managers and crews are working hard to make sure they are doing just that.","I'll now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer","Thank you, Steve. On November 1, we began conducting additional daily consumer research to help us measure and track consumer perceptions of our brand in the wake of the issues we saw last year. Key measures including admiration, consideration, first-time visits and food quality are all continuing to improve. In some cases, consumer perception in these key areas has returned to levels close to what it was prior to Q4 of last year. For others, we still need to see additional improvements but the trends continue to be promising.","In early February, we launched an aggressive marketing campaign designed to drive customers back into our restaurants. This campaign consisted of mobile and direct mail promotions, a nationwide advertising campaign and a variety of social, mobile and local marketing activities. The campaign began with the Raincheck mobile promotion distributed on the day of our companywide meeting on February 8. As you may recall, this was the day we closed all of our restaurants for a national all-company meeting and when we provided the opportunity for customers to get a free meal through our mobile offer. In all, we issued well over 5 million free burrito offers and saw an extraordinary redemption rate of 67%. We followed the mobile offer with a direct mail promotion to about 20 million households and we currently have a 17.5% average redemption rate which we expect to approach 20% as the redemption window closes.","For those customers that had previously responded to direct mail, we are seeing a redemption rate of an impressive 44% and growing. We are currently in the midst of our nationwide advertising campaign that runs through the end of June. This advertising campaign is the largest media spend in our history and is targeting all of our U.S. and Canadian locations. The creative features delicious food and reinforces our commitment to responsibly raised ingredients cooked using classic cooking techniques and without the use of artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners. Our research shows that this campaign is performing particularly well with new customers.","In the coming months, we also plan to return to using nontraditional marketing that differentiates the Chipotle brand. This will include a short film and promotional game as well as other content-driven marketing programs. These upcoming marketing efforts will combine differentiating messages about Chipotle with traffic driving components.","Throughout the year, we will continue to be more aggressive than usual with our marketing and we are considering two programs aimed at driving traffic among our loyal customers and lapsed customers or our customers \u2013 our lapsed customers or that is customers who have not been to Chipotle in three months or more. For example, we are exploring a limited time frequency incentive designed to reward our most loyal customers for eating frequently at Chipotle this summer. Additionally, we are considering adding menu items that will appeal to our loyal or lapsed customers.","Over the years, we have tested additions to the menu that have proven to be very popular with our most frequent customers. While we didn't make these menu items permanent additions to the menu, at the time we do see an opportunity to introduce these or other items as a way of inviting our loyal customers back into our restaurants.","I'd also like to discuss the progress we're making in strengthening our digital ordering capabilities. We have completed the integration between Postmates, our largest delivery partner and our back-of-house ordering system. This allows Postmates to send orders directly to our back-of-house make line instead of standing in line to order. We've completed this initial integration with Postmates and we are currently using this new system at restaurants in San Francisco and Atlanta and will be rolling it out in all of our markets in the coming months. We're also in the process of creating the same capability with our other delivery partners.","Next, we are testing a system that allows for smarter pickup times for customers who place online and mobile orders. This system is designed to reduce the time between order placements and pickup. The system dynamically monitors the flow of orders into our restaurants and gives our customers the shortest possible order completion time while simultaneously ensuring that the restaurants will complete the orders on time. This system is currently being tested in one of our markets prior to being rolled out nationwide.","Finally, we issued updated versions of our iOS and Android ordering apps that make it easier for customers to pay using their credit or debit card that speed up the payment process and that streamline reordering for our frequent customers.","While it is early in our sales recovery process, we are encouraged by improving trends in customer sentiment and by customer response to our marketing and promotional efforts. We expect that we will see continued progress in these areas going forward as customers regain confidence in us and remember what it is that they always loved about Chipotle.","I'll now turn the call over to Monty.","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Thank you, Mark. At the heart of our efforts to ensure the very best experience we can for each and every customer, our teams have top-performing restaurant employees, managers and field leaders. The strength of our teams has always been an advantage for us because these teams truly believe in our mission and treat our guests to a unique and genuine customer experience.","As we continue to rebuild trust with our customers by serving safe and delicious food and as we continue to invite them back into our restaurants with our marketing and promotional programs, our restaurant teams are ready to provide the type of experience that will keep our customers coming back.","I'm proud of how our teams are responding in this challenging recovery effort. They have quickly and efficiently implemented many changes in our restaurants over the last few months and simultaneously continue to provide a terrific experience. I'm incredibly warmed by the level of commitment and pride our teams have demonstrated during a difficult time, and I am more confident than ever that they are the ones who will ensure that we fulfill our mission.","Additionally, we are seeing the impact of stronger mid-level leadership through our improved rate of restaurateur promotion this year compared with last year. Through the first quarter of 2016, we promoted 61 restaurateurs, an increase of 45% over the same time last year, despite having even higher standards for the attainment of this elite position. We continue to refine the restaurateur program, and while our restaurateur candidates have always been required to show demonstrable success in building restaurateur cultures, delivering excellent hospitality and ensuring a strong business model, we now have even more strict standards in all of those categories.","Today, before a restaurateur can be selected, they must have excellent scores on our internal and external third-party audits related to food safety, and we continue to require more accountability for maintaining a disciplined business culture including assessments of sales projections, throughput, scheduling and labor management, food orders and other management and key expenses. This business culture review is in addition to developing an amazing people culture, perhaps the most challenging aspect of being a restaurateur. So with better tools and established field leaders, our pipeline of general managers continues to grow.","To continue to emphasize the development of our restaurateur culture during difficult times is critical. They are the ones who can most skillfully create excellent, safe and delicious restaurant experiences while developing the future leaders we needed to grow our business effectively. As we entice customers to return to our restaurants with more aggressive marketing and promotions, it is doubly important that we remind them what makes a meal at Chipotle so special by greeting them enthusiastically, having friendly and efficient service, great throughput and by making them a delicious meal. And the teams that are most able to do all these things well are our restaurateur teams who provide these great operations while ensuring a strong business model as well.","And as more restaurateurs are stepping up, our best field leaders have been able to spend more time in our newer restaurants, or restaurants that have the opportunity to perform much, much better. With more field leaders in our system than in recent years, our restaurants are getting more one-on-one attention and leadership than before, and that will help to build more of these elite restaurateur cultures. In addition to the accelerated pace of these promotions during the quarter, we also promoted 63 existing restaurateurs into multi-unit positions, and strengthened our ranks by promoting 24 additional field leaders.","This continued investment in our restaurateur and field leadership program is paying off in a better customer experience. One example is the impact we've had on our throughput initiative. Our field leaders are working hard to set each restaurant up for success, and that starts by effectively implanting the four pillars of throughput. When we have the four pillars in place, our restaurants are poised to engage with our customers and show our gratitude by serving them quickly on each and every visit. Our restaurants are prepared, organized and ready for the day with proper mise en place. All hands are on deck with aces in their places, and with a dedicated linebacker that is in constant communication with the back of the house. And we can pull customers through the line faster with a dedicated expediter at the cashier. Incorporating the four pillars affects nearly every aspect of the guest experience.","Of course, building great teams and great cultures in our restaurant starts with the people we hire and with our ability to retain and develop our top performers. That's always the case, but more so in a tightening labor market. We know that if our employees feel cared for and are given proper training such that they feel confident in their ability and encouraged by their circumstances, we have a much better chance of having them stay with us and develop careers at Chipotle. We are emphasizing this more with our restaurant managers and teams starting with the need to hire only crew-members who have the 13 characteristics. The qualities we believe make it more likely that a newly hired employee will become a top performer at Chipotle.","We are also reiterating to our restaurants the need to involve crew in the interview process and hiring decisions for new crew. This helps us ensure that the people we are hiring in our restaurants are a good fit, and it demonstrates the importance of each and every employee we add to our teams. Developing future teams and promoting from within is extremely important to us particularly as we continue to bring Chipotle to more locations across the United States. During the quarter, we opened 58 new restaurants and for 2016 we plan to open 220 to 235 new restaurants. Looking beyond this year, there is still significant opportunity for us to continue to open new restaurants at a healthy pace.","We will continue to balance the opportunity for further growth with a disciplined approach to development to ensure that we are opening up new restaurants in great locations with strong economics and staffed with top-performing teams.","As many of you have experienced firsthand, our restaurants are feeling busy again. Relative to December and January, they have more energy, more customers and enthusiastic teams ready to greet them. Our food tastes great and we are continuing to emphasize customer service and hospitality as we make headway in increasing our sales. That said, it's more critical now than ever that every restaurant delivers on the high standards that we have set for Chipotle.","We have the utmost confidence in our crews, managers and restaurateurs, as well as our field leadership to continue to improve upon these qualities that make Chipotle great.","I'll now turn the call over to Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Monty. We invested aggressively during the first quarter to encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. Our customers redeemed over 6 million free burritos or bowls during February and March. And we also gave away nearly 1 million free orders of chips and salsa or chips and guac. The goal is to invite our customers back into Chipotle with a compelling offer, treat them to a delicious meal and an energetic environment with the hope that they will begin to return to their normal frequency of visiting Chipotle.","The response to the offers was strong especially right after our all-company meeting on February 8 with redemptions reaching a high of nearly $500,000 in a single day just a few days after the offer began. Comp transactions improved from down 34% for the full month of January to a high point of down only 9% during the third week of February. Of course, it's not surprising that free offers spur immediate action by our customers, but more importantly, as the number of redemptions leveled off, we saw our paying customers steadily increase. And by the first week of March when redemptions were down to under $100,000 per day, our comp transactions were down only 14% and comp sales were down 22%. We felt the recovery was off to a respectable start just three weeks or four weeks into our marketing campaign.","As Steve mentioned, we implemented a number of new procedures and protocols to establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. Some of these protocols are put to the test in Boston last month and we had four employees who were at home sick and fully followed our protocols by not coming to work. We temporarily closed the restaurant and local health officials commended us for the successful design and execution of our protocols which resulted in our restaurant remaining safe for our customers.","Unfortunately, some stores refer to this as another outbreak and those headlines interrupted our sales recovery. This was a disappointing setback which caused our nationwide comp sales to worsen to around negative 27% for a few weeks before recovering to the low to mid negative 20%s in late March.","For all of March, comps TCs were down 15.6% and comp sales were down 26.4% with Easter negatively impacting both by about 2.5% as we lost one trading day in the month. The impact of the headlines concerning Boston taught us that the recovery can be fragile and that we need to rebuild trust with our customers \u2013 every single customer, every single day in every single restaurant.","Average daily sales increased sequentially in April versus late March by about 3% to 4% with the comp sales run rate excluding the benefit of Easter was right around negative 26% in April so far because seasonality typically has resulted in about the 6% to 7% increase in April sales over March. Including the benefit of Easter, comp sales were around negative 22% for the first three weeks in April and comp transactions are around negative 16%. Easter added about 4% to both the sales and transaction comps so far. Now, some of this lag in April sales are due to cold, wet weather in some areas of the country early in the month and we did see the comp for a few days improve to the low negative 20%s during the past week, so we're hoping we will still get that seasonality step up we normally see this time of year but just a few weeks later.","The sales recovery has been uneven throughout the country. For the first three weeks of April, our traffic comps excluding the Easter benefit were negative 15% in the middle of the country, the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic, whereas they were down 20% companywide again excluding the benefit of Easter. That's about a 16-point recovery as compared to January which means we recovered about half the lost visits in these areas. But on the West Coast and the Northeast, the two areas closest to the outbreaks of late 2015, our traffic comps have recently been trending at negative 24%, again excluding the Easter benefit compared to negative 37% in January. So we've only recovered about a third of customer visits in these areas.","For the first quarter, our sales were $834.5 million and our restaurant level operating margins were 6.8% for the quarter. As expected, the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease in margin was sales deleverage which accounted for more than half of our drop in margins compared to 2015. There's also an impact of nearly 600 basis points of what we would consider to be nonrecurring expenses including an elevated promotional and marketing investment that totaled 660 basis points, which is over 500 basis points higher than last year. Food cost is higher than Q4 2015 by 150 basis points and we expect that food costs will remain at about this level for the rest of the year.","While it's difficult to provide meaningful projections for either sales comps or margins in the coming quarters especially given the sales volatility I just described, I can tell you that the approximate margin level to expect at various sales levels. For example, with comps at the current level our average unit restaurant volumes are about $1.9 million on an annual basis, and our restaurant level margins should improve to the low double digits in the next few quarters as the nonrecurring costs begin to level off. If comps are around negative 20%, AUVs would be about $2 million and margins would be around the mid to high-teens. If comps recovered around negative 10%, AUVs would be about $2.2 million and our margins should be in the low 20%s. And if we fully recover our sales with AUVs in the $2.4 million to $2.5 million range, we would expect margins in the mid-20% range which accounts for the recurring cost of new procedures and protocols that relate to food safety.","Labor costs for the quarter were 30.9% of sales or an increase of 850 basis points compared to last year. More than 600 basis points of the change was driven by sales deleverage (23:27), while we also had nearly 100 basis points tied to nonrecurring expenses as we incurred additional labor in early February and March to support our promotional strategy and also our national team meeting on February 8 when about 50,000 employees attended. We also continue to incur higher labor costs related to our merit increases taken in mid-2015 for restaurant crew and managers which averaged about 7% along with increased benefits including increased vacation days, paid sick leave and tuition reimbursement, all of which added about 160 basis points to labor.","Our promotional and marketing expenses during the quarter totaled $55 million or about 6.6% of sales and this included $4 million or about 50 basis points related to promo offers that were issued in the first quarter, but they're expected to be redeemed in the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in recovering our customers and promos will be an important part of the strategy, but we expect combined marketing and promo to level off to about 3% to 4% as a percentage of sales over the next few quarters. While this is lower than Q1, it's nearly double what we spent as a percent of sales in Q2 and Q3 of last year. We'll invest in more traditional brand advertising and return to talking about our delicious food made from high quality ingredients.","G&A for the first quarter was $62 million or 7.4% of sales, down $1 million from last year. Total stock-based comp included in G&A was $7.5 million which is down about $7.6 million from last year. Offsetting that reduction were higher legal costs and the cost of the all-company meeting which combined added $4 million to G&A. For the full year 2016, we anticipate total stock-based compensation in G&A to be about $60 million and for the full year 2016, G&A will total just over $300 million or about $50 million higher than last year as we add support for our new restaurant openings and as we will hold our biennial all-manager conference in September.","Our effective tax rate benefit for the quarter was 40.6% and was impacted by nonrecurring adjustments related to state income taxes for prior years. Our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be 38.4%.","During the first quarter, we reported a loss of $26.4 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.88. Our cash and investments totaled $706 million as of March 31 and we continue to be very aggressive with our balance sheet to repurchase stock. We repurchased a total of $645 million from January 1 through yesterday at an average price of $463 per share. Since November 1, 2015, we've repurchased a total of $956 million of our stock, representing a reduction of nearly 2 million shares outstanding and we have $71.4 million left in our current authorization to purchase stock.","As we work through this sales recovery, we will remain disciplined in restoring our unit economics to deliver attractive margins and returns and restore our ability to create significant shareholder value over the long-term.","Thanks for your time today. And we'd be happy to open the line for any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. If I could, just two. One is, first, can you just talk about currently what portion of your sales are on coupons? I think you've talked about that in the past with the rate of \u2013 how reliant are you currently on coupon redemptions? What portion of sales, and how have those trended over like the last four weeks as you've sort of moved away from some of the initial drops?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, John, it's dropped off a lot. If you look at the difference between during April between our sales and our transactions which is about a 4% to 5% difference; that would account for the people that are coming in and have a coupon and are not \u2013 basically it's reducing our average check. So I would call it in that 4% to 5% range.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","4% to 5% of transactions or of your total comp are coming from that?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Well, there's a gap between the comp sales and the comp transactions and that gap is all driven by a lower average check and most of that gap is driven by the promotions. So part of it is driven by a lower check size but the largest part of it is driven by the promotions. So I'd say the promotions are in that kind of the 4% range in terms of sales. Those are sales, John. Had they been coming in and full paying customers, there would be virtually no gap between our transactions and sales.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got you. And I know you gave some scenarios around where store margins would be at various comp levels. Can you talk more specifically about the second quarter specifically? And knowing now a little bit more specifically about the promotional activity you're doing and the expense related to it, do you have a sense of where second quarter earnings comes out based on all of that? I understand there's some comp sensitivity, but is there anything specifically to call out in terms of the cost structure in the second quarter versus the first quarter?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","John, I hesitate. The first quarter we gave a figure, we said we were going to lose $1, and that's because we knew we had a lot of one-time things. We were implementing our food safety protocol. We're not prepared \u2013 I'm not prepared to guess what the EPS is going to be in the second quarter. It all depends on sales. So if sales recover, the EPS will turn positive very quickly, and we'll have a reasonably healthy EPS. But if they stay at this level, it's going to be hard to deliver the higher margins. It's going to be hard to deliver the EPS. So we're not going to give an EPS projection at this time.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I guess a couple of questions for Mark. I think you mentioned in your prepared commentary that some perception areas with consumers are lagging. And I wonder if you could talk about what the laggers are and how you're going to address those?","And then secondarily, when you talk about your most loyal and most frequent customers, can you define how you characterize those? Are those folks who come in once a week? Just any kind of parameters around that. And then it sounds like they have been lagging maybe more than the less frequent customers. If you could give some color around that, that would be helpful.","Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer","Sure. With regard to the brand attributes, they're all actually looking pretty good, but I'll give you a few examples. Aided consideration, so obviously when we give people a list of restaurants including our brand, and ask them how likely they are to visit, before the food safety issues that hovered around 50%, right now that's recovered to 43%. So we're down 7% on that one, but it's picking up at a consistent rate. Admiration before these incidents was 70%, now it's at 61%. So again, recovering from down into the 50% area. So a lot of the stuff has come back up nicely.","The way we measure new customers, of course, are the people who visited for the first time within the last three months. That's actually recovered almost \u2013 it's just two points below what it was before this, so that's really good news. On the customers who are lapsed, we look at people who haven't been in three months or more. And that was \u2013 you want a lower number there, that was 49% before and now that's at 57%. So that one's probably got the biggest delta there. But for example, on another attribute which is we serve healthy, fresh, unprocessed food, that's recovered to exactly the same levels as it was before. So it's a mixed bag. I don't know that any of them are problematic such that I don't think we're going to be able to recover them, because we're seeing just nice trends all across the board on those.","In terms of your question about frequency, we break our customers into five groups by frequency. We call our most frequent customers top loyal, they come 25 times or more a year. The next group are heavy customers, they come 13 times to 24 times, then medium which is 6 times to 12 times, light is 2 times to 5 times and a new or lapsed customer is one-time. And you're correct in that we saw larger declines in both new in the two \u2013 the top and bottom categories. So these are single-digit drops, but in new and lapsed, and in top loyal. And so a lot of what we're looking at from a marketing perspective is bringing in those top loyal \u2013 that single-digit drop in top loyal customers that we saw. And I'm not suggesting that these customers left altogether, but their frequency may have declined.","So some of what I mentioned in my prepared remarks are aimed at either giving them a reason to come back in and that might be a new menu item. Or some sort of a frequency incentive which I also mentioned which would be coming in a certain number of times over a period of time, and we will give you something. So those are both efforts designed to target that group of customers.","Operator","This time, we'll move to Joshua Long with Piper Jaffray.","Joshua C. Long - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. So I wanted to see if you could provide some commentary on how you're thinking about balancing the aggressive advertising and traffic driving initiatives here over the near-term with maybe balancing the longer-term value or consumer perception over the longer term.","Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer","Well, we are transitioning first from free to buy one, get ones and other types of promotions which typically have a purchase associated with them as a transitional step away from being entirely dependent on free food. So that's part of it. But as I mentioned also in my prepared comments, we're getting back into the type of advertising or marketing that's been so successful for us in the past, which is some of this brand marketing which is based on short films and other types of content which really deliver messages about the brand and continue to differentiate Chipotle from the competition.","One of the good \u2013 one of the really good pieces of news in our research is that the differentiation of Chipotle from our competitors really has not suffered, or to the extent that it did, it recovered fully. And so we're going to continue to push the messages about our 65 ingredients and how simple they are and our simple, classic cooking techniques and how different that is from the competition whose food is \u2013 tends to be heavily processed and include hundreds and hundreds of ingredients, many of which are processed. So we're definitely getting back on that, and July is when we'll really be in full swing with that type of marketing again. So we're transitioning back. But as I say that, there's going to be always a promotional element with those until we really fully recover our sales.","Joshua C. Long - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Understood. And then as we think about your discussion about bringing new menu items in, should we be thinking about those as LTOs here over the near term, or perhaps permanent menu additions? And how do you think about balancing the maybe added complexity of new menu items which you haven't done or haven't been as big a part of the story historically with your focus on really driving operational efficiency here over the near term?","Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer","Okay. Well, I'll speak to the \u2013 whether or not or how this might unfold, then I'll let Steve talk to the nature of the operational impact to us. But right now, I wouldn't say whether or not \u2013 I don't think we know whether or not these things would be permanent, but there's no reason why they wouldn't be. The item that we're considering introducing first is chorizo, which is something we've done before. We did it in Kansas City last year, and we were prepared to expand that to a second market right as we came into this food-borne illness situation and we tabled it so that we could put all of our focus on correcting the problem.","But we did find that that was very, very popular with our loyal customers. In fact, for a lot of people who tried it, it quickly became their most favorite protein. And so it'll be very helpful for us from a marketing perspective to bring those customers back in and make our loyal customers come more often. So I think it's a \u2013 it's yet to be seen whether that means it will become permanent, but we'll try it out and see how it goes. Steve can talk to the nature of that and how that works within the Chipotle environment.","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Mark. Josh, thanks for the question. So this chorizo that Mark speaks of is really delicious. It's a chicken and pork spicy sausage. We cook this on our plancha. It has lots of little crispy bits, so it has nice spice and really good texture, and as Mark said, very, very popular with the customers that had it in a couple of our test markets.","When we think about adding something to Chipotle, we're very, very mindful of our overall efficiencies, efficiencies in the kitchen, efficiencies in cook time, efficiencies in throughput and ease of ordering for the customer. Chorizo fits into this system really, really well in that we have space for it on the main line and it doesn't detract from throughput. It's also very easy to rotate on to the plancha to grill between chicken and steak. The cook time and the method of grilling isn't much different from the chicken and steak already on the plancha. So operationally, I would say it's quite easy to execute. But I think it's very exciting in that it does add a new flavor and texture to the meat offerings. And it pairs well with our existing offerings, our salsas and guacamole and cheese and what have you. So again, very popular and I'm excited to see how this works.","Joshua C. Long - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","We'll move to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, with some of the food safety changes that you've made, the sous vide of the steak, blanching a variety of vegetables and precutting lettuce, have all of those changes been met with positive customer response? In other words, do the customers like the food as much or better than they did before with the operational changes that you found yourself to make?","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Yeah. I think, generally, the changes have gone very, very well. I won't say all of them have been met with immediate approval. And an example of that is we went over to a lettuce that was pre-shredded at a central kitchen in order to be able to be absolutely certain of the \u2013 that all the interventions were in place to make sure that that was food safe. And that lettuce, I think, people found to be a degradation in quality of the stuff that was cut in the restaurants by our teams who \u2013 when our restaurant teams do it, they're able to cut it to the exact size they want, they're able to really make sure that the presentation is exactly what they want and that they can assure the quality of the lettuce. This was a product which is really just completely prepared in a central kitchen.","So what we've been able to do and what we'll be rolling out soon, we've been able to find a way to have this made completely safe by interventions in a central kitchen but yet still have the entire head of lettuce brought to the restaurant and yet and give our crews in the restaurant the latitude to be able to cut that properly and assure the quality of that again. So we've just been tasting that the last few days in a few of our restaurants here in Denver, and it's delicious. It's wonderful, and so we're going to be moving back to a lettuce that I think everyone else is very satisfied with.","The rest of the changes have been met very positively. The sous viding of the steak is delicious. We've actually had a reduction in the number of customer complaints. With steak, there's always been over time some complaints because steak contains naturally some chewy bits and whatnot because we use real steak. And with the sous vide, the technique has allowed us to break down some of those aspects of the steak through kind of a long breathing process in the sous vide process which makes the steak juicier and more tender and more delicious. So actually we're very, very pleased with how that's going and our customers seemed to be very pleased as well.","The blanching of the ingredients has had \u2013 essentially it's had no effect whatsoever on the eating quality of the ingredients, but it's a wonderful step to ensure, again, food safety and the elimination of potential harmful pathogens or what have you. So our crews in the restaurants have done an awesome job implementing that new procedure and have found it quite easy and they're very proud of it because it makes them \u2013 it gives them even higher level of confidence in the food we're serving. And again, no degradation whatsoever in what our customers are receiving.","So we are feeling really, really good about the quality of our food in the restaurants. I think it is actually better than ever, I think, subject to that one change in lettuce. We thought that the bell peppers we were bringing in pre-sliced from a central kitchen were good, but maybe not quite as good as the ones cut in our restaurants. So what we've been able to do is go back to blanching the bell peppers such that they can be cut by a knife by the skilled hands of our folks in the restaurant and again, have brought that back to the level of quality it was before but again with the blanching to assure food safety of that ingredient.","So we're very proud of everything we've done. We think that the intent focus on our food that's been caused by looking at every single ingredient, it's caused our teams in the restaurants to also look at every single ingredient very, very critically and make certain that everything is as good as it can be. So I think our food is more delicious than ever. With that one sort of asterisk that the lettuce was I think not as good for a time but we're returning that to where it was and I think that we're very, very proud of where our food stands now.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And, Monty, you made a comment in your prepared remarks and it was interesting how you said it, talking about the unit development in 2016, and basically saying, beyond this year, continued to grow at a healthy pace. And I think you used the word disciplined pace around location, returns and staffing. I'm sorry I don't have the transcript in front of me. But it seems like you may be kind of preparing us for a slowdown or a leveling off of development from 2016 into the outer years. So I just wanted to see perhaps what you meant by those comments.","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Yeah, yeah. Thanks for asking. I think that the short answer is no. We're not preparing for a slowdown of our development and I think you'll find that we will be able to achieve very easily the guidance that we've given in terms of number of restaurant openings. But we do have a very strong pipeline coming in from our real estate teams who have been doing an excellent job finding a lot of terrific sites. But the reason for my comments was that as we've had a slowdown of sales overall that you're all aware of, and the numbers that Jack spoke about with a slowdown of nationwide sales as a result of what happened in late 2015. So too has that slowdown affected our new store openings. But it's not \u2013 it's affected them disproportionately. What I mean is that most of our new restaurant openings have still held the same percentage that they historically have held versus our trailing 12-month sales of all our existing stores.","But the exception is that in the new markets and developing markets, in those markets there's been, I think, even more softening of their sales than there has been nationally, say. So the delta between a new store opening in a developing or new market has been slightly greater than when compared to the rest of our restaurant average daily sales. So the delta of new and developing markets is a little bit bigger than the delta between proven and established markets. And so that percentage of all of our new store openings though is quite low. It's about 13% of our new store openings are in new markets or developing markets. And because those sales have been correspondingly a little more soft than the rest of openings, we're going to be taking just a much closer look at those, and be more nitpicking as to which ones we do deals on.","So it's going to be a very slight effect in terms of number of openings, and we have such a strong pipeline that we don't think it's going to affect the overall numbers that we've shared with you that we plan to open. But it's going to give us, I think, the ability to be a little bit more discerning on a few of our locations, and just make sure that any ones for which the development cost is perhaps a little bit high, or the rent structure isn't quite advantageous, we might walk away from some of those deals that we might have pursued a year ago today, for example, just to be responsible with our investments.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to a question from Jason West with Credit Suisse.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, thanks. Jack, just wanted to come back to the guidance that you talked about on the promo and marketing expense going forward. You said you want to get that down to 3% to 4% of sales, I think, over the next few quarters. I believe it was over 6% in the first quarter. So, are you guiding us to promo marketing in sort of 2Q, 3Q in the 5%-ish type range, or is it not going to be that much of an impact? If you could help us there, it'd be great.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. No, I'd mentioned it'd be in the 3% to 4% range. Now, keep in mind our sales during the second and third quarters are higher. So you're talking about a 3% to 4% figure on top of higher sales. So it'll be meaningfully reduced, and what you'll see is the reduction is going to be in the promo. We hit promo, as you know, very, very heavy. We gave away about 6 million entr\u00e9es during the first quarter and we did that intentionally. We wanted to hit that really hard, we wanted to signal that the event was over. We signaled that within a week or two after the CDC called their investigation over, and so we did that intentionally. Going forward, as Mark mentioned, we're going to be transitioning to more BOGOs, which have a lesser impact on our promo line.","Offsetting that, we're actually going to spend more on advertising during the second quarter for sure, probably third quarter. But overall, I would expect that to be in the 3% to 4% range. Now, that's still higher than historical, because if you look at second quarter and third quarter of last year, I think, that's right around double or a little more than double what we did as a percentage of sales last year.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And is that number still though TBD, depending on the sales that you're seeing? So if your comps are not progressively improving, is that a number you're going to come back and revisit, or do you guys feel like that's the type of number that's really going to get the sales going?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","No, listen, we're not locked to a number at all. That just happens to be the number based on the next wave of the strategy. We're moving into more brand advertising, moving into more of the BOGOs. That just happens to be the number. We're prepared to do what we need to do to continue to invite customers in, to continue to give them a great experience. And so if we needed to invest more, if we thought that would be a good investment, we would certainly make it. But right now, we're thinking it's going to be in that 3% to 4% range.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And, Mark, can you just explain a little bit on the loyalty piece that you mentioned how that's going to work and is that a temporary program or not?","Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer","Yeah. I don't have enough details to tell you exactly how it's going to work right now, but it is a temporary program. What we've seen and I mentioned earlier is that there's been a slight decline with our most loyal customers in the number of times they actually visit Chipotle per week. And so we would love to get that, have it back up, and so this was a way and we've got a couple of different technological ways of doing it. So I don't really want to go into those because I'm not sure which ones or if either will prove to be completely viable.","But we do believe it's beneficial to us to get people back into the habit of visiting Chipotle at a frequency level that they enjoyed prior to the issue. So it would be something that we would do through the summer and perhaps into the fall but not something that would become permanent. There is, of course, always the possibility that we would create some sort of a permanent program, but that would take more time and planning, and so this is a temporary one for now.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","The final question today is from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Jack, I just wanted to better understand or confirm some of the numbers you discussed today. So I think you said that April same-store sales, at least to date, are down 22%, but that included the benefit of an Easter shift. And had we excluded that benefit from the Easter shift, it would've been down about 26%? Is that correct?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","That's correct.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So I guess then the question becomes so that down 26% sounds like it's essentially in line or even a modest sequential acceleration of same-store sales decline from what you were seeing at the end of March. If that is the case, how do you explain that?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Jeff, it is because we saw early March was down 22%, then we have the news coming out of Boston, our sales spiked up to \u2013 or spiked down to a down 27% for a couple of weeks near the end of the month, and you've got a lot of choppiness with Easter this year at the end of March, and then you compare it to Easter last year in early April. But we are starting to see recovery back into that low to mid-20% range at the end of March. Our sales dollars, we moved from the end of March to April, got better. They improved by in that 3% to 4% range, but we're comparing to seasonal sales that in the past and last year kind of followed the pattern of increasing more like 6% to 7% range.","So our dollars moved up just from March to April from late March which is in that low to mid-20% range. Our dollars from that range moved up in April but because of the tougher comparison, our comps did retrench a little bit and they move back to 26%. Now, in the last week, we've seen a number of days in a row, it's not a pattern yet but we've seen a number of days in a row that have gotten back into that mid to low 20% range. And so we're hoping that maybe seasonality just is showing up a little bit late where we're going to get that bump. We do know that there was some cold and some wet weather throughout parts of the country early in April. And so we'll see whether we're going to get this up or not. But, yeah, our comps did get worse, but our sales dollars did continue to move up from March to April.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one more. I know you're reluctant to provide Q3 EPS guidance, but is there potential for this to be another loss? It seems like that would be, at least in my opinion, a little bit surprising given just the sheer magnitude of the promotional costs that you were throwing at this business at Q1, including a lot of the costs that were basically headed toward the Q2 transactions. So, again, understanding the reluctance, is that in the realm of possibility...","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","I would not. Yeah, Jeff, listen, it's so hard to predict because I gave almost excruciating detail about the sales during the quarter and then in April just to give you an idea of how volatile it is, how tough it is for us to see is the recovery taking hold and then it gets interrupted by the news out of Boston. And so I wanted to give you as much detail as possible. So with all that volatility, it's hard to predict. But I would not expect a loss in the second quarter. I would expect that because we have fewer of the one-time costs, because I would expect to see some recovery, because second quarter is seasonally a better quarter for us compared to the first quarter, I would not expect to see a loss in the second quarter.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then can I sneak in just one more real quick?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. You ask \u2013 now you're going to ask me what EPS is going to be in the second quarter, aren't you?","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, no, no, not at all. Just on the labor line, I just looked at this one. So look, we all sort of look at the dollar costs for operating week numbers. It looked like you did a pretty good job of \u2013 at least they fell year-over-year. So the question becomes \u2013 I know you pointed to going back to over the last quarter that some inefficiencies surrounding both staffing in restaurants and managing food waste. I'm just trying to get a better hold on your ability to sort of maximize efficiencies or minimize those inefficiencies, I should say, in terms of both labor scheduling and controlling your food waste. Do you guys think you've made some big steps?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","I wouldn't say we have, Jeff. I know there's inefficiencies in there. We're really not going to go hard after them. When you look at labor, for example, labor is worth, I think, 850 basis points, of that 600 basis points of that is deleveraged because of sales. And so the most important thing we can do is get our sales back. Another 100 basis points is due to the very heavy promo that we did in the first quarter. So we had a lot of people visiting, a lot of people dining at Chipotle but they didn't pay for all or part of their meal. Yeah, we have to staff the restaurants, so there's about 100 basis points of that and then there's another, I think, it's 150 basis points to 200 basis points or so of, what I'll call, inflation. It's stuff that we did last year. We had merit increases for our managers and crew. We rolled out or introduced an education program, college education or education but usually college education. We started to pay for sick pay and then we enhanced our vacation pay. So those are all inflationary things that were in that kind of 150 basis points to 200 basis points range. So those are the big pieces. Underneath all that is there some efficiencies? Sure, but maybe that's 100 basis points or so.","We don't want to go out and squeeze labor right now and drive those efficiencies at a time when what's most important is for us to have a fully staffed team to have the four pillars in place, have a team that feels ready to greet customers when they come in and hopefully at an accelerated rate. So I wouldn't want to go after 100 basis points on the labor line when what's most important is to have a great experience and let's encourage the sales probably to happen.","Jeff D.

Well, 20 years ago this month I opened the first Chipotle in a little space near the University of Denver. And I had no idea that this little restaurant would someday become one of over 1500 restaurants. And that together with over 42,000 team members we would be changing food culture in this country. When I opened that first restaurant, I wanted to show that just because food is served fast didn\u2019t mean it had to be a typical fast food experience. So I stressed over ingredient and the team I worked very hard every day to make sure that we served delicious burritos to every customer who visited.","And today as a team we welcome each and every customer as if we were inviting them into our own home. Proud to serve the food that we have been working on so hard to prepare. And as I reflect on this journey we have been on for the last 20 years, it occurs to me that while we are bigger today with a much larger team serving many more customers in many more ways, we are doing just what we did when we opened the first restaurant 20 years ago. We still stress over ingredient. That we have raised our expectations to expect not only fresh ingredients, but ingredients that are responsibly raised. And our empowered teams, the top performers in our restaurants today care just as much as we did back then about making sure every customer feels welcome and are treated to a delicious meal every time they visit. I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together over the last 20 years, but are even more optimistic about our potential over the next 20.","We\u2019re pleased with our performance for the second quarter of 2013, which includes revenues of $816.8 million, an increase of 18.2%. Comp sales increased 5.5% in the quarter and diluted earnings per share increased 10.2% to $2.82. We\u2019re particularly pleased that the strength of our performance continues to be driven by our focus on the things that really drive our business and our unique people culture.","Throughout the quarter, we continue to make progress in each of these areas. We expanded the rollout of Sofritas vegan tofu entr\u00e9e to all of our restaurants in California. We\u2019re pleased with Sofritas, both in terms of the taste and how they\u2019re being received by customers. As of now, Sofritas accounts for between 4% and 5% of our product mix in California. That percentage was higher at the time of launch when there was significant marketing support and we think it will creep back up in time as we gain wider acceptance since many people are still unfamiliar with the idea of a tofu entr\u00e9e at Chipotle. We\u2019re expanding this Sofritas test to include our restaurants in the Pacific Northwest this month and we\u2019re considering additional markets this fall when we expect additional supply to become available of our tofu.","Many of you have seen that Chipotle recently became the first restaurant company to voluntarily label GMOs in our food. We made this decision because part of our Food With Integrity mission is to educate people about the realities of the food they choose to eat. Most consumers don\u2019t understand how pervasive GMO ingredients are in this country in restaurants and supermarkets. But the fact is that 94% of the soy beans and 88% of the corn in this country are genetically modified. While there\u2019s not yet a clear scientific consensus on issues related to the GMO foods, use of GMO crops has been banned or restricted in a number of other countries and there\u2019s increasing debate about the issue in the United States. At Chipotle, while most of our ingredients are already GMO free, we are committed to accomplishing the difficult mission of removing all GMO ingredients from our food.","We\u2019ve already made a significant progress toward our goal. We\u2019ve completed the transition away from soybean oil to cook our chips and Crispy Taco Shells4 nationwide by replacing it with non-GMO sunflower oil. And we also replaced soy bean oil in our Chipotle Chili Adobo used to marinade our chicken and steak, choosing instead to use non-GMO Rice Bran Oil. These are important steps for us in moving away from genetically modified ingredients altogether, and there will be significant further progress in the coming months.","Our marketing continues to highlight our food culture and how it differentiates us from other restaurants as we believe customers are increasingly receptive to messages about where their food comes from and why that\u2019s important. During the quarter, we hosted the first of three Cultivate Festivals planned for this year, this one in San Francisco. This event drew over 40,000 people to Golden Gate Park where they were entertained by great bands and some of the country\u2019s best known chefs. They also had a chance to learn about some of the important differences between industrial food and food that\u2019s sustainably raised, differences between fresh and processed foods and trivia about Chipotle\u2019s 20 year history.","With broader marketing support, including advertising, PR and in-store communication, the reach of these events is significant in the host markets, giving them impact beyond those who attend. The next Cultivate Festivals will be in Denver on August 17 and in Chicago on September 7. These events are part of our big picture efforts to show how Chipotle is cultivating a better world.","In addition to our Cultivate Festivals, we are now well into our skillfully made advertising campaign and our ongoing tracking of that campaign is encouraging, with 93% of consumers saying they find the ads relevant, compared with an average of 55% for advertising campaigns in general. 91% say they are a little or a lot more interested in trying Chipotle compared with a norm of 61% for other ad campaigns. And 89% saying that they felt a lot of information in this ad was new to them. This campaign like most of our advertising is designed to help customers understand what is different about Chipotle. That our food is skillfully made and that our commitment to great ingredients is unique in the category. This is a different approach to fast food marketing but one that very much matches the way we have built the company.","Collectively, the components of our market programs are creating positive impacts on how people perceive Chipotle. And we believe they will continue to help attract and educate customers and to build more loyalty among existing customers.","In honor of our 20th anniversary we have launched a promotion called Adventurrito, which is challenging customers to complete a series of online puzzles to be eligible to win free food from Chipotle for up to 20 years. The program began on July 13 and continues for 20 days and provides customers a chance to win free burritos for a year, with 20 people winning this prize on each of the first 19 days and an opportunity to win 20 years of free burritos on the final day of promotion. We will award up to 20 grand prizes at the end.","During each day of the promotion we reveal a new puzzle with video clues that feature friends or people who have been involved in Chipotle in some way over the last 20 years including chefs, athletes, actors, musicians, and political figures. Customers who correctly answer all of the daily puzzles over the first 19 days will have a chance to unlock the grand prize puzzle on the 20th day where they could win free burritos for 20 years.","This promotion was designed with our loyal customers in mind as our most loyal customers have contributed so much to our success over the years, and we wanted to create a program that gives back to them. Customers seem to love the promotion and we have already awarded many daily prizes so far. During the quarter we opened our first ShopHouse restaurant in Los Angeles, actually in Hollywood, are very encouraged by the first weeks of operations and the excitement this has generated.","From the beginning, ShopHouse has reminded me very much of how people responded to first Chipotle. People love it and appreciate that we are giving them something very different then what you would get from traditional fast food or other chain restaurants. ShopHouse is reinforcing the beliefs of having a restaurant to our culture. ShopHouse is reinventing the benefits of having a restaurant to our culture.","We opened the LA ShopHouse with one of our restaurant tours and from the very first day we have had tremendous crew that's cooking delicious food and providing a truly unique experience for our customers. ShopHouse is continuing to show us that there is significant potential for our business beyond burritos and tacos and we are really encouraged by its potential. We have two more ShopHouse restaurants slated to open in the coming weeks. One in Los Angeles and one in Washington DC. And lease is signed up for four additional locations, all these locations in either Los Angeles or Washington DC that should open by mid-2014.","As much as we see long-term potential for ShopHouse, I should remind that all of our growth for the foreseeable future will be driven by Chipotle in the United States. I will now turn the call over to Monty.","Monty Moran","Thank you, Steve. One of the most significant changes we have made to our business since Steve opened the first restaurant 20 years ago was to build a people culture that is as unique and compelling as the food culture. By bringing our people culture in line with our food culture, we have been able to improve the overall experience we provide, developed exceptional leaders, strengthened our economic model, and created more opportunity for our people than ever before. The cornerstone of our people culture is our restauranteurs program. These elite managers are continuing to set new standards for the quality of the experience we provide and for our financial performance. And they are also filling our pipeline with the future leaders we will need to keep pace with our growth.","During the quarter we promoted 46 new restauranteurs out of 56 candidates we interviewed, a selection rate of 82%. While this is off a little bit from our highs, but it's still a clear indication that the overall caliber of restauranteur candidates is very strong and that our field leaders have a growing understanding of what it takes to become a restauranteur. Through the first half of the year we promoted 91 new restauranteurs and 36 of our existing restauranteurs were promoted to R2 and R4 positions. This group of extraordinary leaders continues to expand their leadership influence as they move in to fill leadership positions. During the quarter we promoted 10 new apprentice team leaders, four new team leaders and one new team director, nearly all of these coming from restaurateurs.","With the continued advancement of managers to restaurateurs and restaurateurs to field leaders, 70% of our restaurants are now overseen directly or indirectly by leaders who have come through the program. The strength of our restaurant teams is not only allowing us to provide better service and a better experience, but also allows us to take on exciting new challenges.","In January, we launched our catering program in our Colorado restaurants and since then have expanded that to a dozen markets around the country. We now have over 200 restaurants offering catering and expect to more than double the restaurants offering catering by the end of August. By the end of this year we\u2019ll roll out catering to all of our restaurants. While catering is still relatively new to us, it\u2019s off to an excellent start and showing great potential. Many of our customers were delighted to [offer] Chipotle for their recent graduation celebrations and the feedback from parents and graduates alike has been overwhelmingly positive.","Overall the restaurants that are currently offering catering, sales are pushing 1% of total sales and we believe that the vast majority of that is incremental. We believe catering will continue to grow as we roll this out further and as more customers get an opportunity to try it. Recall that our catering program allows customers to essentially set up a mini Chipotle service line to make their own burrito bowls and tacos anyplace they choose. We are offering catering options to feature two or three meats as well as a chips and sauce only offering.","Last quarter I told you I would give you an update on our efforts to improve throughput in our restaurants. Typically the second quarter represents one of our busiest times of the year which provides a significant throughput opportunity for us. Last year we made great progress in this area, achieving our fastest throughput ever as our crews system wide focused on the four fundamentals that lead to excellent throughput. This helped us drive comp sales during our peak lunch hours faster than the overall comp. this year, during the second quarter, our Friday throughput increased by an average of two transactions per hour during our peak lunch hour which is from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. compared to the second quarter of 2012.","So we have managed to speed up our already fast service to make additional gains in this important area. But the truth is that we were actually disappointed that we were not able to better translate our skills into better results this quarter. We know we can deliver even faster throughput during our lunch peak and as we do, we know that more customers are going to choose to visit Chipotle confident that they\u2019ll breeze through the line and receive terrific customer service. We are committed to doing all we can to maximize this important strategic advantage that Chipotle has over all of our competitors.","The good news is that we know how to drive faster throughput and the answer is to make sure that we execute on what we have been calling the four pillars of great throughput. Having excellent (inaudible) so that everything is prepared and the line is properly set up to serve customers, making sure we have a linebacker in place to keep the service line clean and stocked to allow our team on the service line to give their full attention to customers, having our aces in their places, which means our best people at each station during our busiest times and making sure we have expeditors who can assist customers in moving through the cash out process quickly during peak times.","Our internal analysis has shown we have faster throughput when all four of these throughput fundamentals are followed. But while we\u2019ve been communicating the importance of this to our teams, I think we have not been clear enough with the message, nor have we emphasized its importance well enough at the restaurant level.","So recently for the first time ever, we have made these four pillars a key part of each manager\u2019s semi-annual bonus measure, which will encourage our field leaders to diligently train their teams on these metrics. We've also provided specific goals tailored for each restaurant to track their improvements and speed of service. We're also making execution of the four pillars of throughput a prerequisite to becoming a restaurateur. Finally, we're training all of our field operators to understand that creating a great culture around the four pillars is not just about speed of service. It also causes the entire shift to run better, make sure that our people are set up for success before the rush, improves the empowerment of the team and dramatically improve the customer experience. As always I will continue to update you on our progress in this critical area of our business.","Our development team had another very strong quarter as they opened 44 terrific new restaurants and crossed the 1,500 mark with a total of 1,502 at the close of the quarter. Not only do we remain on track to deliver the high-end of our restaurant opening guidance for this year of 165 to 180 restaurants, but our development pipeline remain strong for the future, giving us confidence that we'll able to continue with strong growth in 2014 and beyond. The strength of our operations, coupled with our unique and compelling food and people cultures have us well positioned for the second half of the year, and continue to give us confidence in our ability to provide long term value to our shareholders in the years to come. I will now turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Hartung","Thanks, Monty. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating and financial results. Our focus on building a special food culture, a unique people culture, and a strong unit economic model continued to deliver these strong results and we believe they also provide a compelling advantage in a very competitive industry.","We know that have empowered teams of top performers, serving great tasting food made from high quality, sustainably raised ingredients, will result in an exceptional dining experience for our guests and lead to even more loyal customers visiting Chipotle. Our same store sales in the quarter were up 5.5% and our average sales for restaurants that have been open for at least 12 months is over $2.1 million. Overall sales for the quarter increased 18.2% to $816.8 million driven by new restaurant openings and the 5.5% comp. [Delay] sales were $1.54 billion, an increase of 15.9%. So quarter comp was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic along with the benefit of one additional trading day compared to the second quarter of last year.","Year-to-date comps were 3.4% driven by the increased traffic. So far in July we are seeing underlying comp trends similar to the trends in Q2 after adjusting for the extra day in the quarter. Without the extra day in the quarter, the underlying comp trend was about 4.5%, which is an acceleration from the underlying 3% comp we saw in Q1. This higher sales comp trend became apparent in the second half of April when more normal spring weather arrived in most of the country and continued into May and June. In light of this higher comp trend, we are raising our full year sales comp guidance to low to mid-single digits.","We opened 44 new restaurants in the quarter and 92 for the year so far which brings our total companywide restaurants to 1502 at the end of Q2. We continue to expect to open between 165 and 180 restaurants for the full year, and we are pleased that at the end of Q2 we are more than half way there as our development teams have worked diligently to build more inventory to support level loaded openings throughout the year.","Our new restaurants continue to perform very well and are opening at or above the high-end of our $1.5 million to $1.6 million sales range. Restaurant level margin for the quarter were 27.6%, a decrease of 160 basis points from last year, and year-to-date margins were 27%, a decrease of 130 basis points. Higher food costs and higher marketing costs more than offset favorable sales leverage both in the quarter and for the year. Our food costs in the second quarter were about the same as in Q1 but were 100 basis points higher compared to Q2 of last year due to higher cost for our salsas, higher cost for cheese, and from higher chicken, slightly offset by the lower cost for avocadoes.","A freeze in Mexico severely impacted our tomatillo supply increasing our cost for both red and green tomatillo. While our corn salsa costs are higher as we fully converted to serving our delicious sweet, white corn which is more expensive than yellow corn. Year-to-date food costs were 33% which is up 80 basis points from last year. We expect food costs will remain at about this level or slightly higher for the rest of this year as we expect cost pressure from higher avocado and stake costs. We expect the avocado costs to move higher in the coming months from increased demand for California supply of avocados and from recent hotter weather which affects the fruit size and the availability, as well as from slightly lower expected supply from Mexico in the fall. As a result of the relatively stable food cost and a longer-term general forecast of a stable or perhaps even deflationary food cost, we do not have any current plans to raise prices for the remainder of 2013.","Labor costs were 22.7% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 40 basis points from last year, and year-to-date labor cost were down 30 basis points. Normally, we would not see labor leverage with an underlying comp of around 4.5% as the benefit from sales leverage is offset by wage inflation. But our wage rates in the quarter were about the same as last year as our restaurant teams have done a better job of fully staffing their restaurants with top performers thus resulting in lower overtime this year compared to last. We anticipate labor costs as a percentage of sales will move modestly higher in the coming quarters due to seasonally lower sales in Q3 and Q4.","Occupancy costs for the quarter declined 10 basis points from last year due to the favorable sales leverage. Other operating costs increased 100 basis points from last year as marketing costs increased to 1.5% of sales in the quarter compared to about 0.7% last year and from slightly higher promotional cost. We expect marketing to be about 1.6% overall for 2013 as we continue our skillfully made advertising campaign across the country and for marketing events around our cultivate platform in the third quarter, including Cultivate Festivals in Denver and Chicago. As a result, we expect marketing expense to be around 1.7% in the second half of the year.","In the quarter, G&A was slightly higher than last year by 10 basis points, primarily due to higher legal and higher payroll, mostly due to a bonus accrual. G&A cost for the first six months of 2013 were 6.2% of revenue or a decrease of 70 basis points compared to last year. This decrease was due to lower stock based compensation expense and lower employee payroll tax as Q1 in last year included a one-time catch up adjustment for performance shares and higher employee payroll taxes on greater number of stock option exercises from last year. We expect total non-cash stock compensation will be about $66 million for the full year 2013 or about the same as last year. And we expect our G&A as a percentage of sales will be about the same as in Q2 or perhaps slightly higher as we move into seasonally lower sales periods.","Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 40.1% and for the full year we expect the rate to be around 38.9%. The second quarter includes a non-recurring adjustment of around $1 million for changes in state income taxes that reduced earnings by about $0.03 per share. This includes about $250,000 in interest expense in the interest and other income line of the P&L, with the rest of the adjustment reflected in the tax line. For the third and fourth quarters of this year, we expect to have a tax rate of about 39.4%.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.82, an increase of 10.2% from last year. During the quarter we repurchased about $30 million of our stock or nearly 84,000 shares at an average share price of $353. At the end of the second quarter we had nearly $120 million left on our share buyback program previously approved by our board. And over the last five years we have invested over $580 million to purchase about 4 million shares at an overall average price of $145 per share.","We finished the second quarter with about $775 million in cash and cash equivalents and short and long term interest bearing investments and no debt on our balance sheet. We continue to believe that the best use of our cash is to invest in our high returning restaurants and we will continue to develop additional growth options by planting seeds including ShopHouse and Chipotle outside of the U.S. that will provide attractive value enhancing growth investments in the future. In the meantime we\u2019ll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today and at this time we\u2019d be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Congratulations on a good first half of the year. Jack, just a question on your pricing philosophy and strategy. I know you mentioned you don't have plans to raise prices for the rest of the year, yet the food\/cost ratio you mentioned also was going to creep up or stay similar to where it was in the first half which is above the historical norm. So, I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that. Is this another delay in your price increase? Or are you thinking that you don't need it at this point. Maybe if you could just kind of layout your thoughts there.","Jack Hartung","Yeah, David, I\u2019d call it a delay, but I think it's a delay right now that based on what we see for the rest of this year. We don\u2019t feel compelled to increase prices in the next two quarters. Certainly, that may change, but based on our current margins, based on what appears to be a tamer food inflation environment generally, based on the fact that even the pressure I talked about mostly coming from avocados on our food cost line in the next couple of quarters, those are more cyclical than inflationary. I would argue that\u2019s based on just what we\u2019re seeing in California and Mexico in avocados this year. So they don't feel like a permanent inflationary item. And then another consideration is -- Steve had mentioned, we want to remove GMOs and that\u2019s a significant challenge.","There is going to be some cost associated with that as well. So we like to be patient with that as well. And so when we do raise prices, we may be able to time that when we\u2019re doing Food With Integrity items like removing the rest of the GMOs in some of our ingredients. We also had some of our supply of naturally raised meat such as steak this year will be a real challenge. We\u2019re working to get that back up 100%. So there are things like that that we think will add to the quality of our food, but may add to the cost as well, and so we think that it\u2019s wise to wait until we understand what those costs are going to be and maybe time it around some of those items, and so right now we don\u2019t think we need to do anything in the next two quarters.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Great. And, Jack, just to clarify some of the items you just mentioned, are those items you expect to happen early in 2014 and is that way your rating is just maybe a couple of quarters out from where you expect it or?","Jack Hartung","We hope so, David, but it\u2019s hard to pin it down because when we\u2019re changing ingredients like this, there are so many things to consider. Of course, cost is really just one of them. The most important is what's the impact on the recipes, what's the impact on the taste of our food, the quality of our food. We want to be very careful before we're switching out ingredients that we don't have unintended consequences or we don't have customers that feel like, gee, I don't really like the taste. So we don't think that will happen, but we have to be very careful as we do this. So, it's not unreasonable to think that we can get a lot of this done, maybe all of it done in the next two quarters, but it's hard to say that with certainty.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","I just want to ask, after your restaurant margins have gone up year after year after year for so many years, they have stabilized now in this 26%, 27% range for the past three or four years. Is there any reason to believe it's some sort of natural ceiling about what the concept will be able to achieve? Or do you think maybe this is just a pause and you have a vision that it can move higher?","Jack Hartung","Well, Michael, it can move higher, I don't think it's a natural ceiling. I think it depends on what our ultimate volumes are, and that depends on what our comps are. We've always talked about that food cost aside, and food cost by the way the margin pressure we've seen in the quarter and for the year can be easily remedied by increasing prices. We think we've got that pricing power, we think our food cost is higher than it normally would be and so that part we think we can solve.","So then beyond that, we think we still have leverage. If we can deliver a comp that's at or above a mid-single digit comp that is driven by transaction, we think we still can maintain or even add to our margins. And in fact, we think that if we were able to drive a higher than mid-single digit comp we can increase our margins at a similar level to any other concept that's at a much lower level. So, we don't think our ability to raise margins has been diminished at all, but it all will depend on what the comps and what our ultimate average volumes end up being.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","And then do you have maybe any research that suggests the majority of your customers want to pay more for GMO free foods or is that a decision that you make more based on feel?","Jack Hartung","Customers don't fully understand GMOs. There is a small number of people and we've seen this when we recently put information about GMOs on our website that are really into it, really understand it and are really excited about us removing GMOs. I would say the vast majority of our customers are largely unaware of which of their foods that they eat everyday contain GMOs, what the impact of GMOs might be. There is a lot of debate and uncertainty around the real impact of GMOs. So, we don't necessarily think that customers are going to want to pay more or going to visit more often. But all along the way on our food integrity journey we've always done things that we thought were the right things to increase the quality of the food, that was going to be more wholesome, more helpful and more respectful to the environment, and we think GMOs follow along that same thinking. And we think over time as our customers and as customers in general, as they discover more about where their food comes from and as they discover more about what Chipotle is doing to source these higher quality ingredients, we think that does build customer loyalty. So, we think it's going to be good for our business, Michael, but it's hard to say that there is a direct correlation between removing GMOs and people paying more or people visiting more.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs","And if I could sneak in one last one. Since the employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act is delayed by a year to Jan 15, do you plan to hold-off on offering insurance to your employees until then?","Jack Hartung","We are still studying that. That is a very possible outcome. The one challenge we're dealing with, Michael, is we've been offering for a number of years now a streamlined version that our crew have had the option to elect and then pay for this coverage themselves. It's called the Starbridge program. We're trying to figure out whether we will be allowed to continue to offer that. Right now, it's possible that we won't be able to, that we'll have to remove that. And so, we don't know how exactly to deal with our few thousand employees that are reelecting that. We'd like to not have to take something like that away from them. So we're still studying that. Right now, it's likely that we will delay it, but this is the one issue that we want to get our arms around before we make a final decision.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse","Just to dig into the traffic trends and the throughput issues, very, very encouraging obviously at 5.5 in terms of the traffic mix benefit. If you think through that Friday scenario you gave Monty, and how much of this might have come from expanding throughput initiatives, maybe breaking that down a little bit more, if you think, how much of the increase in sales on the same-store basis is coming maybe outside lunch? Are you seeing changing patterns in willingness outside this peak hours? Is it broadening out in appeal on that front? Maybe anything you can give us on comps at peak hour, how much of throughput and then comps outside peak hour as well. Thanks.","Monty Moran","Yeah, great question. We really focus on throughput during peak hours just because that's where there is the most sand in hourglass, so to speak, and where we have the most opportunity to put people through faster and thereby avoid people walking away from the end of the line. So one of the things we're very encouraged by in the last couple of years is our ability to drive a better comp during the peak lunch and peak dinner times than we did during even the rest of the day. This last quarter that wasn't the case. The comp that we drove during peak lunch was slower than the all-day comp, although the comp that we drove at the peak dinner hour was slightly better than the all-day comp. So we're still achieving some really nice gains there. But the amount of additional transactions we've put through during the rest of the day were higher.","So the -- what we call shoulder hours between lunch and dinner we did very, very well. We had unusually high comps during those hours. Now that can be caused by the fact that people choose to avoid the long lines and simply reschedule their lunch for a later time or it can be just be caused by the fact that we have a lot more transactions coming through the restaurants generally. This quarter -- second quarter of 2013 versus the second quarter of 2012, we actually had 25 transactions more per day coming through in each of our restaurants on average. Like I said, only two of those occurred -- only two incremental occurred during the peak lunch hour. So we're still proud to eke out those two because it's difficult during lunch to put through -- that's the name of the game is to put through more people during that busiest time.","But like I mentioned, we're still little disappointed just because we think we can do much, much better. We know we can do better because our very fastest restaurants are way, way faster than our average restaurant. And as the lines build, we really want to continue to teach and encourage our teams to focus on these four pillars of throughput, which not only enable us to put people through the line more quickly, but also to just increase the quality of the customer experience a great deal as well. So we're very pleased in our ability to drive additional transactions to our restaurants. We're very pleased to be able to do it without adding a substantial amount of labor or any additional equipment. But we know we can do a heck of a lot better as well with the knowledge we've already accumulated about how to drive throughput. So we're excited to continue to work on achieving those gains as we get our teams more and more focused on this very important advantage of ours.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear next from Bank of America and Joe Buckley.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a couple of follow up questions. Questions on the Sofritas sales mix you mentioned. Do you have any sense of how much of that is incremental of those California stores comping up better than the system?","Jack Hartung","Joe, we think very little if any of it is incremental. We've only done a little bit of advertising. A lot of that is done through tasting as customers come in. So we don't see any evidence that it\u2019s incremental. So we think it\u2019s all trade up. I think what's encouraging is that only half of the trade-off is coming from vegetarian. The other half is coming from some of our meat entrees. A lot of that's coming from chicken. So we are pleased by that. That's got a broad appeal. So we\u2019re hopeful that over time that as people want to visit Chipotle more often and they\u2019re looking for a little change in what they\u2019re ordering, that they will order the Sofritas and it will add to our comp over time. But I would say right now we\u2019re not really seeing anything that's obvious that it's incremental right now.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just a question on the marketing. Some of those statistics, Steve, that you shared were very impressive. Can you tell us a little bit more? Have you done different forms of marketing in different regions? Are there any other learnings you can share with us and do you have a sense that it is -- you are driving some of that nice traffic increase?","Steve Ells","Well, we don't know exactly how much of the comp the marketing is affecting. But the numbers I shared with you I think are significant to us because we want to make sure that what has traditionally been a more difficult message for us around food with integrity, and things and marketing messages that are not typical fast food marketing messages. These different kind of messages were tough for us and we feel that we've been getting better at them over the last couple of last two to three years or so. I think we're feeling really good about skillfully made. And what we think is really important is over the long-term continuing to form a close bond with our customers, getting them not only interested in things that they haven't thought about before. There was a question about, are people asking for non-GMO foods, are they willing to pay for it? Well, it's a great question. But when I think about food with integrity in general, customers weren't asking for that. This is something that was very important to us and really was around conducting our business in a way that we think is open and honest and ultimately best for customers and the environment, and animal welfares and farmers and things like this.","Customers aren't directly asking for that but when you help them understand the importance of these things, I think it develops a stronger relationship. So, that's why these numbers are significant to us because they're finding this marketing as increasingly relevant to them. And I think that's especially important as we go into new territory and start talking about things like GMOs. So, I'm very bullish. Again, how much of that, how much of the marketing contributes to the comp, we're not exactly sure. But we've always taken a longer term view in our market approach and rather than put out campaigns that will spike up sales or contribute to a quick comp, we would rather ensure that we're building the business consistently and long-term. We think that's ultimately better for our shareholders and for the business.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then maybe just one more real quick on the, same-store sales increase was it all transaction, was there any deviation in the [check]?","Jack Hartung","No, it was all transactions, Joe, except for the one extra day. So the 5.5%, 1% of that came from one extra day, but the 4.5% underneath that was all transactions.","Operator","We will hear our next question from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Just two follow ups. First off on the marketing line of question. It seems like you're very happy with the skillfully made efforts here and it looks like this quarter was a big spike in terms of what you spent. I think, Jack, you said 1.6% for all of '13. I'm just wondering, first, if you can just layout the biggest buckets within that. I guess in some way it is cultivate versus the coupons versus more traditional radio and billboard. Just wondering how you break out that bucket and then how should we think about '14 in terms of as a percentage of sales, if you're pleased where you are at this point. Like is there a feeling as to how high you would go or how much you'd be comfortable to increase it for next year?","Jack Hartung","Yeah, Jeff, 2014, it's too early to tell. We haven't really done our budgeting, but I would expect that we would be in the same ballpark, kind of this 1.6%, 1.7%ish kind of range. There is nothing that we've seen or talked about so far where we've talked about, yeah, let's really ramp it up. And in terms of the split, you know it varies by quarter, it varies by year, but I would say generally it's a reasonable split between what I\u2019d call traditional advertising, the billboards, the radio and things like that. We\u2019re probably putting more money into that this year than we have in the past and we've had one flight already. We\u2019re going to do more of it beginning in August. So we\u2019re probably going to spend a little more than we have in the past.","Cultivate, we\u2019ve added Cultivate. And so those are nice local, really having some close contact with people in not a marketing way, but in experiential way. So we\u2019ve added one and so we\u2019re spending a lesser amount on that because it\u2019s only in three markets. And then we\u2019ve got some other things coming up in the fall that Steve has talked about that are more similar to our back to the future video that we had last year -- I\u2019m sorry back to start, not back to the future, the movie. But more in that entertainment where we\u2019ll have a video series where it\u2019s entertaining and there is also a message, a message about food and that's coming up as well. So it\u2019s split up between a number of things like that. They\u2019re very, very different. Some of experiential, some are traditional and some are very non-traditional. And as the year comes to an end and we look at how things went, we\u2019ll revisit and then decide what we do in 2014. But I would expect the overall marketing expense to be in the similar ballpark.","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital","And then a follow-up. I think you mentioned from a commodity -- I don't know if you gave us the basket per se. I think you had said that it\u2019s going to be similar to slightly higher. I think you meant versus the 33%, so we should be assuming 33% plus in the back half of the year. Can you share how much what the basket inflation is at this point and how much is locked kind of thing?","Jack Hartung","Very little is locked, Jeff. We have beans locked. We have our corn for salsas locked just through the end of this quarter, the third quarter. And then we have re-up there. We have a few other -- I think we have rice locked and that\u2019s about it. That\u2019s the majority of what we buy. We have no locks in the meats. We have no locks on the avocados. That just not possible with what we\u2019re behind there. So, really for the most part most of our ingredients are floating according to the market.","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital","And lastly, you said the 4.5% underlying comps, it sounds like after the start of April it was very steady through the quarter at that 4.5%. And it sounds like you\u2019re saying that\u2019s where it's running in July. If that\u2019s true the compares -- is there anything unusual about the compares? I know some of your peers talked about June and July last year, things really slowed down. So just wondering if you see it as very stable on a two year basis or how you read that month to month.","Jack Hartung","I would say the trends that we\u2019re seeing are pretty stable. Nothing is stable when you go day by day or week by week. But when I look at the entire quarter and I look at once weather -- return to normal weather because in the first half of April with the Easter moving from one year to the next and then with the weather it took a while for spring to arrive. It was hard to get a read until the second half of April. Once second half of April appeared, when I look at the entire period all the way to July, it looks like a pretty stable 4.5% underlying run rate. I would say the compares are largely meaningless and the reason I say that is because the trends from last year was I would call it the third year of a trend that started three years ago with the recession and as you add up all the quarters for the last three years ending in 2012, we added about 27% to 28% in each quarter to our sales. And that was done since the recession. And now this is a brand new trend. The brand new trend was an underlying three in the first quarter and now it's a 4.5. It continues to feel like 4.5 as we're into this third quarter. So I think looking at comparisons to last year I think will not help you got diagnose the transit at all.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research","Just a follow-up on Jeff's question. It does -- the trend of 4.5% traffic you're seeing that right now, but do the traffic comparisons -- do they get more difficult in August and September and you just feel that it's meaningless, but does it get more difficult for the balance of the quarter?","Jack Hartung","Well, if you went back to last year you would see that our comps actually were lower in the back half of the year. And I think if you were going to draw the conclusion, that, oh, lower comps in the back half of the year that means the compares are easier, I think that's where you would be misled. This trend that we're seeing right now is a couple of months old, still very young. It feels like a 4.5% trend right now and that's I think the best way to think about it. I think any kind of compares to last year, if you try to draw anything out of it at all, you might conclude that they're easier compares, but that's not the way to look at it. Those compares are really, it's the completion of a three-year trend that started three years ago. And so we kind of started with a clean sheet of paper with this trend, we're starting a brand new trend is the way I would think about it.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research","And a question on the non-GMO products. As a base the food costs were 33.1% in this quarter. If you were to implement this program of non-GMO products and assuming no pricing, what type of food cost percent should we think about modeling?","Jack Hartung","We don't know, to be honest, that's why we want to kind of hold off. We have to discover things like make sure that we get the right oil, that the oil performs the way that we want it to, that the taste is delicious. Ideally that would improve the taste of the food. We need to study things like yield and waste and holding times and things like that. There is a whole host of factors, and so we really don't know what the cost is going to be. So, we are going to take a very diligent, very thoughtful approach in this and make sure that we do it right in every single way. And the idea of holding on to any price increase until we understand all that and then try to find those, we think makes quite a bit of sense.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research","And if I can slip one more question in. It looks like Sofritas is on its way to go national perhaps. When we think about the kitchen and your ability to add new products, you've always focused on improving the existing products, Sofritas is new. Are there any physical capacity constraints in the back of the house if you want to add just say one new product per year? Is there a point where you may have to do a more meaningful reconfiguration in the kitchen?","Steve Ells","In terms of the production capability back of the house, not only is there a lot more room for more volume production but there would also be room for different items. It's never been our thought that we want to hold back on new items because they are in some way difficult to produce. If you look at our kitchen, it's interesting. Lots of fast food restaurants employ very specific equipment to do specific tasks. We have things like pots and pans, knives and cutting boards and the grills and thing. So, you can prepare a wide variety of foods, all different kinds of foods with these basic kitchen tools. So, we are very, very well prepared, well suited to take on new tasks. The reason we choose not to, I think is twofold. One is that our very simple ordering system allows for great throughput. It\u2019s as you know one of our competitive advantages. But I don\u2019t know that we necessarily need to continue to add or we need to add things in order to keep customers coming.","I remember 20 years ago people said, Steve, a menu with burritos and tacos, I mean, you are going to have to add new stuffs pretty soon. But it\u2019s the combinations of things that people can make, not only for taste but for diet. And people can vary over the years during their visits that really keeps Chipotle fresh. So, I think it\u2019s really, really important that we keep a simple streamlined, very efficient front line. That being said, the addition of Sofritas is really not something that we\u2019ve noticed has any negative impact on throughput or the frontline operations. And it\u2019s my hope, we haven\u2019t seen this yet, but it\u2019s my hope that we'll get more people who might not have thought about eating in fast food restaurants who might be vegan or vegetarian or just health conscious in general to maybe come and try us and learn that this is a new fast food. So Sofritas is a very special menu addition in that it really not only respects our Food With Integrity mission in the use of this non-GMO organic artisanally-made tofu, but it also has an appeal to those who are health-conscious.","Operator","We\u2019ll move on to our next caller which is Paul Westra with Stifel Nicholas.","Paul Westra - Stifel Nicholas","Just a couple of questions. One was a follow up on catering. Would you expect any roll-out costs impacting the second half as you ramp up the national rollout? And then a related question is, is the breakeven volume low enough where also as it begins to build and a little bit maybe --","Steve Ells","Paul, I\u2019m starting to lose what you\u2019re saying. Can you speak a little louder?","Paul Westra - Stifel Nicholas","My apologies. The question was on catering. Should we expect some rollout costs associated with the national rollout ramp later in the year? And a related question was the breakeven level you expect with catering. You\u2019re about 1% now you said in existing stores. Would you suggest it's a breakeven level now or not?","Monty Moran","Well, the cost of rolling it out is very insubstantial. There is a pallet of equipment that's delivered to the restaurant when we roll it out to a new restaurant. And once that equipment is stored and everything we're ready to go and the margins on catering are favorable so that we can comfortably begin serving it right away. In terms of a breakeven cost, no issue at all. There is zero cost on that. I think from the get-go, from our very first catering order served, we are achieving the margin that we would expect from it just like we would with any -- we\u2019re serving a Burrito Bowl or anything else that we would serve.","The packaging for catering has a cost to it, but most of the cost to that -- nearly all of the cost to that is rolled into the prices we charge for the catering spread. And we do ask for them to come back with -- we do ask folks to bring back some parts of the packaging in exchange which will give them a free burrito, but that's more just because we want to be responsible and we use those aluminum parts that don't wear out. So even if they didn\u2019t bring that back, we'd be just fine from a margin standpoint. So really it is something that is profitable from the very first order and there is no -- really there is no roll out cost to speak of at all or very, very slight.","Paul Westra - Stifel Nicholas","And when you think about that maybe being obviously a national mix by the end of this year, Sofritas may be coming national even later, I want to tie that into maybe your commentary or thoughts on the marketing spend. I can tell your brain is perfectly aligned with current trends and marketing toward digital and local and customizable. But those are two initiatives that seem perfect for maybe some national ad spend because I wanted to line that with what you\u2019re thinking about the same market spend next year. And maybe do you have a thought about dialing up marketing around catering?","Steve Ells","Well, in terms of the catering marketing, that doesn't really -- I don't think require anything different or an additional spend than we already have. That can easily be added to what we\u2019re already doing. I would say the same for Sofritas. In our current advertising campaigns like skillfully made, we can easily replace that with pieces that would promote Sofritas. But there is a lot of local store marketing that we can employ to promote both catering and Sofritas, and I think we're getting better and better at our local store marketing tactics. And I think those are the ones that are really powerful, especially when there\u2019s a deeper message behind something like Sofritas.","Paul Westra - Stifel Nicholas","And then just one last question. We've seen some very good commodity cost declines at least in the base commodities corn and wheat, soybeans now. Is there anything -- it usually takes some time, 12 months maybe to show up later in the meat products, but there is nothing we should expect. I mean, obviously with these coming down and looking out for 2014 and I know you don't want to show your cards too much, but there is nothing that shouldn't be translated into your relatively benign cost for '14?","Jack Hartung","No, Paul. We think the same thing that generally there is a stable environment. I would say the one thing that could potentially be different is we've had real challenges from a supply standpoint with our meats, steak in particular. We're falling below 100%, chicken we fell below 100% actually [waited] for a while, we're back up to 100% now. So, there is a different supply and demand formula that's going on right now that supply just seems to be tight right now. So, it's possible that we might not see the same kind of deflation that commodity meats might provide but we don't see the kind of inflation pressure that we saw like at the end of last year. It does seem like there is stable pricing at least or stable cost at least, but we might not get all the advantage that the commodity everyday ingredients might bring.","Operator","Our final question will come from Andrew Barish with Jefferies.","Andrew Barish - Jefferies","Two quick things, on the mix that had been running negative, it sounds like it's turned to kind of flattish. Was that a little bit of catering and maybe some of the upgrades on the margarita side? And then secondly -- or just different consumer behavior maybe -- and then secondly on stock-based comp, that it come down in the first quarter and for the year, was there some more favorability here in the 2Q or not really?","Jack Hartung","On the stock comp, our dollar cost this year was higher than last year, what you saw in the first quarter was kind of a one-time thing. We had $6 million, I think it was a $6 million catch up adjustment in the first quarter of last year, and that was for some performance shares where it became apparent more likely than not that we would meet the performance criteria. And so we had a catch up adjustment for I think it was roughly a year and a half or so worth of expense if you will, once it became apparent in the first quarter of last year that we would reach their performance criteria. So that's why stock comp was lower Q1 this year versus last year. In the second quarter we were up a little bit. I don't have the numbers offhand, but it was up about 10%-15% something like that, Andy. So the growth was a little bit less than sales.","Then overall for the year, most importantly we're going to be at about $66 million in total, which is about the same as last year. And then your other question is on mix, we continue to see that there is a slight degradation in drinks and that's what we're seeing before. But it's very modest, so it did lessen a little bit, and then we saw some offsets and a few other things, particularly like guacamole for example. And so, those two things just offset. And you'll remember in the past the mix that we were seeing was very, very modest, but we pointed out only because there was a slight difference between our transactions and the comps that we're seeing, but in this quarter the transactions just about exactly mirror the sales. So, no net mix of that whatsoever.","Alex Spong","Great. Thanks everyone. Looks like we've exceeded our time, so thanks for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Jack Hartung","Thanks, everyone.","Steve Ells","Thanks, everyone.","Monty Moran","Thank you.","Operator","Once again this does conclude today's conference.

Welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings call. By now you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. Including projections about comparable restaurant sales growth, new store openings, our effective tax rate and expected G&A expenses.","These statements are based on management\u2019s current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual \u2013 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.","Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will start today\u2019s call prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. After which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Niccol","Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re pleased with our second quarter financial performance which reflects continued progress on the strategic initiatives we discussed at our special Investor Call just over a year ago. Since that time, our efforts to highlight that Chipotle sources, cooks and serves real food that has the power to cultivate a better world have led to a meaningful improvement in our business fundamentals. In fact, this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales, which reinforces our view that when we connect with guests through culturally relevant marketing focused on Chipotle\u2019s great taste and real ingredients and provide more convenient access with less friction, they respond.","For the quarter, we reported 10% comparable restaurant sales growth that included nearly 7% transaction growth, restaurant level margins of 20.9% which is 120 basis points higher than last year, earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.99 representing 39% year-over-year growth and digital sales growth of 99% year-over-year representing 18.2% of sales. These strong results were delivered despite the tougher year-over-year comparison and benefited from better execution, on four key initiatives we mentioned on last year\u2019s call, specifically revamping our marketing, creating a stage-gate process for innovations, leveraging our second make line to grow digital sales and expand access and engaging with our customers by launching a new loyalty program. All of these efforts are layered on top of our foundational work to run successful restaurants with great hospitality and throughput.","Let me now spend a few minutes updating you on each of these initiatives. First, starting with our marketing efforts. We made sure to stay relevant throughout the quarter by celebrating our real ingredients and classic cooking techniques. Our Behind The Foil campaign resonated with guests by showcasing the connection between how food is raised and prepared to how it taste by featuring our team members pride in making delicious food daily.","In addition, Q2 benefited from several strategic promotions that made the Chipotle brand more visible for helping to expand access. An example is a free delivery promotion in conjunction with the prominent influencer to celebrate National Burrito Day on April 4. Leveraging the social and digital experience helped make this, the highest sales day in Chipotle\u2019s history.","More importantly, it was another opportunity to acquire customers and transactions by introducing them for the convenience of delivery and we are seeing increased new customer retention with higher levels of delivery sales after the promotion. On the menu side, we are elevating our core by developing innovations that leads food culture and meet guests requests. Our Lifestyle Bowls remain popular with customers and we continue to test new menu items that are in various stages of development.","The furthest along is Carne Asada, which I am pleased to announce is nearing validation through our stage-gate process, after which we will decide on the timing of a potential national launch. This item is easy to execute operationally as unique flavor profile and is receiving terrific customer feedback in our test markets. We are also gaining valuable feedback on our Quesadilla pilot with the good news being that customers really love it.","The new ovens are helping to improve the quality and taste of the Quesadillas and could potentially be a platform for other new menu items including desserts and nachos. That being said, we still have some work to do in order to streamline our workflow. As I\u2019ve stated previously, we are not going to roll out new menu items at the sacrificed throughput. We will update you on our progress of all potential new menu items as they move through our stage-gate process.","We are very excited about Chipotle rewards which launched on March 12 and has exceeded our expectations with over five million enrolled members. Encouragingly these sign-ups across all frequency bands, and we are starting to use customer data to more effectively target and engage the incidence of lower frequency in lapsed users. Early results are showing that members are increasing their frequency after joining the program. The rewards program gives us a currency that we can use to incent behaviors and is a key enabler of our digital ecosystem moving forward.","Our customers are responding positively to our digital system, which includes order ahead, delivery and catering as it reduces friction and creates a convenient and enjoyable way for our guests to experience Chipotle. Overall, digital sales grew 99% year-over-year to $262 million during the quarter and represented 18.2% of sales. For this in perspective, this was more than we did in digital sales during all of 2016. Delivery remains a key driver of our digital growth given enhanced capabilities on our app and website, as well as our expanded reach. In fact, delivery is now available for more than 95% of our restaurants and remains highly incremental.","We continue to see residual lift in delivery sales that last beyond any promotion and have seen very little guest overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner apps. Additionally with mobile order pickup shelves available in all relevant restaurants and digital make lines in nearly 2,000 restaurants, we are modernizing and making the customer and team member experience, more efficient, while building more love for Chipotle. With more customers coming to Chipotle restaurants, many of whom are new, it is imperative we provide a great guest experience. The operations team has made progress against this goal, partly as a result of our focus to make 2019 the year of the General Manager.","Specifically, we have a great company with a meaningful purpose that people want to be a part of. We have a culture of food safety. We are dedicated to training and developing talent and we are enhancing our industry-leading employee benefits. In addition to our newly expanded tuition assistance program you may have seen our recent announcement of a new crew bonus program. This gives hourly employees the opportunity to turn up to an extra month\u2019s pay each year based on the restaurant achieving certain performance in food safety goals. This is another example of investing in our most valuable asset, our people.","As a result of these efforts, we believe our employee value proposition is resonating. Manager and crew turnover have come down nicely over the past year. Our food is being prepared more consistently through line tastings and our result is being executed better. And we are seeing steady improvement in throughput aided by training, focus and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard, that provides greater visibility on performance.","While I am encouraged by the progress thus far, I believe we still have a significant opportunity for further throughput gains. When done well throughput isn\u2019t simply about moving people through the restaurant as quickly as possible, instead, it\u2019s about outstanding customer service with clear authentic communication as customers efficiently move down our serving line. I believe better execution on our five key pillars, which have historically been proven throughput drivers will drive sales and transactions.","Everyone at Chipotle believes real food can change the world. So we strive every day to do the right thing for our employees, for our customers and for the environment. I would like to personally thank each of our team members for their tireless dedication and passion to make Chipotle success.","In closing, what really excites me is that I believe we are still in the early stages on many of our key initiatives and by continuing to execute and get better which we are committed to doing, Chipotle is well positioned for future growth.","With that, here\u2019s Jack to walk you through the financials.","Jack Hartung","Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re proud of our performance for the first half of 2019 as we continue to see comps and margins expand. Combination of investing in our people, delivering relevant and compelling marketing, and enhanced digital system and great execution in our restaurants is all leading to a better guest dining experience, which ultimately allows us to further strengthen our economic model.","Sales were $1.4 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 13.2% from last year. The comp was 10% in the quarter, which includes a 40 basis point reduction as a result of deferred revenue from our rewards program. Restaurant level margins of 20.9% expanded 120 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.99 representing 39% year-over-year growth. The second quarter had unusual expenses related to our transformation as well as legal reserves, which I\u2019ll talk about in more detail later and these negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.77 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $3.22.","Our Q2 comp of 10% was driven by healthy acceleration in transactions as nearly 7% of the comp came from greater guest visits. The higher average check includes a price impact of about 2% and a mix contribution of roughly 1.5% driven by growth in digital orders which have a higher average check. We\u2019re delighted by the customer response to the convenience offered by our digital strategies as well as the culturally relevant marketing which once again drove increased guest visits into our restaurant.","Given the strong Q2 and first half of 2019 results, we\u2019re increasing our full year comp guidance from mid to high single digits. To the high single digits with price continuing contribute about 2%. And as you think about the cadence for the remaining two quarters, remember that our comparisons get more difficult as the year unfolds.","We opened 20 new restaurants in the quarter, with continued strong economics. For 2019, we expect to open between 140 and 155 new restaurants with the weighting that\u2019s heavily skewed toward the fourth quarter. We anticipate Q3 opening to be slightly higher than what we saw in Q2 with Q4 openings increasing significantly. Based on the site pipeline we\u2019re building so far this year, we expect the 2020 new restaurant openings to be more equally weighted by quarter.","Food cost for the quarter were 33.7%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year due primarily to higher avocado prices partially offset by a menu price increase, while we anticipated some of the avocado price increase due to a spike in late March based on higher demand from retailers, prices spiked again in June going to further reduce supply coming from Mexico. This resulted in a roughly 50 basis point greater headwind from avocados during the quarter than we expected.","Avocado prices are likely to remain elevated in July, but should start to moderate as we move through the quarter as our sourcing shifts to other market. Offsetting some of the avocado pressure in Q2 was approximately $2 million of cost savings through more efficient sourcing, while our supply chain team will continue to search for efficiencies, our top priority is to continue to pursue high quality, sustainably raise ingredients and our pursuit of efficiencies will never be at the expense of food quality or food safety.","Of note, protein pricing was in line with our expectations during the quarter and we\u2019ve not seen any impact for market forces thus far. Since we purchased higher quality more expensive pork as opposed to commodity pork, and we have pricing agreements in place, covering the near term, we don\u2019t expect a significant impact on our costs for the rest of this year.","Factoring in the above items, we expect Q3 cost of sales to be slightly lower than Q2, while Q4 should be at or slightly below 33% of sales. Labor costs for the quarter were 25.7%, a decrease of 130 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range.","We expect Q3 labor costs to be in the mid-26% range as we expect similar labor inflation against lower sales seasonality. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.5%, a decrease of 30 basis points from Q2 last year, as sales leverage more than offset higher marketing and promo costs. Marketing promo costs were 3.3% in the quarter, an increase of about 10 basis points compared to Q2 of last year to fund our Behind the Foil campaign and various delivery promotions. We expect our marketing investment to be spent more evenly over the second half of the year, with the marketing and promo budget for the full year remaining around 3% of sales. Other operating costs continue to include delivery fees.","And delivery is the way for us to increase convenience, drive awareness and ultimately acquire new customers. It remains the fastest growing part of our business with a relatively small portion being associated with free delivery promotions. Given the high incrementality we\u2019re currently seeing, delivery continues to be accretive to our restaurant level margins.","G&A for the quarter was $121 million on a GAAP basis or $97 million on a non-GAAP basis which excludes $4 million related to transformation expenses and $20 million for legal reserves. G&A also includes $20 million related to non-cash stock compensation and $4 million related to higher bonus accruals from our strong performance and payroll taxes and stock option exercises. Similar to last quarter, without these items, our underlying G&A this quarter, restaurants total right around $72 million, which is in line with our expectations. Moving forward, we expect our underlying G&A support to increase by about $2 million to $3 million in Q3 as we round out our organizational structure.","Assuming our current financial trends continue, I would expect stock compensation, including performance adjustments and higher bonus expenses to remain right around this $25 million for both Q3 and Q4. As it relates to legal reserves, we recorded $20 million in the quarter for estimated loss contingencies related to legal proceedings much of which relates to older cases and includes the previously disclosed government investigation that\u2019s been going on for about four years now \u2013 nearly four years.","We have a new General Counsel and legal team, we\u2019re taking a determined approach to resolving certain outstanding matters with the objective of putting these specific issues behind us wherever appropriate. But we still have work to do to bring final resolution of these matters, we believe this reserve is a reasonable estimate based on where we are today. And we\u2019ll update you as we have more information.","Continuing down the income statement, our effective tax rate was 26.6% on a GAAP basis and 23.9% on a non-GAAP basis. Included in both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rate is higher because of the possible non-deductibility of some of the legal reserves. For the remainder of 2019, we expect our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 26% to 29% range. So it may vary quarter-to-quarter based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remained strong with cash and investments totaling about $746 million. As of June 30, we\u2019ve repurchased $58 million of our stock at an average price of $703 per share during the quarter.","Similar to last quarter, even though there are fewer shares outstanding and trading as a result of these purchases, our diluted weighted average share has actually increased by 182,000 shares from Q1 as a result of more options being in the money given higher share price.","In closing, we\u2019re encouraged by our Q2 results and the progress we\u2019re making against our strategic growth initiatives that relate out about a year ago. Sustaining our sales momentum is the most important lever to our powerful economic model and that requires great execution and delivering an excellent guest experience. We\u2019re grateful to all of our team members for their hard work and their commitment and contributing to our vision of cultivating a better world.","And now we\u2019re happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now being the question-and-session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","David Tarantino","Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on a strong first half of the year. And Brian, you mentioned being in the early stages of a lot of the initiatives, and I guess the context of my question is related to the momentum you\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year. And I guess that won\u2019t be long before investors start worrying about your ability to cycle such big numbers as you move into next year and even the following year. So, I guess can you talk about how you think about the business recovering over the next year \u2013 to as you cycle these big numbers and how as you layer in what you have in the initiative pipeline, your degree of confidence and sustaining such positive comp momentum.","Brian Niccol","Yes, sure. Thanks, David. So yes, my point on why we\u2019re in the early stages of all these initiatives is very simple. We just launched a rewards program in March. We\u2019ve got five million members in there. This is a place that we\u2019re going to grow from. We\u2019re not done adding members to the rewards program. As you think about the digital ecosystem, we first started with installing digital make lines and we layered in the digital pickup shelves. So it will be even easier for the customer and then we layered in the rewards program.","And if you think about the awareness of this total system for our customers, we\u2019re still in the early days of those levels of awareness and utilization. So, I think there is opportunities to grow from where we are today on that front. And then as you think about really kind of revamping our marketing communication allocating those marketing dollars, you\u2019re really just now starting to see the marketing team utilized new communication vehicles and continue to fine tune the communication as it relates to Chipotle\u2019s real ingredients, real cooking, which results and we think really the best food out there.","And then the last piece is some of the innovation that we\u2019ve been working on our stage-gate process, all those things are still in its early days and in most cases, the only thing we brought out really is the Lifestyle Bowls to date. And then I\u2019d be remiss not to talk about all the great progress we\u2019re making on operations. If you think about where we were six months ago, a year ago or even two years ago, we are far better than we were. And I\u2019m confident that team is focused on the right things to be better, six months from now, 12 months from now, two years from now. So, still very much early days.","We\u2019re delighted to see the response that we\u2019re getting to the digital system. The response that we\u2019re getting, I would say better operations with more consistent better tasting food that now is getting to be a bit faster. And then we\u2019re very optimistic about how we can grow from here. We had this reward system and also the future as it relates to innovations, as it relates to the menu and or how the market. So delighted to see the response to date, but this is just the beginning. This is how I would categorize it.","David Tarantino","Sounds good. And on the rewards program, can you elaborate on what you learn to date in terms of your ability to change behavior with that program or incentive behavior with that program. I think I\u2019m a member of the program. And I don\u2019t even recall seeing any incentives throughout the quarter. So just wondering how you\u2019re using that and what you\u2019re learning so far.","Brian Niccol","Well, we have you blocked, David. But\u2026","David Tarantino","That\u2019s [indiscernible]. No, I\u2019m just kidding. Totally kidding.","Brian Niccol","Yes. So, look we are early days in this and we obviously are breaking this up into various cohorts and we\u2019re trying to experiment with each of those cohorts to understand if you, incentivize them with points on certain days of the week or certain add-ons, what type of behavioral changes do we see. And the good news is, we\u2019ve done a couple. We\u2019ve not done a whole lot and the thing to keep in mind is you know last quarter where were we, I think two million, three million people. This quarter, now we\u2019re closing on five million. So we\u2019re still refining the cohorts and then we\u2019re also experimenting with each of these cohorts to understand how that impacts their behavior.","With that all said, the few programs that we run, we\u2019ve been really pleased with our ability to influence behavior going forward. So as the population gets bigger in the rewards program and we get more fine-tuned on our cohorts, our goal is to then further drive behaviors that makes sense for the customer and then also makes sense for the Chipotle proposition. So early days, but we\u2019re very pleased with where we are right now.","David Tarantino","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","David Palmer","Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions on digital. It looks like your mix was up eight points from the prior year. How much do you think this mix increase is driving comps or how incremental you think it is? And over the next year, how do you think specifically I guess it relates to Tarantino\u2019s question, but how much do you think this digital lift can continue? And just thinking about this digital mix was up 2.5 points from the previous quarter, so it looks like that digital lift is increasing or accelerating, but of course we have more difficult comparisons as you think about things like loyalty coming up. So, any thoughts on that? Thanks.","Brian Niccol","Yes, sure. So look, we continued to understand all the \u2013 facets of how this digital business is coming to life. Right as it relates to order ahead, delivery and rewards. And then we also have about 16 restaurants now with Chipotlane where we\u2019ve added another access point for people that order ahead. And what I\u2019m delighted about is we see places where you\u2019re seeing the digital business achieved 30% and north of 30% and it is driven by just giving people more access building more awareness and giving them great experiences.","So we definitely are not, we think, at the top of where this is. We think there is still, lots of room for growth in all aspects of the digital business, our catering business continues to still be a relatively small piece of the order ahead business and we think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity on that front as well. So as we continue to build awareness, give people more access and get them to understand the occasions that they can use this access for, we\u2019ve been pleased to see where this business can get too and we\u2019ve got some evidence of getting north of 30%.","David Palmer","And do you think that, are you thinking about how much of that eight point mix is really adding to the comps you\u2019re seeing lately?","Brian Niccol","You mean the 18%?","David Palmer","Well the eight point increase or its 18% this quarter, but year-ago.","Brian Niccol","Versus year ago, versus the 10%you\u2019re talking about.","David Palmer","Yes. How you think about it?","Brian Niccol","Yes. So the good news is, as we\u2019ve talked about it, the component of this is delivery, which is highly incremental that\u2019s in the 70% range. I think is what we\u2019ve shared and what we continue to see and it appears to be pretty consistent with other people see. Our order ahead business not as incremental as our delivery business, but we\u2019re still continuing to see it be a very incremental piece on the business as well. So we\u2019re not breaking out exactly the contribution relative to the comp, but what I can tell you is, it continues to be an incremental piece of the business and it comes with a nice flow-through as well. So we love incrementally profitable transactions and that\u2019s what this digital business brings to the Chipotle business.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.","Nicole Miller","Thank you. Good afternoon. Two quick questions. The first is on marketing. So the 3% spend is relatively static year-over-year but dollars are up. So, I imagine impressions, weeks et cetera. The dollar spend is up. The question is fairly simple in that, the dollars are up and comps are up. So, what\u2019s the thought process behind increasing marketing spend above 3%? And depending on how you define your peer group, that could be another 100 basis point to fall in line with your peer group. Thanks.","Brian Niccol","Sure. So, I think obviously, this quarter, the spend was up. A part \u2013 a big reason for that is Chris and his team, I think, are smart about allocating our marketing dollars. Two communication vehicles that are going to be highly effective and there was more options available in this quarter for us to get the Chipotle message in front of our customers at the right time. And fortunately, we had the right communication there. The thing I will tell you is we are always evaluating whether or not we have the right spend and what we see today is we feel really good about the absolute dollars that we\u2019re spending and I think really what you\u2019re seeing more than anything else is the allocation of those dollars resulting in the brand being more visible with the right communication at the right time, which then is driving ultimately a purchase at Chipotle.","So, no plans in the near-term to go beyond that 3%. The other thing to keep in mind too Nicole is, as this business grows, the marketing budget grows with it, because it\u2019s 3% of now a much bigger business than it was six months a year ago and the marketing team is going to be really smart about how they allocate those additional dollars going forward, so that the brand continues to even being more visible and even more effective in its communication. So, really proud of the work that team has done. But I think we\u2019re still getting started on this one as well and there\u2019s a lot of creative things to come with the dollars that have been allocated to marketing today.","Nicole Miller","That\u2019s very helpful. I think what gets lost in the shuffle, can you \u2013 the comp is there is really just not much in a 3% of the spend and that would be one way if you ever wanted to look way out in the future to do it. So, that\u2019s very helpful. The second question is around your comments on digital and some stores being 30% mix, it\u2019d be pretty fascinating to understand anything you could share, this might not be the right metric, but the first thing that comes to mind is the AUV range. So, I\u2019m trying to understand clearly with the comp being what it is and the flow through. I don\u2019t think there is any question that it\u2019s incremental. So, would you characterize the AUV of those digital, high use digital stores as passed the system average maybe there higher at above the system or maybe there even at like what a prior peak used to be for the system. What does that look like?","Brian Niccol","Yes, what I can definitely share with you is they\u2019re above our average for sure. And I don\u2019t think we want to get into specifically talking about what the AUVs are, because some of that relates to the site-specific, but what I can definitely share with you is where the digital system is totally in place, meaning even adding a Chipotlane that\u2019s beyond the average unit volumes. And then even in the places without Chipotlane is above and beyond our average unit volumes, where you see this digital business play such a big percentage of the business. So, we feel great about continuing to drive that digital business to a higher percent. Because it is incremental, which then results in these higher average unit volumes that we\u2019re seeing across our system.","Nicole Miller","Thank you for the time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good afternoon. I just have to say I did get an incentive through rewards. So, I\u2019m pleased to be in a different cohort than David. So\u2026","Brian Niccol","You know what that means. That means that you are a light user.","Sharon Zackfia","I think, currently, he is going to block me as we\u2019re talking. So, on the delivery side of the equation. I guess just given the success you\u2019ve had with DoorDash and it sounds like very little overlap between what DoorDash is doing and what you\u2019re getting through your own app. I mean how do you think about opening that opportunity to other third-party delivery providers. Is that something you\u2019re exploring? And then it seems as if the digital cadence didn\u2019t slow at all after you lap the DoorDash agreement in May. And if you could just talk about, if that was in fact the case that maintained its momentum.","Brian Niccol","Yes. So, to answer your first question. We\u2019ve got a great relationship with DoorDash. We do today also provide delivery with Postmates and Tapingo. So, it\u2019s not exclusive however DoorDash and Chipotle, I think have done a nice job of marketing the delivery channel. And we\u2019ve got a great relationship in place with that team. And as you mentioned, we lapse our DoorDash partnership pretty successfully. And one of the things that I\u2019m really excited about seeing is, it does continue to show up in the data that those that use our in app delivery experience are not the same people that are using the third-party app experience.","The other thing that I\u2019m also really excited about is there are a lot of people on these third-party platforms that still have not gotten to try Chipotle delivery. Even though Chipotle is one of their top delivery partners, there is lots of runway with people that are using these aggregator sites to still have an opportunity to experience the Chipotle delivery experience. So, lots of runway, even in the partnerships we have in place. And then as I think about our digital business as it grows and we generate more awareness about the occasion, I\u2019m very optimistic about how we grow from here going forward.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay. Thank you.","Brian Niccol","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Sara Senatore","Great. Thank you. I had a question about the product launches, and then a follow-up on the digital mix. Just on the \u2013 you were talking about Carne Asada being well received and looking to Quesadilla as \u2013 getting the ops right there. I mean, I think in \u2013 my question has to do with, is the goal to sort of prevent menu fatigue, is it to bring in new customers. Is it to drive incrementality in a \u2013 the given quarter that you launch it. Is there anything you can tell us about to the extent that you\u2019re seeing successful test? How that\u2019s translating into new or incremental traffic? And how do you think about that in the context of, I think people in general are creatures of habit and a lot of people probably order the same things over and over again anyway. So, any color on that? And then like I said, I have a follow-up on the digital mix.","Brian Niccol","Sure. So, to answer your question on the menu innovation, we view it as \u2013 it should be able to drive incremental sales transactions. The reason why is because it does give people an experience that they don\u2019t get out of their every day experience. So, it gives them a reason to either come more often or maybe come and try us for the first time. And as we do these tests, that\u2019s what we\u2019re really trying to understand. How much of this is, hey, this is just among our existing user that\u2019s coming more often, because we\u2019ve now added another occasion form. Or you know what we\u2019ve now peak somebody\u2019s interest that has never had the opportunity to try Chipotle in the past. And Carne Asada is a great example, where we\u2019ve actually gotten the request of both non-users of Chipotle and users of Chipotle to say, how can you guys never do Carne Asada?","Now whether or not, it stays on the menu permanently. there\u2019s a lot of things that go into that decision. And that\u2019s why we keep these things into our test long enough, so that we can understand how is it perfect behave both new with marketing and then just on a sustained basis as part of the menu. And then things like the Quesadilla, it adds another level of validation, because it cannot have a negative impact on our throughput. But things like Quesadillas and Nachos; those are clearly things that both, again, users and non-users of Chipotle have said, well that would really make the brand, the restaurant experience even more attractive, so that I could come more often. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re experimenting with these things. And that\u2019s why we use the stage-gate process. So, we can understand that balancing act between incrementality among existing users as well as bringing in new users.","Sara Senatore","Great. Thank you. And then just on the \u2013 I know you said you\u2019re not breaking out the contribution, the comp from the different types of digital ordering. But is it fair to assume that at least some of the growth came from mobile order and pay. The reason I ask is, because of one, the extent to which, when you see people actually coming into the store, maybe, that\u2019s an opportunity to engage with them and versus delivery. And then two, of course, I think they are very different margin profiles, insofar as mobile order and pay I think is probably the highest margin and delivery is lower. So, if you could just maybe talk about that either even qualitatively, the mobile order and pay versus the delivery?","Brian Niccol","Yes, sure. So, yes, obviously, it contributed to our comp growth, right. I mean the thing that\u2019s wonderful about this digital business is its incremental transactions with higher ticket. So, we\u2019re picking up more ticket and that is true, both in the order ahead business as well as the delivery business. Now, obviously, the order ahead business has even better economics, because we don\u2019t have to deal with the aspect of the delivery cost. But both are proving to be incremental, both are contributing to the comp and we\u2019re very bullish on how we can drive this going forward.","Sara Senatore","Okay. Thank you.","Brian Niccol","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Brian, as you look at your digital mix across your fleet of stores, how \u2013 is it a normal distribution? Is it more skewed as you might think to more urban markets, more affluent markets? Or is it really across the breadth of your stores? And I guess the comment is on digital, but also in delivery specifically, how evenly distributed or not, is that business for you?","Brian Niccol","Yes. You know what \u2013 it\u2019s actually fairly evenly distributed. You don\u2019t have certain spikes in some of those areas that you mentioned, it\u2019s fairly evenly distributed, John.","John Glass","That\u2019s helpful. Can you talk about also throughput, maybe update us on the metrics you\u2019re looking at for throughput. You said there is \u2013 it\u2019s improving, but there is still opportunity. And in particular, the digital make line is accounting for, and I\u2019m rounding up nearly 20% of your sales, is that executing as you would expect? Or do you need to tweak that as the volumes are growing faster there? Maybe, one time expected and you need more capacity there? Or is it \u2013 is it still underutilized in this headroom?","Brian Niccol","Yes. So, the \u2013 first, I\u2019ll answer the question, just in general on throughput. The teams have made really great progress on throughput. We are halfway through the year. I think we mentioned in our prior call that we have \u2013 the teams are incentivized in their bonus based on throughput targets and then even to the point now where we will provide accrued bonus assuming they\u2019re able to hit there both throughput targets, food safety targets and the other key operating metrics that we ask the team to hit. but I think the thing that\u2019s really been powerful is Scott has got the operational organization just focused on a critical few items. It\u2019s these tasks have a great team \u2013 have a great leader, which results in great culture. That\u2019s number one. He has got them focused on.","Number two. Great food, taste the food, know how to make the food and do it right, every single time. Throughput, we now have the dashboard in place, we\u2019re showing the teams what is the difference between having the five pillars in place versus not having the five pillars in place and we\u2019re seeing nice results on that front. And then obviously, a culture of food safety has to be evident in everything that we do, since we\u2019re handling real ingredients with real cooking techniques every single day. So, all of it is working together and I give Scott and a lot of our ATDs a lot of credit, because they are really getting after one best way of execution and then holding themselves accountable against that execution.","So, I think we\u2019re going to continue to see better progress on operations going forward. And we look at this every day and you know this, the restaurant business, the retail business is an everyday business. And that\u2019s the type of focus that we have. Every day, we want to be better than we were the day before. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting after on the throughput, team stability, great food and then obviously, all in a food safe environment. So, on your question regarding the digital make line, the good news is, we have plenty of capacity. Capacity is not our issue. If anything, we just have to learn how to execute better on that second make line. Some new metrics are important for us, right.","On the front line, we\u2019ve never had to worry about accuracy. Because the reality is, I\u2019m interacting with you and you get exactly what you want as you move down the line. Now, we\u2019ve moved to a place, where you order, you pick it up and go, and then you open it up, and that\u2019s the moment of truth of whether or not it\u2019s accurate, everything is there, is it hot? And the good news is, the food is hot, because we make it really quick. The deliveries are really fast. And we\u2019re learning our way to become even more accurate.","So, some things that we\u2019re learning, so that we could be better with that off-premise experience. But all in all, plenty of capacity, customers really love having the additional access, both on-premise and off-premise. And then as I mentioned, I think the in-store operation is just really, really continuing to improve and much better than we were six months ago or even a year ago.","John Glass","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Andy Barish","Hey, guys, one quick sales question and then an expense question. Any commentary you\u2019re willing to share just on sort of cadence given you were lapping. During the 2Q, given you were lapping the DoorDash launch and the launch of For Real advertising and then the start of the 3Q here.","Brian Niccol","Yes, Andy from a dollar standpoint, our sales were even throughout the quarter and then they continued through \u2013 the trends continued through July. You did see a difference in the comp percentage as we moved from April to May and June, because we are comparing against the things that you mentioned. But from a dollar standpoint, we still see nice underlying strength and that continued into end of July as well.","Andy Barish","Okay. And then can you give us a quick update, Jack. I think you mentioned that the $2 million of food cost saves, was that just a continuation of what you \u2013 what you saw in the first quarter, is that $2 million incremental? And then just more broadly from an organizational perspective, obviously, given the numbers you\u2019re putting up right now, cost saves efficiencies are kind of happening on their own, but are there some efforts that may bear some fruit as we look out to 2020 more on the peer cost save side of things.","Jack Hartung","Yes. Andy, the $2 million is incremental on top of the run rate that we reported in the first quarter. And the team does continue to look at opportunities and there are a number of opportunities, Andy. So, I fully expect that we\u2019ll be talking about greater savings, especially as we move to the end of this year and into 2020.","Andy Barish","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","John Ivankoe","Hi, thank you. In the past, we\u2019ve talked about the ability to take price to the extent that there was any cost pressure whether from commodities or labor or anything else. Is 2% pricing the right thing for this brand, especially, looking at some of the absolute pricing of Chipotle versus some peers, which have obviously gotten higher. How much pricing do you think you have at this point that you could take to the extent that you needed to, that wouldn\u2019t have spend as current \u2013 excuse me, that wouldn\u2019t influence your current rate of customer traffic?","Brian Niccol","Yes. So, we\u2019ve taken the approach on pricing that we don\u2019t want to be overly aggressive with it. I loved about the value proposition that we present today. Because as you mentioned a lot of other people that are doing real ingredients, real cooking, their prices are significantly higher than Chipotle and it just puts us in a very nice position, where if we need to take pricing. We have the pricing power to do it, but we want to be very judicious and when we choose to do it. And the good news for us is we see no reason to go beyond the 2% right now. But we\u2019ve also learned that we definitely have room to price beyond 2% if necessary. And if the environment mandates that, then we will do it accordingly.","John Ivankoe","Okay, thank you. And that\u2019s just a quick modeling question. Your G&A in the second quarter look to have taken a step-down. Is that the new run rate in G&A per operating week; however, you want to look at it or was there anything unusual in the second quarter regarding G&A expense?","Brian Niccol","Yes. that\u2019s close to a normal run rate. But keep in mind; we\u2019ve had a lot of things happening in the last year in terms of closing restaurants, which means you accelerate depreciation for a while, same with your offices. So, I think we\u2019re to more of a normal depreciation. but keep in mind as we open up new restaurants, especially, because we talked about opening up a heavy load in the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll see that in the fourth quarter as those stores open. You\u2019ll see some incremental additions to our depreciation and amortization at that time.","John Ivankoe","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Two questions just one specifically on the commodity front, I\u2019m wondering whether you can offer any color in terms of what basket inflation you\u2019re seeing today. I mean it sounds like you\u2019re saying pork is not an issue in coming quarters. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any directional trends you could offer whether you think there is some upward pressure expect as we look to 2020. It seems like that\u2019s what the industry is talking about. But I get the impression you perhaps don\u2019t see it the same way. And then I had one follow-up?","Brian Niccol","Yes, Jeff. Avocados is the inflation story that we\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s not really sustained inflation. It\u2019s more of a cyclical thing; it\u2019s a supply and demand out of balance right now. We expect that to become more normal. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll necessarily get back to the prices that we paid in the first quarter this year, but it should drop from what we saw in Q2.","We\u2019re seeing a little bit in dairy. We saw that is unique to us a little bit in Cilantro. But these are very, very minor and manageable items. We don\u2019t see or we\u2019re not anticipating anything significant with any of our proteins that could change between now and the end of the year. But right now, it looks like \u2013 it looks like other than avocados, the commodities are behaving.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. And then as we talk about kind of the outlook from an earnings perspective, I mean I understand the comp visibility you have based on the guidance you provided. but obviously, the earnings growth is critical. As you look to the back half of the year, any other changes you would expect, I mean, just not sure if you think the comps are maybe going to ease a little bit as you suggest on a tough compares, would you expect restaurant margin expansion to moderate, like how you\u2019re thinking about the puts and takes in the back half of the year with what seems like some very strong comp momentum and how that might flow through the earnings?","Brian Niccol","Yes. on a year-over-year basis, if you\u2019re talking about a high single-digit comp versus a 10% comp. Yes, you\u2019re going to see a different margin leverage than that. And yet, Jeff, you can walk through the modeling to see what that would look like. But remember we had pretty strong margin at the end of last year. I would say the biggest wild card in terms of our margin potential is avocados. If avocados normalize, avocados increased by about 150 basis points, which is from Q1 to Q2. So, imagine if that comes back to us or a half of that comes back to us. Our margin potential gets much greater as avocados normalize. We have a shop that next year avocados could be more plentiful, a number of avocados kind of go in this every other year. next year should be a more plentiful year and I will see if it actually materializes. But I would say that\u2019s the biggest wild card.","In terms of our flow through, we\u2019re really happy with the flow through that we\u2019ve seen with the comp that we\u2019ve gotten. If you do see a \u2013 or as you do see a lower comp, the flow through year-over-year is going to be somewhat less. But we think we\u2019ll still see some nice flow through based on the contribution margin that we earn.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Nice to hear, avocado is the bigger issue than labor. That\u2019s a positive sign looking to 2020. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead with your question.","Will Slabaugh","Yes. I think I just had a follow-up on the throughput comment that Brian you said earlier in your prepared remarks. Did you put any context around that in terms of where you are today versus you were previously, I guess the bottom as well. And then what you see as an opportunity going forward?","Brian Niccol","I couldn\u2019t hear the first part of your question, I\u2019m sorry.","Will Slabaugh","Yes. Sure, just to comment on throughput and you mentioned that in your current market, throughput, wondering if you could put some context around that in terms of where you are and what the opportunity is going forward.","Brian Niccol","Sure. So, I think we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, where today, we\u2019re kind of in the mid-20s. In our peak throughput performance, we\u2019re kind of in the mid to low-30s. And I think the thing that I\u2019m excited about is the team is really focused on getting ourselves from that mid-20s to high-20s and then how this works. Once we get the high-20s, we\u2019ll be looking at low-30s. So that\u2019s what I mean by \u2013 we\u2019ve got terrific focus and we\u2019re seeing progress, and then you have these moments where people achieve something and then we\u2019re able to share that with everybody else in the organization, so that the throughput machine really starts to get going and people realize what\u2019s possible. So that\u2019s where we are today. We\u2019re definitely making progress on that mid-20 number and then once we move beyond kind of the mid-20s, high-20s, we\u2019ll be zeroing in on the low-30s.","Will Slabaugh","Great. thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference call back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.","Brian Niccol","Okay. Thanks, everybody. And apologies for the technical difficulties that got us rolling, but we\u2019ve got it all sorted out and really appreciate you all taking the time to listen and ask questions. Obviously, very proud of our results, very proud of the team and very proud of what\u2019s happening in our restaurants.","As I mentioned in our call, we\u2019ve got some very specific strategies that we\u2019re focused on around marketing, digital, operations and really using the stage-gate process on innovation. We\u2019re in the early days on a lot of these initiatives. We\u2019re delighted by the customer response we\u2019ve seen to date and we\u2019re delighted by the performance we\u2019re seeing in our restaurants today. And I look forward to sharing where we are next quarter with you all, on this journey for Chipotle to really cultivate a better world. So, thank you everybody and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be in touch.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

All participants are now in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you.","I would now like to introduce Investor Relations Manager for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Mr. Mark Alexee. You may begin your conference.","Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter 2015, it may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements about potential business improvements, and shareholder returns, projections of the number of restaurants we intend to open and trends and development costs and new restaurant returns, estimates of future comparable restaurant sales increases or comps, and supply chain and other trends affecting future comps, projections regarding food, labor, marketing, occupancy and G&A costs, and our expected effective tax rate, statements about stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.","These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated on our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. I'd like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter, it will begin December 1 and continue through our fourth quarter and year-end earnings release planned for late January 2016.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Mark Crumpacker, Chief Creative and Development Officer and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mark. I'm pleased with our performance during the third quarter and throughout the full year. With very difficult comparisons against the record year we had in 2014, we have continued to grow our business in a competitive environment while maintaining some of the best margins in the industry.","During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 12%, on comparable restaurant sales growth of 2.6% and the opening of 53 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.59 per share, an increase of 11%. With year-to-date revenue of $3.5 billion, comp sales growth of 5.5%, and earnings per share growth of 26%, we are well on track to deliver another strong year. More than that, I am proud of the fact that we continued to deliver such strong results by maintaining true to our vision to change the way people think about any fast food. We're realizing this vision through constant attention to our unique food and people cultures and by innovating to improve upon these key drivers of our business even in the face of challenges.","During the quarter, we made significant strides to overcome a major obstacle tied to our ability to obtain pork that meets all of our animal welfare standards. Earlier this month, we announced that we have returned carnitas to 90% of our restaurants nationwide. As discussed on the last earnings call, we have begun to source pork from Karro Foods in the UK. It is raised in a way that meets or exceeds all of our animal welfare standards.","Just like our current protocols, Karro does not use antibiotics non-therapeutically to promote growth in healthy animals. Karro follows European standards that allows antibiotics to be administered under veterinary supervision when necessary. We have been very happy with the quality of the pork they've been providing and the care and respect with which Karro is treating their animals. Since beginning our relationship with Karro, we have also secured an additional pork supplier and we expect to have enough pork to return carnitas to all of our restaurants by the end of November.","We know that many of our customers love our carnitas, and we are disappointed we had to stop serving it in a number of our restaurants around the country. To all of our customers who have been inconvenienced by our carnitas shortage, I'd like to personally thank you for your patience and your support. We knew this issue would be difficult for our customers and our restaurants, but we also knew that suspending sales of carnitas in some of our restaurants rather than serving commodity pork was the right thing to do. And we are thrilled to see that so many of our loyal customers agreed with our decision. After highlighting this issue, we have begun discussions with a number of additional suppliers across the country that are interested in working with us to improve animal welfare conditions and meet the standards we require for our pork.","I am so excited about this encouraging change, particularly when compared to the reaction we received when starting our Food With Integrity program a little more than 15 years ago. At that time, there was very little pork available that met our requirements. But today, some of the largest agricultural producers are taking a much closer look at the way they raise their animals, and they're starting to see that we have what we have always believed, that food grown and raised with respect for animals, the environment, farmers and customers simply taste better. We are excited to be close to returning to carnitas to 100% of our restaurants. And to let our customers know that carnitas is back, we have been promoting its return in our restaurants through social media and with PR, so customers who have been awaiting this return know where it is available.","Of course, changing the way people think about and eat fast food requires more than overcoming supply chain challenges. We focus a lot of our marketing effort on educating customers through entertaining and creative approaches, which Mark will talk about a little bit later. And we're delighted that we continue to see evidence of Chipotle's impact on food issues. Most recently, the state of California passed SB 27, making it the first state in the country to pass legislation to limit antibiotic use in healthy livestock and to ban the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth.","We began serving meat from animals raised without the use of antibiotics in 1999 when we started serving pork from Niman Ranch. Today, we serve more meat from animals raised without antibiotics than any other restaurant company. While we have been encouraged by even small steps made by other restaurant companies to reduce antibiotic use in farming and moves from some of the largest meat producers to embrace antibiotic-free practices or reduce antibiotic protocols. The California bill is important as it is the first to mandate more responsible antibiotic use in livestock. This is an important step forward in the evolution of animal agriculture, and we hope that others will take similar steps in the foreseeable future.","During the quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London, a small five-day-per-week location in the financial district, which is intensely lunch-driven, like our first stores inside the Loop in Chicago. It is off to a solid start and has been breaking peak hour throughput records in the UK. Additionally, just last week, we opened our fourth restaurant in Paris, entering a new neighborhood for us. Our growth seeds in Europe continue to build brand recognition and are at the frontend of developing a loyal customer base.","Our growth seeds here in the U.S. continue to show promise, and we have continued to expand ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. ShopHouse recently opened its fourth location in Los Angeles, bringing the total number of ShopHouse restaurants to 11. And we plan to open two ShopHouse restaurants in Chicago before yearend. Pizzeria Locale expanded to its second market during the most recent quarter, opening its first restaurant in Kansas City and we plan to open two Pizzerias in Cincinnati in the coming months, very exciting to apply our strong food culture and our unique and empowering people culture to these growth seeds. We are changing the way people think about and eat fast food and our commitment to that vision is the best way to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders.","Last, we recently hired our first-ever Chief Information Officer. Curt Garner will be joining Chipotle on November 23 and comes from Starbucks where he held the same position. In his 18 years at Starbucks, Curt helped build the technology infrastructure that began with fewer than 2,000 stores to one that now supports a global business. We believe that Curt's background and expertise will be a great asset to Chipotle as we continue to seek ways to accelerate our use of technology to help strengthen our business. We are very excited for Curt to join us and look forward to the value he will bring to Chipotle.","I will now turn the call over to Monty.","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Thank you, Steve. Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we're setting ourselves up to be able to provide a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience, while also maintaining a strong unit economic model. Like our food culture, building the right people culture is an ongoing journey and is one that requires us to constantly push ourselves to find ways to get better and to raise the bar on the quality of the experience we provide.","During the quarter, we hosted our biennial field leadership conference to bring together all of our field leaders and support departments to talk about how we can strengthen our culture. It was a wonderful and inspirational two days focused on how our field leaders can make a bigger impact in their restaurants and help our teams on the road to Restaurateur. We discussed the importance of instilling an inspiring vision, creating encouraging circumstances, and how to best utilize our diagnosis and plan tools to identify negative themes that are standing in the way of a restaurant achieving Restaurateur status.","Our unique people culture also continues to gain traction within our growth seeds. As Steve mentioned, during the third quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London and I recently visited the fantastic team there and was pleased to be able to sign them off as Restaurateur. Our European operations team, which is led by Jacob Sumner, a team leader and Restaurateur, has been building outstanding teams to ensure the customer experience we are providing in these new markets meets our high standards and he continues to develop Restaurateur cultures in these restaurants quickly.","To help us better plan for future growth, we recently hired Jerome Tafani as our Head of European Business Development. Jerome has decades of restaurant industry experience in Europe and is spearheading our planning process, including navigating the nuances of operating a new restaurant brand across several countries and identifying lower-cost real state options in markets that are very expensive. As European customers continue to discover and turn into repeat customers at Chipotle, we are excited for the leadership and insight that Jacob and Jerome bring and we look forward to great things to come from this team.","As of the end of the quarter, we are proud to have a strong roster of nearly 500 Restaurateurs with an additional 30 restaurants ready to be signed off by an officer. Our past investment in field leadership is beginning to bear fruit and we're confident those improved restaurant cultures will lead to better service and a more compelling experience for our customers. Beyond our efforts to strengthen our restaurant leadership, we recently took a very visible step towards bolstering the bench strength in our restaurants as we held our first-ever National Career Day in September.","We set ambitious goals to interview more than 30,000 candidates for this, and through the event and surrounding publicity, we ended up hiring 4,977 incremental crew members. Not only are we excited about our new hires, but this event also created a significant opportunity for us to showcase our people culture and the unique career opportunities we provide. Although, the overall labor market continues to show signs of tightening, we have found that top performers are consistently attracted to the challenging work environment and growth potential offered at Chipotle.","One of the leadership roles within our restaurants is the reliance on what we refer to as a take-out specialist, whose job it is to take care of our out-of-store orders, which are a growing part of our business. As you may know, virtually every one of our restaurants is equipped with a second make line, which is an abbreviated version of the front line where we serve our regular customers. Fortunately, those second make lines are gradually getting more used and we're now averaging nearly $500 a day in sales per restaurant on the second make-line company-wide.","In some of our high-volume restaurants, the sales in the second make line are much, much higher; such that it is virtually a second restaurant within the restaurant, which is a phenomenal way for us to leverage our existing kitchens. When we receive online fax or catering orders, the take-out specialist is managing the timing of orders, food production, and all other aspects of the guest experience and preparing the orders to be picked up. Not only is the sales channel exciting, but it offers the additional benefit of improving throughput as the more people who use the second make line, the better the customer experience is for the rest of our customers who can more quickly receive and enjoy their meal.","During the third quarter, our teams increased throughput during our peak dinner hour by one transaction while non-peak throughput counts increased by nine transactions. Unfortunately, we declined by one transaction during our peak lunch hour and our teams will be working on instilling a sense of urgency to continue to improve this important aspect of customer service during the peak lunch hour. We know that as our volumes continue to grow, our teams need to continue to achieve incremental throughput gains to improve the overall customer experience. Better throughput is one key driver that helps us improve our unit economic model and over the years has contributed to some of our best cash-on-cash returns.","Another component for a terrific return on investment is the great job that our development team has done in identifying locations for new restaurants while maintaining reasonable capital investment costs. We've built a fantastic development program as our real estate, design, and construction teams are finding favorable new restaurant sites and negotiating some of our best lease terms. During the quarter, we opened up 53 new restaurants for a total of 150 restaurants through the first nine months of this year. This is the fastest that we've ever added new stores and we're not done yet. Our teams have been working diligently and we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2015 to a range of 215 to 225 new Chipotles.","What's even more encouraging is that we're able to complete these restaurants in what is arguably one of the most competitive real estate markets we've seen in recent years. Our teams have given us feedback that the competition for new site locations remains high and the demand for talented contractors, subcontractors, and crews is intense as many developers are taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment. Despite these pressures, we continue to focus on identifying an optimal mix of endcap and inline restaurants that have actually allowed us to lower our average investment cost.","Also, Chipotle remains a preferred tenant for many landlords, and that places us in a strong position to negotiate favorable lease and tenant improvement terms. It also helps us get into properties even where demand is very high. As we think about 2016 new unit development, we expect to open new restaurants at an even faster pace and are currently projecting a range of 220 to 235 new restaurants for next year.","I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative and Development Officer","Thank you, Monty. During the quarter we continued our efforts to educate consumers about issues in food and our unique food culture through innovative marketing programs. In our promotion we called Friend or Faux, we challenged consumers to identify real friendly ingredients that align with our Food With Integrity vision and foe ingredients, artificial flavors, preservatives and additives by comparing our food to a representative set of food meals, such as burgers, sub sandwiches, and pizzas that are often manufactured with highly processed ingredients. People who played the game could win a buy one get one offer at Chipotle simply by comparing what's in our food against what's in traditional fast food.","The idea for this promotion was to show the simplicity of Chipotle's food, all of which is classically prepared from just 68 ingredients across our entire menu compared to typical fast food where a single menu item can have upwards of 100 ingredients, many of which are chemical additives. The program launched in July and consumer participation exceeded our expectations with more than 750,000 people playing the game within the first 24 hours. In total, the program generated an average of 180,000 page views a day, totaling 7.5 million views over the duration of the program.","The campaign message was clear with a large majority of respondents in a follow-up survey saying that they understood the intent a Friend or Faux, and that already positive views of Chipotle were strengthened by the program with three-quarters of respondents saying that it made them more interested in eating at Chipotle. And although sales did increase with these promotions in July, our long-term goal remains to engage our customers and educate them about the quality and simplicity of our food.","We also introduced a retro style video game called Taste Invaders as another entertaining way to point out to customers some of the artificial ingredients found in typical fast food. The game, which is referred to as a galactic battle against artificial ingredients, has been played more than 2 million times and provides another creative path to learn more about the food Chipotle serves compared to the vast majority of other chain restaurants.","We also continued to advertise nationwide throughout the summer months using traditional online, radio and outdoor media. Our goal to educate customers about where our food comes from and the simplicity of our ingredients is also being carried over to our annual burrito promotion and fundraiser this month. Because we've always believed that artificial ingredients simply aren't necessary for delicious flavorful food, we are asking our customers to add something unnecessary to their costumes October 31 in order to qualify for a $3 burrito. Burrito has become a favorite promotion for our customers and we expect will contribute $1 million to benefit the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation.","Increasingly, our customers are ordering using their iPhone and Android devices or visiting our website to order online, and we continue to make improvements to enhance and simplify those user experiences. Our mobile and online sales continued to grow for the seventh consecutive quarter and currently represent more than 5% of topline sales, up more than 40% over last year. As we move forward, further investments in those platforms will be made with an eye toward developing tools and technologies to help our restaurant teams better manage and execute our out of store orders. Over the next year, we will also continue to improve and simplify our customers' ability to order their meals online. These investments are still at an early stage, but we believe that they will help us increase the quality of the experience for our guests ordering out of store and will help us grow this promising piece of our business.","We've also added a new delivery partnership for customers who prefer that convenience. Ahead of the fall semester at colleges and universities across the country, we entered into a delivery partnership with Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses and that is already well-liked and widely used. We are now delivering to 40 major campuses across the country through this partnership. Because it's so tailored to students, Tapingo service includes additional conveniences such as the ability to partner with university payment programs and deliver to dorm rooms and school buildings. Tapingo marks our third delivery partnership and collectively these valued delivery partners enable us to offer a delivery service throughout much of the country.","Customers also continued to discover our catering. As of tomorrow, it will be two years since we rolled out catering options on a national level, which is available everywhere with the exception of New York City. And while we continue to gain traction in catering, we know there is still work to be done. Part of that work is to test and ultimately roll out an online platform that will allow customers to order and pay for their catering in advance and ultimately to have those orders delivered.","Setting up delivery for catering is not a simple task, however, particularly when you consider that many of our catering orders are intended to serve up to 200 people. That's a lot of food to be delivered hot, fresh, and delicious in a way that meets our high standards and reflects positively on our brand. So we're going to need a partner that has the scale, reach, and capability to deliver those large orders. And so we'll be carefully pursuing potential partners and hope to have trials complete in late 2016.","I'll now turn the call over to Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Mark. Overall, we're pleased with the continued strength of our business during the third quarter despite lapping historically high same-store sales comparisons in 2014. We continue to grow our comps this quarter by 2.6%, which is on top of last year's comp of 19.8%, our highest as a public company. We're able to continue to grow even as our restaurants are now achieving volumes of more than $2.5 million on average, all of which can only be accomplished by having top-performing crews and management teams in place that are driven to create an exceptional dining experience for our customers.","Overall sales for the quarter were up 12% to $1.2 billion driven by new restaurant openings and a 2.6% comp. Year-to-date sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of 15% over 2014. Our comp increase during the quarter was driven by a 1.9% increase in customer visits, which accelerated from the second quarter. Increasingly, more customers are connecting with our vision and they appreciate the real food made from wholesome, delicious ingredients using classic cooking techniques, and they appreciate that all of that just tastes better.","Our sales comps were highest in July when our Friend or Faux campaign was in full force, but were lower in August and September. We were happy with the customer response and engagement with Friend or Faux during July as our customers who played the game learned about our simple wholesome ingredients and were treated to a BOGO for playing.","During the third quarter, we also began implementing a targeted menu price increase on steak and barbacoa due to the sustained beef inflation and we will continue to roll this increase out across the remaining markets during the fourth quarter. This price increase is expected to contribute about 130 basis points when fully rolled out, and for the third quarter, this targeted menu price increase contributed about 70 basis points to the comp.","Traffic trends during the first few weeks of October so far have been pretty choppy but overall, they're averaging about the same as what we saw during August and September, so slightly lower than the overall 2.6% comp in Q3. With the recent return of carnitas to 90% in our restaurants and expectation of getting that to 100% soon, we would expect Q4 comps will be similar to what we saw in Q3. For the full year, we continue to expect our overall comp will be in a low to mid-single-digits, and as we look to 2016, we expect the comps will remain in the low single digits.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.59, an increase of 11%, and year-to-date earnings per share was $12.92, a 26% increase over 2014. With 2,000 restaurants on the horizon and our restaurants currently achieving record volumes, we are very confident about what lies ahead as we continue toward our vision to change what people think about and eat fast food. Restaurant level margins during the quarter were 28.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points as higher labor and marketing costs were partially offset by lower food costs.","Food costs were 33% in the quarter, down 10 basis point sequentially from Q2 and down 130 basis points compared to 2014. The decrease from the prior year was largely driven by lower costs for avocados and dairy, offset by sustained inflation for beef. We saw minimal inflation for the rest of our food during the quarter and we expect our food costs to stay in line with recent results through the end of the year. Our pricing for avocados has benefited this year as robust supply from Mexico has helped to keep prices down, while dairy prices remained low due to strong production and increased domestic supplies, a strong U.S. dollar has reduced dairy exports.","For 2016, we expect food cost inflation will be relatively flat, and our food cost could decrease slightly depending on what happens to our beef costs. U.S. herd count for beef cattle continues to build and we may see some relief in the cost of naturally raised beef late in 2016.","Labor costs were 22.2% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from last year, and year-to-date labor costs were up 40 basis points. After our last call in July, we made significant progress in reducing our labor cost inefficiencies and returned to what we would consider to be normal labor management and scheduling practices. This resulted in Q3 labor being lower than Q2 by 40 basis points. Labor de-leveraged versus last year by 100 basis points as a result of wage inflation, with our hourly wages up nearly 5% over last year, along with the cost of adding enhanced benefits such as tuition reimbursement, paid sick leave, and increased paid vacation for our hourly restaurant employees as we discussed during our Q2 earnings call.","Going forward, we expect labor to be slightly higher than Q3 in the fourth quarter during the seasonally lower sales period. Occupancy costs were flat in the quarter compared to last year, and as Monty mentioned, we're lowering our overall development costs, which will further strengthen our unit economic model. Other operating costs were 11.1% in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year, largely due to the timing of our marketing and promotions this year, including our Friend or Faux game and the increased spending surrounding summer advertising to keep Chipotle top of mind.","Marketing was 1.5% of sales in the quarter, up 20 basis points from last year, and is expected to decline slightly in the fourth quarter. Promotion costs were 90 basis points during the quarter, up from 50 basis points last year. For 2016, we anticipate marketing expenses remain right around 1.5% to 1.6% of sales.","G&A expenses were 5.8% during the quarter, down 80 basis points from the prior year and remember that 2014 included our biennial All Managers Conference, which also will occur in 2016. The conference cost around $10 million in 2014 and is expected to cost around $12 million in 2016. Lower stock-based compensation expense and lower bonus costs are also benefiting G&A for the quarter and for the year-to-date.","Our non-cash, non-economic stock comp expense was $20.7 million in the quarter, down slightly from last. And for the first nine months, stock comp expense was $58.6 million, down from $83 million last year, and we expect the full-year charge this year will be about $78 million.","During 2016, we expect our G&A, including stock-based comp, to grow at slower rate than sales, before considering the impact of the All Managers Conference. Stock comp for 2016 will depend on the stock price at the time of the grants and the number and the types of equity awards issued. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, and we expect our effective full-year tax rate to also be 38.7%, and that compares to 37.6% for the full year of 2014.","The tax rate in 2014 benefited from an increase in the estimate of useful state tax credits and from the work opportunity and the R&D federal tax credit, which have not been renewed by Congress for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points and our effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to remain at around 38.7%.","During the quarter, we repurchased about $30 million of our stock or approximately 46,000 shares at an average share price of $670. At the end of the third quarter, we had $155 million remaining on our share buyback program. We finished the quarter with $1.58 billion in cash and cash equivalents with no debt on the balance sheet and we continue to believe that the best use of cash is to invest in (28:15) opening our high-returning Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. and we'll continue to nurture our growth seed, including ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale, and our international Chipotle restaurants so they will become a compelling use of capital in the future. In the meantime, we'll continue to repurchase shares of our stock opportunistically to enhance shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today. And we'll be happy to open the lines for any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. So, just two questions, Jack. I guess on the carnitas, have you been seeing a bump then when carnitas returns to the restaurants? I know originally you thought it was about a 200 basis point penalty. And then separately on labor, I guess on the wage inflation at 5%, can you kind of dimensionalize what you think your underlying wage inflation is? I think you did some sort of step-up or adjustment in your wage schedule. So I'm not sure kind of how much of that was proactive versus reactive and what might be the ongoing run rate for 2016 for your wage inflation.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Sharon, on carnitas, it's hard to tell because we just returned to 90%, and we finished September like just under 60% and we just hit 90% in the second half of September. It did look like in the markets that did get carnitas back that we did see some improvement during like the second week of October. But October's been still choppy so far that it's hard to tell. We did expect that based on when we suspended the sale of carnitas, we did see what we thought could be as much as a 200 basis points negative impact on the comps. So we're hoping we'll see that return. But it'll take a little bit more time for us to fully see that happen.","In terms of wage inflation, a lot of that was proactive. We did have some isolated areas, we had San Francisco, we had parts of D.C., where there were minimum wage increases. And in most markets, we're above minimum wage, so that doesn't have an immediate impact. But just because of general competition for employees, just the expectation that we want to hire top performers and we want to be the employer of choice, we've been very proactive in making sure that not only our starting wages are competitive, but we also took a look at a number of our hourly managers during the summer to make sure that we're paying fair rates to them as well. So that was proactive.","In terms of what to expect going forward, Sharon, I think it just depends on what the labor market looks like. I wouldn't expect it would stay at fully 5% year-after-year. So I don't know it would come down all the way to 5%, but I don't know that it's going to drop all the way down to 2%, which is what it had been running for the last, I'd say, two years or three years or four years.","Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Okay.","Operator","We'll go next to David Tarantino with Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. Jack, just a question on how you're viewing the recent trends in your business? And I know you mentioned that August and September were a little slower than July. Do you think you're seeing a change in the underlying momentum of the business? Or was that just more so related to the benefit you saw from the buy one, get one free promotion?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Well, definitely, David, the reason I wanted to go through the monthly comps is, July, we benefited. There was a lot of awareness, a lot of people playing the games, a lot of people earning and then redeeming the buy one, get one. And that always results in a short-term bump in sales. So, I would say that the July moving to September \u2013 or moving to August was more kind of a hangover effect from Friend or Faux. So we're kind of holding at that lower level, that low single digit level. Some of that also is due to very, very tough comparisons to last year. So I would say we're kind of just holding our own right now. I wouldn't say after the July bump that we got Friend or Faux, I would say we're just kind of holding our own. I don't think we're accelerating, but we're not \u2013 we're not decelerating, but I don't see us accelerating either.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's helpful. And then maybe a second question. You hired a new Chief Technology Officer recently. And I'm just wondering kind of big picture what we should expect to see from that hire. And does that include perhaps a strengthening of the mobile ordering platform or any of the other elements related to that?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. David, he hasn't even started yet. So, it would be premature to say exactly what we're going to do. But one way we think about the business is, about two-thirds of our business is eaten outside of a restaurant, but only 7% of our business is ordered outside of a restaurant. And so, there's a big gap between our customers who choose to or end up eating somewhere else other than a restaurant. So kind of makes sense for us to provide the convenience to order outside of a restaurant. And we do have \u2013 we have iPhone, we do have Android, but we can make that whole process more efficient. We can make it more reliable. And our customers, they love to go through the line because they have complete control, but I think there are ways for us to, between both a focus on operations on that second make line that Monty talked about, as well as looking at what technology opportunities are there, I think we can enhance their overall experience so that 7% can continue to grow over time.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, David.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. You guys did touch on it, but what was the duration of the Friend or Faux promotion and the approximate number of BOGO transactions you guys saw in the quarter?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","The promotion ran \u2013 was it about five weeks, Mark?","Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations","About six weeks. The total number of BOGOs I think was right around 2 million.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Was it that much? Okay.","Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations","I believe. Just under, perhaps.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then just following up on that, so the ultimate impact on both Q3 transaction and mix, what was that for the quarter as well?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Well, the overall quarter, we did a 2.6% comp, 1.9% with transaction and 0.7%, 70 basis points, was from menu price increase. And that was the targeted \u2013 the vast majority was targeted menu price increases related to our steak and barbacoa.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","We'll go next to David Palmer with RBC.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, David?","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good evening. Your throughput, you mentioned that the lunch hour declined a little bit. I realize it's peak daypart and during peak season, but how important do you think that was? And are you contemplating any significant adjustments to drive throughput?","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Yeah, I always think it is very important that we continue to focus on throughput. And I think that obviously coming off \u2013 we're sort of coming off our highest seasonality in terms of the crowds coming through our restaurants, and then simultaneously with a sort of lower transaction comp than we've been experiencing, I think what happens is sometimes our teams get focused on a number of other things: staffing, being a model, training new managers, on-boarding new crews. And then I think sometimes when things aren't moving \u2013 when the growth isn't quite as rapid, people get a little less excited about pushing throughput and really watching their four pillars execution.","So I think that it's kind of a long way of saying it's \u2013 I think we took our eye off the ball a little bit. I think it happens sometimes, especially after a year of sort of the blistering comps at 19.8% a year ago during this time. During those times, it's very easy to keep throughput top of mind and have our crews be focused intensely on it. We had contests running. We had people excited about breaking throughput records, and just a lot of focus on it. And I think that the focus has waned a little bit. And that's not saying we want to see it continue, because throughput, even during slower growth times, and we have lines, and we have lines that cause some people to want to walk away.","And so we are going to work to replenish and reinvigorate our teams to focus on throughput and on execution of the four pillars of throughput because it is still an enormously huge competitive advantage for us and a huge part of customer service. So even though it's only a falloff of one transaction, we do look to gain transactions. And as you've seen from the previous several years, even at our core lunch hour, we had gained transactions almost every quarter. So we don't like to see it fall off on, but we're glad to have retained the really significant gains we made during 2013 and 2014, but we'd like to improve on that still more.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just a quick follow-up on David's question about mobile order and the fact that you have mobile order already, a lot of people are focusing on that for Starbucks and they're \u2013 that's making great strides for them. You improved your mobile order earlier this year. It feels like a lot of people don't know about it. Is it just \u2013 to some degree, is it just about marketing what you have? Or do you think this is going to be more about improving the mobile order technology (37:51)?","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've deliberately under-marketed our mobile ordering, and the reason for that is fairly simple. We just have not quite optimized the experience in the restaurants to the point where we feel comfortable driving a large number of people in there. I mean, we're working on all of those improvements. So we don't want somebody to go in, make a mobile order and go in and have a degraded experience. And so, all of the growth that we've seen on mobile has essentially been without any marketing at all. So there is a tremendous amount of potential, but as we talked about in our prepared comments, we really want to optimize the experience before we really drive people in the \u2013 the mobile experience, so.","Additionally, we think that we have the ability to drive a lot of traffic through mobile ordering and that will go to our second make line in the back of the house. We think that potentially, we could overwhelm that second make line, so we have started to retool that second make line to have at least the same capacity as our mainline. By the way, it doesn't take extra space in the kitchen, which is good news, but it does take some retooling. So, it needs to be a combination of both the marketing of that technology, with increasing the capacity of the second make line.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. On the same-store sales guidance, it seems low single-digits for 2016 reflects significant deceleration on a two-year and three-year basis. Of course, there is some price that's likely to fall off, but what are the other factors driving deceleration or would you say that low single-digits is a function more of conservatism?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Well, the way I would think about it, Andrew, is that we just finished a three-year trend, and I've talked about this on some earlier calls. If you go back and look to 2013, we started a new trend where we started in low single-digit comps, and we kind of built our comps for the next several quarters. We had a price increase in 2014. But if you combine the last three years \u2013 and this is kind of the end of that trend \u2013 our three-year comps are up in the high 27%-28% range. We now need to start a new trend because we started that momentum. And if you look quarter by quarter to quarter, you can see that the momentum builds for several quarters, it levels off. It peaked last year at 19.8%, and then as you are comparing through multiple years, up double digit comps.","And none of this is based on gimmicks, on promotions, on discounting or anything like that. It's really just inviting more customers in; they have a great experience, they want to come back. So it's an education that Mark and the team have done with things like Scarecrow and things that raise the awareness of where food comes from, why our food is different and our customers have been able during this three-year trend to connect the dots between why the food they love so much, why it tastes so good because it comes from these great ingredients, because the food is prepared using classic cooking techniques \u2013 there's real cooking going on in our restaurants. And so right now, we're in this challenge where we've got three years of growing our sales by 27%-28%, and comparing to that is difficult.","And so what we're hoping will happen is, we'll be able to ignite another trend, another three-year trend. When that will happen with the order of magnitude of that happening is very difficult to predict, but over the last 10 years-15 years, Chipotle has these kind of waves of comps, and most of it is around creating awareness and appreciation for what we do at Chipotle.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Steve, just a separate question: just in answer to last question, you talked about you need to retool the second make line. It's not going to involve extra room, but can you give any sense for what really needs to be done there? Is it sense of execution of four pillars? Is it more around labor training? Any kind of direction would be helpful.","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, it wouldn't be four pillars in that there is a dedicated crew person or two, depending on volume, to that make line. So, it's not the same deployment. But there are a lot of things having to do with capacity of the bin size in the \u2013 as you hold hot and cold food, the bin size right now is very small, so retooling that to have larger capacity. Also, the way we scoop can be improved using different kinds of utensils that are more efficient that might not be appropriate for the mainline, but are very efficient in the back of a house.","And then also, the way orders come in, right now they come in on a paper chit, if you well, which has to be read. So there are different technologies that we are looking at right now, and we've been going through this process to determine which one is going to be best for us. But they involve different ways that the orders can be indicated to the crew people so that they can make these orders much faster, much more efficiently. So, it's an exciting project and it's moving fast and keeping pace with the ability to roll out this technology.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Karen Short from Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just, first question just on the fourth quarter comp guidance. I guess the guidance seems a little light or conservative, I guess, in light of the price increases, and I know you gave some color on October, but any more color in terms of what the composition of the comp has been so far in October? And then, I just had a follow-up.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","October would be similar, but there maybe a little bit more menu pricing in October, but not much more. So I would say the makeup of the comp is similar in terms of we're running about a 70 basis point price increase, maybe that's 80 basis points or 90 basis points, something like that. We will gradually get that up to 130 basis points. We hope it does prove to be conservative, and maybe it is conservative, but October is still choppy right now. It really isn't giving us any indication of what the current underlying pattern is. And so, I hope that when we report in January, we'll come back and you all will say, yeah, you guys were too conservative. But right now, with what we saw, finishing the quarter and what we saw in October being very, very choppy, it's very difficult to read.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then just actually in response to the last question, I mean, I know you commented that you have seen waves of comps, I guess, and I think what you said is that the waves have generally revolved around awareness. But I guess maybe a little color. Is history on what has driven your comps really relevant, I guess, in terms of what might drive the next wave? I guess the way I see it, I mean, the competitive environment has and is changing rapidly, as is technology. So maybe just your thoughts there.","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Well, of course our comps going forward are likely to be different than historical, but we still find that there's lots of people that either aren't aware of Chipotle or they're aware of Chipotle, but they don't know about where our food comes from. They don't know that we're doing real cooking. I mean, this happens to me all time. We just got an email from a former colleague of ours who's in Florida, moved down to Florida, and he says out of 10 people, as many as seven or eight or nine of them have never been to Chipotle before.","And so there is still this opportunity to educate people, one, that we exist, which that is changing over time because as we are in more markets, more and more people know about Chipotle but they don't necessarily know that we are using classic (46:14) cooking techniques. They don't necessarily know that we do things like source naturally raised meats and we have a local program during the right seasons, and things like that. And so that's something that we all bump into people all the time that don't fully understand that. So there's still awareness around why Chipotle is different.","There are lots of competitors out there \u2013 and this makes I think the messaging more difficult \u2013 that our messaging, that they're doing something that is more natural or that would imply that there's higher-quality there. And so that does make the message more clear, but we believe that the source of where our comp will come from will still come from educating people about Chipotle, increasing the awareness about why we're different from others. And we've had a great experience where people come in and try Chipotle and they have a great dining experience. They tend to want to come back and so while, yes, it's more challenging, yes, we have higher volumes, yes, there are more competitors out there, generally our job is or our challenge is to get more people to understand and come to Chipotle more often.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason West from Credit Suisse.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. A couple questions. Jack, on the pricing, the 1.3% that's tied to the beef items, you had also mentioned on the last call some pricing in certain minimum wage markets. Is that on top of the 1.3% or is that included in that run rate?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","It's included, Jason, but the only reason why we didn't point it out, it's just very, very small. Right now it's literally a handful of restaurants, a few dozen restaurants. And so it's a very small part of the 130 basis points.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And as you're thinking about next year and we do have some wage pressures, it sounds like food costs, not really a big pressure. How are you thinking about the next wave of pricing, when you'd want to start looking at that? Is wage pressure something that you want to get ahead of as we get into next year?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we don't have any plans right now for any kind of a national price increase to deal with wage pressure, but we do have a number of isolated markets, a number of which are coming up in January. We'll take the same approach that we took with \u2013 we talked about it, I think it was on the last quarter, and it was in the San Francisco area and then also in the, I think it was the mid-Atlantic area. We had a couple of markets that had pretty significant increases in minimum wage. Generally, we're not affected by minimum wage, but in some cases, the minimum wages are being increased to $10, $11, $12 per hour, and those will have some impact.","We don't automatically increase prices in those markets. What we do is, we look at all the cost of doing business in that area. And in the two cases that we mentioned last quarter, we increased prices there because not only our wage is up, but those areas already had a higher cost of doing business, things like higher occupancy cost and local taxes and things like that. And when we looked at competition, the competition was pretty aggressive in raising prices. So we'll do the same thing with minimum wage increases on a market-by-market basis, and we'll make the decisions on a market-by-market basis based on the wages, other cost of doing business, what the competitors are doing and what our current margins are. We'll consider all those factors.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Keith Siegner with UBS.","Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Jack, you highlighted $1.58 billion in cash. You highlighted how the best use of that is to put it towards new unit opens. You're already accelerating Chipotle opens. This year is above target, next year is even more. How close are we to accelerating the unit opens for ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","I hate to put a timeline on it. We are accelerating to a certain degree, but I assume what you mean is to really ramp it up aggressively. They're still in the nurturing phase, it's still in the brand building phase. When we open up a new restaurant, it behaves a lot like Chipotle 12 years, 15 years ago, when we went into a new market where it's an unfamiliar brand, it takes a while for customers to figure out what ShopHouse is. Pizzeria Locale, while it's pizza, it's pizza that may be unfamiliar to customers that are used to traditional pizza. And so there's still a brand building and an understanding of what we're doing, very similar to what we saw with Chipotle in the early days. We're seeing encouraging signs, like we're seeing some very strong comps in the markets that we've opened. It's why we've done things like \u2013 with ShopHouse, we're going to open a new market in Chicago. And so it gives us now three different markets where the brand building and the awareness is being created.","With Pizzeria Locale, the same thing, we will \u2013 very soon we're in two markets, right now we'll be in a third market. So I think we're planting the right seeds. We're doing it in a number of markets where more and more customers will be able to visit these restaurants to figure out what's different about ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale. And as we see the awareness build, as we see the comps continue to build, just like we did with Chipotle in the early days, we'll continue to invest in those markets. And I would say this is a very similar reaction to what we're seeing in Europe. We're seeing very attractive sales comps. We're seeing some inconsistency in the way the stores open. Some open hot and open up pretty high right away, and some it takes a little time to build. So they're still what we consider to be in the early brand building stage, but we're seeing some encouraging signs.","Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And maybe one quick one for Mark. If we really are going through this three-year cycle, this is a point where the company is very well flush with cash, the traffic is a little lower in this part of the three-year cycle, when we talked about some of these other awareness issues. Why not use this as a perfect opportunity to really put some money into the marketing program for long-term brand awareness, long-term brand building actions to kind of cement that relationship and awareness for the Food With Integrity? Why not step up some of those efforts a little more at this part of the cycle? Thanks.","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Well, I'd say that we actually probably are stepping it up in some regards. I mean, one thing that I think is important to understand about our strategy here is that we deliberately spend less on our marketing so that we can afford these higher quality ingredients. And that's essentially the main benefit, the main marketing benefit to our customers. And so we find different ways to tell that story, entertaining ways to do it, but we have recently shifted our focus more to telling the basic story about where our ingredients come from and how they're made. And we've significantly increased our focus on digital marketing, which we've found to be very effective. We're going to be using some more of our in-store assets to communicate some of these messages like our packaging. And so I think we're doing it.","I think what you won't see from us, though, is some people might think ramping up would mean head to television or something like that. The problem with television beyond the expense, is that it's really, really tailored toward 30-second spots which really only deliver if you have some sort of promotional or call-to-action message in them, which is a very slippery slope. So we're going to stay the course on telling this brand story, but we're working on several large initiatives similar to the ones you've seen in the past as well as what I just mentioned, which is an increased focus on digital and in-store communications. So I'd say we are ramping it up in some way, yeah.","Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good afternoon. When you look at comps in October, November, and December of last year, just like you gave us an idea of what was your best and worst this past quarter, does it get easier or more difficult as you exit this current quarter, please?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","It's similar, Nicole, because even though we had a lower comp last year at 16%, if we do a comp that's similar in the fourth quarter to what we saw in the third quarter, you'll see a three-year comp, and I keep going back to this three-year trend. That will be very similar. Okay, so it feels about the same. I wouldn't say it's any tougher; I wouldn't say it's any easier. It feels like it's a very similar comparison.","Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","In each month? Okay.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, in each month and they bounce around with the holidays, but I wouldn't say there's anything out of the ordinary within the quarter that is out of the ordinary worth pointing out.","Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","And I'm sorry, I missed it. Was it $165 million remaining on share repurchase or $135 million?","Unknown Speaker","$155 million.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","$155 million, so right in the middle of what you had.","Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","$155 million. Okay.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","$155 million, yeah \u2013 one five five.","Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","And then just a big picture question, with the acceleration in development, are you finding more sites that are perfect for Chipotle? Or is this also a benefit of the nearly 5,000 hires you made recently that Monty was talking about earlier?","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","No, this is really \u2013 our real estate people throughout the field are gaining confidence in that we've gone into a lot of smaller or sort of newer markets or off the beaten path markets lately with a lot of success, and our new store openings continue to be at a very solid volume. And so I guess just the confidence of our teams in the field who are out looking for real estate is very, very high that they can confidently sign deals. And also, we are better known than ever as a tenant. We're better trusted than ever by landlords, and so we're a very sought after tenant. And given a little bit better availability of money, I mean people are willing to build an endcap with us in mind or build a three-unit complex and put us in it.","And so we are able to just find a whole lot of deals even while walking away from deals and striking a relatively harder bargain. And also, our team has been organized in a new way that's more efficient, that's allowed us to work really, really well together, and with our increased confidence, the team is just feeling great. And they're producing a lot of great sites with really great terms, with great tenant improvement allowances and building these things for less than we did last year, which is superb.","But it really isn't any result of our hiring. Our hiring is something we did because we're really trying to become staffed as well as we can in our existing restaurants, to have an adequate complement of people to build it for our future leadership, and have a great base and being able to build when we do build new restaurants.","Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks, Monty.","Montgomery F.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","I would now like to introduce Chipotle's Director of Investor Relations, Alex Spong. You may begin your conference.","Alex Spong","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include projections of the number of restaurants we intend to open, comp restaurant sale increases, food cost trends, margins, effective tax rates, return on investment, investment costs, capital expenditures and shareholder returns, as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.  Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. ","We refer you to the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent 10-Qs, for discussion of these risks. Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, the reconciliation of which can be found on the presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our website. I'd like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call.","For the first quarter, it will begin on March 1 and continue to our first quarter release in April.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","M. Steven Ells","I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results and our performance throughout 2011. In a year where we saw only modest improvement in the economy, along with pressure from rising commodity costs, we were able to grow our revenue 23.7% to $596.7 million during the fourth quarter and 23.6% to $2.27 billion for the year. We posted same-store sales growth of 11.1% during the quarter and 11.2% for the full year. And our restaurant-level margins were 26.1% for the quarter and 26% for the full year, among the highest in the industry.","Our performance is a direct result of our continued focus on just a few things: strengthening our food culture, which is aimed at finding the very best ingredients we can; our ongoing quest for more sustainable sources for all of our ingredients that we use; and our commitment to preparing food in our restaurants using classic cooking techniques; and our people culture, which is stronger than ever, as our top-performing employees continue to develop into inspiring future leaders of our company.","While our primary focus is on building the Chipotle brand in the U.S., we're making small investments now in what we believe will become potential growth opportunities in the future. To this end, we plan to open a second ShopHouse restaurant in Washington D.C. market later this year. ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen is a product of our belief that Chipotle's success has never really been about serving burritos and tacos. But rather, it's due to our commitment to serving the best-tasting food prepared using classic cooking techniques, building restaurant teams of top-performers who are empowered to create a unique and special restaurant experience and designing restaurants that are functional, appealing and that say something about the food we serve. Like Chipotle, ShopHouse embraces all of these ideals.","We're pleased with the performance of the first ShopHouse since it opened in September. While we're still working to perfect the concept, it reminds me very much of the first Chipotle when it originally opened. Many current customers aren't quite sure how the system works or what to order when they first come in, and sometimes have issues with flavor combinations or the level of spice in their food. But they like it and from the very beginning, you see that the customers are coming back, week after week. So we've decided to open a second restaurant, which should open sometime in the second half of this year. ","We're also continuing to see future growth opportunities in Europe. In September, we opened our second restaurant in London on Baker Street and have 2 more under construction now, both of which are slated to open during the second half of the year. And our first restaurant in Paris is set to open this spring.","Monty and I just visited Europe last month to get a sense of how our restaurants in London are doing and to check on the status of Paris, and to spend time with our talented teams there. While it's very early in our development in Europe, we both saw some very encouraging things during the trip. The restaurants in London are running extremely well. The food is as good as our best restaurants here in the U.S. The crews have been developed by 2 of our restaurateurs and provide us the future leadership we need to open additional restaurants. And the experience our customers are enjoying is extraordinary.","As of the end of the fourth quarter, all of the meat we served in our restaurants was naturally raised, coming from animals that are never given antibiotics or added hormones, and raised in a humane way. More than a decade ago, this was a first for a chain restaurant to begin serving pork from pigs raised in open pastures or deeply-bedded pens and without the use of antibiotics. That began our quest to find more sustainable sources for all of the ingredients we use. Today, we're the only national restaurant company to serve all naturally raised meat. And it is one of the ways we are changing the way people think about and eat fast food. And we'll continue to work as hard as we can to address supply shortages that sometime result in our serving conventionally raised meats in some markets.","During the last quarter, we also completed the rollout of brown rice to all of our restaurants. We believe that brown rice is a great option for our customers, offering the nutritional benefits of whole grain and flavors that fit well with the rest of the items on our menu. Since completing the rollout, our customers seem to agree, as the brown rice now accounts for about 1\/3 of all the rice we serve.","We're also making progress in our efforts to better educate customers about food culture and the things that make Chipotle so unique. Our Back to the Start short film, the animated piece that shows the farmers journey from more sustainable farming to a more industrial one and then back again, has been viewed online about 4.5 million times. Through its run on nearly 10,000 movie screens nationwide and from YouTube, it has been seen more than 26 million times and it's making an impression on those who have seen it. According to our research, nearly 80% of theater attendees recall seeing the spot, with 84% saying they found it relevant. 79% of the people who have seen it said that they found it persuasive. And it's also won praise from the New York Times, Adweek magazine and others. Because we think this film is great way to connect with people in a way that's powerful and authentic, we're continuing to explore other ways that we can use it.","During the quarter, we also used our annual Boorito promotion as an opportunity to connect our customers to issues that we believe are important. This time, the plight of family farms in America. Historically, Boorito was a promotion that amounted to being a giveaway to customers if they came into our restaurant dressed as their favorite Chipotle menu item. In 2010, we re-created the promotion to give it a philanthropic twist and to better use it as an opportunity to educate customers about important issues in the food system. We continued in this philanthropic direction this past Halloween, asking customers to dress in costumes inspired by the family farm and offering them a burrito, order of tacos, a salad or bowl for $2 at any of our restaurants after 6:00 p.m., with the proceeds benefiting the newly created Chipotle Cultivate Foundation.","This foundation was created to expand upon our tradition of support for family farms, sustainable agriculture and programs that educate the next generation of farmers. Through the program, we contributed $1 million to the foundation. $1 million, which made substantial -- and made a substantial donation to the Farm Aid organization, and will make additional grants and awards beginning this year to help create more sustainable, healthful and equitable food future.","Finally, we're in the process of expanding our Farm Team loyalty program. We started off slow with only our managers inviting our customers into the program. Starting slowly has helped us refine the experience. After positive feedback from the members so far, we're going to expand the program by allowing our current Farm Team members to invite a limited number of their friends into the program. We're also expanding the program by introducing a lite version for Facebook and other platforms as a way of allowing a larger number of customers to participate in some aspects of the program.","Remember that Farm Team is not a frequency-based program like most restaurant loyalty programs, but rather, it's about identifying our most loyal and passionate customers, educating them more about what we do and giving them tools to help them become ambassadors for the brand. We believe that the pieces are in place for us to continue to change the way people think about and eat fast food. The strength of our food and people cultures continues to grow. We're doing a better job of educating customers about the important characteristics that distinguish Chipotle from other restaurants, and we are seeding opportunities for future growth in ways that are consistent with our culture and our business model. We believe our focus in these key areas will allow us to continue to deliver solid results for our shareholders throughout the year and into the foreseeable future. ","Now, I'll turn the call over to Monty.","Montgomery F. Moran","Thank you, Steve. Maintaining such a strong focus on the things that are most important to Chipotle's success requires great discipline. And we're glad to see that by maintaining this focus, we continue to produce strong results. By continuing to improve the critical areas of our business, particularly our food culture and our people culture, we are raising our standards to new levels all the time. The quality of our food is the best that it has ever been, as is the quality of our people. For example, the quality of the restaurant experiences we are seeing during our Restaurateur interviews today is far better than ever before. This group of extraordinary leaders continues to raise the bar in every facet of our operations: better customer service, faster throughput, cleaner restaurants and crews of empowered top-performers that give us great confidence that our future leaders are already among us.","As our managers aspire to become Restaurateurs, they know that the key ingredient is a team of all top-performers. And more today than ever, both our GMs and our field leaders know that while building a strong team takes a lot of effort, it need not take a lot of time. And as they work towards quickly building stronger teams, they are raising their standards both in terms of whom they hire, as well as who they allow to remain on their team. They've also raised their expectations about how quickly they can elevate a team of high-performers to the Restaurateur level.","During 2011, we added 102 new Restaurateurs, and we now have more than 240 Restaurateurs overseeing nearly 40% of our restaurants, including their home restaurant and other restaurants that they mentor. And if you include field leaders who have come through the Restaurateur program, in other words, those that were promoted to apprentice team leaders, team leaders or team directors, we have about 264 Restaurateurs today and about 60% of our restaurants are now overseen by these extraordinary leaders.","We continue to be amazed by how these empowered top-performing leaders continue to raise the bar far beyond even what we thought was possible. For example, one of our newest Restaurateurs, Flor Silva, become a Restaurateur in just the second day after opening a brand new Chipotle restaurant. This is something that none of us thought was possible. But this GM taught all of us a lesson: She came from a Restaurateur store herself and had a strong vision for what a winning team looked like. Weeks before her new store opened, she spent days on the sidewalk in front of her new restaurant, interviewing candidates for crew positions. She carefully selected only the very best candidates, people who had the characteristics to be great and who were committed to becoming leaders at Chipotle. Once she had selected her team, she trained each of them in an existing Chipotle, and then invited all of them to her apartment to explain to them her vision for her restaurant and to watch videos from the 2010 All Managers Conference to be sure that each of these people understood Chipotle's unique culture. She made a commitment to each of them to help them grow, and carefully described exactly how they would be able to become managers and future leaders at Chipotle themselves. At the same time, she secured a commitment from each of them to devote themselves fully to becoming part of the Restaurateur store very quickly.","When I went to visit this new restaurant, it was not to make Flor a Restaurateur. In fact, I was just stopping in to meet the team but the level of talent, inspiration and empowerment of the team was terrific and it was clear that the team deserved to be recognized as a Restaurateur team. I tell you this story to illustrate the level of commitment that our managers have, as well as to show their level of creativity and discipline when it comes to insisting on having an elite culture. I also tell you this to demonstrate that we are better equipped today to hire and train great teams and build great cultures because of the excellent example that many of our top managers set for us.","Flor's example is one of many with similar lessons that all of our aspiring Restaurateurs can benefit from. As the year progresses, we expect to see many more similar stories from these remarkable managers and emerging leaders.","Beyond Restaurateurs, we're also continuing to see examples of people making their way from the restaurants into broader leadership positions. One recent example is Matt China [ph] who began working with Chipotle as a General Manager in 1999. In his most recent position as Team Director, Matt has been directly involved in the development of more than 45 Restaurateurs, 6 apprentice team leaders, 5 team leaders, a team director and even a Regional director. We recently divided our Northeast region into 2 regions, and the North -- one called the Northeast and one called the mid-Atlantic, and promoted Matt to be the Regional Director in the Northeast, where his amazing ability to develop people and create an extraordinary team will ensure our success well into the future.","While our culture is well-known to our current crews and managers inside Chipotle, it isn't necessarily as familiar to people outside the company. So we are in the early stages of implementing a new recruiting strategy. This strategy is aimed at improving the pool of potential applicants by helping them understand what our current crews and managers already know, that we're a company with a special culture that provides tremendous opportunity for our top performers. ","This strategy, which we're rolling out in March, includes a new HR software system that provides better analytics to help us target the very best applicants available, along with a strong emphasis on communicating and marketing the opportunities at Chipotle to help potential applicants understand our culture and the unique opportunity that comes with building a career here.","We will also be relaunching our employee referral bonus program and adding more field recruiters, as well as expanding our recruitment efforts on college campuses and with veterans. Through this strategy, we expect to get even better applicants, so that we can continue to improve the quality of people that we're hiring even as we accelerate our growth this year.  Of course, the outcome of all these efforts will be better customer service and a better restaurant experience. ","One of the essential aspects of good customer service at Chipotle is better throughput. In our last call, we acknowledged that in spite of higher unit volumes and some new training tools, we had not made significant improvements in throughput during our lunch and dinner hours since reaching our peak in 2007. Since we began to reemphasize this important aspect of our operation, we have seen an improvement in transactions during our peak lunch hour. So whereas our sales comp was growing slower during peak hours and faster during non-peak hours during the last several quarters, our recently renewed emphasis on throughput has helped improve the percentage of our comp that comes from the peak lunch hour.","As we indicated on our call last quarter, we are accelerating our new restaurant development this year as well with plans to open 155 to 165 new restaurants. While this is more restaurants than we have ever opened in a single year, we are confident with regard to this plan. Not just in 2012, but over the next couple of years as well. Our real estate pipeline is stronger than ever and because we have broadened the universe of potential sites to consider, largely because of our A Model strategy, we are confident that we remain in control of our own destiny in terms of growth. ","As we look out over the next 2 years, I think we are well-positioned to continue to find great sites, particularly, if we see an uptick in the amount of new developments being built. But we are well-positioned to continue our strong growth even if new construction remains slow. By continuing to improve our people culture, the quality of applicants coming to Chipotle and the strength of our real estate portfolio, we are more confident than ever in our ability to continue to open and operate great restaurants at a healthy pace this year and in the coming years. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack Hartung.","John R. Hartung","Thanks, Monty. We're extremely proud of the results that our restaurant teams delivered during the fourth quarter and for the entire year in 2011. Our managers continue to delight our customers by hiring top-performing crew, empowering them to make each customers dining experience truly special. Our financial results continue to be driven by a focus on strengthening our food culture, our people culture and our business model. And while we're pleased with these financial results, we're even more pleased with the strong position we are in as we look to the future, both in 2012 and beyond. We're proud to report our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit comps since the economy began to recover, with a comp of 11.1% in the quarter. And our average restaurant sales now exceed $2 million for the first time.","Sales in the fourth quarter increased 23.7% to $596.7 million, driven by new restaurant openings and the 11.1% comp increase. The comp was driven mostly from increased traffic while higher menu prices added about 4.9%. For the year, sales increased 23.6% to $2.27 billion, and the comp for the full year was 11.2%. Menu price increases helped the full-year comp by 2.9%. And as we mentioned on our last earnings call, we still haven't seen any noticeable resistance to the summer's price increase, either on an average check or in transaction trends.","Our comps held up well in the fourth quarter despite a tougher comparison to Q4 of 2010, when we had a comp of 12.6%. The unusually mild weather in December compared to winter storms in 2010 added about 1% to our Q4 sales comp. January sales comp started out quite strong as the mild weather continued into the first few weeks of 2012. And now that more normal winter weather has arrived in most of the U.S., we're seeing more normalized sales trends, similar to the fourth quarter trends before the unseasonably warm December. We face tough comparisons in 2012 as we will compare against double-digit comps from 2011 in each quarter, the first time we've done that since before the recession. And in the second half of the year, we'll compare against 2 years of double-digit comps, including the price increase we took last summer. While we have no plan for a system-wide price increase, we do intend to raise prices in the Pacific region. As we've mentioned in the past, California has very high cost of doing business and our menu prices there are below those of most of the rest of the country. The Pacific price increase will have only about 1% impact on the company once it is completed by the end of the first quarter.","As the result of this increase, along with our expectations that are focused on throughput, we'll begin to help the comp in the spring when our sales are at the highest and our lines at the longest, we're increasing our comp guidance to the mid-single-digits.","Our new restaurants continue to perform very well, opening with sales above our previously communicated range of $1.4 million to $1.5 million. As a result, we now expect new restaurants to open in the $1.5 million to $1.6 million range. A Models continue to perform well with sales just below traditional sites, but with much higher returns. We opened 67 new restaurants in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date openings to 150 which exceeded the high-end of our guidance range for 2011. We ended the year with total company-wide restaurants of 1,230, which represents a restaurant growth rate of 13.5% for the year.","As we said during the last earnings call, we plan on increasing our new restaurant openings in 2012 to a range of 155 to 165 new restaurants, with A Models representing about 30%. And we expect that these openings will occur a bit more evenly between the quarters in 2012.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.81, an increase of 23.1%. Efficiencies from higher comps and the price increase were largely offset by higher food costs. Restaurant level margins did increase by 20 basis points to 26.1% for the quarter. Food inflation for the quarter was 9%, much higher than the 4.9% effective run rate for the menu price increase.","Earnings per share was $6.76 for the full year 2011, an increase of 19.9% over 2010. Again, efficiencies from higher comps allowed us to leverage nearly every line item on the P&L except for food, which for the full-year 2011 was up 190 basis points from 2010 and G&A, which is up 10 basis points from 2010. Restaurant-level margins year-to-date were 26%, a decrease of 70 basis points. Food costs were 32.2% for the quarter, up 120 basis points from 2010, but sequentially were lower than third quarter. We are pleased to see food costs improve from the third quarter due to lower avocado costs in the fourth quarter, as we shifted away from the expensive and undersupplied California avocado and began harvesting avocados from Chile and Mexico.","Food cost also benefited incrementally by about 10 basis points from previous menu price increases fully realized during the quarter. Food inflation overall in 2011 was about 9.3% before adjusting for the menu price increases taken during the year.","While we're cautiously optimistic we'll see more reasonable prices in 2012 for avocados, dairy and produce, we expect these benefits will be more than offset by higher costs for our beef, chicken, rice and beans. Beef costs will be especially challenging due to protracted supply shortages, despite recent reductions in grain prices. Additionally during the fourth quarter, we reached a milestone of serving 100% naturally raised chicken and steak, and we'll continue to seek opportunities to invest in higher quality ingredients where we can.  Overall, we expect food inflation in 2012 will be around the mid-single-digits starting from the 32.2% we saw the fourth quarter.  Labor costs were 23.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 100 basis points from 2010. Labor leverage is driven by higher sales volumes and by the menu price increase, and year-to-date labor costs are down 80 basis points from 2010.","Occupancy cost for the quarter and the year declined by 50 basis points from 2010 due to higher average restaurant sales and other operating costs were 11.5% for the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points due primarily to a greater investment in marketing. Year-to-date other operating costs were flat at 11.1%. Marketing was 1.6% in the quarter compared to just 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010. We invested more in marketing during the quarter [indiscernible] animated film Back to the Start which played in theaters around the country and on YouTube allowing over 26 million people to see this film. We also hosted our first ever Cultivate event in Chicago in October, and we feel strongly that we're connecting with customers and prospective customers in an emotional and authentic way through these kinds of marketing investments. While marketing was about 1.3% in Q1 of 2011, we expect it will be in the 1.5% to 1.6% in Q1 of this year due to planned marketing activities.  Overall for 2012, we expect to return to our historical marketing expense range of around 1.75%. ","G&A was 6.4% in the quarter, a 40 basis points higher than 2010 due to higher non-cash stock compensation expense. The non-cash noneconomic stock comp expense was about $9 million in the quarter and $41 million for the full year in G&A. This is $5.3 million higher in the quarter and $20 million higher during the year compared to 2010, purely as a result of stock options issued at a much higher stock price, which resulted in a much higher calculated accounting charge.","Sequentially, G&A was up 10 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to Q3, as a lower relative stock comp expense was more than offset by our charitable contribution from our Boorito event and from higher nonqualified benefit plan expenses. The nonqualified benefit plan is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan and expense comes from equalizing investment earnings from participant account. We plan to hedge our nonqualified plan expenses by setting up and funding a trust during 2012. ","For the year, our underlying cash G&A, adjusting for the higher noncash stock comp expense, is lower as a percentage of sales as a result of our constant efforts to grow our underlying G&A at a slower rate than our sales growth. In 2012, we expect to continue to manage our underlying cash G&A to grow at a slower rate than our sales growth before the impact of the noncash stock comp expense, and before the cost of the biennial All Manager Conference. Including both these items, the noncash stock comp and the cost of the All Manager meeting, we expect G&A as a percentage of sales in 2012 will be about the same or slightly higher than in 2011.","As a perspective, if a similar number of options were granted this year at the current stock price, the accounting charge for noncash stock comp would increase by about $25 million due to the higher stock price.","Our effective tax rate was 38.5% for the year and 39% for the quarter. The higher tax rate is due to a higher estimated state tax rates, as states are getting more aggressive in disallowing certain deductions, and as we earn proportionately more in a higher tax state. For 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to increase further to 39.3%, principally as result of the HIRE Act not continuing and the work opportunity tax credit and the R&D credit, which have expired and, as of today, have not been renewed by Congress.","We've now nearly completed the most recent $100 million stock repurchase program at an average price per share of $239. Over the past 3 years, we've purchased a total of $300 million in our stock at an average overall share price of $98. And we're pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $100 million stock purchase program.","Our average development costs were about $800,000 in 2011 and we expect them to remain around $800,000 to in 2012. With these investment costs, combined with strong opening sales and a strong economic model, we expect to deliver attractive cash-on-cash returns on our new restaurants. Capital expenditures totaled about $143 million in 2011, net of landlord credits, primarily related to new restaurants along with continued reinvestment in existing restaurants. And in 2012, we anticipate CapEx will be in the range of $150 million to $160 million, net of landlord credits, and the majority of which will relate to new restaurant construction.  We were able to increase our total cash and related investments by $235 million during the year and that was even after investing $143 million in capital expenditures net of landlord credits for new restaurants, mostly for new restaurants, and repurchasing stock totaling $64 million. ","We continue to believe that investing in high returning new restaurants remains the best use of our cash and we're confident that the growth options we're seeding today including ShopHouse, Chipotle in London, Toronto and Paris will all provide attractive value-enhancing opportunities in the future. In the meantime, we'll continue to invest in our high returning domestic restaurants, and we'll opportunistically repurchase our stock and enhance shareholder value. ","Thanks for your time today. At this time, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from David Tarantino with Robert W Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Jack, I just wanted to clarify a couple of points you made on the recent comp trends and just get your thoughts on what's driving that trend. So first of all, on the comment about trends sort of settling in once you got past the weather, if you could maybe clarify what you meant by that, and is it still sort of running in that sort of low double-digit range even when you factor out the weather? And then secondly, the comp trend has stayed very strong despite very difficult comparisons. And I was just curious to know your thoughts on whether you think some of that's being driven by some of the internal factors like marketing and throughput or if you think the consumer environment is starting to look a little bit better.","John R. Hartung","Okay. Yes, David, on the comps, this is always a choppy time of year to look at the trends and sort through what's happening because you're trying to sort through winter weather, either mild or extreme this year than compared to last year. And so when we do that and we start to see kind of normal winter weather this year compared to relatively normal winter weather last year, it does look like our trends are returning back to very strong kind of in that very low double-digit range. So for example, if you took the 1% that we got out of the fourth quarter would be right at about a 10% or a 10.1% or so. And that's more in line with what it looks like the underlying trends are. Now, in terms of our comp trends remaining strong, they have remained strong. We think the comparisons are going to get tougher, David, because we're still, right now, comparing against just one year of double-digit comp and we've got 2 more quarters to do that. So if you go back to a couple of years, to 2010, in the first quarter of 2010, we were -- we had a comp of about 4%. Second quarter, it was a little over 8%. And so we're kind of looking at it as those are relatively easy comparisons because it's not 2 years of double-digit comps. So we think that as we get out into the second half of the year, that's where we'll see whether we can find over 2 years of double-digit comps. We have a nice history of doing that for 10 years before the recession, and we just don't know how things will look in the second half of the year and we also compare it to the price increase in the second half of the year. In terms of are we seeing anything specific in our comps from marketing or throughput? I would say no. There's nothing noticeable that we're seeing that's directly attributable to throughput or marketing. We think that marketing is definitely helping our cause. We definitely think that it's allowing people to discover why Chipotle is special, why our food and how we source our food is different than any other restaurant company. We think that the loyalty is likely to increase as a result of our marketing efforts. But in terms of seeing a change in our comp trend line from marketing or throughput, we're not seeing that yet.","Operator","We'll hear next from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first one, on the productivity gains that you guys have been referencing, are you seeing an increase in traffic at the stores in which productivity gains are significant? Or people just shifting back from the shoulder periods to peak lunch? Or is it -- are you seeing anything that leads you to believe this is now going to drive up traffic at those particular stores? And then on a separate kind of unrelated note, on the marketing, the customer card and some of the other stuff that you guys are doing and investments you're making, do you see any of them as being meaningful in 2012, or at this point, just kind of rotating around different things you're doing, tweaking things, playing with things, however, nothing is really going to move the needle? Or are you getting really confident about anything in particular?","Montgomery F. Moran","Mike, I'll the try to answer the throughput question. I mean, Jack pointed out that it's hard to sort of label the throughput has been that we can attribute much of the comp trends to the throughput at this point or the change in throughput. We have seen some encouraging signs. We brought our focus back to this a quarter or 2 ago and in the second -- in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the previous year's fourth quarter. We saw very encouraging results, particularly December, where we saw that our throughput was faster in December than the previous December and even quicker than it was during our best work in 2007. So that's nice to see. And it was -- our throughput in December was the fastest we've ever had. And so far, we don't see any -- that, that's falling off in January, which is terrific. We think that we're going to continue to be able to do that. It's really all just getting ready for game time, which is sort of April, May, June, July, when seasonality dictates that we have a lot more people come into our restaurants. And that's really what we're doing, is making sure that our teams are aware of exactly those things they need to do to drive great throughput. They're ready to do it when those lines get really, really long. Because that's the time when we really need lunch -- peak hour lunch and peak hour dinner to be able to contribute their fair share to our underlying comp. The percentage of our comp that is attributable to our peak lunch hour in December also increased over the previous month and also increased over where it was the fourth quarter the year before. So that was another nice thing we saw that we were able to get the lunch hour to contribute sort of more of its fair share to comps. So that was something that also encourages us. Again, we want to be careful. We're optimistic. We feel very good about it. It seems like our reemphasis on this important initiative is leading to some really great results. But again, game time is April, May, June, July when the traffic really returns and that's when we really judge, grade ourselves on how effectively we've sort of improved on this really important initiative. So we're optimistic for now. We've seen some clear benefits. But will we be able to pull those off when it gets real, real busy? We believe we will, but that remains to be seen. The second question, maybe you can repeat that one...","M. Steven Ells","So Michael, I think that we've done some things that have really have really made an impact marketing-wise. And if you think about our marketing, we really want to deepen our relationships, develop a deep relationship with our customers. And what I mean by that is really allowing them to understand what differentiates Chipotle and what makes it special. And I think over the years, we've learned that, that quick sort of advertising blitz about the facts of Food With Integrity don't accomplish that. But over the past year or so, we've developed things like the Farm Team, the Cultivate event in Chicago, the video Back to the Start, which really all are designed to develop a relationship, an emotional relationship, with our customers. And it's working. We get great response. Our research indicates that we're really connecting with our customers and they're finding reasons to appreciate Chipotle more beyond just great tasting food and value and convenience. And it's these things, it's marketing this way that I think is more sustainable long term. It's not about a marketing blitz or limited time offer that might provide a blip or move the needle, as you say, in a jerky way. Rather, it's something that's calculating and sustainable. And I think, again, really means something to customers, especially our customers.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Westra with Cowen and Company.","Paul Westra - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just had a follow-up question on the marketing spend. Jack, I think you said 1.75% for this year and '12. What was it for the full year of '11? And obviously, given Steve's comments, it sounds like you're getting a good return on that investment. Is that a number that should creep up or down looking up beyond 2012?","John R. Hartung","Paul, it was lower in 2011. It was in the 1.4% to 1.5% range. And so we've been underspending the last couple years and we've really kind of changed almost everything about our marketing and we feel really good about the steps we've taken. We feel really good about this film that Steve talked about and the more people that see it, the more people are really connecting with that film in a special way. This Cultivate event, which we had in Chicago last year, we plan to do another event or 2 like that next year, are totally different things. They've never been done before by Chipotle. We're not aware that anything has been done like these by any companies in the past. And so, as we're finding our way on finding successes, connecting with customers with these efforts, we now are feeling like we want to do more of them. So I would say we've underspent the last couple of years, and we want to return back to the kind of the 1.75%. We don't have any expectations of needing to go past 1.5% to fully invest in the marketing activities that we're thinking about right now.","Paul Westra - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then one more question. I'm curious of your guys' perspective especially with your unique people skills, what do you think the impact of the Healthcare Reform Act, if it is implemented in its current line in '13? Have you looked at that? Would that affect you as a company or maybe how it will affect you differently than maybe the industry?","M. Steven Ells","Yes, Paul, we have looked at it. We haven't spent an extraordinary amount of time on it just because there's enough uncertainty. Hopefully some of which will be resolved this year. It would have a meaningful impact on us. It would have an impact on, we believe, every restaurant company, including us. And so, we're not prepared to talk about the specific dollar amounts, but it would mean taking virtually all of our crew that worked a certain number of hours and offer them insurance. And we, today, have an insurance -- a limited insurance program that we offer our crew. Most of our crew choose not to pick that up. And so we would go from very few of our crew being involved in the voluntary program to us being required to provide insurance to all of our employees. So it would be pretty significant change to our business.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to follow up on Monty's comments around some of the HR initiatives and trying to bring more people on board. I mean, should we read anything into that around your ability to hire good people these days and they've had some issues with turnover earlier in 2011. If you could just kind of update us on where you guys are there.","Montgomery F. Moran","Yes, it's a great question. It's funny, when we were sort of putting together our comments, we all discussed about how maybe someone would think that there was something to read into that, so I'm glad you asked. We did have a higher turnover last year and we hired a lot, lot, lot of people last year. An underlying question that you guys might have is, are you still able to find really good people? And the answer is yes, we are. We found that more and more people are coming our way. We are interviewing more and more people, we're hiring more people, but we're able to be more selective because of the greater number of people coming our way. But when you start to look at the pool of people who come our way and why they come our way, we have not been very strategic about that, historically. People just get to know us and friends tell friends or we put out advertisements on Craigslist or other sort of message boards, both electronic and paper, and people come in. But we haven't been really that strategic about it and we did a little bit of research midyear, towards the end of the year, to find out what the perceptions were of some of these people, people who were looking for jobs in the \"quick service\" or \"fast casual\" industry. And what we found is that their perception about what the job at Chipotle was all about was the same for Chipotle as it might be for even quick-serve restaurants, fast food restaurants. In other words, they didn't think that it was that much of a great job. They didn't know what opportunities were available to them. They didn't know much about what kind of culture we have. And we think that our company is such an extraordinary place to work, and we all feel like that's so obvious and that sometimes I think we've become may be a little bit insular and don't understand the fact that the rest of the world doesn't know that. So once we found that out, we've been very -- we've tried to become more strategic and in doing so, we're putting -- I talked to Mark  Crumpacker, our Chief Marketing Officer, some time ago, and said, \"How can we market to potential employees not just customers, and help them understand what we're about?\" and we put a team of people together to look into that. And so that push is designed -- really, just when you're hiring 30,000 people a year or so, you want to make sure that the candidates you hire -- the pool of applicants that you're hiring from is the best that it can be and we think that we can improve that substantially by being a little bit more strategic, by doing some marketing and doing other things that I mentioned during my comments. So no, nothing to read into it in terms of us having a particular problem with it. We haven't had a problem with it. But we do think we can get much, much better. The bottom line is that today, our standards are much higher for who we have in our General Manager positions, they're higher for we have in our apprentice, service manager and kitchen manager positions. And likewise, we want them to be higher in terms of entry level people that we hire so that we can have a much stronger group of future leaders, and have the greatest odds of having a team of all top-performers throughout the entire country.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 questions. Monty, your comments about the expansion and the goal opening 155 to 165 stores in 2012, you mentioned something about over the next several years as well. I guess, I was curious if you're thinking that 2013, 2014 expansion will be in the same absolute number range.","Montgomery F. Moran","Well, I really wasn't trying to pencil in any number range for that. We'll give that much later in the year. I guess -- first and foremost, I was wanting to express a great deal of confidence in the guidance we've given of 155 to 165 for this year because our real estate pipeline and the quality of the real estate that's in that pipeline is really terrific. And that's, I think, evident in some of the comments Jack made with regard to the strength of our new store openings and the quality of the restaurants that we've been able to open throughout the country, throughout all the regions, proven and developing markets and new markets. So we feel real good about the pipeline of real estate. I think the A Model strategy has given us a lot more flexibility, and frankly, a lot more creativity in the way we look at real estate. So sometimes, for instance, even when we go into a market and looking for A Models -- in other words, going to a market that perhaps is off the beaten path or something we wouldn't have really looked before. We go in there looking for A Models and we find them. And that helps us. But in addition to finding A Models, sometimes, those searches are helping us or leading us to open traditional Chipotles that we may not have earlier considered and the very, very strong openings we're having are showing that, that more aggressive approach is a good approach. And so that gives us a great deal of confidence in opening the stores we're going to open in 2012. And we do think that there's -- we have a high degree of confidence that we'll be able to continue to have a very strong pipeline in future years of restaurants to choose from, even if the amount of new developments remains pretty anemic as it is today, that being about 30% of our new restaurant mix right now. So not trying to tip our hats to what we're going to do really in 2013 or 2014, but we do feel very confident that we're able to get a really strong and fairly numerous real estate portfolio.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jack, just one more on the food cost inflation for the year, how does this flow, what are you expecting for food cost inflation in the first quarter? And is there a big difference first half versus second half?","John R. Hartung","Yes, Joe. I don't know that I can give you a precise, reliable answer. But we think that if you start with the 32 2 in the fourth quarter, we think this mid-single-digit inflation that I talked about will happen throughout the year. So if it happens evenly throughout the year, I mean, at the orderly, and it never happens that orderly, mid-single digits is somewhere in that 150, 160 range or so, it might be 40 basis points or so each quarter. That might be one orderly way to do it. And again, it's not likely to be that orderly but that might be one way to think about it. We don't think -- it certainly not going to hit all in the first quarter. We don't think it's all going to be backloaded either. So probably somewhere in between.","Operator","We'll go next to Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the comments you made about the new development. First of all, the fact that these are so high, is that anything to do with where you're developing them? Obviously, I know you seem to be everywhere now in New York City. I guess, the question is, is there any -- is there real variance across geographically or in new versus developing markets in terms of essentially the need and economics? And then I have one more follow-up.","Montgomery F. Moran","Yes. The answer is that our new store openings are consistently excellent throughout all of our proven markets throughout the entire country. So we don't see weakness in a particular region and strength in a particular region. We're just very happy about how they're opening everywhere. Of course, there is and always has been a significant difference between how we open in the markets that the call proven markets and the markets that we call developing markets. So that remains true today. So there is a significant difference between that. But even in the developing markets, we're very happy with our openings. We're very happy with the comps that we're showing as those stores mature, and we're very happy with our ability to take more risks in those markets with our A Model strategy otherwise to continue to move them towards becoming proven markets themselves. You had a follow-up?","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great, okay. Yes, can you just give me a sense -- you mentioned on throughput, how it will be, really, kind of the rubber will hit the road in spring. Can you give a sense, I think in the past, we've heard you say average transactions in your peak hours something like 110. Can you just give me a sense of how that might vary between the really peak months, April through July, and then what will come through with winter?","Montgomery F. Moran","Yes, I mean, it softens in winter so that our average -- our peak hour transactions are sort of more in the 100 range during the winter months. And during the summer months, it's historically gotten up sort of more in that 110 to 115 range. So that gives you an idea of what the differences in terms of the peak hour averages. And obviously, with this coming spring and summer season, we hope to set some new records in those areas because of our new emphasis on this and our excellent restaurant teams.","Operator","We'll hear next from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First just, Jack, just a clarification and then I have a separate question. But on the commodity basket in the last quarter, there was some confusion in terms of the laddering of the commodity inflation through the year and I think you just made a very telling and clarifying comment. But just to make certain, I mean, at the end of this year, in kind of that 32 2 range, I know you guys don't think about it year-over-year, but rather sequentially through the year. Might understand then that, perhaps, in the first quarter, if everything was orderly, which obviously usually isn't, but we should assume like 40 basis point increase each quarter so that we would push into the mid-32s and the high-32s and the low- to mid-33s sequentially as they move through the 4 quarters? And does that take into account that fact that -- it sounds like you've seen perhaps some recent easing in the commodity inflation basket? And I have a follow up.","John R. Hartung","Yes, we have seen some easing, Jeff. But the easing has been like in the produce and dairy items, we've seen easing seasonality because of avocados. But when we look ahead, we think that's going to be offset by inflation, higher cost in mostly our meats, beef in particular, as well as with our rice and our beans. And so overall, we think that the easing's going to be more than offset. We think that, that's going to have, by the end of next year, it'll have the kind of that mid-single-digit inflation impact, and I think you're thinking about it right that there would be a piece of inflation in the first quarter, another piece additive in the second and another piece in the third. So by the time you get to that fourth quarter, we would expect somewhere in that mid-single-digit inflation on top of the 32.2% that we saw in the fourth quarter. That will be a reasonable way to think about it if, in fact, it is orderly.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Of course. Which is not likely, I guess. And then separately on the sales-driving initiatives, I'm just wondering if you could give any kind of update specific to the menu board, whether it be pushing to a protein beyond your core, whether it be shrimp or otherwise, or whether there's any update on thoughts around breakfast as you've had success and on the airport tests. Just wondering if we think about the expansion of the menu board behind its current state.","M. Steven Ells","Well, Jeff, as you know, for the last -- we'll be 19 years come July, we've had basically the same menu, and we've had one 10-year period of double-digit same-store sales growth and we're now in another -- a pretty strong period of same-store sales growth, double-digit. And I think one of the reasons that we continue to grow so strongly is because we continue to improve our core offerings, which is what people come for. We have experimented here and there with a new menu item. We've tried soup. We've tried chili. We've tried smaller menu items, single taco, things like this. But it seems that people keep coming back for their chicken burrito or their barbacoa tacos or whatever it is that they've landed on. And the thing that I think keeps people coming back is that we have a commitment to improving the quality of the food, not only the taste of the food, but the impacts on environment and health and animal welfare. And these messages are becoming more and more relevant with people. So I think we've done a very good job staying focused, which makes the food taste better and allows us to have this very, very efficient economic engine, which has allowed us to invest disproportionately back into the quality raw ingredients and our top-performing people. And so I think it's a good system and I don't see that there's any reason to add something like shrimp tacos or roll out breakfast now. In fact, maybe something like that could even be detrimental to the model. Although that being said, now and again, we experiment with stuff.","Operator","We'll hear next from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I could just quickly revisit first the throughput question. I think, Monty, you said you're now having more comps coming from the peak hour than nonpeak, but you never quantified that. So at the prior peak in '07, was that, therefore, 100% of your comp or virtually all of it coming from that? And what is it reduced to and what do you think you can get it back to as a proportion of your total comp growth in this spring, let's say.","Montgomery F. Moran","No, no. Yes, if I said that, I did not mean to say it. So let me clarify it. When we look at our comp, you can break it down to every single hour of our business. From the time we open to the time we close, you can look at how did we do from 11:00 a.m. to noon this year compared to last year. How we did we do -- well, you could also look at how we did from 3:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon compared to last year. And if you look at every one of those hours and break it up and you take the total, that total is the store's comp transactions. What we do is we look at that and break it down and just kind of find out, where is the comp coming from? We've never had the time where 100% of the comp difference came from just the peak lunch hour. That's not what happens. I mean, it typically is moving from one part of the day to another. Over in fact, during 2010 and '11, we found that a lot of our comps came from the off-hours, the sort of what we call shoulder hours that aren't the peak lunch, that aren't the peak dinner, but where people are either knowing that we have a long line at lunch and choosing to come later in the afternoon. Or just more people are coming to our restaurants generally and we're able to serve them then quite easily because the lines aren't that long. In terms of measuring throughput, one thing we like to look at is how much of a contribution to our overall comp can we accomplish during the peak lunch hour when lines are very, very long and where we might otherwise have to turn people away. In other words, lunch can be a bottleneck and it's possible, theoretically, that you could have a store comping quite well, but has no comp coming from the peak lunch hour. Some of our stores show that, in fact, they have a slow comp at the peak lunch hour even though their overall comp is pretty good. We don't want that to be the case because we know that lunch is a very, very favorable place from which to mine additional sales, because if we eliminate the line at lunch through greater speed, we know there's more people behind those folks who will come and eat at Chipotle and that's great. So what I said was -- what I tried to say, let me clarify, is that in December of 2011 versus October of 2011, we saw -- and versus the earlier months in 2011, we saw an increase in the amount of the comp that was coming from that peak lunch hour. It was contributing more of a share to the comp, if you will. So it's not that, that's where it's all coming from. Every -- in fact, when we look at the analysis, every single part of the day, every single hour of business showed a positive comp. And was making a positive contribution to the overall comps. Again, hypothetically, it's very possible that one part of the day could be negative on comps. You could be slower at lunch and lunch could be driving a negative 2 comp and the store could still be doing an 80% comp. That's not the case. Every single part of the day was positive and lunch was comparatively more positive than they had been in previous months, which leads us to believe we're doing a pretty good job.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then the question was really how much more can you quantify the increase in the lunch comp or contribution of the total comp coming from that peak hour versus prior. How much did it improve?","John R. Hartung","Well, we really hesitant to go there because we're talking about a very short period of time and it's very much a moving target. So I'd rather not get into the actual details of those numbers until we have the season under our belt and then I can start discussing with you guys what we're seeing in terms of numbers month over month.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just one final question. At what stage do you begin to put people in Europe and the U.K., for example, that aren't in the restaurants? Are you at the stage when you might start putting someone in advance to scout locations or source food? How much investment, do you think, over the next, say, 2 years do you plan there?","Montgomery F. Moran","Well, we already have someone on the ground devoted to development. Rex Jones, who was our development Director before Bob Blessing took over as Chief Development Officer, is now on the ground there in Europe and has been involved since the first lease that we signed there. In terms of sourcing the food, our 2 Restaurateurs are actually doing the sourcing of the ingredients, and in many cases, going directly to farms to meet farmers, develop relationships, much the same way we did with farmers here at Niman Ranch and other places, too. We don't anticipate we need to have anyone on the ground to be in the purchasing department for the next couple of years at least because the supply chain is actually -- it's been relatively easy setting up these supplies. So again, a lot of autonomy on the shoulders of the Restaurateurs, but they're doing a great, great job and we will open up the subsequent restaurants there, having the managers do a lot of this work that the current ones are doing.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

We refer you to the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Q for a discussion of these risks.","I'd also like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period will begin on the sixteenth day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the second quarter of 2018, it will begin June 16 and continue through our second quarter earnings release.","Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which can be found on the presentations page of the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will start today's call with some brief prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will allow plenty of time at the end of those remarks for questions. In the room and also available during the Q&A period are Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Chris Brandt, Chief Marketing Officer; Laurie Schalow, Chief Communications Officer; and, Marissa Andrada, Chief Human Resources Officer.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be talking to you today on my first earnings call with Chipotle. Chipotle is such a strong brand with incredible equity built over the last 25 years, and I couldn't be more excited about our future. One thing is very clear to me, consumers love our great tasting food and appreciate that our food is made with integrity. I have admired Chipotle for many years and I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the future direction of this incredible company.","Before I get into the details of this call, I'd like to start by recognizing Steve Ells for creating this amazing concept. And for the last 25 years, leading it to become one of the most important restaurant brands of our time. I thank Steve for the invaluable time he spent bringing me up to speed over the past several weeks, and I deeply appreciate him fully handing over the reins to me and giving me the autonomy to lead, innovate, and create the new strategy that will ensure our growth for the future. Going forward, Steve has embraced his new role as Executive Chairman. We're fortunate to be able to leverage his creativity and expertise as a culinarian, a visionary and our founder.","For those of you who don't know me very well, I'd like to share some of my key beliefs and leadership principles, so you know what to expect going forward. I believe it is important to focus on results over activity, to hold people accountable, and to be stewards of our business. I believe in the power of innovation and that to be successful we must create and lead change. I also believe in a winning work ethic and that to win we need to have an external focus with the ability to quickly read and react to change. And I believe in the power of people so it's important to me that we create a culture that is focused on running and supporting great restaurants, putting the customer first, living our purpose, innovating for today and tomorrow, and supporting and recognizing each other.","Before I share my view on what changes we need to make, I thought I would start by telling you what is not going to change. We will continue to serve high quality, great tasting food that consumers crave. We will also continue to focus on improving operations and fixing and modernizing the foundation of our company. With that said you will see us doubling down on our purpose and our guest experience. We will get better at innovation and putting customers front and center. We will focus on execution, which rests on simple choices, clear goals and consistent measures. We are also upgrading our capabilities to innovate across our business. Specifically, we will provide greater consumer access including through delivery and catering, enhance the digital experience, innovate around our menu, and improve our restaurant design. We're working on building a world class executive team and an organization built for growth. In the last year, we've added new leaders across operations, communications, marketing, and human resources.","Since our last earnings announcement, we added Chris Brandt as Chief Marketing Officer and just this week, Marissa Andrada joined Chipotle as Chief Human Resources Officer. Chris Brandt is a seasoned veteran and is quickly assessing the changes needed across marketing, so we can get back to emphasizing the craveability of our food and expanding brand loyalty among consumers. Having worked with Chris in the past, I can vouch for his proven track record of delivering innovation that is good for consumers and operations and that provides the financial outcomes needed to grow transactions and sales. I'm confident Chris will quickly find ways to increase our brand relevance and ensure our advertising spend is working harder for us. Marissa Andrada has extensive experience in senior human resource roles in prominent consumer brands and I'm excited that she has joined our team. Marissa's leadership will be essential as we look to strengthen our organization, and ensure we have the right structuring capabilities to achieve our strategy and build a culture of innovation and recognition. We are creating a path to performance and we are in the process of establishing the strategies to get there. I plan to share more details with you on a special call before our next earnings announcement with more details around how we will do these five things.","First, grow sales, transactions, margin, and restaurants. Second, elevate our brand relevance and further our brand purpose. Third, build the right structure and capabilities to sustain performance. Fourth, create a people recognition and innovation culture. And fifth, run great restaurants that deliver best-in-class financial performance.","In the coming months you will see us piloting various tests across key innovation focus areas such as consumer access, the digital experience, our menu and restaurant experience, and realigning the organization to support the go-forward strategy. I do want to acknowledge that there's a lot of great work underway and we are starting to get some traction. Curt Garner's work on the mobile app is paying dividends, and I'm excited about the continued benefits of the digitally enhanced second make-line, which is now in 237 restaurants. Order accuracy has improved in those restaurants, leading to a nearly 20% improvement in customer feedback.","Digital sales are our fastest growing area with growth of 20% year-over-year and now represent 8.8% of sales in the first quarter. The customer experience with mobile sales is also improving as our average wait times for mobile orders are down by more than half since launching Smarter Pickup Times. Curt and I are excited to continue driving progress in these areas which we believe will help us bring Chipotle to more people in ways that customers appreciate.","We are seeing improvements in operations under Scott Boatwright's leadership. I've spent a lot of time in restaurants with Scott over the last several weeks and I'm impressed with our teams and their dedication to operational excellence. The plans Scott put in place last fall have created a culture of accountability in the field, our design provide a great guest experience, and are built on a strong foundation of food safety. Most importantly, our customers are noticing and I'm confident we are focused on the right measures. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm optimistic about the future of Chipotle. We have a strong economic model, a loyal customer base, and a powerful purpose.","With that, I look forward to sharing more details with you on the special call I mentioned earlier.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jack Hartung to provide a financial update.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our performance in the first quarter as comp sales accelerated slightly, margins expanded, and earnings per share grew. And though it was a solid quarter, we realize we have much more work ahead. Since Brian's arrival, we've been taking a fresh look at every element of our business. We're committed to running great restaurants; putting our customers first; staying true to our purpose; embracing innovation in menu, digital, access and restaurants; improving our execution capabilities; and strengthening our culture internally. We're confident that these are the right areas of focus to drive strong performance and increase shareholder value on a sustainable long-term basis.","Before I go through the financial results, I want to highlight some important operational accomplishments this quarter. As Brian mentioned, Scott's plan to instill a culture of accountability in the field is starting to get the attention of our customers, as internal customer satisfaction scores have increased significantly since last summer. Employee turnover at the crew level has improved to the best levels we've seen in many years. We have much more to do, but the culture of accountability, the heightened focus on training, and the improved leadership structure in the field is beginning to drive results that are precursors to sustained comp sales improvement.","Brian highlighted the strong improvement in our digital sales, which grew 20% year-over-year and now accounts for 8.8% of total sales. Mobile sales alone grew 41% year-over-year. And these orders are all fulfilled on our second make-line, which we believe to be a competitive advantage and that we will continue to invest in to make the customer experience as convenient as possible, allowing us to continue to grow digital sales. The majority of second make-line orders are app and web orders, but also include third-party delivery orders and catering. The surge in mobile sales since relaunching our app late last year gives us confidence that our customers appreciate the great experience. We're proud to say that we were notified just this week that we won the People's Choice Webby Award for best user interface for a mobile app. The Webby is an award for excellence on the Internet and is one of the most prestigious industry awards.","Catering is approximately 1% of sales and remains a large untapped opportunity on which we have increased our focus. We recently expanded catering delivery availability to 1,500 restaurants from 940, and on average, we see about a 15% lift in catering sales when we add delivery. And we're decreasing group size minimums and we're testing lower per person pricing options to expand our catering reach.","Our delivery sales continue to grow at a rapid pace. And when our delivery partners offer free delivery at Chipotle to build their customer base, our customers respond in a big way, as they did during Super Bowl weekend when delivery volumes increased nearly 250%. We'll continue to expand the number of delivery partners we work with, and we'll look to partner with them to offer compelling options to our customers.","Turning to financial results, we generated revenue of $1.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of 7.4% from last year on comp sales growth of 2.2%. And that's on top of last year's 17% Q1 comp sales. Restaurant level margins for the quarter were 19.5%, an improvement of 180 basis points from last year. And earnings per share increased 33% to $2.13. The Q1 comp of 2.2% is comprised of an underlying comp sales growth for the quarter of 2.7%, and that's before the 50 basis point impact from Chiptopia as we've lapped deferred revenue from Chiptopia in Q1 of last year. Comp sales were driven by higher average check, primarily from the price increase taken since Q1 of last year. The price increases averaged about 5% across the menu and resistance has been less than 20%. The check average also benefited from customers adding queso to their order which added about 200 basis points.","April trends have been impacted by unseasonably cold and wintery weather in much of the country as well as the Easter shift, but taking these impacts into account, underlying April comp transaction trends are similar to Q1. Now keep in mind that we started lapping the first price increase from last year on April 15, which accounted for about 1% of the sales comp. Based on comp trends through the first quarter, we are reiterating our full year comp sales guidance in the low single digits with lower sales comps expected in the first half the year due to tougher comparisons. Now this guidance does not include any projected impact from the sales growth strategies we're currently developing, as it is too early to determine the timing and magnitude of the impact these strategies may have on the comp.","We opened 35 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect 130 to 150 new openings for the full year. We're in the early stages of building our pipeline for 2019, and while it's too early to provide specific opening range for 2019, we expect to open at or above the 2018 opening level. We're pleased with the strong performance of our new restaurants this year, and we'll continue to emphasize high quality, high returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline.","Food costs during the quarter were 32.4%, and that was down 140 basis points from the 33.8% last year, and that's down from 34.2% in Q4. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and efficiencies in paper and packaging. We expect relatively stable prices for the rest of 2018 across most items, resulting in food cost at or below the 33% range for the full year. Now this full year estimate is higher than the Q1 due to the seasonal shift to source avocados from California which will start in Q2.","Labor costs for the quarter were 27.8%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Wage inflation of 5% was offset by the price increase but deleverage from negative transactions along with the Chiptopia revenue deferral drove the higher labor as a percent of sales. We expect labor costs to improve in the low to mid 27% range in Q2 as we move into our seasonally higher sales months. And we expect labor for the full year to approach 28% as crew and manager merit increases combined with general wage pressures continue to outpace the comp. Occupancy costs for the quarter were 7.4% or flat with last year, and we expect full year to be in a similar range.","Other operating costs were 12.9% of sales, down from 14.1% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were only 1.8% in the quarter which is a decrease of about 150 basis points compared to last year. We still anticipate marketing and promo costs to be right around 3% of sales for the full year with elevated spending for the remainder of the year. And while Chris and the marketing team are still working on their plan for Q2 and the rest of the year, we would expect marketing and promo will be in the 3.5% to 4% range in Q2. Other operating costs included about 30 basis points of incremental maintenance and repair costs that we discussed on the last call. And we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level during 2018.","G&A for the quarter was $77 million, or 6.7% of sales, an increase from 6.5% last year. This was lower than expected due to stock comp forfeitures of around $4 million and the 2018 equity grant that was done very late in the quarter. With normalized stock comp in Q2, total G&A is expected to be around $7 million higher, around $84 million, and that run rate puts us on target to hit the $330 million G&A for the full year, which was communicated last quarter. Underlying G&A in the quarter increased $8 million compared to last year to support our growth as well as several initiatives including new formalized training programs and operational changes in the field. This increase comes after three years of flat G&A despite opening up 650 restaurants. As we fully develop our strategic plan to strengthen our unit economic and drive sustainable sales growth, we may need to adjust how and where we invest our G&A. As such these G&A estimates for the second quarter and the full year are subject to change and we'll update you on any known changes during the special investor call Brian mentioned earlier.","Depreciation was 4.1% of sales for the quarter, an increase from 3.7% last year. We expect depreciation to remain at about 4% for several quarters as we accelerate the depreciation for items expected to be replaced related to the maintenance and repair refresh, as well as other capital initiatives that we described on the last call. Our pre-tax income was $94.2 million, and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9%. I'd like to spend a few more minutes than I normally would on this tax rate to put it in the right context.","First of all, the actual tax rate we expect to pay the government is around 28.8%, not 36.9%. This tax rate of 36.9% includes about 810 basis points, the bulk of which are non-economic accounting items related to stock-compensation issues in previous years. In essence, during the quarter we wrote off deferred tax assets related to previously issued stock-comp because the related performance shares either did not vest, and so they expired, or the shares vested at a much lower value. So, the related deferred tax asset on our balance sheet needed to be written off or written down and the write-off flows through the tax expense line. We expect no such write-off in Q2 and Q3, so our effective tax rate is expected to be around 28.8% in those quarters. During the fourth quarter, additional performance shares may expire, and if they do, we'll write-off the related deferred tax assets for those awards. Again, we'll not actually pay a higher tax rate, but the write-off will flow through the tax line. We expect the tax rate including this write-off in Q4 will be around 38.4%.","Before I leave the discussion on taxes I want to briefly walk through the components of our underlying tax rate. There are five key components that roll up to the underlying rate. First, our federal tax rate is the statutory 21%. Second, our state tax rate is about 5.6% and it's higher than last year's rate because of the lower federal rate. That takes our rate to 26.6%. Third, we lost part of the deduction for free meals we give to our restaurant teams which adds 1.3% to the rate. That takes us to 27.9%. Fourth, about 1.6% is added related to the tax law change, where all named executive officer compensation over $1 million is not deductible. And fifth, our rate is reduced by about 60 basis points for employer wage credits and other miscellaneous items. And that gets us to the 28.8% I mentioned earlier. For the full year, taking into account \u2013 taking all this into account and adding about 4% on an annual basis for the non-economic write-off of deferred tax items I talked about earlier, we estimate that the 2018 effective full-year tax rate will be around 33%.","We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $580 million in cash and investments, and we generated $200 million in cash from operations.","During the first quarter, we repurchased $68 million of our stock at an average price of $311 per share and we spent $58 million on capital investments outlined on the previous call. We still expect opportunistically to repurchase shares throughout the year, invest in the capital items we discussed on the last call, and maintain a cash and investments balance of about $500 million.","As I mentioned on the last earnings call, the overall guidance we provided then and we're reiterating today, does not factor in any potential strategic changes arising from hiring a new CEO. As Brian mentioned earlier, we will need to realign the organization in order to support and execute our updated strategy. We also plan to carefully analyze underperforming assets during the second quarter. This organizational review and the asset review will likely entail some one-time costs in 2018 that are too early to quantify, but these initiatives are intended to support and strengthen our economic model and set us up to execute our strategic plan and deliver long-term shareholder value. We'll share more details with you later this quarter.","We're encouraged by our first quarter results and we're optimistic about the direction we're headed. We're confident that the changes we're making to our leadership and the realignment of our organization will enable us to be more nimble and more innovative in all areas: customer access, digital, menu, and the restaurant environment, and will allow us to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees, and our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details about our plans on our special investor call which will be scheduled some time before our Q2 earnings call.","Operator, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Nicole M. Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you, good afternoon. Jack, a quick one for you. Did you reiterate CapEx? We were going pretty quick through the numbers, so I just wanted to check that. I wanted to check that real quick, and then ask Brian a quick question.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Nicole, the CapEx right now we expect will be about the same as we outlined on the last call. It's going to be in the neighborhood of $300 million. About one-third of that is new stores. The other two-thirds is existing stores. The big items there is the refresh that we talked about, which is about $50 million. Another big piece was about $45 million for the digitized second make-line, and then there's another \u2013 a number of other things that we outlined on the last call, but those are still intact now. Nicole, just like I mentioned, our guidance hasn't taken into account the impact of strategies. It's possible that we may refine that or adjust that throughout the year, and we'll give you a full recap on any changes when we talk to you before the next earnings call.","Nicole M. Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thank you. And then, Brian, just a big picture question for you, and thanks for your time. Do you see this as a recovery story or global growth opportunity, just curious how you see this playing out long-term? And you talked about five pieces you want to execute, could you give us any little detail before the next call on maybe some of the low-hanging fruit versus longer-term solutions? Thank you.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Nicole. First, I think the opportunity is clearly a recovery story in the U.S. and we'll be focused on taking what I believe is a powerful brand that has really strong economics, strong purpose, that when we tie the elements that I outlined in my earlier comments, and we'll go into much further detail on our special call, I think the opportunity is really exciting for what this brand has in front of it. The innovation will be across the business, as I mentioned, in access, digital, menu, and frankly, we'll double-down on our fundamentals. So, I think it's a story of recovery, and then where that recovery takes us I think is also really exciting, but that's much longer-term discussion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird & Co. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. Brian, just a couple of questions kind of high level how you're thinking about how this plays out over the next few years. Are you thinking, I guess, directionally that you're going to need to make a lot of investments in the business? I know you talked about realigning the structure, but do you think there's going to be a big step up in expenses related to that? And then secondly, I know Jack mentioned next year you'd open a similar number of units, or maybe a little higher, but how are you thinking about unit growth as you execute this turnaround strategy? Do you think you need to slow or moderate the unit growth in the out-years to accomplish what you're envisioning? Thanks.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. Okay, thanks, David. Your first question, I think, we can get into all the details of how we see the plan playing out forward. I think some of the good news is, though, as I've looked into the business, like a great area of focus the people have been asking about is our marketing spend. And I think the marketing spend is one of those areas that we believe there's a lot of opportunity to take those dollars that we're currently allocating and make the brand much more visible with what we have. And then we're going to put in place more of a test-and-learn approach on the initiatives that will roll out, so, we'll have clarity on what we believe the return is for the investment that we're making before we make those decisions to go beyond our current plans. So, I think the recovery plan that we'll be putting in place, or as I talked about earlier, our path to performance will be based on leveraging the idea of testing, improving out propositions, while at the same token with our organization we build capability and we restructure to support the strategy that I believe will set us up for growth in the near term and longer term.","Your second question regarding units, the good news is the economics of the units that we're opening continue to look very strong, and as mentioned in the script, we see no reason for us to change the pace that we are experiencing this year, and obviously, as we get further into our plan, we'll give the appropriate updates as the time permits when it's right to do that.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you and congratulations, Brian, on the new role. I wanted to ask two, if I may. One is about the quarter that just passed, and then sort of going forward. So, in terms of the quarter that just passed, I guess I was surprised at what appears to be a fairly quick impact you might have be having, a couple of things that we've seen are maybe new creative around marketing and then a waste management initiative that looks like it has some pretty big opportunities in terms of \u2013 in restaurant waste management. So, I guess, from my perspective to what extent is this you, Brian, kind of putting your stamp already on that and do you see a lot of low-hanging fruit like what some of these initiatives seem to suggest, just in terms of sort of basic systematic approaches? So that was question one. And then question two, if you could just talk a little bit about what you meant by consumer meaningful innovation across the business in the context of what's always been a very simple, straightforward menu and the operations that go with that?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So first, obviously thank you for the kind words. Very excited to be in the CEO role at Chipotle. It's loaded with opportunity, which I think is what you're asking about. And what I'll tell you is in the short-term, I think, there are real opportunities for us to make simple pivots to increase, I think, the appeal of our brands to those customers that are already very much big fans. One of the big surprises for me, frankly, even once it got announced that I was taking this role, was the amount of people that reached out just saying how much they love Chipotle and they love the food. And I think just with the most recent advertising we made a little pivot towards reminding people what is great about the ingredients.","This Food With Integrity purpose really resonates and reminding people why they feel good about eating Chipotle, I think, is always a good approach. So, you'll continue to see us make simple pivots like that while we also continue to push this brand forward in a big way from the standpoint of access, as it relates to digital innovation; menu, as it relates to menu innovation that leverages our operating model, which I believe is something very special in this industry and allows us to do a lot of exciting things, whether it's day parts or simple menu tweaks that I think will broaden the appeal. And then obviously on \u2013 I think, you were kind of mentioning your question about waste management and such. Look, there's always opportunities to be better on the cost side and we're going to continue to look for those opportunities along the way. Because that just frees up the ability to give the customer more of what they want and our team members a better experience to provide the experience we want them to provide. So, lots of opportunities I think in the short-term. We're going to be very cognizant of what are the things we pace in sequence in the near term and what are the things we put in to test to ensure we're focusing on the right things over the next 18 to 24 months.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, that's very, very helpful. Thank you.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Jack, a quick question on the restaurant level margin. I know you've beat by a good amount in the first quarter. I think, some of that as you mentioned with marketing will catch up as the year goes on. Are you still looking for 17.5% to 18.5% for the year? And then longer term, I guess, with \u2013 Brian, with your leadership, I mean, how do you think about the long-term restaurant level margin at Chipotle as you talk about new day parts balancing sales versus margin?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Sharon. On the margin range, listen, we had a very nice quarter. It was aided by lower marketing \u2013 and the good news is Brian and Chris to the extent they came in and were able to look at what marketing was doing, they were able to redirect dollars, so they weren't spent. And so that's kind of dry powder. So that's dry powder that we have for future quarters. I think that's a very good thing. I would say the range of 17.5% to 18.5% now appears quite conservative. I don't know that I would change it. I think what I would do is say we're going to probably hit for the year at the high end that. Could we beat it slightly? Sure. I just wouldn't want to call it a victory just yet but getting out of the gates this strong does show that we have some great margin potential.","And then you wanted to know in terms of margin potential going forward. If you want general margin potential, Sharon, I can answer that. I still think that our margins are going to be highly contingent around volume. Like, for example, if we're in this 18.5% to 19% or so for this year, if we get up to $2.2 million volume, we could do a 22% margin. If we get to a $2.4 million volume, we could do a 24% margin. So, really the biggest lever to pull is bringing more customers in. If we bring more customers in we know that our model levers up pretty significantly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much and, Brian, good to hear your voice again. Congratulations. Two questions. One is when you look at the brand and you've looked at it from afar and now you're looking at it from the inside, how do you think about the price value relationship in this business versus the one you came from? Is there an opportunity for example to broaden the price value relationship so you can capture more customers? Are you happy with kind of the price value? So, think about just how you think about that price value equation for the brand going forward. And maybe just secondly, in your mind, what's the right timeframe for us to look at your initiatives that you're contemplating and how they're going to play out? In other words, is this a year of investment and the impact is really felt in 2019 or do you think there can be some meaningful impact and changes inside of 2018?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, well, thanks and good to hear your voice as well. Look, here's what I would tell you is, the value proposition at Chipotle is tremendously strong. And now with that said, we will always be looking for innovation that continues to enhance that value proposition. The most important thing I think you can do for a healthy value proposition is to never get complacent on where you stand. So, we will be on the side of the consumer making sure that we give them the value proposition that excites them to come back over and over again. So, all the initiatives we'll be talking about, one of the ways that you make sure it's consumer relevant is it rings the bell for our customer on that value proposition. Whether that value proposition takes place in mobile, digital, loyalty, menu, access, those are all important things. So that's the one piece. You're second question about timeline. Look, here's what I would tell you is as opportunities present themselves, we will walk through those opportunities to grow the business. As we find opportunities that yield even bigger benefits through testing and learning and iterating, those things will probably take a little bit longer. But I think there are simple wins on our way to our path to what I think is going to be really accelerated opportunities in the future. So that's how I think about it. It's really a combination of both. We'll find some singles on our ways to finding home runs.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, obviously looking forward to the call that we're going to get in a month or two months with some more detail on this, but thinking about that call, is that something that's really going to be focused on where are the opportunities at the margin level, or to drive sales? Or should we be also thinking about there's going to be discussion of any sort of more structural changes, whether that's the balance sheet, is refranchising something that you're considering? How should we think about kind of what's on the table, or topics for discussion there?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, what I would tell you is we're going to use that special call as the opportunity to give clarity even further into the strategy, the structure necessary to execute that strategy, and what those key focus areas are to put Chipotle on the path to performance that we believe is highly attainable. So, it will be comprehensive. And I think, you'll find it will be choiceful. And I think, there's power in simplicity, power in choice and power in a focused organization. So obviously it will be a comprehensive discussion and the good news is we'll have our entire leadership team present to be able to really discuss our path forward.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you. And congratulations again, Brian. Two things. One just on the comp recovery maybe from an outsider or actually most recently a competitor's perspective, I'm just wondering in your view what do you think's been the greatest impediment to the Chipotle recovery over the past couple of years? Hence, I guess, which of these initiatives you're talking about will be the most impactful I guess is a different way to look at it. And then the second question was just on the fact that you came from Taco Bell, which obviously there's lots of laterals, but the one thing that's quite different is Taco Bell being close to 100% franchise model, now you're in a 100% company operated model. Just wondering qualitatively how do you \u2013 how does the approach differ, whether you look at it as just pros and cons to the franchising versus the company operated side. I'm just wondering as you now come into your new role, how you have to think about things differently in that perspective? Thank you.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So, look, I think to answer your first question, Chipotle, smartly, under Scott Boatwright's leadership has refocused the fundamentals in running these restaurants. We put clarity into roles. We've put focus on throughput and we've also put high expectations on the guest experience and the food experience we're going to provide. Those fundamentals are critical whether you own the restaurants or whether you franchise them to people. So there really is no tradeoff in what are the fundamentals to having a great restaurant? The other thing that I think Scott's done very well is he's put in a culture of accountability and a culture where people know they can count on each other to train, support and grow. And I think that is a foundational element for any upside that we will experience in this business.","We can never lose sight on running great restaurants and having great people that lead those restaurants and supporting them with a wonderful culture and tremendous opportunities. So that's the first piece. The second piece is I think the brand has been invisible. So, I think, if you combine great fundamentals in the restaurant with now a visible brand that has a powerful purpose and really craveable food, it's a recipe for a lot of opportunity that can play well in the ways that customers want to eat food today, and I believe how they want to eat food in the future. So, I'm tremendously excited about the fundamentals that we are maniacally focused on, coupled with identifying how we make this brand much more visible and get a narrative back out there in explaining what makes our brand different, what makes our brand connect with people, feel good about the way they eat and live, and why they can feel great about carrying the badge of Chipotle with them.","Oh, and I think, you had a question on franchising. You know, we see no need to go down that path right now, given the economic model that we have and the returns that we get with building new restaurants. So \u2013 but thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bitner from Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you and, of course, congratulations, Brian, as well from me. I have two questions for you guys, both on just how you're thinking about the asset base. Jack, you talked about an asset base review. First of all, is there an initial smell test you are doing on the unit economic threshold required to earn the right to stay in the asset base that you can talk to us about? And then, Brian, you talked about looking at your unit base and improving the accessibility of it. Could the implementation of drive-thrus play a role in the accessibility strategy where it makes sense or is accessibility really just focused solely on digital? And I ask that question just in the spirit of where you came from, obviously seeing the benefits of drive-thrus. Thanks.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Brian, I'll address the first question on the asset base. No, we haven't changed our threshold for what is a high-returning asset. What we're looking at, though, is we had a number of restaurants that, before the drop in sales, were strong cash flow, strong returning stores. We opened a number of restaurants during a tough period where they got off to a slow start. So, our asset review is going to look at all the restaurants that are clear underperformers, and these would be negative cash flow stores. So, we're not looking at stores that are positive cash flow that the return is a little underperforming. We're going to look at stores that \u2013 restaurants are not cash flowing, that maybe we picked the wrong site, maybe they got off to a wrong start and made a bad first impression, and it's going to be difficult if not impossible to change that.","And to you give you an order of magnitude, the review, while we're still in the middle of it, we're looking at something less than 100 restaurants. So, it's not a huge list of restaurants, but that's kind of the total population that we're looking at. We'll review each and every one of them and we'll look at the whole story from a financial standpoint, from a real estate standpoint, from a what kind of first impression did we make, and then we'll make some very careful choices about what to do with the assets.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Brian, this is Brian. So, your second question regard to access. You know, look, I think innovation and access, obviously you are not surprised by the idea that look, digital is a key piece of the puzzle, right? Whether it's through the mobile access, delivery as access, also kiosks as access, catering as access. I mean I love the list that I'm rattling off here. The trick for us is figuring out what comes first and how we prioritize it accordingly. Now, drive-thrus I think are an interesting proposition for Chipotle as an element. It'll be something that will definitely be a part of our access innovation program, but that's in the scheme of what's going to happen in the very near-term versus what's more of a longer-term access innovation play. Drive-thru would fall further on that longer-term scale.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. My first question is on the \u2013 for Jack, versus what you guided in February on the restaurant margins, it came in about 3 to 3.5 points better than expected, and we can see what is going to happen over the course of the year with COGS and labor expense, but a lot of that came from other operating expenses in this quarter, and I know that 150 bps was related to the ad spend shift, so, I'm curious what else in that line item would look better over the course of the year? Is that just not doing the maintenance or is there something else that's just looking better than you anticipated in that line item?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, yeah, thanks, Matt. The food costs behaved really well. Avocados were something that took a bite out of our margins last year. They got better late in the fourth quarter and then they got better again. And you hear us talk about avocados kind of almost every year. It has a big impact when it goes up and down. Nearly 50% of our transactions include guacamole. And so, when prices shoot up, which by the way, they shot up from something below $30 a case to nearly $80 a case for part of the fourth quarter. So, they've come back to kind of normal prices. If they stay at normal prices, we should have a decent food cost during the year. Labor is kind of the same story in terms of wage inflation continues. We expect it to continue, and so, the guidance I gave you, I think, is very reasonable guidance. So, I think, we got off to a great start. I think the comments that Brian made about Scott and the field, our field teams did a great job of managing food costs to the extent that it was their job to order the right amount of food, to control food waste, things like that. They did great job. They've done a great job managing labor, as well. So, I think we're off to a great start. I think if we keep these kind of controls, the next big surprise or additive thing would be additional sales. And so, some of the things that Brian mentioned go into test and they test well, and if we put those into more restaurants and we get more sales, we know we have the ability to leverage our margins when we bring more customers in. And that would be the next thing to look for.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. So, Brian, I've heard a lot really from external people that when you look at the supply chain that Chipotle has versus other restaurant chains that just the way that food is prepped and the way that it flows through that supply chain, it always makes it harder to innovate at Chipotle versus other chains. Having been at other restaurant chains, do you feel that there's a big factor that sort of limits your innovation at that company? Or do you see it's kind of just green fields and there's a lot that you can do?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question. Look, I actually think the -- I'll break up your comment. I guess supply chain meaning the ingredients that we use. I see no barrier to innovation. If anything, I see this great ingredients to be able to further distance ourselves from other restaurant alternatives. And then from the standpoint of then finishing that ingredient in the restaurant, it is a really powerful model. I mean if there's one thing that I've been really impressed by is the throughput capability of this line is something really special and unique. And I actually think it's an advantage to figure out how to do innovation that can build from a throughput machine. I don't think there are many places where you could say, well, I can have that great food, done at that speed, and then we can innovate on that foundation or that platform? And you'll see when we're talking about some of the innovation we're talking about. It just takes advantage of what I believe is a competitive advantage. So, I think, we're going to be able to innovate and distance ourselves and really put ourselves into what I believe is something very special that will delight customers and give our team members the ability to execute flawlessly.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Great, thank you.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, I was wondering on that \u2013 actually follow-up on a couple of those comments. If there is some throughput data you're willing to share kind of currently versus a year ago? And then secondly on innovation, not only supply chain, but just the physical plant and now the need for second make-lines. Is the space constraints make it more difficult to innovate or is that sort of an outmoded thought and there's ways to work around that with your fresh eyes viewing the business now?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question. Because the second make-line is actually a huge enabler for our business to take throughput to the next level, frankly. And the reason is we've put digital capability into 250 plus restaurants, but the fact that we already have the second make-line physically there in all our restaurants is a huge opportunity for us to both innovate as well as drive throughput even further on our consumer-facing line as well as our second make-line. That second make-line has some efficiencies that we are delighted that we have in place because as we dial up the innovation in digital and we dial up that off-premise access, it presents a great opportunity for us to really enhance our throughput on both lines.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. And then any throughput numbers you're willing to share or is it a little early for that?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Look, we can probably get into those details. Scott will be available as part of the special call we're going to do and we're happy to take you through that then.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, hi, thank you. Hi, Brian. At Taco Bell, you guys put in both fourth meal, or the so-called late-night day part, as well as breakfast. And we've mentioned day part a couple of different times and I was wondering what that could potentially mean at Chipotle, whether it's different products at different times of the day which can happen certainly within a quick service or a fast-casual type of format, and whether it's possible to have breakfast without a drive-thru or maybe you can put breakfast in just the dense urban stores, while not necessarily putting them in suburban stores. Just thinking about what kind of potential you think day parts really means for the brand at this point.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So, look, I think one of the things that's really exciting about the day part opportunity for Chipotle is today we're opening at 10:30, 10:45 and we're closing roughly around 10:00 PM, and there's opportunities to expand those hours and leverage our existing food and our existing platform in a very seamless fashion. Then when you look at the obvious day parts within those extended hours and you quickly see where there's opportunity where we have some down time where, frankly, I think with some marketing and some product innovation we could turn those down times into transaction-driving times. So, as I think about it right now, there is day part expansion opportunity with our current model and then you layer on some menu innovation coupled with some marketing communication, I see a real ability to drive the existing platform in those day parts without having to take the step today all the way through breakfast and introducing a whole new food platform. So, that's where our thinking is today. Not to say that in the future you may want to even expand those hours further and you need to think about new food platforms, but that's not in the plan right now.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Hey, Brian. First a question on consumer scores. You mentioned something about becoming more consumer-centric. What is the consumer telling you about Chipotle today and the opportunities to improve, perhaps in ways that you've seen the brand deteriorated in those scores, and just in ways that you just feel like it's underachieving? And then separately, just building on that last thing that you mentioned, the operating model, everyone's always assumed that Chipotle's operating model, because they have those limited number of wells in front of us, doesn't have the ability to handle new menu news or even use price because of that simple menu. And those are two tools that you used with great effect in the past, and so, I think people are having a hard time understanding how you're going to use those going forward. So, that comment would be helpful, as well. Thanks.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. So, on your first question regarding the consumer. You know, what we see is a real opportunity to make the brand more visible and be more top of mind with people to remind them why they love Chipotle. When you remind people about the fact that they buy into this idea of Food With Integrity, cultivating a better world, they instantly feel better about the food they're eating. And we make good on that promise. So, I think there's a real opportunity to be much more visible on why you want to be connected to this brand, why do you believe in this brand. And based on the information I'm seeing, that resonates with how people want to eat today and how they will want to eat in the future.","Look, there's also huge opportunities to get people access \u2013 one of their biggest complaints, frankly, is access to the brand. The brand is not that convenient. I know we have 2,400 stores, almost 2,500 stores, we, as a result, are not that convenient to people. So, you've got people saying, hey, when can I do mobile ordering? When can I do delivery? When can I get Chipotle to me? And the good news is more than I think 50% of the people don't even realize that we started to do these things. So, there is tremendous opportunity of educating people on why they should feel good about the brand, why they will love the food, why it's craveable, because it gives them all of the customization, the abundance that they're looking for with the ingredients that they want. And then you combine that with now giving them more access and getting food to them on their terms, it's a really exciting proposition.","Your second question on our ability to innovate. The line has flexibility, so long as we first test and understand the demand that we're generating. If we prepare ourselves for what is going to happen, Scott and his operators will be capable to use our supply chain and our operating model to execute and meet consumers' expectations. Where you run into problems is when you get ahead of a forecast, and one of the things we're going to put in place here is when we are working on innovation, we're going to pilot that innovation so that we can have a prediction of what's going to happen and prepare the operating model accordingly to support it. So, I'm very optimistic about opportunities that just leverage getting more access to what Chipotle is today, and then you add some innovation and I think you broaden the appeal and we have predictability of what that's going to perform, Scott and the operators will be able to execute.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. I have two questions. The first for Brian. Have you looked at portion sizing and your thoughts on whether or not consumers are paying you for your portion sizes now, if there's an opportunity to take that either up or down? And then I think you had also talked about employee turnover coming down recently. Any metrics around that and what do you think is driving that? Have you made any changes on the training front or -- the industry has been going up, and so that would be kind of impressive? I guess, I'm wondering what you guys are doing differently?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. So, the piece on employee turnover, I think that's a testament to Scott putting clarity of what you're supposed to be doing in your role, how you support each other in the restaurant, and then providing clarity of how you can grow in this organization. And people like to stay at places where they believe they're appreciated and they have the opportunity to grow, and that's the culture that we're putting into the restaurants and I think that's why you're seeing our turnover move down. And it's really exciting because the more we can push that turnover down, the more we don't find ourselves retraining the organization and we execute better. It's that simple. So, Marissa, who's new to the team, she's going to be laser-focused on how we drive this culture and training all the way through the restaurant while Scott partners with her to take from a culture of accountability to also a culture of growth. And I think you put those two things together, people will feel highly appreciated and believe that there's a future for them at Chipotle. What was your first question?","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","The first question was just on portion sizing.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Oh, portion sizing.","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. So, look, one of the things clearly that people love about Chipotle is the customization proposition and we're going to continue to figure out how we get more consistent in our execution for people, so that they don't feel like they got too much this time, or they got too little. But one of the things that I love about the experience, and the consumer knows, is we're a place that wants to get them the experience that they're after with their food. And that's not going to change. So, if people want a little more, we'll probably give them a little more. If they want a little less, we'll give them a little less. But regardless whether they're asking for a little more or a little less, one thing Scott is focused on is how do we continue to get more consistent, so people feel like they're getting the experience they got the last time as well then the experience they can count on for the next time. So, that's what we're focused on, is how do we get more consistent with that experience, but we're never going to tell the consumer you can't ask us for a little more or a little less.","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you, and just to echo, Brian, congrats again on the new role. Longer term question for Brian and a short-term one for Jack. So, Brian, as you think about the road ahead, can you help us compare and contrast the starting points? When you look at Taco Bell in 2011 and Chipotle in 2017, what do you think are the different factors at play here that help shape the turnaround, if you will? And then, Jack, you mentioned, as well, the similar comp trends that continued in April. How are you framing that? Just is that looking at it on a geometric three year or how should we think about that? Perhaps just for simplicity, if you just disclose the number, it might be helpful.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","So, why don't I go first, then I'll hand it over to you, Jack. So, look, here's what I believe for Chipotle. I believe the brand has been invisible and I think as the brand becomes visible and we lead culture, that's going to be a huge opportunity going forward. This brand needs to be leading culture, not reacting to it, and the people that are loyal to this brand, that's what they want to be a part of. The other piece that is very exciting about this company is, look, there is limited innovation happening in small scale and the opportunity for us is how do we take some of that innovation to pilot it and get it to a place where we can now do it at scale. And the opportunities, we talked about a few of them, right? They go from access to digital, to menu, to even the restaurant design opportunities going forward. That is huge opportunity.","A brand that has a lot of relevance, that's culturally right in leading, coupled with innovation, built on strong fundamentals that give people great food at a fast experience at a great value. I like the future. I really get excited about that because those are things that I think as we put together this leadership team here with Chris and Scott and Marissa and Jack and Curt and Lori, it is mission one to make this brand visible, and right next to it is be culturally relevant so all the innovation and the fundamentals that we put in place are going to, I think, attract people not only to work here but attract people to continue to be our loyal customers. And that's why I'm excited about the long-term.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","And, Andrew, in terms of what I looked at when I made the comments about April, we look at dollar trends, we looked at what our expectations were, based on what we expected with the Easter shift, what normal seasonality would bring. The weather definitely hit us during parts of the month. I'm sure that's not a surprise to you. From a comp standpoint, we looked at it mainly from a one-year comp standpoint. If you're going to do multiple years, you'd have to go back to three. A two-year trend will not give you anything meaningful. 2016 and 2017 lined up, 2016 was a step down, 2017 was a step up. So, if you wanted to do a three-year layer, you'll probably get in the same ballpark, but for purposes of what we did, we just kept it very, very simple, looked at April compared to where our previous trends were. And underneath it all, it looks like the trends were very similar when you factor weather out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, guys. On the 5% pricing, and then maybe more specifically on longer-term pricing plans in general, I realize it's been a while since Chipotle has taken any meaningful pricing, but 5% is obviously a decent ways ahead of where the rest of the industry is. So, I'm curious, number one, if you plan to change the strategy to be more consistent in terms of low price increases, and number two, if you've seen any material difference in customer pushback to the pricing in some of the market that we've talked about as being lower performing markets in recent years, or if that 20% level that you talked about earlier has been fairly consistent.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, the every three-year pricing, we've done it kind of three times in a row now. It's not necessarily strategy that we say, okay, no more price increases for the next three years. It just kind of happened this past time. We didn't want to do it while we were trying to bring customers back into the restaurant. Before that, labor inflation was very tame, and so we had strong comps and so we could lever our margin without resorting to pricing. It's a powerful advantage to have if you can continue to build your model, continue to expand leverage without constantly increasing menu prices. And so, we took advantage of that luxury. Going forward, we're going to do what we need to do. And if that means doing smaller, more regular price increases, we're certainly open to that. If we can lever our model, if we get the top-line going and we lever the model without a price increase, we think we can drive greater value to the customer. Customers always love it when they get greater value. So, we're not going to predetermine what and when we will do anything with pricing, but we're open to doing something other than kind of a three-year cadence.","And in terms of the resistance, we just don't see much resistance across the company. The only time we've seen it, and we've seen it in the past, as well. We see it a bit on the West Coast, and that's it. Otherwise, for the rest of the company, our customers think we provide a great value. And value is not just based on price. It's based on high-quality ingredients, it's based on a lot of food, it's based on an environment that they enjoy, and it's actually the value that we bring is a harder thing to bring, based on food, based on environment, based on the overall experience. Price is something that our consumers, sure, would they like to pay less? (1:02:27) Who wouldn't? But when they come to Chipotle and they get a great experience in a nice restaurant, the food is delicious, they call that a great value.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Oh, thanks, good afternoon. First, Jack, I apologize if I missed it, but what was the traffic decline in the quarter? And then secondly, Brian, several of the opportunities you mentioned to improve access for the brand seem to me, could take some time to build, but are there opportunities to quickly address the traffic declines you're seeing?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, I'll answer on the traffic. The comp came from an increase in average check, and you can take the 5% price increase, it's less than 20%, which is rounded up to 20%. That added 4%. Queso added 2%. So, you can back into what the transaction impact was. So, you'd be in the 3.3% or so range, 3.3%, 3.5%, something like that, and so that's the underlying traffic.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, and then to answer your question on what's my belief on the transaction opportunity going forward. Look, I think that's a real opportunity, and one of the things that Chris and the marketing organization are going to be centered on. And the good news is I believe the combination of the brand visibility, the innovation that I talked about, I think, there are opportunities in the near term that we can start putting into place and put into action that make it a material impact on our transactions. And then over time, you'll see the culmination of all these things coming together. I think, play an even bigger impact on the transactions and the number of people coming into our restaurants. So, it's really a combination of the digital, the menu, the access, programs like loyalty, those are all things that are going to be centered on making sure we are driving transactions as part of the proposition.","Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Over the last couple years, there's been a shifting focus at different points in time trying to bring back sales among existing customers at some points and finding new customers at some points. I'm just wondering, Brian, do you think about the opportunity set in that way, the customer base in that way? And if so, where do you see the greatest opportunities over the next 6, 12, 24 months?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, look. Here's what we know about our customers. Every age cohort loves Chipotle. Okay? And we over-index with young people. And this brand is a youthful spirit. It's a challenger, right? It's breaking convention of what accessible food done fast is. And that appeals broadly. So, our goal is not to be exclusive, our goal is to be inclusive, and our goal is to drive transactions with a youthful spirit, a meaningful positioning, and continue to leverage the strength of being a youthful brand that connects with youth. So, that's how I look at it. Obviously, Chris and I are digging deep into it because we need to understand the reasons why you either slowed down or increased your usage with us. And then we want to make sure we understand why all these different age cohorts are excited about being in the Chipotle business. Our goal is every category buyer to be coming to Chipotle. It's that simple. I probably won't get all of them in the near term, but I'm going to try in the long-term.","Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great, thank you very much.","Brian R.

Please proceed with your question.","Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thank you. If you could share a little bit, Jack, this question is for you on the margins. You mentioned that you think you can get to the high end of the 17.5%, 18.5% range, and then you said you could possibly exceed it, but you also mentioned earlier that nothing is really being built into the plan with respect to what Brian's integration and his ideas can have. Can you just balance between what you were saying? Because it sounded like you said it's going to be without any implementation of Brian's strategies, but it also sounded like you were talking about some additional sales. Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, I think you heard it right. We reiterated our guidance that comps will be in the low-single digits, so the margin comments deal with that assumption. To the extent we have strategies, that goes through pilot and are worthy of a rollout, meaning we expect to get a return on our investment. That's not included in the comp.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Chipotle's Director of Investor Relations, Alex Spong. Please go ahead.","Alex Spong","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter 2012. It may also be found on the website, at chipotle.com, in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include projections of new restaurant openings, comp restaurant sales increases, the timing and impact of potential menu price increases, trends in food cost and other expense items, effective tax rates, stock repurchase and our unit economics and investment returns, as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them.","Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for discussion of these risks.","I'd like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings call. For the fourth quarter, it will begin December 1 and continue to our fourth quarter release in January.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.","M. Steven Ells","Thanks, Alex. We're pleased with the results for the third quarter of 2012, particularly in light of continued uncertainty about the overall strength of the U.S. economy.","During the quarter, we posted comp sales increase of 4.8% on revenue of $700.5 million, an increase of 18.4% compared with the third quarter of 2011, adding up to a diluted earnings per share of $2.27 for the quarter.","With our results for the third quarter, we remain on pace to meet or exceed the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year in every area. Specifically, we're confident that for the full year, we will see mid-single-digit same-store sales growth and that we will meet or exceed 165 new restaurant openings before the end of year, at the high end of our previously announced range.","The performance of our business is driven essentially by 2 things: our unique food culture where we look for the best ingredients from more sustainably raised sources; and push ourselves to find better ways to prepare the food that we serve; and our unique people culture where we identify top-performing employees and develop them to be the future leaders of our company. We continue to make significant progress in each of these areas, and our relentless focus on them is what drives the performance of our business.","During the third quarter, we hosted our All Managers' Conference in Las Vegas. This event brought together an extraordinary group of over 2,000 of our folks, including Restaurateurs, restaurant managers, field leaders and regional and corporate support teams, to share details about our vision, to share programs to help our managers run our restaurants even better and to inspire and coach our managers to hire and develop a strong bench of future leaders.","What always strikes me the most when I spend time with our managers, and particularly spending time with all of them at once, is the remarkable talent, passion and commitment that exists within our ranks. It serves as a stark reminder of the leadership we're developing and gives me great optimism that Chipotle's best years are yet to come.","Our food culture and our commitment to finding better ingredients and better ways to prepare the food we serve has always been one of the things that has made Chipotle different from other restaurants, and we continue to push ourselves in both of these areas. During the quarter, we continue to expand our use of sunflower oil to cook our tortilla chips and taco shells instead of the soybean oil we have been using. Not only do we think sunflower oil makes our food taste better, but it also is GMO-free.","With California's Proposition 37 on the ballot, the subject of GMOs is becoming a bigger part of the conversation about food-related issues. And we're pleased to be ahead of the curve looking for non-GMO options to replace the ingredients we use that are genetically modified. Sunflower oil is now used in all of our restaurants, except our Central region. And we expect to have it rolled out there in the coming months.","For other foods where we soybean oil, we're testing a GMO-free rice brand oil in all of our restaurants in New York City, and are encouraged by how those tests are working. If all goes well with that, we will look to expand the use of this oil, eventually allowing us to replace the soybean oil entirely.","As we move into the fall, our local produce program is coming largely to an end as most of the country enjoys a growing season that spans from June through October. That program has exceeded our expectations this year as we have used more than 14.5 million pounds of produce from local farms, including romaine lettuce, red onions, jalapeno peppers, green bell peppers and oregano, greatly exceeding our goal of serving 10 million pounds of local produce. We believe that the use of locally grown produce is the right decision for us in that it not only tastes better, but also supports local farming communities around the country and is consistent with our commitment to working with independent family farms whenever we can.","Helping people understand how our ingredients are raised and how they are prepared continued to be a dominant theme in our marketing this quarter. Since the end of last quarter, our local marketing team has held more than 70 events nationwide, including 2 of our signature Cultivate food and music festivals. In total, these events reach more than 1 million people, with messages about our food and our commitment to cultivating a better world.","In particular, our Cultivate festivals, this year held in Chicago and Denver, attracted more than 40,000 attendees, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. These day-long festivals bring together some of the nation's best celebrity chefs, local farmers and popular bands for a celebration of Chipotle's commitment to great-tasting responsibly raised food. This year, along with a variety of special Chipotle menu items, we served select items from our ShopHouse menu at both Cultivate events. ShopHouse proved to be an incredibly popular event with long lines and rave reviews from customers throughout the day.","In addition to our ongoing local marketing efforts, we are once again preparing for our annual food retail Halloween promotion. Last year, hundreds of thousands of people came to Chipotle dressed in family farm-themed costumes to help raise $1 million for the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation. This year, we're broadening the appeal of the promotion by extending our offer of $2 burritos to people dressed in any type of costume. This Halloween, between 4:00 p.m. and closing, people dressed in costumes can get a burrito, bowl, tacos or salad for only $2. Proceeds of up to $1 million will benefit the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation.","While Chipotle in the United States continues to be the focus of our growth strategy, we continue to explore the prospects for Chipotle international in international markets as well. Before the end of the year, we plan to open our first restaurant in Vancouver, Canada, and we hope to open in Germany sometime later next year.","Our other growth options, ShopHouse in Washington, D.C., continues to perform well, and ShopHouse was a big draw at both Cultivate events. In fact, when I see how people are responding to ShopHouse, it reminds me very much of the reaction I saw when I opened the first Chipotle. While the concept is new to many people, there is a lot of excitement around the food and the flavors. And people are eager to try the food and learn more about what we're doing. So we think it's time to introduce ShopHouse to another market and plan to open the first ShopHouse in Los Angeles in the first half of 2013.","Like Washington, D.C., we think Los Angeles will be a great market for ShopHouse as a tremendous food city with a variety of international influences, and we think ShopHouse will do well there. Our first L.A. location will be in Santa Monica. In the meantime, the second ShopHouse location in Washington, D.C. is under construction and should also open early in 2013.","While we are certainly encouraged by the growth potential for Chipotle outside of United States and for ShopHouse, it's important to remember that building the Chipotle business in the United States will be the primary driver of our growth for the foreseeable future.","Our commitments to improving our food culture and our people culture have never been stronger. And our business results demonstrate the benefits of our unwavering focus in these critical areas. This focus will not only allow us to achieve our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food, but it will also allow us to deliver strong business results in the years to come.","I will now turn the call over to Monty.","Montgomery F. Moran","Thanks, Steve. Our All Managers' Conference last month in Las Vegas was an amazing one. Every other year, we hold this event to gather all of our managers and field leaders together, to discuss how we can best achieve our ongoing vision of creating an amazing food culture and people culture in this company. It was the third time we've held this event, and the feedback from our restaurant teams is that this was the most effective and impactful event we've ever had. The talent of our people, their enthusiasm and their optimism for their future and the future of Chipotle was truly inspiring.","In addition to our managers and field leaders, most people from our headquarters and field offices attended the conference this year, as well as our Board of Directors. And it seems that all of them were amazed by the incredible managers we have and their optimism and exuberance about the future of our company and the opportunities that exist for them and their crews at Chipotle.","After returning from the conference and visiting a number of restaurants, I'm already seeing that the conference has had a profound impact, not just on the managers who attended but on the entire restaurant team. Each crew member I see can't wait to tell me how their GM came back more inspired and energized than ever. And they tell me how inspired and motivated they are to create Restaurateur cultures in all of our restaurants. Most of the crew tell me with confidence that they will become a GM or Restaurateur before the next conference and that they're excited to be part of this magical gathering that their GM has described to them.","The conferences is designed for our managers, and it's intended to share a clear vision with them that they can bring back to their teams to give them inspiration and direction for their continued advancement and to make sure that they are aware of the excellent support available to them and their teams from our corporate staff. Managers leave with new information to help them do all facets of their job better, inspired by vision and with a clear understanding of their role in achieving it.","The rest of us leave inspired by the extraordinary passion and commitment we see among our managers and with greater confidence in our belief that we really are developing amazing future leaders for Chipotle. It's truly a remarkable display of the power of the culture we're creating, a culture of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards.","During the quarter, we interviewed 46 Restaurateur candidates and selected 41 to become Restaurateurs, the highest selection rate we've ever had, and a reflection that our culture is building still more momentum.","Year-to-date, we promoted 131 new Restaurateurs out of 153 candidates that were -- that we interviewed. This represents not only more Restaurateurs but also a higher acceptance rate than last year. 2\/3 of our restaurants are now overseen either directly by a Restaurateur or by a field leader who ascended from a Restaurateur position.","The improving rates of acceptance in the Restaurateur program suggests that our field leadership teams are getting better in identifying the qualities that make a Restaurateur, and also that the quality of managers vying for this elite position is improving all the time.","Because this is the engine that drives our leadership development, we are encouraged by the acceleration of leaders getting into the program, especially since our standards are getting higher all the time. In addition to the newly added Restaurateurs, we also expanded the roles of 69 Restaurateurs during the quarter, allowing them to begin mentoring and leading other GMs to reach the level of Restaurateur, thereby dramatically strengthening our field leadership teams.","Of course, these extraordinary leaders create fantastic dining experiences. They provide exceptional customer service, cook delicious food, run sparkling-clean restaurants and deliver better business results. So it should be no surprise that we're seeing these top-performing managers and crews delivering better throughput as well. As you know, about a year ago, we began focusing on relearning and mastering the principles of great throughput because we knew that this is an area where we could provide an even better customer experience.","And in 2012 that effort has paid off as we've been able to grow the peak lunch-hour comp faster than during the rest of the day. That trend continued in the third quarter where we grew the 12:00 to 1:00 p.m., in other words peak lunch-hour transaction comp, faster than the overall transaction comp and on average added an additional 4 transactions during the peak lunch hour. In the quarter, we also saw our peak dinner-hour transaction comp increase faster than the overall transaction comp.","So in summary, we're pleased with the progress we've made this year in growing the peak lunch hour and peak dinner hour faster than the all-day comp. And we know that with continued focus in this area, our throughput can be even faster and therefore our customer service even better.","Moving to real estate, we're pleased to report that we expect to hit or exceed the high end of the store opening guidance that we established at the beginning of this year of 155 to 165 new restaurants. And the outlook for our ability to develop new restaurants in 2013 is very promising as well. Specifically, due to the strength of our real estate pipeline, we estimate that we're going to open between 165 to 180 new restaurants in 2013.","In 2012, A Model locations are going to account for approximately 20% of our new restaurants, and we expect about the same percentage of A Models next year. For 2013, we expect to see an increase in the number of restaurants opening in new developments, with about 43% of our new locations in new developments next year compared with 33 this year, which is an encouraging sign that developers are becoming more active again.","Of our 2013 openings, about 70% we're going to be in proven and established markets, with the remaining 30% in new and developing markets, very similar to the mix that we have this year, but more in new and developing markets than we saw in 2011. This balanced approach to managing our portfolio allows us to invest in restaurants with expectations of generating high returns, while also introducing or growing the Chipotle brand in new and developing markets.","With stronger food and people cultures than we've ever had, better tools to help our managers work more efficiently and continued emphasis on improving the restaurant experience, along with the strength of our unit economic model, we believe we are well-positioned to provide consistently strong business results into the future.","I'll now turn the call over to Jack.","John R. Hartung","Thanks, Monty. Overall, we're pleased with our third quarter results. Against the backdrop of moderate and uncertain economic growth, transaction trends remain stable from the second quarter, and we were able to expand our restaurant level margins over last year. We're also able to generate excellent operating margins as result of our continued disciplined approach to running the business. Our top-performing crew and management teams continue to do an excellent job delivering great customer service while developing our future leaders.","Our same-store sales were up 4.8% in the third quarter, and our average sales volumes for restaurants that have been opened for at least 12 months is over $2.1 million. Overall sales for the quarter increased 18.4% to $700.5 million, driven by new restaurant openings and a comp of 4.8%.  Year-to-date sales were over $2 billion, an increase of 21.5%.","The quarter comp was driven primarily by increased customer traffic, along with a 1.2% increase in prices, primarily from the menu price increase taken in the first quarter on the West Coast. Our average check was lower than expected by about 60 basis points due to selling slightly fewer drinks and a slight decline in the relative mix of our larger iPhone, online and fax orders.","Our to-go orders are higher this year than last year, which may contribute to the fewer drinks sold, but a more cautious consumer may also be a factor in both selling fewer drinks and a reduction in these larger iPhone, online and fax orders.","Overall, our underlying transactions remained about the same as in Q2. Year-to-date comps were 8.3%, primarily driven by increased traffic, while menu price increases accounted for about 3.5% of the increase.","October underlying transaction trends so far are similar to Q2 and Q3, but keep in mind the final 30 basis points of pricing related to last year's increase will roll off and our 2-year comparison is more difficult by 100 basis points as we compare to a 2-year comp of 23.7% in Q4 versus a 22.7% comparison in Q3. Unseasonably warm weather last December is contributing to the tougher comparison. So Q4 comps are expected to be lower than Q3. And overall for the year, we reconfirm our full year sales comp guidance of mid-single digit for 2012.","As we look to 2013, we expect comps in the flat to low single-digit range, excluding the impact of any future menu price increases. We don't have any specific plans to increase menu prices next year, but with inflationary expectations related to the summer drought looming, which I'll talk about later, we remain open to possibility of a price increase next year.","We opened 36 new restaurants in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date openings to 123 and total company-wide restaurants to 1,350 at the end of Q3, which includes 1 ShopHouse, 5 restaurants in London, 4 in Toronto and 1 in Paris. We expect to end the year with total new restaurant openings at or above the high end of 155 to 165 opening range, with A Models representing about 20% of that total. We're also pleased to announce that for 2013, we expect to increase our new restaurant openings to a range of between 165 and 180 new restaurants.","Our new restaurants continue to perform very well, opening up with sales at the top of or above our communicated range of $1.5 million to $1.6 million. Our unit economics for existing restaurants is the strongest they've ever been, with average volumes of $2.1 million and with industry-leading margins despite some uncertainty in the current economic environment.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.27, an increase of 19.5%. This includes about $1 million for bad debt expense related to general contractors who became insolvent before paying their subcontractors. We were able to grow EPS at a slightly faster rate than sales as we delivered strong sales leverage in every line item except for G&A, which included about $5.5 million for our All Managers' Conference in September.","Our operating margins were up 20 basis points, while restaurant-level margins were up 70 basis points compared to last year. Year-to-date, diluted EPS was $6.80, an increase of 37.1% over last year. And again, efficiencies from higher comps allowed us to leverage every line item on the P&L, except for G&A, which on a year-to-date bases was up 20 basis points from last year due to a higher noncash stock comp expense and the All Managers' Conference. Restaurant-level margins year-to-date were 28%, an increase of 210 basis points.","Food costs were 32.6% in the quarter, which is down 50 basis points from last year. Avocado cost continue to be favorable due to a strong harvest and good supply availability. Lower cost for avocados and cheese more than offset continued rising prices for chicken, steak and rice on a year-over-year basis.","Excluding the impact of menu price increases, our underlying food costs are up about 2.5% this year, which is better than what we expected at the beginning of the year.","On a sequential basis, moving from Q3 to Q4, we expect food inflation in the low-single digits, driven by higher dairy and meat prices resulting from higher feed and corn prices as a result of this summer's drought. And as we look to 2013, we expect continued food inflation on top of the inflation we expect to see in Q4 in the low single-digits as the impact from the drought continues to be felt from the weaker corn harvest, higher corn prices, which will result in a higher meat and dairy cost next year.","This expected inflation would be higher except that we are hopeful that avocado prices in 2013 will remain about the same as this year. The unusually mild weather patterns this past spring have created conditions favorable for a larger avocado crop, which should result in a strong harvest next year.","So the combined inflation in Q4 and next year is expected to be in about the mid-single-digit range. Should that kind of inflation materialize, we will consider price increase to help offset the impact.","The timing of any price increase will take into account a number of factors, including the actual realized food inflation, our transaction trends, general consumer confidence and spending trends and the competitive response from inflation. In this still uncertain economic environment, we'll be patient and thoughtful about the timing and magnitude of any price increase.","Labor costs were 23.2% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 10 basis points from last year. Labor leverage was driven by the positive transaction comps along with menu price increase. And year-to-date labor costs are down 60 basis points.","Occupancy cost for the quarter declined 10 basis points from last year and 30 basis points year-to-date due to higher average restaurant sales.","Other operating costs were 10.5% for the quarter, a decline of 20 basis points. And year-to-date of operating costs were 10.2%, down 70 basis points from last year. Favorable sales leverage in the quarter was partially offset by higher marketing expenses.","Marketing costs were 1.4% in the quarter, up 30 basis points from last year. And year-to-date, we're 1.1% or down 20 basis points from last year. We expect marketing to increase in the fourth quarter to around 1.7%, and our overall marketing will be about 1.4% for the full year in 2012 and should be about the same in 2013.","G&A was 6.9% in the quarter, 60 basis points higher than last year. The increase was due to our third biannual All Managers' Conference, along with noncash, noneconomic stock comp expense of nearly $14.5 million in the quarter and nearly $52 million for the year. This is $3.8 million higher in the quarter and $19.6 million higher for the year compared to last year as a result of stock options issued at a much higher stock price.","As mentioned earlier, we also had about $1 million in bad debt expense in the quarter for general contractors who become insolvent before paying their subcontractors. G&A in the fourth quarter will include $1 million related to our Halloween Boorito promotion and fundraising event, which will benefit Chipotle Cultivate Foundation.","In 2013, we expect G&A as a percent of sales to be about the same as in 2012. While G&A next year will benefit by not having expense of our All Managers' Meeting, that benefit will be offset by wage inflation and a higher noncash stock comp expense. Of course, the stock comp expense will depend on the stock price at the time options are granted. But assuming a similar number of options granted at a stock price similar to what we traded for recently, we estimate the related accounting expense will be in the range of $70 million to $75 million compared to about $68 million this year.","We expect our effective tax rate for both 2012 and 2013 will be about 39%. We're now $88 million into our $100 million stock repurchase program through today. And over the past 4 years, we repurchased a total of $388 million of Chipotle stock in an overall average share positive of $117. As we're nearing the end of our $100 million repurchase, our Board of Directors recently approved investment of an additional $100 million into Chipotle stock.","While we continue to generate more cash from operations than we invest in the Chipotle business today, we're confident that the growth options we're seeding today, including ShopHouse and Chipotle outside the U.S., will provide attractive value-enhancing growth investments in the future. In the meantime, we'll continue to invest in our high-returning domestic restaurants and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today. This time, we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jack, you went through a lot quickly there, Jack. And I just want to follow up on the commentary around the pricing versus inflation for next year. First, on the pricing, can you say if you guys are testing anything right now and sort of what level you would be testing? And then on the inflation, just want to confirm the year-over-year inflation for next year on the food side, did you say it was mid-single digits? If you could clarify.","John R. Hartung","Yes, sure. Jason, we're not testing any menu price increase right now. What we want to convey is that it looks like inflation is upon us. The effects of the drought from this summer is going to impact us. It's already starting to impact us in October. We expect to see higher prices overall of in the low-single-digit range moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And then on top of that, we expect to see continued effects from the drought, and the effects are going to be seen in higher dairy prices and higher meat prices. And we think that's going to add another low single-digit amount on top of the fourth quarter. So overall, when you look from where we are right now into next year, so this 32.6% food cost that we saw in the second -- in the third quarter rather, into next year, we're seeing somewhere, when you add what we expect to see in the fourth quarter and into next year, somewhere in the range of kind of a mid-single-digit inflation rate. And then in terms of the price increase, Jason, we really want to see how things play out in terms of the economy, in terms of our transaction trend, in terms of actual inflation and in terms of what competitors do and how customers respond. And once we have all that information, then we'll decide whether and the magnitude and timing of what kind of price increase we might implement to help us offset some of those inflation.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just to follow up on that, how quickly could you guys move on pricing? I mean, I don't know what amount of time you would need to test and evaluate the test, any historical sort of averages on that?","John R. Hartung","Yes, it doesn't take us that long, Jason, to be honest. But I will tell you, we're going to be patient about it. So if we see, let's say we see inflation of couple of percent in the fourth quarter and a couple of percent as we move into early next year, we're not going to be in a hurry to offset that. We'd rather be patient. We'd rather see what happens with the economy, see what happens with the consumer spending, see what other competitors do and how consumers respond. So we can move quickly, but we're going to choose to not be in too much of a hurry. We don't want to be the first one out of the box who are trying to cover the effects of inflation. So while we can move quickly, I think you'll see us to be patient.","Operator","We'll go next to Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","John R. Hartung","Nicole, are you there?","[Technical Difficulty]","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I was on mute, I apologize. My question was centered around the DNA of the brand, from the genesis to where it is today, because a lot of other brands selling or offering the same cuisine or different want to be like Chipotle. But the one thing I've noticed that is different is customization. So do you have any information how important the ability to customize at Chipotle is to your consumer and as that would differentiate you from other concepts?","M. Steven Ells","Well, Nicole, I don't know if we have any hard data that speaks to that, but I can tell you that when I opened the first restaurant 19 years ago, the initial reaction was that it was a very limited menu offering and the people said, \"You can't just have burritos and tacos.\" But what customers soon came to understand was that we focused on just a few core items: chicken, steak, barbacoa, carnitas, beans, fajitas, these kinds of things. And it's the ability to combine, not only for taste but for diet, that keeps people coming back again and again and again. And I think that's why you have such a high frequency at Chipotle. It's because of that ability to customize. So I think it's extremely important. And as we expand the idea of Chipotle into ShopHouse, the exact same idea applies. And that is we focus on making just a few different items for the ShopHouse customers to choose from, but their ability to combine things to create different kinds of flavor is pretty vast. So we think this idea of focus on a relatively narrow set of offerings but having -- being able to please a bunch of different palettes and a bunch of different diets is really important. It also contributes to the success of the economic model. Again, the more streamlined and focused your operation is, the stronger your economic model. And this allows us to invest disproportionately relative to our competitors in our raw ingredients. And of course, this makes our food taste better and it also has a really great Food With Integrity story. It also allows us to invest in our top performers. So we think that this customization thing is really important. And we do some research into why customers come to Chipotle. Taste is always the #1 reason why people come, but this customization, as it turns out, is always in the top 4 items, so very, very important to our customers.","Operator","Moving next to John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to just first start with the comp guidance for this year and next year. This year, mid-single digits, I appreciate you want to be conservative but you could get to mid-single digits with negative comps in the fourth quarter. So when you plug-in like a 2 or 3, you get to like 7. So is 7 mid-single digits, or what are you trying to maybe steer us toward the fourth quarter more specifically?","John R. Hartung","Yes, John. I mean, in essence we've had that guidance throughout the year, and so we just not changed it. I think what is more important to focus on is when you're moving from the third quarter of 4.8 to the fourth quarter, the 2 things that we see that are different between those 2 is, one, we lose a little bit of menu price that's about 30 basis points, and it's a tougher comparison. When we look at how we've recovered since the recession and we look at 2-year comp, it's a 100 basis points tougher comparison when we move from Q3 to Q4. Those are the 2 things that I would take into account in terms of what we'd expect in the fourth quarter, so that should give you an idea in the fourth quarter. We weren't trying to say that there's any other kind of trend to take into account with that, just reaffirming our annual guidance.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then next year flat to up a little bit, and again I appreciate the conservatism. But would that assume in your minds a negative comp in the first quarter and then sort of a normalization in the back half?","John R. Hartung","Not -- I mean, that's more precise, John, than we're able to predict at this time. What it really predicts is that we've seen kind of a leveling off of our transaction trends. We're up about -- on a 3-year basis since the recession is over, we're up in the 26%, 27% range. And it looks like there's a little bit of a slowing of consumer confidence. And so when you project that into next year, it looks like it's a relatively flat or slightly positive. But I would say that trend, John, we would see throughout the year. Now the only exception of that, this might be what you're alluding to is, the weather was extraordinary in the first quarter of last year. So if we have a normal winter this year compared to an extraordinarily warm winter next year, I mean, that comparison could lead to a negative comp in the first quarter.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just the last question is last quarter there was some controversy around new store productivity. There was some fear around the fact that you are hiring some external managers to make up for gap in your internal management structure. Can you update on those 2 subjects? Specifically for the third quarter, it sounds like you're still opening in a more normalized basis, new versus existing markets versus last year, but maybe the comparison was trickier last year, maybe more stores in existing markets last year that made it harder, and this quarter it's more normal. If you could comment on this quality of openings this quarter specifically, and also that manager issue that you discussed last quarter if you, in fact, went ahead with the hiring of those outside folks?","Montgomery F. Moran","Yes, John. I guess I'll start with the manager part of it. When we talk about -- I think there was some misunderstanding from my comments last time because we've said for years how we hire the vast majority of our general managers from inside the company. And in fact, that number is still 98%. So roughly 5 out of 5 managers we hire come from the inside. Well, that number used to be 2 out of 5 several years ago. And so that is still happening, and we've got wonderful, wonderful momentum of being able to train crew people into kitchen manager roles then service manager roles and apprentice roles and ultimately into general manager roles. So that's going wonderfully well. When I made the comment last quarter about sort of hiring people from the outside, it was a very narrow focus of hiring just a few area managers. These are folks who oversee sort of that 8 to 15 restaurant range. But hiring some area managers -- and the reason we were doing that, and we have done that by the way. We've interviewed, well, we looked at a great deal of resumes and picked just a few of the very, very top candidates and so we hired them, half dozen of these area managers already. And the purpose for doing that was simply to allow us to make sure that we are not overstretching some of the terrific field leaders who have come up from within our ranks. We have a tremendous amount of upward mobility through the ranks right now. We have, in fact, area managers, which used to be -- all of our mid-management leaders used to be called area managers. We have only 25 of those left, and we have 33 of what we call team leaders who are folks who have either come up from Restaurateur or who are folks who have become team leaders by virtue of developing 4 Restaurateurs. And we also have 37 apprentice team leaders, and these are folks all of whom who have come up from Restaurateur positions. So the vast majority of our leadership in the field is already folks who have come up from Restaurateur ranks and usually folks who have come up from crew to Restaurateur and then beyond. So the amount of field leaders we have coming from within is extraordinary, and we're very, very pleased with it. However, there's a few parts in the country, a few places in the country where the folks coming up through the ranks were asked to oversee a lot of restaurants. People who had overseen 4 were quickly raised to where they're overseeing as many as 20 or 30, and in one case 40 restaurants. We want to be careful not to overstretch new leaders because we want them to continue to lead the restaurants in a way that is what we believe is most effective, which is creating teams of top performers who are empowered to achieve very high standards. If you stretch people too far, what happens is they tend to start getting a little overly busy where they're going around essentially swatting away at symptoms in the restaurants and not really able to diagnose and correct the underlying problem, which is if the team is not excellent in some of those stores. So what we did is we've hired some area managers to make it so we don't overstretch a few of those field leaders. So it's a pretty -- I brought it up last quarter because it's something that we keep a very close eye on, and I wanted to express it to you all. But we're talking about half a dozen people we've hired. We'll hire a few more too, opportunistically as needed. With regard to the new store openings, we're very pleased with our new store opening volumes. These new store openings continue to open at or above the $1.5 million to $1.6 million range that Jack has mentioned to you many times in the past. And what's also important to notice with our new store openings is that these new stores out comp the rest of the field. And so within a few years, these restaurants are approaching our average store volumes which have tremendously strong unit economics and great returns. So when we look at the mix this year versus last year, we do have more developing markets, but those are doing better than ever. So this year, like I said, next year -- this year and next year, we're something like 70% proven markets and 30% new and developing markets. But those developing markets, which we used to say to you were in that sort of $1 million, $1.2 million range opening are now opening much, much better at that sort of $1.4 million to $1.5 million range. So that allows us to feel good and responsible about shifting some of our portfolio to that developing market range. And finally, with regard to A Models, like I said early, about 20% of the restaurants we plan to open are A Models, and those restaurants which have lower development costs are showing wonderful returns as well because even though the volumes of those restaurants aren't as high as the traditional Chipotles we open, they are high enough to deliver a very, very high return, equal or better than the return of our traditional stores when you take into account the lower development cost. So we feel very good about our new store openings. The portfolio was strong. It's been strong throughout the year. And we have confidence that it will remain very strong in 2013.","Operator","We'll go next to Alvin Concepcion with Citi.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the guidance for 2013. I mean, looking back the last 3 years, when you provided guidance at this point in time, it's either been low-single digits or flat for the following year, and you've significantly outperformed each year. So it appears there has been a bit of conservatism in your approach to providing guidance at this point in the year? Is there -- is your approach to providing guidance for 2013 any different than it has been in the past?","John R. Hartung","It's not any different, but what's different with our comp guidance and what other companies might do is we don't have like limited time promotions or games or things where we can say, \"Okay, we're going to advertise in some way where we can temporarily bring customers in, and that's going to have some kind of impact on the comp.\" And so every year, what we do is we take our current sales trends and we push them out into next year and assume that the trends don't get any better and don't get any worse. And very often, just the way the math is going to work, you're often going to end up in a range that's in the guidance range that we always give, which is in the low-single digit. This year, we're giving it in the flat to low-single digits. It's incumbent upon us to now find a way to try to change that trend line. If the trend line doesn't change, we're going to hit our guidance. If the trend line gets worse, we're going to fall short of our guidance. If we can invite more customers in, if we can delight more customers so that they visit more often and bring a friend, if we get some help from the economy, we'll be able to beat that comp guidance. But in terms of the math exercise we go through each year and the way we figure out what the guidance should be, the math exercise that we go through is the same each year.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And I wonder if you could comment on how you believe your market share held up this quarter versus last quarter given some recent concerns about competition? And in light of some competition at lower prices, what is your level of comfort with the current menu offerings and in price point ranges at this point?","John R. Hartung","Well, I'll comment on the sales trend and then Steve may want to comment about the menu. But we're pleased with our transaction trends. We still don't think the economy is in great shape. We still think consumers seem to be a little bit cautious right now. There's a lot of noise during the quarter about somebody taking market share away from us. They did a lot of very, very heavy advertising. A lot of the advertising was intended to attract our customers, for obvious reasons. But our transaction trends in the second quarter when none of that advertising happened were identical to the third quarter when there was very, very heavy advertising in the quarter. So we're not seeing any kind of loss whatsoever in our transactions moving from us to any other competitor. Having said that, it was the same Q2 to Q3. We love to see more customers coming in. We're going to do everything we can to make sure that we're focused on continuing to hire top performers, continuing to improve the taste and the quality of our food, continuing to improve the dining experience at Chipotle and hope that more customers will decide to visit Chipotle or existing customers will decide to visit more often. I don't know, Steve, you want to say something about the...","M. Steven Ells","Yes, could you repeat your question, please.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, given some of this competition, the promoting at lower prices, I mean, what's your level of comfort with your range of offerings in terms of the menu and price points?","M. Steven Ells","Sure. Well, so at Chipotle, we're doing something that's very, very unique in the world of quick service. And that is we're bringing the elements of a real dining experience. And on the kitchen side of that, that means we're buying really great raw ingredients, sustainably raised ingredients. Now we're preparing those according to classic cooking techniques and then serving them in an interactive format so that people get exactly what they want. When I say interactive format, people go along the service line and pick and choose exactly what they want and how much of it they get. So it's really sort of unique to the world of fast food, and we've had many imitators over the years, people who recognize that this value in the system, in this new fast food system that we've created. And perhaps some have argued that this is the new fast food, but it's absolute not a very easy thing to copy. Lots of people copy the veneer. For example, one could try to offer a low-cost item of a Chipotle menu item, but maybe it would only on the surface appear to be similar. When you dig down a little bit deeper, maybe it's very different. If you look at a recent competitor who offered something that maybe looked similar on the surface, but yet and it contained, say, grilled chicken, yet that company did not have a grill nor do they have knives or cutting boards, so how do they make grilled chicken and chop it up? And so when you look down and dig little bit deeper, you realize that it's almost impossible for them to duplicate what we're doing. And I think in the end, the customer can realize the difference. And our customers love what we're doing. We get comments all the time that they appreciate our commitment to really good ingredients so they're able to feed theirselves, their families really wholesome food. And I think this is not a trend that's going away anytime soon. So I would just say be careful of those who have a lower-cost opportunity. Look a little deeper to see what it is that they're really providing. The customers are not easily fooled.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Anderson with Miller Tabak.","Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Just a question actually on your expansion to some of the developing markets. And I see you have good penetration in some of the urban and some of the college town markets. As you go more deeper to suburban markets, is drive-through an option that you've considered? I see some of your competitors in the fast casual space have adopted it. Is it something that you would look into?","M. Steven Ells","I would never say that we'll never do a drive-through. In sort of expanding the Chipotle concept as we go to new markets, the question always comes up, should we try one with a drive-through? And part of what customers love is the ability to customize. As I just explained earlier from a question by Nicole, that it's sort of very important to our customers in the top 4 reasons why they like to come to Chipotle. And a drive-through distances them from that. So it doesn't seem like for the majority of our customers it's something that would be relevant. That being said, it's certainly something that we could try in the future. It's just not something that research about our customers and how we deliver the Chipotle experience, it doesn't lead us to drive-throughs.","Operator","We'll hear now from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask, given the meaningful change in traffic trajectory that you've experienced since May, what strategic or tactical changes, if any, do you now plan to implement to adjust relative to maybe what you are planning before?","M. Steven Ells","Well, Michael, I think that what we noticed is that when we're really on our game and have a great team of all top performers and are cooking delicious food and providing an extraordinary customer experience, people love it. And so while perhaps comps are off a little bit, I don't necessarily know that this is a trend, and I would hate for us to do something that's off-brand, something that customers wouldn't see as Chipotle. So I think the best way to ensure that we continue to drive the business, to strengthen the brand, to continue to win new customers and get existing customers to come back more and more is to continue with our Food With Integrity mission, continue to explain to them the importance of sustainably raised food because that message is getting through, continuing to refine our marketing. I think, last year, we had a major breakthrough in connecting with customers on an emotional level that hasn't been seen in marketing in many years with our Back to the Start video. And now we have plans to do the same kinds of emotional connection, but to add on traffic-driving parts to that marketing. And so I don't think you'll see any radical differences in what we're doing but just continue to do the things that we think drive our business, the things that our customers love.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe another way to talk about this, maybe your future planning sessions, maybe looking further out than just a knee jerk to what's going on in one quarter or another, are you considering pursuing new traffic drivers like new menu items or expanded hours, possibly, including breakfast, a step up in traditional advertising? And maybe if none of these are in the near-term horizon, which might you pursue or what other things might you pursue before the others?","M. Steven Ells","Sure, well, as we talk in strategic sessions, as you say, I mean, we've discussed all of those things and more, for sure. But one thing that we're all very, very careful to do is to make sure that we continue to strengthen the brand and do things that support our mission and to satisfy our customers. Additionally, we want to make sure that we preserve our economic model because it is a very, very strong unit economic model that helps drive the things that make us successful in the first place, making for better service through better people and making for better food through better ingredients. It is certainly logical to look at things like breakfast. The question is, what would it be? What would those offerings look like? It's certainly logical to look at additional menu items, but what would they be? It was interesting, a few years ago, at the height of the recession, we thought that perhaps we could offer some lower-priced menu items. And so in a select couple of markets, we did that. What we noticed as people look at those ads that we're promoting the lower-priced menu items, they went ahead and ordered their regular menu items, their regular full-priced menu items. Customers at Chipotle tend to get the same thing over and over and over again. They might tweak it here and there and slightly vary it, but I don't think our customers are necessarily looking for a radically new menu item. So I would lean probably more toward something like breakfast if we were looking at expanding the menu, that also expands the day part. None of these things are off the table by any means. But if we do them, we'll certainly do it with the same quality, same attention to detail and ultimately with the goal of satisfying our core customers in a way that satisfies them during our normal opening times with the normal menu. But then, layering on opportunities, seeding opportunities like ShopHouse and international, are certainly ways to think about potential growth opportunities in the future.","Operator","Moving next to Larry Miller with RBC.","Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just had 2 quick ones. Jack, how should I think about restaurant-level margins in 2013 if your guidance is 0 to low-single-digit same-store sales?","John R. Hartung","Well, at that level, Larry, with inflation, margins are going to be under pressure. So food costs are going to rise in the fourth quarter. They're going to rise again next year. So that, all by itself, is going to have a negative hit on our margins. And when we talked about what it takes, for example, to what kind of comp do you need, transaction-driven comp to drive labor leverage, I've always said you need something in kind of that mid-single-digit range. And you can see that we had just in this quarter just a little bit of labor leverage when we had a mid-single-digit kind of comp. So if we have low single-digit in our comp and we have inflation, that's going to put pressure on our margins. Now keep in mind, eventually, it would be our intent to pass on the higher cost of doing business, especially inflation, through a menu price increase, but we're going to be patient at that. So I would think of our business in terms of pressure on the margins from inflation, pressure on the margins, assuming that we have this low single-digit comps. And then there will be the opportunity sometime in the future when we decide, okay, the economy seems to be picking up, consumers seem to be confident, others have increased price then it looks like it's an okay time to raise prices, we can recover that margin back. So longer term, Larry, our margins as they are today are sustainable. In the short term, I would expect there to be some pressure.","Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then how should I think about the $100 million-plus share buyback authorization? Is that something that you look to complete in 2013?","John R. Hartung","You mean the new one?","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, the new one. Suppose you have some existing carryover?","John R. Hartung","Yes. I mean, it depends on our stock price, Larry. If the stock price remains under pressure, we'll buy a lot more. You may have noticed, we bought a lot more in the last quarter than we did in the 2 quarters before that combined, a lot more. And not that we try to anticipate or we don't do day trading per se, but we put in place a chart that allows us or results in us buying our stock back a lot more aggressively the lower our price go. And we're much more conservative when the stock price increases. So I would not promise that we would finish the new $100 million before the end of the year. It depends on the stock price. But you could expect this to be about as aggressive, if not more aggressive, than you've seen in these past quarters.","Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I could slip in just one quick one actually. The mid-single-digit inflation you're talking about for 2013, are you contracted at any -- on anything at this point? Or how should I think about that?","John R. Hartung","Just a few things, Larry. We've got our rice contracted through 3 quarters. Next year, we've got some of our corn, just a small amount of our corn, not even all of our corn needs. And that's about it right now, so very small amount is contracted right now.","Operator","The next question will come from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Jack, first a quick clarification question on the traffic in the quarter, the same-store traffic, I think you mentioned there was some negative mix impact. So maybe could you clarify what the composition of the comp was, traffic, mix and pricing?","John R. Hartung","Yes, David. In the quarter, our comp was 4.8%. We were about 60 basis points off on average check, so underlying traffic was about 4.2%.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess maybe another clarification, how did you see the trend progress as you move through the quarter? Was it pretty even across the various months? It seems like maybe you're running a little softer at the start of the quarter, but how should we think about that?","John R. Hartung","No, we were pretty stable, David. I mean, obviously, nothing is a straight line. It bounces around a little bit. But I would say it was pretty stable. We have some trading day impact at the end of August versus September. August was a favorable trading impact at the end of the month. September was a negative. But if you look at the weeks throughout the 3 months, they were relatively consistent. We didn't see anything out of the ordinary in terms of trend. The normal kind of choppiness, but not -- I wouldn't say there was a trend where we were soft and then got strong. I would say it was reasonably consistent.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then one question on the unit economics. Currently, I guess, maybe if you could give us an update on what you're seeing on the development cost side year-to-date and what your expectations are going forward? And maybe if you could comment on your expectations for the returns for the new units that you've opened this year relative to recent years?","John R. Hartung","Yes. We expect our openings this year to average right around at $800,000 that we have seen for the last few years. We hope that it will be similar next year. There is some pressure. Next year, there is some inflation that we're hoping that we'll be able to offset some of that. So we're hoping next year that we'll still be in kind of a $800,000 target range next year that might tick up a bit. But I don't have anything specific to give you on that. But in terms of our openings, when our restaurants open at or above the high end of the range, and if you look at a couple of years of comps, and our newest restaurants always out comp the rest of our restaurants. And as Monty mentioned, our new restaurants, within a couple of years of comp, can pretty quickly approach our average unit volumes of, today we're $2.1 million. But let's say just to use a round number, Dave. Let's say that within a few years of comp they're in the $2 million range, you're looking at a kind of margins that we're generating and call it in the mid-20% range, for example, you're talking about a $500,000 cash flow on an $800,000 investment, you're talking about a 60% return, a better than 60% return. That's what we expect with the openings that we're seeing this year.","Operator","We'll go now to Matthew DiFrisco with Lazard Capital Markets.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered but except to -- I just want to go into sort of looking at the comp and what's been driving the comp the last couple of quarters as far as the throughput initiatives. How should we view that as far as when you now are going to be lapping it soon, and you look at into '13, is this something that is multiyear and you can build upon? Or is it pretty much when you look at the base and you look at the low-hanging fruit, your high-volume stores, have you sort of -- have we gotten optimization quickly and we've driven the traffic? Or is that also something that could be playing into sort of the more conservative guidance going forward, I'm wondering?","Montgomery F. Moran","Yes, I would certainly say it's really not something that's playing into our guidance going forward at all. A throughput is -- we see it as a key attribute of Chipotle's customer service. And the better our throughput, the better the customer service. When I talk about our throughput improvements and the fact that our lunch time, that is to say peak lunch time and peak dinner time hours, having a higher comp than the rest of the day, that shouldn't -- I don't want you to take from that, that means that the throughput drove the comp. Not the overall days comp in other words. But if you look at what happened was our comp during the peak lunch hour, for example, was more than a point higher than our comp during our overall comp company-wide. And what that shows is that we're putting more people through at lunch time. And the same thing was true at dinner, we're putting more people through dinner time than before. But that's despite the fact that the overall transactions for the day only went up by the amount of our stated comp. So if you look at the lunch hour, for example, where I said we did over 1 point better on our lunch time comp, we actually cannibalized from the 1:00 to 2:00 hour in order to do that. In other words, we put people through that might have historically gotten their lunch at 1:01 p.m., we put them through at 12:58 p.m. instead. And so that allows us to get that comp into the lunch hour. What that means is our crews and restaurant managers are doing a fantastic job of delivering speedier service to our customers. It does not automatically translate into a higher sales comp. But we believe, over a period of time, it will because we believe that it's better customer service, number one. Number two, it gives our customers much greater convenience when they come into our restaurants, number two. And then over time, people who might have been more afraid of our long lines might get higher and higher level of trust that when they come to our restaurants during a peak hour that we'll get them through quickly. And we believe that will result in comp long term. But throughput, faster throughput, does not translate into an immediate sales comp increase necessarily. That's something you've got to wait for. But so your question is -- you asked the question about lapping comps, I'll answer it in terms of lapping throughput, throughput comps. Our throughput has been better this year than at any time in our history. And that's an accomplishment that we're very proud of. We think we can continue to get faster on throughput because there are restaurants that have long -- that still have long lines at peak lunch hour. We were not going nearly as fast as we could. In fact, we think we have a lot of room to get better throughput. And all of our managers and crews are working hard on that right now.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And along those lines, is there any sort of plan capital investment or an amount of stores that you could target that could put in a second line, that also might be something to drive greater throughput that you haven't addressed yet?","Montgomery F. Moran","Yes. We're really not interested in doing that yet, Matthew, just because our ability to increase throughput is so extraordinary. I mean, we've got restaurants, our very busiest restaurants, during our peak lunch hour that are doing more than 300 transactions per hour, every single day, like clockwork. And yet we have restaurants that have busy lunches that are down in the sort of 100 range or 120 range that can easily speed up through working with their teams to get better at it. So it's much more important for us to focus on the human aspect of it, of getting better and better teams that are focused on throughput than it is for us through technology equipment or an expensive second make line at the process right now. And throughput is not a limiting factor at any of our restaurants in the sense that we have never shown that we can't go faster in order to accommodate those customers yet. And we've never shown that our kitchens and physical facility can't support that greater throughput. So we are getting close to our potential in terms of what we are able to accomplish in our restaurants, and so we wouldn't look to change the physical design of the restaurant at this point.","Alex Spong","Thanks so much.

I'm very pleased to report strong Q1 results with 9.9% comparable restaurant sales growth that included 5.8% transaction growth; restaurant level margins up 21%, 150 basis points higher than last year; earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.40, representing 60% year-over-year growth; and digital sales growing 101% year-over-year to represent 15.7% of sales. The ongoing improvement in each of these key metrics over the past few quarters gives us confidence that our mission to win today and cultivate the future is resonating.","In fact, this is the fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating comps, which reinforces our view that when we connect with guests through culturally relevant marketing, focused on Chipotle's great taste and real ingredients, and provide more convenient access with less friction, they respond enthusiastically. The first quarter strong results were driven by the same strategic focus areas that we've talked about for several quarters now; being culturally relevant and increasing brand engagement and visibility; digitizing and modernizing the restaurant experience; great hospitality and throughput; and of course, enhancing our powerful economic model, all while building a great culture of accountability and creativity.","We were definitely visible this quarter with unique marketing programs that celebrate our real ingredients and classic cooking techniques, as well as several initiatives that caught the attention of our guests. As you know, last fall we launched our four-wheel advertising, which showcase Chipotle's point of difference in real ingredients in real cooking techniques. We followed this up with our behind the foil campaign in February to showcase what is fully kitchen looks like every day; real fresh ingredients; real cooking techniques; and real people.","Chipotle has always believed that there's a connection between how food is ready and prepared to how it tastes. And what I love most about these commercials is there was no studio, no script, no props and no actors. It was just our employees doing what they do best, which is making delicious food. In addition,Q1 also benefited from several other initiatives that made the Chipotle brand more visible in culturally relevant social and traditional media channels. Our free delivery bowl offering, which ran from December 17 to January 7, helped expand access and was not only a great way to attract new guests or app, and delivery capabilities, but also to Chipotle as nearly half of the guests taking part in this offer were new or last users. And we are seeing increased new customer retention with higher levels of delivery sales after the promotion.","We also launched our first digital only menu innovation on January 2nd called Lifestyle Bowls. This resonate with consumers in a big way. In fact, during the first few days, it generated over a billion earned media impressions. Later in the quarter, we extended the Lifestyle menu platforms with plant-powered options, highlighting our Sofritas and Vegetarian Bowls. We're currently testing several other menu items to our stage-gate process and we\u2019ll update you on their progress over time.","And finally, we continue to drive awareness of our brand through a holistic media plan with national TV advertising on culturally relevant programming like March Madness, and always-on social media that resonates with our guests. Collectively, these marketing efforts help drive culture, drive the difference and ultimately drive the Chipotle purchase. This contributed to the lift in Q1 sales as evidenced by digital impressions increasing 300% year-over-year and social impressions increasing 400% year-over-year. We are pleased with the returns on our marketing dollars to-date and expect healthy returns from programs being worked on for the remainder of 2019.","We\u2019re also excited about Chipotle Rewards, which launched on March 12th. The stage-gate process allowed us to learn, enhance and optimize the program to ensure a better guest experience upon launch. And we're encouraged and have already enrolled 3 million members. The rewards or spend day where customers earn 10 points for every dollar spent and receive a free entr\u00e9e after accruing 1,250 points with periodic bonus offer so real food becomes real treat real fast. In addition to allowing us to reward and thank our guests, we're beginning to gather data that can be used to more effectively target them to engage and grow their loyalty. The Rewards program gives us a currency that we can use to incept behaviors as a key part of our digital system flywheel. Our guests have been asking for a loyalty program for a long time and now the more you eat at Chipotle, the more you can get free Chipotle.","We believe that Chipotle rewards will be a key element that will provide topspin for digital system, which was again a key driver of our sales growth. The digital system, which includes order ahead, delivery, catering, digitize second make lines, mobile order pickup shelf and now, Chipotle rewards, is creating a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience, making it easier to order food from Chipotle, however and wherever you like.","To that end, I am pleased to share that we recently completed the addition of mobile order pickup shelves in all relevant restaurants. These self-service shelves are a key element in digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience. As they increase access, speed of service and convenience for our guests, while building more love for Chipotle and driving digital sales. In addition, this is a key component to improve delivery times. The delivery driver no longer waits for orders when they enter our restaurant. They simply go straight to the shelf, select the appropriate order and head off to the delivery destination. We feel this is a competitive advantage and allows us to have industry leading delivery times. I want to thank our teams for their great execution on this initiative.","Also with regard to our digital make lines, they're currently in approximately 1,300 restaurants and we expect to have them in all applicable restaurants by the end of 2019. Early results are showing that restaurants of mobile order pickup shelves and digital make lines generate digital sales above our national average. Through a combination of delivery, order ahead and catering, our digital sales accelerated from Q4 and grew 101% year-over-year in quarter one. Digital sales totaled $206 million during the quarter and represented 15.7% of sales. We also re-launched a new chipotle.com website in February that is helping increase customer conversion. We are pleased to be averaging more than 1 million digital transactions per week.","Delivery remains a key driver of our digital growth given enhanced capabilities on our app and website, as well as our expanded reach. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing some residual lift in delivery sales that last beyond any promotion. And I've seen very little guest overlap between our own in app delivery and our third party delivery partner apps. As part of our goal to increase access, we continue to open Chipotlanes and this test will ramp up later in 2019. These restaurants are a great extension of our digital system as they help increase convenience and access to Chipotle for customers looking to pick up digital orders without getting out of their cars.","On marketing and digital, we're helping to bring guests into our restaurants, the operations team is determined to deliver a great experience that will keep them coming back. Specifically, we are focused on team stability and development, creating and supporting an inclusive engaged culture, exceptional throughput, consistently delivering great tasting food and food safety. Our field leadership conference last month allowed us to reiterate these messages, while also highlighting the theme that Chipotle is a people driven world class organization. The key part of this is to continue supporting and celebrating our general managers through better leadership training, providing a clear direction on career progression to ensure long term success and great benefits as illustrated by our enhanced tuition assistance program.","While early, these efforts are beginning to make a difference. We experienced a solid reduction in overall turnover measures in Q1, which tells us we're on the right path with our people focused initiatives. We are now consistently executing line testings and leveraging chef food and cooking demonstrations to improve the quality of our food. And these efforts are being noticed by guests as measured by our guest experience survey. In addition to these outcomes, we are seeing a modest improvement in throughput, aided by training, focus and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard that provides greater visibility on performance.","We still have more work to do but I am encouraged by the progress thus far. And we are aligned in our approach and believe that great execution will enable Chipotle to capitalize on future growth opportunities. As we continue to evolve our brand and grow the business, it is an honor to welcome Patricia Fili-Krushel and Scott Boatwright to our board of directors. Pat is currently the CEO of the Center for Talent Innovation, and has previously held numerous leadership roles in Comcast, Time Warner and WebMD. Scott recently retired as CFO of Starbucks after a long and successful career. From contributions in global business strategy and talent management to finance and risk management, I'm confident both Pat's and Scott's perspectives and valuable insights will help us accelerate our goals.","With that, let me conclude by thanking all of our team members for their belief in Chipotle. Their dedication and passion to provide our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. Whether I'm in our restaurants or in our support centers, I feel the energy and see the right actions being taken day-in day-out. It's this focus and strong execution that has brought us to where we are today. To care, hard work and dedication on the line, in the kitchen and in our support centers, are the reason we are winning in the marketplace. We're off to a great start in 2019. And with our sustained efforts, I believe Chipotle can cultivate a better world.","With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials.","Jack Hartung","Thanks, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report another strong quarter as both comps and margins accelerated from our last report. The biggest lever to strengthening our economic model has always been comp sales and transaction growth. And the Q1 results illustrate that point as we achieved our highest restaurant level margin in nearly four years. Customer engagement and visits are increasing as a result of a compelling marketing message, more convenient access, including delivery and strong operations.","Sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 13.9% from last year and comp sales growth of 9.9%. This 9.9% comp includes a reduction of 30 basis points as a result of deferred revenue from our loyalty program. Restaurant level margins of 21% extended 150 basis points over last year and earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items was $3.40, representing 60% year-over-year growth. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to the transformation, and these negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.27, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $3.13.","In Q1, we recognized $7.5 million in non-recurring expenses, primarily related to the organizational restructuring. Transformation costs which started last year now total about $98 million, and we continue to expect these charges to total between $100 million and $120 million. The EPS of $3.40 include $7.3 million or $5.5 million on a tax effective basis. And G&A related to higher bonuses, higher non-cash performance based stock comp adjustments and higher employer payroll taxes, all related to our strong performance and the strong performance of our stock.","The higher stock price also contributed to a tax benefit of 480 basis points in the quarter. The stock option exercises and RSU vestings at the higher stock price drove excess income tax deductions. This tax benefit offset the higher performance based costs included in G&A, resulting in no net impact to EPS. And I'll talk in more detail about these impacts later. Our Q1 comp of 9.9% was driven by a healthy acceleration in transaction as 5.8% of the comp came from greater guests visits. The higher average stock includes a price impact of roughly 2.5% and a mixed contribution of 2% driven by growth in digital orders, which have a higher average check.","With the launch of our Chipotle rewards loyalty program, accounting rules require to deduct or defer revenue for anticipated reward redemptions in our current comp sales. This negatively impacted our Q1 comps by about 30 basis points. We're pleased that our customers have responded enthusiastically for our digital strategies and our culturally relevant marketing, which drove increased guest visits this quarter. And our restaurant teams welcomed our customers by providing a great guest experience.","With these strong Q1 sales results, we're increasing our full year comp guidance from mid single digit to mid to high single digit range with price contributing about 2%. Our comparisons get more difficult as the year goes on. And for Q2 specifically, recall that last year's second quarter benefited by about 100 to 200 basis points, and the beginning of our partnership with DoorDash in May and from the start of our spring marketing campaign.","Finally, the revenue deferral of 30 basis points in the quarter related to loyalty is expected to increase each quarter as we acquire more customers, and it's likely to hit 100 basis points or more before redemption cause the deferrals to level off. We opened 50 new restaurants in the quarter and returned for new restaurants continue to be strong with projected year two cash on cash returns in the low 40% range. Our development teams continue to emphasize high quality and high returning sites. For 2019, we continue to expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants with a waiting towards the second half of the year. We anticipate Q2 openings to be slightly higher than what we saw in Q1.","Food costs for the quarter was 32.2%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year as leverage from the December price increase was partially offset by higher protein prices. Our supply chain team drove approximately $2 million in cost savings through more efficient sourcing this quarter. And while we expect to find additional efficiencies, it's too early to quantify the impact, which we expect to materialize later this year or early next. Of course, our number one priority is to continue to pursue high quality sustainably raised ingredients and our pursuit of efficiencies will never be at expense of food quality or food safety.","While avocado prices were stable throughout most of the quarter, in late March they began to spike based on higher demand from retailers who've been aggressively advertising the fruit combined with lower expected supply in the short term due to the reduced harvesting for an Easter holiday, and a lighter California crop this summer. We expect Q2 food costs to increase around 100 basis points from Q1. For the full year, we continue to believe food costs will be right around 33%.","Labor costs for the quarter were 26.7%, a decrease of 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales levers and the menu price increase. We also decreased our workers' comp liability due to better management of claims activity, and we experienced lower unemployment expenses. These benefits were partially offset by labor inflation, which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range. We expect Q2 labor costs to be in the low 26% range as leverage from sales growth and the menu price increase is expected to offset ongoing wage inflation.","Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.4%, an increase of 50 basis points from Q1 of last year and higher marketing and promo costs more than offset sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, an increase of about 70 basis points compared to Q1 of last year to fund our behind the foil campaign in February and free delivery bowl campaign in early January. We expect to increase our marketing investment to around 3.5% in Q2, but still expect overall marketing and promo budget for the full year to be right around 3% of sales.","Other operating costs were also higher due to the inclusion of delivery fees. Delivery continues to be the fastest growing part of our business with high incrementality. And from a margin standpoint, because of the efficiency of our dedicated second make line along with the high leverage our economic models generates on incremental sales, delivery continues to be accretive for our margins.","G&A for the fourth quarter was 7.8% of sales or $103 million, which included nearly $5 million related to transformation expenses, nearly $25 million related to non-cash stock compensation, higher bonus accruals related to our strong performance and payroll taxes and stock option exercises, along with $1.5 million for expenses related to our biannual field leadership conference. Without these items, our underlying G&A support totaled about $72 million right around what we expected.","We expect our underlying G&A support to remain around this level for the rest of the year. And while total G&A each quarter should be lower than the $103 million in Q1 as we complete the transformation of our company and those related costs fall out. The total G&A each quarter will vary as a result of these performance based charges and the level of option exercises. As an example, stock comp in the quarter includes an upward revision of $1.9 million in our non-cash stock comp related to performance shares. Unlike stock options and restricted stock grant, the accounting expense associated with performance shares will adjust up or down each quarter over the vesting term based on actual performance.","Our annual grants have evolved over the past two years to become more heavily weighted towards these BSUs with the percentage of overall equity grants growing from less than 10% in 2017 to about one third in 2019. While these PSUs, which are tied to improving margins and comps, are effective in aligning company performance and incentive pay for the creation of shareholder value, the variable accounting treatment can cause volatility in our recorded quarterly G&A cost. Another component of G&A that's difficult to project and will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter is the employer payroll taxes and stock option exercises and stock vesting. These costs will vary depending on the stock performance and the timing of when our employees choose to exercise.","Depreciation expense for the quarter was $53.8 million, which included $1.8 million of accelerated depreciation related to our digital make line project progressing more quickly than initially anticipated. For the full year, we expect depreciation to be about 4% of sales. Asset retirements were higher this quarter as re-retired assets were identified last year as we completed the big pay. Our effective tax rate was 22% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis, both lower than our communicated range of 27% to 30%.","Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and restricted share vesting and elevated stock prices. In essence, we receive a tax deduction for the value our employees receive upon option exercise or share vesting. And when that value exceeds the fixed accounting charge for those shares, we benefit from a higher tax deduction. For the remainder of 2019, we expect our underlying tax rate to be at the low end of our previously disclosed 27% to 30% range. Though it may vary quarter-to-quarter based on the factors I just mentioned.","Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling $735 million as of March 31. We repurchased $52.4 million of our stock at an average price of $567 per share during the first quarter. Even though there are fewer shares outstanding and trading as a result of these purchases, our diluted weighted average number of shares increased 422,000 shares as a result of more options being in the money given the higher share price. This negatively impacted EPS by $0.05 in the quarter.","In closing, we're encouraged by our Q1 results and the progress we're making against our strategic growth plan. We know that [Multiple Speakers] initiatives, many of which are in the early stages will help drive sustainable, long-term growth for Chipotle. This will benefit our guests, our employees and our shareholders, and it will allow us to have a positive impact on how real food is sourced and made accessible, contributing to our vision of cultivating a better world.","And now, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from Sarah Senator with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Sarah Senator","I have a question about delivery, if I may. And first part is just, you\u2019ve seen an inflection point, I don't think we've observed in any other limited service in terms of launching delivery and really seeing a change in comp. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk about what you think might be distinct about your context for what you're doing, where you could see that level of incrementality that we're not really seeing perhaps elsewhere. And then just on the margin side, you said it is accretive to margins but then also called that that was a cost headwind. So could you talk a little bit about that? And if there's any opportunity to perhaps lower the cost and delivery, whether it\u2019s the take rates that aggregators have or something else? Thanks.","Brian Niccol","So, we\u2019ll answer both of those questions. So your first question, why do we believe Chipotle is a great solution with respect to delivery. I think it's as simple as our food really travels well in the channel. And then when you think about the time and the ease of access to actually get your order in and then the amount of time that it takes for your food to then get you is some of the best in that space. So we're basically removing a lot of obstacles for people, because the app experience or the web experience, I think is one of the best out there. So it's very easy for people to place order. And then when you look at the time for people to get their food from orders at home, again, it's one of the best alternatives out there for that space.","So time and time here is delivery drivers love delivering Chipotle food, because of our smart pickup times. So they know the food be ready when they walk into the restaurants, they grab it off those pickup shelves and they go. And there's literally no wasted time in the process. And that's we're going to continue to work towards is removing all the friction so that these deliveries become as efficient as possible.","In regard to your question on the margins and incrementality, we continue to see as we give people more access, we get more incremental business. And delivery is one of those occasions that is proving to be highly incremental for the Chipotle business. And on the margin side of things, we are continuing to see with that high level of incrementality it results in a margin accretive proposition. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything.","Jack Hartung","The only thing, Sarah, when we look at delivering, we take the sales. Some of it is trade off that we think is coming from in-store to delivery. Most of it, we think at least two thirds is incremental. But we take our costs associated with that business. So we separate it as a separate business and we've got our food costs, our labor costs and you factor in the delivery costs as well. Our second make line is very, very efficient and our incrementality, our model drive a high margin incrementality, that the margin that we get on the delivery business is higher than the 21%. So if we didn't have delivery, we would not have delivered the 21% margin. Now, I called that out in other that we do have delivery fees in there. So you're going to see that line item is going to be higher. When you take the whole P&L of delivery together, we're generating net incremental margins at a higher than 21%.","Operator","The next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Nicole Miller","Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations. If you could think about same store sales performance and rank the drivers, it does sound like delivery is number one. But I'm just wondering what TV marketing in past you would suggest there was on comp. And then in terms of delivery, when you think about the 15% or so of sales in delivery, how much was going to your app? And how much is going through other third party marketplace sites? And besides having the ability to keep your data when it comes to your app, what are some of the other economic differences?","Brian Niccol","The first piece I just want to clarify the 15.7% is digital. So that's percent of sales in digital. Within that 15.7%, delivery makes up a certain percentage of that. So I just want to make sure if you guys understand the 15.7% it's not a delivery percent of sales, that's our total digital percent of sales. To go to your first question though, the breakdown between the various levers that drove comp, and I really think we just had a lot of things working in unison that we're building nicely on top of each other. You have the marketing, which I think was very visible with some smart menu innovation around these ideas of lifestyle goals.","And then we've got very positive response to advertising, which I think reinforces why Chipotle is a different restaurant company there is real ingredients, real cooking techniques that brings food really fresh to you at tremendous speed and tremendous value. So I think that is coming through loud and clear. And we know that is a compelling message for people to be excited about being part of the Chipotle business.","The other piece, obviously, is our digital business. As we continue to make access easier, so there's mobile pickup shelves giving to more restaurants, the digital make lines giving to more restaurants. We just execute that much better than we did the prior week. And what we're seeing is consumers love the app experience. They love the new website experience. And that's resulting in them committing, I think more and more to this easier access approach through the digital channel. Many layer in the idea of delivery, which our delivery times are usually below 30 minutes. And what we're hearing from folks is they love obtaining that new point of access as well.","I think we're also one of the only companies out there that has delivery boat in our own app, and is using a third-party partner like a DoorDash or those that are delivering for us. And what we're seeing is no overlap between the two access points. So they're proving to be two different occasions and which is really terrific news. And we have built strong relationships with our partners where we're able to use data smartly to inform what we do next, as well as in the data reflecting internally.","The other thing too is the rewards program got started. And one of the things that's terrific about the rewards program is we see another level of engagement into our digital system. So you see even more commitment to the idea of digital ordering, as well as all these additional access points. So the last thing too is I would tell you our operations. If you had a chance to be in Chipotle lately, I think they have really improved versus where we were three months ago, six months ago or even nine months ago.","Our crews are staffed they know about how to make great food, they're doing line testings, the restaurants look great. And we're making progress on throughput. So when you think about all the initiatives that are going on, our operations, I think are operating at a higher level than they have in the past. I think our digital system is more robust than it was in the past. And I think our marketing is much more on point and much more visible. So it's hard to distinguish one versus the other. I really think it is all those things working in unison, and that's why we get that 9.9% comp.","Operator","The next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead.","David Tarantino","Just a couple of questions on the sales trends. Jack first can you maybe talk about how the comps trended through the quarter? Was it a gradual build or any color you could add there would be helpful?","Jack Hartung","So we started the quarter very strong. We had the free delivery bowls that continued into January. Then we had Lifestyle Bowls as well. There was a lot of talk about the Lifestyle Bowls. So the quarter started out very, very strong. We had weather then in the middle of the quarter, and then things rebounded near the end of the quarter. So there's a lot going on in the quarter. It was overall relatively steady if you factor out some of the weather. But we did start out -- like I said, we started out very strong and then settled into nice gains for the quarter with the exception of the weather during the middle of the quarter.","David Tarantino","And then, Brian, you mentioned that the guest experience surveys that you run have responded well to the operational improvements you mentioned. So I was wondering if you could perhaps elaborate on where you are now on whatever metric you're measuring versus where you were three or six months ago. And how much you think that might be influencing the trends that you're seeing relative to some of the more tangible drivers you talked about?","Brian Niccol","So one of the biggest things that we've seen make the dramatic change is just the feedback on the food testings. And I think that's a direct result of our teams being basically focused on ensuring they\u2019re creating great food and they are doing their line testings. And so one of the examples I'd give you is what we seen in customer satisfaction surveys is people are commenting on how great the food tastes again. And I think that is a testament to a couple of things. You don't end up with great food unless people make the food correctly. And you don't end up with great food if, when you sit down and go to eat your food that\u2019s not in a great environment. So all those things I think help build the idea that this food was terrific. The other thing that we're seeing in our customer satisfaction surveys are people just are getting us high marks on overall experience versus where we were in the past. So is a customer satisfaction survey is the best way for us to get that feedback, and we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing in those key metrics.","David Tarantino","And then just a quick follow up. Brian, I know you shared some throughput metrics in the past related to your peak 15 minute intervals. And I think the last update you gave us was 25 transactions in the peak on average for the change, and it used to be 35 before all the issues. So can you maybe just give us an update on where you are heading into the peak season here on that metric?","Brian Niccol","So I think I made comment in my early remarks. We're seeing some improvement on that mid 25, that mid 20s number. And we're excited about the improvement that we've seen. We're not I think done getting better on this throughput front. We're obviously not close to that mid 30 number that you referenced, David. But we're definitely making progress from the mid 20. And I think this is going to be one of those things that overtime we just continue to get better at. This is element of having teams in place with some stability with the right leader in place, so that they really get into a rhythm of great throughput. But early indications, we're making some progress on this front already. And we're excited because there's still so much headroom to get us back to where we were.","Operator","The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Glass","First, can you just comment, Brian, little more about the loyalty program? How does this fit in as you think about comp drivers? And you talked last quarter about a material step up in trend when you did delivery and activated digital? Did it result or is it too early to tell if this is also resulting in another step function up in sales? Or does it taking longer to engage consumers given it take some time to clear the points?","Brian Niccol","I think John it's going to take a little bit longer for us to see the direct impact. What we are excited about though is I think I said this in the past. One of the big request from our consumers was a rewards program. We've rolled out a rewards program and now we've already got 3 million people enrolled. And we're just getting started with using that information to then smartly market to those individuals. So there're few things that are going to be happening over the next year. We're going to continue to build that enrollment. And as you build that enrollment, it gives us a bigger universe then to create the right programs to incentivize behaviors and hopefully change behaviors associated with it.","But I don't think we've seen the impacts yet from the rewards program, because we're just getting started with the enrollment and we're frankly just getting started with doing some targeted marketing leveraging that.","John Glass","And if I could, just one follow up on labor, Jack. Is my calculation is labor dollars per store ran a bit higher than what you would call your wage inflation about 6% versus wage inflation of 4% to 5%. And if that's right, is this just the cost of higher throughput and higher volumes in your stores? Or is that the right way to think about labor dollars per store going forward if your conference are at this new higher run rate?","Jack Hartung","John, our labor was really outstanding during the quarter. Our teams staff and deployed had about the right level. They certainly didn't have more hours than we would have expected of anything. They were a little more efficient than we would normally shoot for, but we had a burst in volume. So when you have that 9.9% and you should think about the comp as being at 10.3%, because that deferral means we had customers that came in they are paying customers and so it's a journal entry to take us from about a 10.2% or 10.3% down to a 9.9%. And so our folks had the right amount of labor. The way I would think about it, John, is we levered labor by over 100 basis points. We also dealt with about 100 basis points or a little more in terms of wage inflation. And so we had to cover the 100 basis points of wage inflation, and then we levered another 100 basis points. And we only had a modest price increase. So I think our labor is outstanding. And I think if we stay at these sales levels so we should stay at this labor level.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Bernstein","I just wanted to follow-up on the Chipotle Rewards Loyalty program, it seems like 3 million members is pleasing to you relative to perhaps your internal expectation. And I would assume you therefore have customer information now in these 3 millions. I'm wondering if you can go into a little more color in terms of how you'd measure ultimate success, whether how that membership compares to what you think that your total unique users? And Brian, you mentioned the one-to-one marketing. I\u2019m just wondering how we should think about that playing out in terms of using the data to effectively market to those loyal users?","Brian Niccol","So I think that is one of the most valuable pieces of the rewards program is it creates a different type of engagement and relationship with our customers. What we saw in our proof of concept or our test markets is this data, when we turn it into communication, is able to incent behaviors. And we do see behavioral changes, so light user becoming a medium user, a non-user becoming a light user. And you see people moving the various cohorts. We\u2019re early days. We haven't even had for a lot of -- we have 3 million people, which we're delighted about but those are coming in on a daily basis. So we even had a chance to market with these folks on a couple months basis here, so it's really early. But I think the positive is we've got a lot of evidence that consumers want to be a part of it. And we've had evidence in our test markets that when we use the data smartly with them, we do see behavioral changes that results in a positive outcome for our sales group.","Jeffrey Bernstein","And then just to clarify, you mentioned the digital sales being, I think you said just shy of 16%. But I know you mentioned that some stores obviously doing a whole lot better than that. So I'm wondering if you can maybe give some perspective in terms of the range across the country in terms of where you\u2019ve seen the greatest success and how you\u2019d measure the -- I guess the incrementality of those sales relative to more traditional sales?","Brian Niccol","So we've seen where we've got the full digital system in place, definitely higher percent of sales going through the digital channels with higher sales in general. And I think we've even talked about this. Another example is the Chipotlane where you really have added another level of access, and this is why we're continuing to expand that test. We've seen percent of sales for digital touch 30%. So we're very optimistic that there still is a lot of growth to be had. And a lot of that growth is incremental to business. So we're very optimistic about continuing to drive this access point and ecosystem.","Operator","The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John Ivankoe","I was hoping to understand the experience of the stores that have had the pickup shelves, and the digitally enhanced second make line the longest. Has there been a significant labor opportunity on a given number of transactions that can be realized in those stores versus other stores that have newly implemented those projects, or perhaps even best said, the stores that don't yet have those projects?","Brian Niccol","I mean, what is definitely true is the most valuable transaction is an order ahead, whether it's in mobile or website, and then that consumer comes in and picks it up from the shelf, because obviously that leverage is then the digital make line, which requires less labor to run. And then, obviously, that transaction usually comes with a higher ticket as well. So that is the most valuable transaction for us to grow. One of the things I love about the Chipotlane test is it gives them more access to that highly valuable transaction, because they order ahead and now they don\u2019t have to even get out of their car to have an experience with a burrito bowl coming off our second make line. So there's a lot of upside in getting more and more business to that second make line just from an efficiency standpoint and then obviously the consumer just key at which they can get to their burrito bowl.","John Ivankoe","And then secondly and I think this was touched on briefly. Some of the broader supply chain work that you've been working on. I mean if we could have an update on some timing and potential benefit on that, especially if you look into '20?","Brian Niccol","So we're early days on this and we already started to see some benefit in the quarter. Their focus is obviously to continue to be as efficient as possible without making a trade off on the quality and our commitment to our integrity price goals. I don't know Jack if you wanted to add anything to that.","Jack Hartung","John, I think the headline is it's too early. Brian is right that's our highest priority. We're also keeping ourselves busy just by keeping up with the growing volume. And we're seeing theoretical opportunities, efficiency opportunities, but they take time. We've got contracts. We've had a lot of suppliers. And so I would expect that we'll be able to -- if we don't see the benefit flow through later this year, perhaps in the fourth quarter, we'll at least have better visibility and we can tell you what those might look like going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jake Bartlett","Jack, I have a question about G&A. And you gave us the underlying I think $72 million run rate continuing. I'm trying to understand the stock based comp. And I believe you mentioned $25 million, but that also included bonus accruals. I wasn't sure if that all was really the stock based comp. And then if you hit your guidance, if the current guidance is hit. Is that $25 million pertain for the rest of the year, because that\u2019s the right run rate for that, for bonus accruals and stock based camp. And then built into that question, there was a big impact on the tax rate with the $25 million. Would the tax rate go down as well to offset some of it? I'm trying to get a better idea of what the G&A could be for '19?","Jack Hartung","Well, first of all, let me try to piece that -- tear that apart. The $25 million of that $19 million relates to our stock comp. And of that $19 million, about $2 million is an adjustment to stock comp, because we had better performance. We have, as we disclose in our proxy we, over the last couple of years, have emphasized more PSUs performance shares. Those performance shares will be marked each quarter based on how we actually perform. If you follow us historically when we've issued [indiscernible] as our option, those are fixed accounting and they don't change quarter-to-quarter, doesn't matter what our performance is, doesn't matter what the stock performance is. So it's a different animal that aligns better, we think the incentives with creating shareholder value. But it's going to have variable accounting and we're going to have drones entry that are going to happen throughout the year.","The other 6 million relate to the higher bonus accrual, because of our performance. And that's going to be a cash bonus based on how we perform each quarter. And so if we continue to perform at this level, there will be higher bonus accruals. And then another element in there is that because our stock has performed so well, we've had an increase in the number of stock option exercises. And we have to pay payroll taxes on those, those are very difficult to predict when those are going to happen, also difficult to predict what the stock price is going to be. So there's going to be a number of things that are going to be not part of our core. The G&A this quarter didn't have to do with extra headcount, didn't have to do with extra travel, didn't have to do with anything from an ongoing basis that we need to continue to spend to support a restaurant. But these are incentive based things that are going to hit based on how we perform throughout the year.","Difficult to predict exactly what the number will be, I think the best way to think about it. Underlying is about $72 million and underlying means that\u2019s our headcount to support our business, that's the travel, that's the outside services to support our business. There's a base layer, I would say, of about that $17 million stock comp that if we had fixed accounting that $17 million would not change throughout the year. And then on top of that, we're going to have amounts that will vary depending on our bonus accrual, and that will be performance based depending on the PSUs and that will be performance based on margins and what our stock comp is. And then to the extent that our folks exercise option, the stock price remains high, there may be some payroll tax impact as well.","Jake Bartlett","And then you just secondly, Jack, you\u2019ve mentioned in the past, just your last call, a framework around AUVs and what AUVs could have a given restaurant level margin. I had trouble getting there. And so I'm just wondering when you talked about last call 2.2 million in AUVs and 22% restaurant margins. Is that still -- or does that include inflation going forward? Is that if you were standing right now with your current cost structure, and you have those higher AUVs that's what your margin would be? Trying to understand whether that's really how we can frame that target and mesh the two with those AUVs?","Jack Hartung","Jake, it's more of a standing still. And in fact, we're right on the money right now. Our trailing 12 month average volume is 20% -- $0.5 million -- $2.05 million we're at 21% margin during this quarter. And what I've talked about is $2 million you\u2019re at about a 20% margin, $2.2 million you're at 22%. The way I would think about it from here, if we layered on $100,000 worth of incremental volume as of today, our margins at 21% during the quarter, would be -- that extra $100,000 would be a 22%. Now, over time inflation is going to have an impact there. We have to either offset inflation through modest price increases and\/or leverage from higher sales. But as long as we're able to offset inflation over time, our model has the ability to expand margins at about 100 basis points to reach $100,000 of sales added.","And I think probably the most important thing is we've been able to do this as our delivery business is growing dramatically, and we know the industry that's been a real challenge. We think we're uniquely suited with the second make line and efficiencies we drive with that second make line, and our model that inherently allows us to create leverage -- margin leverage as we grow sales. We're very optimistic that the more we add delivery sales to our business that margin has the ability to continue to drift upward.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles","Jack, I had a two part question for you. You called out projected year-two cash-on-cash returns and a low 40% range. Obviously, very stellar return. Do you think there's going to be a delta between the 2018 and 2019 cohort? That 2018 development skewed to some of the higher volume markets, or are you testing some the higher cost towards that in 2019? And then secondly is the low 40% returns, is that a strong enough hurdle to justify accelerating development back to call it the 250 openings per year you opened at the peak?","Jack Hartung","First of all in terms of 2018 versus 2019, I mean it's early. It won't have 15 restaurants in so far. But I don't see any reason why 2019 performance wouldn't be similar to 2018. Meaning similar volumes, similar margins, similar returns. It does suggest that we have opportunity to step it up and open up more restaurants. We know that we're only halfway to our ultimate potential. We're about 2500 restaurants now with the ability to get to 5,000. So it suggests that we can step it up but we're going to do it the very thoughtful way. This is not going to be -- we're going to blow the doors off and go from -- our guidance this year is 141, 155, we're not going to all of a sudden open up two or 250 or something like that.","What's most important is that we open at a pace that we're able to find great real estate that'll continue to generate these returns that we'll be able to hire, and develop and staff, our restaurants with great managers and great crew. So we'll have the right cadence going forward. But I do think you can expect us to take our opening guidance up each year in an incremental fashion. Too early to say how much that will be in 2020. But we're optimistic about the results and we'll step it up from here.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Gregory Francfort","The first question is G&A in a longer term basis? Maybe can you help frame up how you expect that to grow versus revenue? And then the second question just on the unit opening cadence within the year. I think last quarter you'd given us that the second quarter was going to be around 25% of openings for the year. Is that still the case or is it different from that?","Jack Hartung","What was your first question?","Gregory Francfort","I was just -- your G&A on a longer term and leveraging it versus revenue growth\u2026","Jack Hartung","The underlying G&A, and I have to emphasize underlying G&A. Underlying G&A will grow at a lesser rate than sales growth. That's our goal internally. And I know we can achieve that goal. From a stock comp standpoint, we're going to have journal entries. Remember, these are journal entries, and these journal entries are different today, because we have PSUs from the journal entries we would report three or four years ago when we had slow start. Even though we're issuing equity, even though there's solution related to this equity, the accounting treatment is dramatically different. And so it's important to understand that these journal entries that we're making, it doesn't change our cash flow, it doesn't change our cash and cash return but it does going to show up in our G&A through these accounting journal entries.","The underlying G&A and that's the headcount, the travel, the outside services that we use to support our restaurants, we do plan to grow that at a lesser percent of sales. And then we're going to have cyclical things like we're going to have a quarter where there's a lot of option exercise and we're going to have a blip in payroll taxes. That's not a sustainable fundamental thing that will continue every single quarter. And we're going to have -- when we have great years like this or great quarter like this, you're going to have bonus accruals. But the idea there is that will be a match along with our improving out the economic model. And it really sets up sets us up for continued momentum, both in our sales, our margin, as well as EPS. ","And then the second question was I think on opening. I think I mentioned in my comments, Q2 will open up at a little bit more than the 15 that we opened up in the first quarter. So this is going to be one of those years where we're pretty more heavily loaded in the second half of the year than we've been in quite some time.","Operator","The next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Will Slabaugh","I had a question on menu innovation. And what we've seen in the past is when menu innovation that generally uses ingredients already in store. Should we expect future menu innovation rather to mostly take that same form, or is there room to broaden SKUs in the restaurant at this point?","Brian Niccol","Yes, you're going to see us doing both. Obviously, what we did in the first quarter was leverage existing ingredients that were already on the line. But I think I've mentioned this before, we're using our stage-gate process to evaluate either new ingredients and\/or new forms to bring into the restaurant. And one of our key criteria in order to bring in a new form or an all new ingredient is it can't have an impact on throughput. So the consumers going to love it, it's got to work financially but it also has to work for our operating process. And so as a result, it's going to take a little longer time to bring things to market that are either a change in process or require new equipment or a new form versus it's much easier to do things like a new ingredient or introduce people to a new way, or a new Lifestyle Bowl, like we did in the first quarter. But the plan is to do both.","Operator","The next question comes from Howard Penny with Hedgeye. Please go ahead.","Howard Penny","My questions on delivery. Is Georgia's funding part of the delivery or are you funding all of the delivery costs? And if you are given all the benefits that you're seeing from delivery from a margin perspective and enhance capability of delivery. Why wouldn't you offer delivery free all the time and if not all the time, three or four days a week? Thanks.","Brian Niccol","So, obviously, delivery is one of those access modes that consumers definitely want to experience. This is a scenario where we want to set up the model to be a model that can work long-term, not just here in the near term. And long term, we can just be planning to do free delivery all the time. So really what we're focused on is, how do we build the right economic model where the consumer gets a great experience, they get a great value and as a result, they want to do it more. And I think that's what we're setting up and establishing with our key partners, whether they are doing it through our app or through a third-party.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead.","Brian Bittner","Jack, you said labor costs in 2Q should be in the low 26% range. And that would suggest a similar amount of leverage that you got in first quarter. So just trying to clarify. Are you assuming a similar sales trend in 2Q as 1Q when you talk about that labor guide? And second to that the full year guidance for labor, back when you talked to us last quarter, was low 27% range. But you didn't really update that this quarter for the full year. Where's that target now in your mind for full year labor costs?","Jack Hartung","When I think about Q2, I would not expect the same comp. Take into account by the full year guidance that we gave and take into account that comps get tougher each quarter. What it does mean though is seasonally our sales are higher in the second quarter. So when you move from Q1 to Q2, you naturally have a higher sales amount and you naturally have a leverage, just from moving to seasonally higher sales. It doesn't mean the comp is going to be at the same 9.9% level.","The other thing I would expect that labor for the year is going to be somewhere in between these two levels. I mean, you got 26.7% in the first quarter. Fourth quarter seasonally is very similar. And the two quarters in the middle should be similar where you're in that low 26% range. So I think somewhere between the low 26% to the 26.7% we just delivered, I think that's a fair estimation of where labor should fall. And what we shown in this quarter, we have labor at that level. And as long as we don't have as long as things like avocados normalize we could deliver this strong comp in the 20%, 21% range or so.","Operator","And the next question comes from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Brian Vaccaro","Just two quick ones on delivery, if I could. Would you be willing to ballpark what percent of digital sales is coming from delivery? And also curious what percent of orders are coming through the company app versus the DoorDash or other third party platforms? And did that move much since the launch of the loyalty program over the five or six weeks?","Brian Niccol","We're not going to break out the composition of our digital sales but with obviously to be up 100% year-over-year. We're seeing great progress in all aspects of the digital system, whether it's order ahead delivery. Consumers continue to want to have access digitally and then they want to have access where it's either brought to them or they can get it quick. So that's working very nicely. And then adding rewards, I think I mentioned this before. One of the things that's great about the rewards program is it's another level of engagement in this digital system. And we have continued to see when people become engaged in the rewards program, they become even more engaged in our digital system. And you see an uptick in our digital as a percent of sales as well there.","So it really requires all these things to be working in unison. We got to have the pickup shelves, which I'm happy to say we now have that have in other restaurants, the digital make line, which we're in 1,300 rec up there we'll be finishing that up in 2019. And then the rewards program is in the early days as well where we've got 3 million people already engaged. And then we're giving them the access that they want, whether we're testing our Chipotlanes or letting DoorDash or a third party like that deliver to them at their home. So the digital system is a powerful growth driver for the company going forward. And it's consistent with the strategy that I've shared with you guys. So we're really excited about the early innings of all this stuff.","Brian Vaccaro","And then shift into the commodity outlet, Jack, the 33% that you gave for the year. I'm just curious, what's the underlying inflation embedded in that forecast? And just are you assuming that avocados stay where they are currently after this recent run up? Or any other puts and takes on what you're seeing on core proteins and\/or other areas that we should be mindful of? Thank you.","Jack Hartung","We're seeing just a little bit of inflation in some of our [indiscernible]. Most of the commodities that we're looking at look pretty benign. The real story the only call out is significant call out is avocados. We're paying a lot more right now. That's why second quarter food costs going to be about 100 basis points more. We'll update you when we update you for the second quarter, hopefully that will ease a little bit as you move into the third quarter. We do expect it to go back to normal once we move back to away from California in the fourth quarter. But avocados are a tough thing to predict. Other than avocados, most other things are pretty modest, very low single digit inflation. And so that's why we think we can stay in this 33% range overall for the year.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.","Brian Niccol","All right, thank you. And thank you everybody for taking the time and the questions. I just wanted to remind folks, I think the strategies that we outlined over a year ago, we're starting to see the impacts of the execution around that strategy, whether it is making the brand more visible with culturally relevant marketing and menu innovation, or making the restaurant experience more digital with the roll out of our mobile pickup shelves, the digital make line, the delivery partnerships and now the rewards program, to operational improvements focused on great hospitality, great food, a great environment and then ultimately, terrific throughput.","And then obviously, we're going to continue to work hard to improve this economic model, which is I think one of the best in the industry through being smart and being efficient and prudent in how we choose to spend our money. And then the key piece too is we want to continue to drive home access for Chipotle, whether that means physical access to more restaurants, more digital access through the various channels that I\u2019ve talked about earlier. But we want to have Chipotle solve people's needs for how they want to eat in today and in the future. So very proud of the team and the results that we achieved in Q1, and very excited that we continued down this strategy, and continue to execute with excellence going forward.","So thank you for your time. And we'll talk to you all soon. Take care.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I'd now like to introduce the Chipotle Director of Investor Relations, Alex Spong. You may begin.","Alex Spong","Hello, everyone, and welcome to our conference today. By now, you should have the access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the first quarter 2012. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities laws.

I'd like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. This quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the second quarter, it will begin on June 1 and continue through our second quarter release in July.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. ","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","M. Steven Ells","Thank you, Alex. We're pleased to see our momentum from 2011 carry into the first quarter of 2012. Coming out of the recession, we have now seen 7 consecutive quarters of double-digit same-store sales growth, posting a comp sales increase of 12.7% in the first quarter on revenue of $640.6 million, an increase of 25.8% from the first quarter of 2011, adding up to earnings per share of $1.97 for the quarter. More importantly, I'm pleased that we continue to perform well by remaining focused on only those things that are the major drivers of our business, our unique food culture and our unique people culture.","During the quarter, we made another significant leap in educating our customers about our commitment to serving great food made with better ingredients from more sustainable sources when we ran our 2-minute animated short film, Back to the Start, as a commercial during the Grammy awards. Buying such a large block of time during the Grammys reached a significant number of people with this important message and sparked some very public dialogue about food issues that continued for several days in social media and mainstream media outlets.","This year's Grammys telecast surpassed the expected 29 million viewers with 40 million people tuning in. But the spot had a much broader reach and impact than that. Immediately after it aired, the spot prompted 22,000 Tweets and significant reach in social media where it produced more than 33 million impressions on Twitter in the days that followed the Grammys. According to the popular sharing platform, AddThis, which tracks the frequency with which people are looking at or sharing things in social media, our commercial was unique in that as soon as people saw it, they felt like seeing it again and wanted to share it with their friends. Running the spot on the Grammys also provided another significant PR opportunity for us. ","In all, press coverage surrounding the spot generated another 150 million media impressions, giving us the kind of media attention that is often associated with Super Bowl ads. But with our Grammys spot, all of that coverage was focused only on Chipotle instead of being shared among numerous Super Bowl advertisers.","The Back to the Start film is just one part of our Cultivate marketing platform which is designed to invite people on our journey to a more sustainable world. While most other fast food companies use advertising to tell the latest discount or the latest menu item, we believe that we are creating a more loyal frequent customer by connecting with them rather than advertising at them.","Since we have such a great story to tell, our challenge is to tell it in the most compelling way possible and we have found that less traditional forms of advertising work better. The Back to the Start short film and other films and of similar nature that are in production now are a great example. Just as we did with the Back to the Start film, we'll start small with these projects and figure out the best way to use the films based on the opportunities we think they provide as they come together.","Our day-long Cultivate Festival series planned for Chicago and Denver this year is another way we're making use of nontraditional marketing, as is our Farm Team program that rewards knowledge about the Chipotle story. These programs, along with a variety of others including games, educational content and a refined approach to local marketing, are all designed to engage our customers in conversations and create an emotional connection that will last much longer than any limited time offer possibly could. ","I think this is absolutely the right direction for our marketing and believe it's very consistent with our brand. We've built Chipotle in a way that's different than traditional fast food, so it should be no surprise that marketing works best for us that doesn't follow traditional fast food model. Of course, marketing efforts like this would ring hollow if we weren't so deeply committed to doing the kinds of things our marketing portrays, and our commitment has never been stronger to finding better, more sustainable sources for all of the ingredients that we use and identifying ways to improve the taste of our food by finding better ways to prepare it. ","For example, we're improving our flour tortillas to make them taste better. And we use more -- and be more nutritious with twice as much whole wheat as our current tortilla and free of preservatives. We're already serving this new tortilla, which is very similar to the tortilla we're using in our London restaurants, in our restaurants in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. Not only is this a better tasting and more nutritious tortilla, but removing preservatives and increasing its nutritional content also brings it more within our philosophy of serving Food With Integrity. ","We're also working to improve our soft corn tortillas. We have developed an improved recipe for more consistent corn tortillas made from a combination of white and yellow card masa flour. These new tortillas not only taste better, but have a better texture and improved eating quality. We've begun testing these tortillas in Portland and our Chelsea restaurant in New York and if successful, we'll roll these new soft corn tortillas out before the end of the year. ","We're also working to improve our beans. We're experimenting with a new process and equipment which will allow us to better hydrate the dry beans fully and consistently before they're cooked. The result will be that all of our beans, regardless of the time of year, will always be cooked exactly the same. This will allow us to make better and more consistent beans throughout the year and ensure that the viscosity and the texture are always at their optimum. ","These changes are some of the examples of our ongoing commitment to finding ways to improve the quality and taste of the food we serve, whether that means finding better ingredients from more sustainable sources, new recipes to make our food more nutritious and better tasting or new cooking processes that help us serve the best food possible.","We continue to make progress with our expansion in Europe not just in terms of opening new restaurants, but also in terms of developing teams of top performers to provide us with the future leaders we'll need as we continue to grow. Currently we have 2 restaurants open in the U.K. with plans to open 3 more between now and the end of the year. Our first Paris restaurant is slated to open this spring, and we plan to open a couple more restaurants in Canada as well. Of course, development of Chipotle restaurants in the United States will remain the focus of our growth for the foreseeable future.","As we work in Europe, I can't help but notice the tremendous benefits of starting from scratch in these new markets, but built upon a solid restaurateur culture with teams of top performers who have high standards. Our initial teams in London are extraordinary and our managers are taking great care to hire only top performers who can be developed into our future managers and future leaders for us in Europe. As we work to open our third restaurant in London on Wardour Street, we have already appointed a manager who has been with us since day one at our first London restaurant on Charing Cross Road and we've screened hundreds of applicants to hire only 15. The team in London tells me that they expect to screen hundreds more to get the 25 or 30 employees they'll need to open. That strong commitment to finding and hiring only top performers for positions will help us accommodate growth in the future.","Finally, as we continue our efforts to reemphasize throughput in our U.S. restaurants, which Monty is going to discuss a little bit later, we're just beginning to emphasize this concept in our restaurants in London. Already, we are seeing the impact of these efforts there, seeing better transaction volumes and better customer service as our managers and crews are beginning to emphasize the same throughput practices we've been teaching in the restaurants in the United States. ","Our commitment to improving our food culture and our people culture has never been stronger and our business results demonstrate the benefits of our unwavering focus in these critical areas. This focus will not only allow us to achieve our vision to change the way people think about any fast food, but it will also allow us to deliver strong results to our shareholders. ","I'll now turn the call over to Monty.","Montgomery F. Moran","Thanks, Steve. Like Steve, I'm pleased with our results for the first quarter and I'm very proud of our terrific restaurant teams, whose hard work and dedication has led to this success. Our people culture continues to be a key driver of our business and I'm delighted with how we have developed such an extraordinary and powerful culture so quickly. As a reminder, before we created the Restaurateur program, the vast majority of our managers came from the outside and our crew people were seldom promoted to accelerated management positions. So the crew has little reason to be optimistic about their future, which meant that they were not as happy, energized or excited as they could have been and they have less of a sense of ownership over the guest expense. ","Today, the opposite is true. 98% of our managers come from crew. So our crew members know that they are the future leaders of the company and for this reason, they have a huge sense of ownership and they're excited, driven, optimistic and happy and the best of them quickly move into manager positions where they lead their teams to understand and take part in our special culture. ","Because of this, Chipotle is able to attract and hire a much stronger crew than ever before and they are fast becoming managers and ultimately, restaurateurs. These top performers know how to hire the very best crew. They know how to lead these people to become a strong team and they know that doing this is the surest way to create an amazing dining experience for our guests.","But the powerful effect of these excellent leaders does not stop at the restaurant. These great leaders are quickly moving into field leadership positions as well. More of our field leaders now come from restaurateur positions than ever before, and so the awareness of what a restaurateur culture looks like is better than ever. This makes the process of developing and selecting restaurateurs faster and more efficient than ever since a higher percentage of candidates that we interview for this position are accepted into the Restaurateur program. ","Last year, only 74% of the candidates were being accepted to restaurateur but this year, that percentage has increased to about 87%. Year-to-date, we interviewed 42 potential restaurateurs and accepted 36 into the program, bringing our total number of restaurateurs to 295. When you include the apprentice team leaders, all of them are restaurateurs. In all, more than 60% of our restaurants are now overseen by these extraordinary leaders.","There's another exciting trend that gives us optimism that we will be able to sustain the influence of our special people culture even as the pace of expansion quickens. Specifically, we are noticing that more and more of our new general managers are able to create the restaurateur culture in only a few months after being promoted to the GM role. Additionally, these people coming up to our ranks are some of the best leaders in our company. ","Currently, we have 30 apprentice team leaders, all of whom worked their way up from hourly positions in our restaurants. As a reminder, the only way to become an apprentice team leader is to first become a restaurateur and then demonstrate the ability to build excellent teams in 4 restaurants and promote at least one restaurateur from among these. ","The ATL position came into existence in 2008 when we realized that some of our best restaurateurs had the desire and ability to create restaurateur cultures in more than just their own restaurants and we wanted to create a position that would allow these leaders and the company to see the greatest benefit from their leadership abilities. ","Well, in the first 2 years after developing this new position, only one person was able to reach this elite level. Happily, during the following 2 years after that, from January 1, 2010 to January 1, 2012, we had 19 more making it to this position.","So what's most impressive is that we have promoted 10 more ATLs in just the last 3 months. In other words, a full 1\/3 of all of the apprentice team leaders promoted during the 40 years the program has existed have been promoted since the first of this year. These ATLs are not only understanding and can teach the restaurateur culture; they are also having a big impact in the business. They quickly identify issues, diagnose the root cause of problems and have a clear vision for how to develop and promote their crew to positions of greater leadership. ","Despite their short tenure, they know the people in their restaurant and they know how to quickly establish a restaurateur culture. They literally know of no other way than to identify top performers and empower them to achieve Chipotle's very high standards.","These new apprentice team leaders are truly showing us what's possible when you examine the restaurants and that they oversee and mentor. For example, when you look at the 10 newly appointed apprentice team leaders, for the 73% of the restaurants that they were mentoring at the time of their promotion to ATL were already promoted to restaurateur. When you take into account that only 21% of our restaurants system-wide are run by a restaurateur, that means that these leaders are quickly establishing patches of remarkably well run restaurants, with exceptional experiences for both our guests and the employees who join their teams.","What's more is that they're developing their people at a pace we have never seen before. We're seeing that as this newest generation of field leaders takes on new restaurants, they immediately have a clear vision and plan by which they will lead each of these new restaurants to become a restaurateur restaurant. We are also noticing a higher caliber of future leaders when we visit our restaurants and talk to our managers and crew.","In spending time with Perla Lara, who is a restaurateur who recently became an apprentice team leader in California, I was struck by the quiet confidence she has in her team and her ability to develop future leaders quickly. In asking whether she was prepared to the added responsibilities taking on a number of new restaurants, she seemed confused by my question. In short, she told me that she had no real concern because they would soon all be restaurateurs and restaurateurs take very little time of oversight to a field leader. She told me her job was easy. So I told her that it was going to get much tougher for her as she took on more and more restaurants. But she respectively disagreed with me. She told me that it's not really very hard as long as you have a strong base of restaurateurs to help you. And of course, she is exactly right. And people like Perla do not know any other way. They are the product of a culture where everyone is committed to developing the people around them and they simply do not see obstacles to developing restaurateurs very quickly. In fact, I'm optimistic that Perla will soon be a team leader in the near future.","In another case, after promoting 2 new apprentice team leaders named Carlos and Lorena in Chicago, we were discussing the 8 additional restaurants that they were now going to be asked to lead in their new positions. We asked them how many of these 8 restaurants will be restaurateurs by the end of the year and they looked at us as though we were a bit naive. Of course all of them are going to be restaurateurs, they said. ","These new high expectations are wonderful for us to hear about, but even more wonderful is the fact that our people are achieving these very high expectations.","As we build more new restaurants, our managers need a reliable supply of top-performing new crew in order to develop teams in the restaurants. For this reason, we are giving our managers better tools to improve their ability to recruit, hire and bring on new people. Last quarter I spoke about our plan to rollout a new recruiting and processing tool called Taleo. We are now using Taleo in all of our mid-Atlantic and Rocky Mountain region restaurants, and we'll be using it in all of our restaurants nationwide by the end of May.","Using Taleo in our restaurant simplifies the entire hiring process. It uses a centralized database so that managers can review applications from multiple candidates quickly and easily, without sorting through individual paperwork for each applicant. Also, candidates complete all of their forms online and the system ensures that all their information is entered correctly. This information is automatically integrated into HR system which eliminates the need for additional data entry. Collectively, these benefits will save our managers a lot of time, allowing them to spend more time developing their teams. ","The early feedback regarding this tool from our managers has been very positive and they tell us that they're seeing more high-caliber applicants as a result of this. This tool will allow us to better track information about the number and source of our applicants and it also allows many managers to view the same application simultaneously, so an applicant only needs to apply at one location.","In the last few quarters, I've spoken to you about our renewed emphasis on throughput and I wanted to give you an update on that as well today. Once again, we continue to see promising results on this important initiative. During our peak weekday lunch and dinner hours, we are seeing solid increases compared to last year. Additionally, we have been able to move the needle on our throughput during our busiest 15-minute periods as well. ","Before we began this renewed emphasis on throughput, 2007 was our benchmark year for peak hour transactions. From these highs, our peak hour transactions dipped during the recession and we've been working diligently to restore or surpass those records. Since we renewed this effort in November of 2011, we have managed to exceed our 2007 peak hour transactions for the first quarter. Put another way, our teams are now the fastest that they have ever been for this time of year. We're also encouraged by how our peak hour transactions are making a larger relative contribution to our overall sales comp than they have in the past.","Throughout 2011, our overall daily comp consistently outpaced the comp seen during the noon to 1 hour. However, we reversed this trend more recently with our emphasis on throughput. Since December, we have seen our noon to 1 comp actually grow faster than the rest of the day. This tells us that we are on the right path and that this initiative is gaining traction. These throughput improvements come at the right time, as we're now into some of our busiest months, April and May, and we are now hoping to see our average transaction count increase even more throughout the day and especially during our peak lunch and dinner hours. ","Great throughput really improves the experience we provide our customers in every way. In addition to the obvious benefit of not waiting as long for their food, great throughput is accompanied by better communication and engagement with each guest, more eye contact, hotter, fresher food and overall, a more energized crew serving each customer.  Over time, it's our belief that our continued efforts in this area will lead our customers to come more often as they grow more confident in our ability to keep our lines shorter, allowing them to spend more time enjoying their meal.","Finally, I want to update you on our development progress. We are very optimistic that we will succeed in our commitment to open the 155 to 165 restaurants that we guided earlier this year and we think that approximately 30% of these new restaurants will be A Model locations. We also are optimistic about real estate trends in the coming years. We are predicting a slight increase in the amount of new construction, which we believe will lead to a slightly larger portion of our restaurants being new construction instead of remodels. Specifically, we're seeing a slight increase in landlord-built centers and pad locations which seem to be recovering a bit more quickly than large-scale shopping centers.","At the low in 2010, about 30% of our deals were new construction projects and we expect that, that number will increase to about 36% of our new restaurants in 2012 with perhaps more significant increases by 2014 and 2015.","With stronger food and people cultures than ever before, better tools to help our managers work more efficiently and continued emphasis on improving things that contribute most to the restaurant experience, as well as the continued strengthening of unit economic model, we believe that we are well-positioned to provide consistently strong results for our shareholders. ","With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack Hartung.","John R. Hartung","Well, thanks, Monty. We're very proud of the results we achieved in the first quarter and while the quarter provides an encouraging snapshot of our recent financial trends, what's more important is what's driving these results, the continued strengthening of our food culture, our people culture and our business model. Our top-performing crews and managers are delighting our customers by providing great customer service while serving great tasting food made from premium ingredients, leading to customers wanting to visit Chipotle more often. It's encouraging to see these efforts lead to attractive financial results in the quarter, and it gives us even greater optimism about what lies ahead.","We're pleased to report the 7th consecutive quarter of double-digit sales comps since the economy began to recover with a comp of 12.7%. These strong comps, along with new restaurant openings drove a sales increase of 25.8% to $640.6 million in the quarter. The comp was driven mostly from increased traffic, while higher menu prices added about 4.9%. In March, we raised prices in our Pacific region by about 4.5% to reflect the higher cost of doing business in the region and to help narrow the pricing gap with other U.S. markets. This price increase was completed in March and because it laps a similar increase in the Pacific region at about the same time last year, it will have no additive effect to our comps going forward. ","While we continue to believe we have pricing power, we do not have plans for any additional menu price increases during 2012 to offset expected food inflation. Our business model is strong and we're not compelled to take short-term price increases to drive quarterly results. And instead, we're focused on driving greater customer loyalty and strong transaction trends.","Our comps held up well in the first quarter despite the toughest quarterly comparison in 2011 of 12.4%. Unseasonably mild weather through much of the quarter helped transaction trends remain strong and in addition, we benefited from the leap day in February, which added about 1% to the comp. Our sales comps continue to benefit from the menu price increases taken during the second and third quarters of 2011. Of the current menu price increase run rate of 4.9%, we will lose 3.9% of the benefit over the next 2 quarters as we lap the price increases from last year with about 30 basis points dropping off in Q2 and about 360 basis points dropping off in Q3.","We also faced tough sales comparisons in the back half of 2012 as beginning in the third quarter, we will comp against 2 full years of double-digit comps for the first time since before the recession. Taking all this into account, we reaffirm our full-year comp guidance of mid-single digits. ","Restaurant level margins increased by 220 basis points to 27.4% to 30 basis points shy of our highest-quarterly restaurant level margins set back in Q3 of 2010. The higher margins were driven by sales leverage including the benefit of the menu price increase and from lower promo costs due to the large promotion in Q1 of 2011. Operating margins increased by 130 basis points, lower than the restaurant level margin expansion because it increases the noncash stock comps, which I'll talk about in more detail shortly.","Diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.97, an increase of 34.9%. Food costs were 32.2% in the quarter, up 20 basis points from the first quarter of last year and sequentially were flat from Q4. We were pleased to see that food inflation was moderate in the first quarter as lower prices for avocados, produce and dairy costs helped to offset the increases in beef and chicken. We continue to expect food inflation in the mid single-digit range over the next few quarters due primarily to rising cost of beef, dairy and avocado. Contributing to these higher cost is the expectation that all of our sour cream will come from cows that are pasture-raised beginning in the second quarter and from seasonally higher avocado costs as we return to buying avocado from California this summer. ","Labor costs were 23.7% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 90 basis points from last year. Labor leverage was driven by higher sales volumes, including the benefit from higher menu prices. Occupancy costs in the quarter declined 60 basis points due to leverage from the higher average restaurant sales and other operating costs were 10.3% in the quarter, down 100 basis points compared to last year, driven by lower promo and utility costs. Promo costs were down from last year when we ran a large buy 1 get 1 promotion related to the restaurant TV show we sponsored. ","Marketing was 1.3% in the quarter, the same as in Q1 of last year, with the largest part of our marketing invested in airing our Back to the Start films during the Grammys. We had an audience of over 40 million TV viewers and helped introduce Chipotle to millions of potential new customers. While Back to the Start was not created as a TV ad, the Grammys provided an opportunistic way to share our message with a larger audience about what makes Chipotle special. We feel confident that our marketing approach, which is different than the traditional approach other restaurants have taken, is connecting with customers and prospective customers in an emotional and authentic way.  Overall for 2012, we still expect our marketing expense to be right around 1.75% of sales. ","G&A was 7.7% in the quarter, up 140 basis points from last year, due primarily to higher non-cash non-economic stock compensation expense and a higher payroll tax expense related to the exercise of options during quarter. The non-cash non-economic stock comp expense was about $20.5 million in the quarter or $11.5 million higher than last year. About half of the increase or $5.6 million was due to a 1% adjustment for performance shares issued during 2010.","These performance shares have a 3-year vesting schedule ending October 2013 and the amount of the work can increase or decrease depending on our financial performance during the 3 years. Now that we are halfway through the measurement period, based on our strong performance during the past 6 quarters, it appears likely that we will earn the maximum award. So the $5.6 million represents the incremental expense to catch-up for the last 6 quarters for earning the max. For the rest of the performance period, the remaining charge will be amortized by about $1 million for each of the remaining 6 quarters at which time the shares will vest. We expect non-cash stock comp to total about $69 million for the full year, which will includes this incremental charge for hitting the max on our performing shares.","G&A also includes additional employee taxes of about $3 million related to the exercise of stock options during the quarter. So without the charge related to the performance shares and the higher employee taxes and option exercises, underlying G&A was 6.3% of sales or about the same as last year. ","In the quarter, we also saw our average restaurant volumes increase to a record high of $2.07 million and we're confident that our strong unit economics can get even better as even more customers discover and choose to visit Chipotle. Our new restaurants continue to perform very well, reflecting the success of our real estate development strategy and the growing awareness of the Chipotle brand across all U.S. markets. ","Our new restaurants are opening at or above our $1.5 million to $1.6 million communicated range and A Models continued to perform well with sales just below traditional sites, but they generate higher returns. During the quarter, we opened 32 new restaurants including one in Toronto. We expect to open between 155 and 165 restaurants in 2012 with about 30% of these being A Models. We also expect to open 1 in Paris, 3 more in London and a couple more in Canada. And as we mentioned on our last call, we plan to open our second ShopHouse in Washington, D.C. some time later this year. ","Our effective tax rate was 39% for the quarter and for the full year, we expect the rate to remain at 39% or 50 basis points higher than 2011 as a result of the HIRE Act not continuing and the work opportunity tax credit and the R&D tax credit, which have expired and have not been renewed by Congress.","Our already strong balance sheet continues to strengthen and has allowed us to open new restaurants with expectations of superior returns, funded by operating cash flow while we continue to opportunistically pursue our $100 million share buyback.","Though our tax provision for the quarter reflects an expense of just under $40 million, we actually have a tax receivable on the balance sheet of $35 million. This is the direct result of an excess tax benefit, which totals $68 million related to stock option exercises. Though this $68 million is a real economic benefit and it will enhance our cash flow over the next few quarters, this benefit is not reflected in our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, we purchased around $16 million under our stock repurchase program at an average price per share of $376. While we believe that investing in high returning restaurants remains the best use of our cash, we'll continue to opportunistically and carefully repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value. ","Thanks for your time today. And at this time, we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question about throughput. Would you mind just discussing a little bit about what you are communicating down the line in terms of beginning to get the focus on throughput? And what specific changes might be being made in prep, ordering, and the payment that -- sort of the tricks of the trade that might be going on that are helping you with the throughput?","Montgomery F. Moran","Really, what we've done is tried to focus only on those things which tend to have the greatest impact on throughput, and those are the 4 things that I've mentioned a number of times before which are the \"mise en place\" or having everything in its place before their shift begins or before the peak hour begins, having what we call \"aces in their places\", in other words making sure that absolutely everyone in every position is ready to serve the guest and that we have the best person in each position during peak hours, so that we're not training folks during that time and also having an expediter in place during all kinds of peak hour. That's the person who stands between the person that rolls the burrito and the person who -- the cashier. And so that person is the one who takes care of all the little requests like is it for here or to go, puts it in the bag, gets the drink or taking care of any other requests of the customer so that the cashier, which is typically the slowest part of our throughput, can focus completely on the task of cashing someone out. And then finally, we want to always have a linebacker position in place during peak hours, and that's -- usually it's the General Manager or a Service Manager or an apprentice, but that person is someone who stands behind the line and makes sure that all of the pans are full of food, that all the food looks perfect, that the line is clean and that all of the people working on the line have all the tools and implements that they need to do their job perfectly without looking away from the guest. So a big part of the focus has been to focus on those 4 things. In addition to that, we try to give as many tools to our teams as we think will be helpful, and recently we rolled out a throughput video that really puts in a very descriptive way, kind of demonstrated the 4 things that I mentioned to you and how they should be done properly. But also, gave a live view of what a terrifically well-run team looks like when they're executing very, very high throughput. This -- the throughput video was taken at -- on location at one of our very busy downtown Chicago locations that had a near constant line throughout lunch of people who are used to very, very fast service, demanding a very, very fast service and it's a place where the team provides over 320 transactions per hour consistently and it's hit numbers of over 350 transactions in a single hour of business. So by having all of our teams around the country be able to see that, with a commentary from one of our regional Directors talking about what they are seeing, was a real nice -- sort of a picture worth a thousand words, if you will, to help them understand and be able to really visualize what's possible in a really well-run Chipotle. And part of that lesson is how achievable these very high throughput numbers are and how it's not a phonetics or a spastic or disorganized-looking thing when we go very quickly, and in fact, it's just the opposite. When you -- if you'd look at the throughput video, you'd think that it didn't look that bad because everyone's so efficient, there are no wasted movements. There are very few mistakes made, and if there are mistakes made, they're caught and corrected very quickly. So the crew is very calm, very competent and really having a lot of fun. And so the customers feel that and enjoy that fun as well. And I guess finally, I would say that one of the important things to teach our teams that we always emphasize is the throughput is not -- speed is not the first goal of throughput. The first goal of throughput is to provide the very, very best customer service. Great eye contact, great communication, a polite and efficient way with customers, and all of those things, when done well, tend to lead to very, very fast service because the guest goes through understanding exactly what they want, getting what they want and being very satisfied with that quickly. So that gives you, I guess, an idea of some of what we're doing to increase the throughput, and it's working very, very well.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then one quick follow-up is that in this last quarter, do you have a sort of rough estimate as to how much throughput might have helped your sales directly if -- do you have a sense of literally how many more orders per hour you pushed through such that you helped the comp? And as you get into the peak months coming up, it looks like your sales go up 10%, 12% versus the type of months that you have in the March quarter and the coming quarters. Is it going to be even a bigger lift or how should we think about that?","Montgomery F. Moran","Well, I'll answer backwards because the second answer is quicker than the first. Yes, the first quarter is seasonally our slowest quarter from a sales standpoint, so we do believe that in the next quarter, the second quarter and, in fact, the third quarter as well, throughput is even more important then than it is now. But to answer your first question, I'd like to caution you not to too closely link an increase in comps -- increase of comp sales with an increase in throughput. Seasonally, the first quarter is one of our slowest in sales, and so typically, during our peak lunch hour in the first quarter, we average about 100 transactions. But the first quarter this year, we were about 5 transactions faster than we were last year during that peak hour. We're very proud of that. But we don't see a particular effect on short-term costs from the throughput initiative yet. But we believe it is an important part of great customer experience and that over time, it will encourage more visits as customers have more confidence that they can visit a Chipotle, get through the line more quickly and have more time to enjoy their meal. So again, in these next several months, the speed of service will be more and more important, but we can't tell you that when we increase the speed of service, that automatically yields an increase in comp sales. That's something that, we believe over time, will improve as a result of great throughput, but it's not an immediate reaction. If people want to come to Chipotle more often, we want to do all we can to reward that decision with an incredible guest experience, and a large part of that incredible guest experience is great throughput. So we believe that over time, it will lead to an increased comp, but that's not something that we can tell you that we've seen just yet.","Operator","And we'll now go to Matthew DiFrisco with Lazard.","Phan  Le - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","This is Phan Le in for Matt DiFrisco. I just had a quick question about the gap between the growth in average weekly sales and the comp. It seems to be widening a little bit this quarter compared to the past last few quarters and I understand that the new stores are doing just as well as they had in the past. So I'm just wondering what the discrepancy is there, if you can provide a little color, I'd appreciate that.","John R. Hartung","Well, I'm not sure what your calculation is for that. We're not seeing anything that's disturbing in our trends. What you've got is you've got 2 opposing forces, you've got comps that are driving our average volumes up and then you've got all the new stores that are coming that shift from non-comp into the comp base. And frankly, looking at about a $50,000 or so increase from quarter-to-quarter while we're adding new restaurants into the comp base, we think we're getting exactly the right increase in our average unit volume than we should. So we're not seeing anything underlying that's not supporting that both our new stores are opening up strong. They come into the base and they have a dilutive effect, but that's always happened. But it's being more than offset by the comps, so nothing -- there's nothing I can tell you that's disturbing in the underlying trends.","Phan  Le - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I jumped on the call a little bit late, so I'm not sure if you touched on pricing at all. I know that in your last call, you had mentioned that you don't anticipate to take as much pricing in 2011 as you do with this year.","John R. Hartung","Yes, we don't -- yes, we did mention it on the call. We don't have any plans for any further menu price increases. We did take a localized increase just in the Pacific region. That's more a function of that's a very high-priced market for us, high-cost market to do business. The menu prices there have been lagging. It kind of -- really they've been lower than they should be forever, and so we did raise prices last month. That's not going to have a continuing positive effect on the comp because it came on -- that price increase happened about the same time that we took an increase last year, so they kind of offset each other. But we don't have any plans for any future menu price increases in 2012, not right now.","Operator","And we'll now go to Alvin Concepcion with Citi.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wanted to see if you could give us a sense of the weather benefit to comps, if there was one?","John R. Hartung","Yes, there definitely was one. January, February were terrific, from a weather standpoint. Lots of people decided they want to come out and visit Chipotle. Hard to get a really firm handle, but to the best that we can tell, it probably added somewhere between 100 to perhaps as much as 200 basis points to the comp during the quarter.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And have you seen a change in the underlying sales trends in April?","John R. Hartung","No. What I would say is if you factor out weather and factor out the leap day, what we're seeing in April so far is kind of a continuing of the underlying sales trends. So kind of, to the best of our ability, factor out weather, factor out the leap day, and then it seems like April is just picking up where the underlying trends in the first quarter left off.","Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up on food costs. You maintained your outlook on the inflation. Is it fair to say you still think food cost will be up 150 to 160 basis points throughout the year, is that still the case?","John R. Hartung","Yes, that's a fair amount. I mean right now, we think that over the next 2 quarters, it's going to be mid single-digit inflation. We think that the -- that if things go as planned, that in the fourth quarter we'll level off a little bit. So I think when you take that mid single-digit inflation and convert that into impact on food cost, I think you are looking at somewhere between 100 to 150 basis points of higher food cost over the next couple of quarters.","Operator","And we'll now go to Karen Holthouse with Credit Suisse.","Karen Holthouse - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just got a quick question with the move and development to maybe some more new construction units. Is there anything we should be thinking about when modeling that in terms of differences in square footages or bill to costs or average unit volumes in the new units?","M. Steven Ells","Well, no, no. I think that you'll see that those are largely consistent. I mean, the square footage of units is largely driven by that which we find in the field because we're leasing our space. But generally, we'll continue to do what we've done in the last many years, which is favor smaller restaurants when we can find them, but always just look at what we think will make for a great Chipotle restaurant. So no, no particular change there.","Karen Holthouse - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then one quick housekeeping question. Did you give a number for food inflation in the quarter on the call?","John R. Hartung","Yes, we just reiterate it. We think it's going to be still in that mid single-digit range.","Karen Holthouse - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","For the first quarter?","John R. Hartung","Oh, during the first quarter. Well, sort of. I mean, what we talked about is we did a comparison to last year, but more importantly from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, we had the same food cost. So we didn't see any net effects of food inflation so far in 2012 and that's I think the most -- the best way I think to look at it is kind of sequentially from the fourth quarter. If you look at the fact that we had a -- we've got a run rate of about 5% menu price increase and our food costs went up by 20 basis points, you could just back into the fact that we have like a, call it a 6% or 7% in that kind of ballpark inflation year-over-year. But more importantly, looking at it sequentially, didn't get hit in the first quarter. We do think that the mid single-digit inflation going forward will kick in and we think it'll hit over the next 2 quarters.","Operator","And we'll now take Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the 2 incremental potential growth opportunities. One question on Europe and one on ShopHouse. Maybe I'll first touch on the Europe question. You mentioned you're implementing the throughput initiatives that you'd been running through in the U.S. in the U.K., and I guess I didn't realize that they would be necessary that your store volumes were so good that it was relevant to do that. So maybe you could talk about what the sales demand or AUVs are at the current 2 U.K. locations? And if the demand is that strong, I understand 3 more for the rest of the year, but how quickly might that ramp up once you get past 2012?","M. Steven Ells","Well, so let me speak to the necessity of throughput and why now is a good time to emphasize that. It's interesting to watch a lot of new customers in a brand-new market of a brand-new country try Chipotle for the first time. There is a learning curve, and to emphasize throughput at a time when people don't really understand the menu and understand the service format, I think makes it very confusing. And so we deliberately want to allow people to go at their own pace within reason, of course. But as we see more and more regular customers in our London restaurants and as people are starting to understand the system and become very comfortable with it, we started to talk about throughput with our crews. And our managers have done a very, very good job at slowly building up the speed, and this is something that the customers really appreciate. They understand that Chipotle is more convenient now and that they have time to sit down and actually enjoy their meal because the service part of it is faster and of course, one of the benefits that we see from doing that is an increase in sales. It's interesting that we've noticed the exact same thing at ShopHouse in Washington, D.C. deliberately not emphasizing throughput when we opened up because it's, again, completely different menu offerings. Now a lot of our customers recognize the service format. They recognize that it's very similar to Chipotle, but since there's a difference in ingredients and a lot of questions about the different flavors and different spice levels and things like this, it was slower. But we've noticed more and more regular customers and have started to emphasize this idea of throughput and how to provide service to the customers, and we've seen increased sales in that restaurant also.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So in those U.K. restaurants, what are the rough AUVs and what might the growth trajectory -- unit growth trajectory look like as you go past 2012?","John R. Hartung","Michael, just on the balance and I'll turn it back to over to Steve. We haven't communicated what those are but just to give you a rough idea, in terms of transactions, they're similar to what new restaurants would be in the U.S., perhaps a touch higher in terms of transactions. And keep in mind, I think the original question was kind of why throughput, are the volumes really that high. Throughput isn't just about flying as many people through the line as you can. Better throughput, our teams work better together, the food is better, the customer experience is better. When you have 5 people in line and when our teams are ready to deliver great throughput, those 5 people are going to get terrific customer service and it's just as important, we believe, if there's 5 people in line versus if there's 40 people in line, and so that's why we wanted to get this kind of into the D&A in Europe early, but that will give you an idea, at least from a transaction standpoint, where we are in the U.K. But we've not communicated actual volumes yet. I'll let Steve -- what was your other question that you wanted...","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, just generally about the pace of growth and the future in Europe, what the unit growth trajectory would look like. I would imagine that even though we're early in '12, you've already got some real estate in your mind for 2013. I mean, what's the pace of growth that you plan to pursue?","John R. Hartung","I wouldn't even call it a pace yet, Michael. I mean, it's still allowing people in London to discover Chipotle, making sure our team continues to grow. And so we're going to have a few restaurants here and there, but I wouldn't really call it a pace yet. There are still lots and lots and lots of people within the trade areas we're already in that just don't even know that we're there or don't really know what Chipotle is all about, and so we want to be patient and let that happen. And so it's going to be a similar just kind of a restaurant here, restaurant there approach for a while.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, just wanted to follow up. As I mentioned, I had a question on ShopHouse. You were excited enough about it to announce further builds last time you had a quarterly call. Maybe you could talk about how the sales of the initial location have progressed now that the initial opening halo's worn off?","M. Steven Ells","Yes, well, so sales have continued to grow and I think that it's fair to say that the sales are very similar to the Chipotle that's across the street. In fact, I would say that the unit economic model, in general, is substantially similar to that of Chipotle, in general. So that gives us enough confidence to say that we want to open one more and there's a lot of excitement about the concept. There's a lot of excitement about the food, and so we'll be opening the second restaurant in a contiguous trade area in the late fall, early winter.","Operator","We'll now go to Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk a bit about employee turnover and just get an update on where you are on that. I know you had some issues last year when the investigations were in full swing. Are you back to more normalized turnover? And if you could just talk about employee recruitment, if you're back to kind of a normal cadence and ease in terms of getting new employees?","M. Steven Ells","And what's the last part of it, Sharon?","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Recruitment of team members, if it's back to as easy as it was before ICE?","M. Steven Ells","Yes. Okay. All right. Well in terms of turnover, our General Manager turnover is stabilized and at a level that we find quite reasonable. The crew turnover, which was in sort of that 100% range a couple of years ago at the low and spiked up to sort of the mid-100, has now moderated such that it's not down to 100% yet, but it's better than it was. So crew turnover is okay. It's not down to the lows that we saw a couple of years ago before the entire immigration hiccup happened. So that sends a little bit of a sort of a shutter through the system that I think that had an effect for a while. And then now we are, with our recruitment efforts, they are going really, really well. I would say there's a few things going on. When we first implemented E-Verify nationwide, we were concerned that it was going to diminish the amount of applicants in our restaurants. And that happened in some places, but overall, our managers and crew around the country have expressed to me that they have found throughout the entire time that they've still been -- by and large, they've still been able to find really, really great candidates. In some cases, they've had to look at more people to get the top performers that they're looking for. But only a part of that is externally imposed. A lot of that is internally imposed in the sense that we have had a greater and greater focus on hiring only top performers, but we've also had a greater and greater focus on trying to define what a top performer is, and our teams in the field are getting really masterful at knowing what that looks like and so they become pickier than ever. That being said, our recruitment efforts are working really, really well and the managers are telling me that they're getting better applicants. But not just because of our recruitment efforts but because slowly but surely, the word is getting out there that Chipotle is the very best place in terms of opportunity for an entry-level person to come for an hourly position at a restaurant and have an awesome opportunity to become a manager and perhaps a restaurateur and perhaps a field leader in very short order if they're going to work hard and if they're a top performer. And so we get a lot more top performers than ever who are understanding the opportunity that Chipotle represents to them and are coming our way. Simultaneously, we've gotten loads, thousands of people who are being promoted into higher and higher positions who are, of course, telling their friends and recommending Chipotle as the place to come work. And we also increased the amount -- we created a little bit of a reference bonus for people who bring in new people to Chipotle amongst our team. And so a lot of them are taking advantage of that. So on a lot of different fronts, we're seeing that the recruitment, I would say, is now better than it has ever been in terms of the quality of the candidates we're seeing and in terms of our ability to staff really, really well throughout the country. So we're super, super pleased by the people who are now in our restaurants.","Operator","And we'll now go to Bart Glenn with D.A. Davidson.","Bart Glenn - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just had one quick question. As it relates to ShopHouse, I was just curious what are going to be the primary constraints to ramping up the pace of unit growth if it gets to the point where you are ready to do so?","M. Steven Ells","Well I mean, by design, ShopHouse operates in a very similar way to Chipotle. It's got the same make-line, it's got the same-size kitchen, it's got the same amounts of offerings. I mean, they're very, very similar. We would look at real estate, I think, the same way. We would look at building size the same way. We think of building cost the same way. We think of staffing the same way, a similar crew size. We think of purchasing a distribution in a very similar way. So there's a lot of ability to leverage a system that's already in place. What kinds of little things here and there that might pop up, I can't really imagine are going to be a huge impediment. But it really was designed to be kind of the same thing as Chipotle. In fact, when thinking about the reason to do a different kind of cuisine, it's that you look at what has made Chipotle successful and we think it's really our focus on the kinds of ingredients that we source, classic cooking techniques, an interactive service model and these are the things that make us successful, not necessarily our burritos and tacos. So any kind of cuisine can fit into this model. So I think we're very bullish that when and if the time comes that we want to accelerate this, we can do that.","Operator","We'll now go to Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 questions. First, kind of a follow-up on the unit growth side of things, at least at the core Chipotle U.S. business. I'm just wondering, it sounds like you said that the pipeline is looking better from a real estate perspective which is a net positive. I'm just wondering now as you think about growth this year, I think you said you could do the 160 and you're fairly comfortable with that. And I know in the past, you've talked about that the team could do -- your existing team could do north of 200, so I'm just wondering some of that prior questions in terms of impediments, is it the kind of managers and leadership or is it just finding the right locations or getting them up to your specs or whatnot. I'm just wondering, if the pipeline's stronger might we see or could we see an acceleration not only the absolute numbers, but perhaps the percentage or whether if you could just talk about penetration and whether you have a rule of thumb where certain markets are already saturated or some key metrics to support the penetration, kind of the cadence of potential acceleration in growth?","Montgomery F. Moran","Yes. Well, we've said for a long time that we decide to grow when we have excellent leadership and great General Managers to open new restaurants and when we can find great real estate. I mentioned in my opening comments that we've seen a -- that it looks like there's a slight shift and a slight increase in the amount of sort of new developments that we might be able to lease and build restaurants in over the coming years. And that's a nice thing, it's a good thing. But we aren't ready to talk about how many restaurants we plan to build over the next couple of years. I can tell you that we feel very optimistic that given my conversation today about the amount of restaurateurs and apprentice team leaders that we have growing in a field of their influence and their ability to bring great -- to recruit great people in at the crew level and train them into our future leaders, we feel like that people culture is going to be able to really effectively deliver us a lot of great leadership for our restaurants. And so hopefully, that will be less of an impediment than it would otherwise be. With regards to real estate we've seen, as you've seen from our results over the last year or 2, some really high-quality real estate we've had. We've been able to broaden our portfolio by using the A Model strategy, which has allowed us to effectively take advantage of a lot of remodel opportunities, a lot of off-the-beaten-path locations during a recessionary time. And that A Model strategy is something that not only has been very effective during a recession, but there's no reason why that will not continue to be very effective as we emerge from the recession and as the economy strengthens. So when we see that the amount of new restaurants or new developments begin to increase and again, what we see now is only very slight. But if that should increase yes, I think that there's a chance that we'll be able to find more real estate. But we don't look to grow at a percentage. We don't look to seek a certain degree of penetration. What we do is we look at our markets around the country. We look at what the demand is for Chipotle. We look at how high is the quality of experience that we're offering in our Chipotle restaurants. When we're in a marketplace where the quality of the experience is very, very high, where there's a lot of people who are moving up through the ranks as employees at Chipotle are ready for management positions and our unit economic model is great and we have very high sales in these restaurants and when we can find great real estate nearby, of course if behooves us to take advantage of those opportunities to lease that additional real estate, build additional restaurants and satisfy both the customers' demand for additional Chipotle, as well as the demand for our employees to give them additional opportunities to serve guests in new restaurants. So we really look at it as sort of, we do everything we can in this company to create a huge demand for what we do. And that starts with great ingredients and food with integrity and better-tasting food through better cooking techniques, better training techniques, better people in our restaurant. We try to do all those things better, and when we do all of those things better that we focused on in our opening comments, we believe that it's a much more compelling restaurant experience. When we have a more compelling restaurant experience there's a higher demand for it, both from the crew standpoint and the customer standpoint and we are eager to fill that demand by building -- responsibly building restaurants in markets throughout the country, and of course taking advantage, just beginning to plant seeds overseas and [indiscernible] too, but we think it's going very, very well and so I don't think there's any reason to be anything but optimistic about the future. But we're not ready to decide how many restaurants that's going to yield in 2013 and so forth right now.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Understood. And then just, Jack, just one clarification. I think it's often times confusing when we talk about commodity inflation, but I think I understand when you're saying that commodity basket's going to be up mid-single digits that's still kind of a forecast for this year. I'm assuming that's year-over-year. And the pricing we know in the first quarter was 5% and it seems like that's going to ease to down to perhaps 1% or so by the fourth quarter. But I'm just having trouble having packaging them all together in terms of how we think about year-over-year the food cost line. So you mentioned it was up 30 bps this quarter, with 5 points of price and a little bit more than that of inflation. On a year-over-year basis, how would you think about the next couple of quarters in terms of as a percentage of sales? You threw out 100 to 150 bps, I wasn't sure if that was specific to year-over-year on that line or whether you were talking sequentially or...","John R. Hartung","Yes, Jeff, on most of my comments, really all of them were designed -- were talking about sequential. I think when you go year-over-year, lots and lots and lots of things have happened between this year and last year. And so to simplify it, what I'd rather do is talk about where were we in the fourth quarter, where were we in the first quarter. And we had somewhat of stability there. Now what I'd like to do is what do we expect in the summer? And we expect higher cost as we move into the second quarter and the third quarter. It's coming from 3 principal places. We continue to see inflation in beef cost. We will see seasonally higher prices, even though avocado year-over-year will be lower. As you get into the second and third quarters, they're going to be higher than they are in the first quarter because we're going to start buying from California. They will be more expensive. That's why I think it's more relevant to talk about what's it going to cost, what are avocado going to cost in the second quarter and the third quarter compared to what we're paying today, and that's going to be higher. And the third thing is we're doing things like sour cream is going to be more expensive beginning in the second quarter because we're going to move towards getting our dairy to make the sour cream from pasture-raised dairy and that's going to add some expenses. So those 3 things combined, as you move from the first quarter to the second and the third, are going to result in about that mid-single digit higher cost. When you compare to last year, now you're talking about seasonality of avocado, you're talking about the freeze with the produce last year, you're talking about the menu price which starts factoring out, and I think it gets much, much, much more complicated. So I hope that makes sense. And so when we talk about this mid single-digit inflation, it's from where we are today.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Versus 32.2% in the fourth quarter of '11, you're saying it could go up to the high 33% range by the end of this year?","John R. Hartung","That's right. And because we're talking about the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, which had the price increase fully loaded, that price increase is in there and so you don't have to adjust for price increases as you move to the second quarter and third quarter because we don't plan on a price increase. And so what we can talk about now is just commodity inflation. We talk about food with integrity and those things, principally those 3 things, beef, seasonal-affected avocado and our dairy, we think, are going to add somewhere in that mid single-digit range to our food costs.","Alex Spong","All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. But we have passed over our time, so we appreciate you joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","John R.

In 2018, Chipotle will celebrate its 25th anniversary. This is an ideal time to reflect on the things that have contributed to our success over the past 25 years, while at the same time, providing an update on the fundamental changes we are making across the business to enable us to get back on a strong growth trajectory and realize our vast potential.","As I think back on the past 25 years, I'm extremely proud of the unique company we've created. Our success is based on our passion for serving great tasting wholesome food that's served in an interactive environment. It has been our vision, and the commitment of doing what is right for our guests, employees, suppliers, and farmers, the environment and animals well before these things were common in the world of fast food, all while delivering a superior economic model that has led to our success.","When I started Chipotle, I wanted to show that just because food is served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. It wasn't a commonly held view at the time, but it certainly has paid off. I continue to believe that this approach to serving nutritious, wholesome, and delicious food remains highly valued by our guests and can deliver strong returns to our shareholders. Now, after 25 years, we must navigate new challenges by continuing to evolve how we approach the business. Our results for the quarter clearly show that there is still work to be done to restore a strong growth and customer trust, and today, I want to discuss the progress we're making on a number of initiatives that will transform how we manage the company and that will provide a solid foundation for how we build the business going forward.","Today, I want to talk about three key areas of focus: first, our operational changes and efforts to perfect the guest experience; second, enhancing the guest experience through innovations in digital and catering; and third, reinvesting in our existing restaurants to enhance guest convenience and improve the appearance and function of our restaurants. In addition, I'll provide an update on our CEO search.","First, let me discuss the operational changes and efforts to perfect the dining experience. After spending time in our restaurants over the past few months, I've seen firsthand the impact Scott Boatwright and his team are having on our operations. Shifting our operational culture requires leadership, determination, and time to retrain and build new habits. Our field leaders are spending time with managers to focus on what it takes to effectively train our teams to deliver an excellent guest experience. Scott and his team have formalized the role of the manager and the role of the field leader to ensure all their efforts are focused on the guest experience. And our support teams are building extensive detailed training programs to provide the necessary tools for this type of change.","We're also launching a dedicated centralized training program based in Denver. This program combines classroom teaching, which is new to Chipotle, with live in-store training in a certified Chipotle restaurant. The curriculum has been tailored to our field leaders to ensure we are effectively addressing the most important elements of delivering a great guest experience. That effort is beginning to pay off as we develop consistency around the speed of service and improving hospitality from every crew member. We're revisiting the concept of throughput, which has historically been an incredible strength of our business.","As our training program continues to take hold, our teams will be primed to refocus on delivering excellent throughput in the restaurant again and will be looking at various ways to incentivize terrific throughput. When executed correctly with well-trained crew, throughput is one of the best tools we've had to build sales and to build our brand. We also completed the restructuring of our field leadership, reducing the number of regions and eliminating unnecessary layers above the restaurant. Our field leader ratios have been reduced, enabling our strong field leaders to spend more time in each restaurant. This has had a direct and lasting impact on the restaurant teams.","And over the past six months, we've implemented a new guest satisfaction system in our restaurants and we are encouraged by improvements we've seen across all measures, including key areas of friendliness and ease of ordering. These renewed efforts come in addition to the incentive program changes we instituted at the restaurant level one year ago, which makes the guest experience a key component of incentive compensation for our restaurant and field teams.","With early signs of an improved guest experience, we are excited to celebrate our 25th anniversary with all of our guests, employees, and partners. We will incorporate the 25th anniversary celebration into many of our marketing and promotional campaigns this year, and it will be a rallying point for our brand. We have passionate and loyal fans that love Chipotle and it's a great opportunity to share their stories along with reminding our guests of all the things that make us unique and special. We'll share more of this campaign with you on our first quarter call.","Now, let me turn to how we are enhancing the guest experience to build sales through innovations in digital and catering. It's clear we must also ensure that we are offering new and convenient ways for our guests to interact with Chipotle. For much of our 25-year history, innovation at Chipotle rightfully focused on sourcing better ingredients, improving our cooking techniques, and making our kitchens and equipment more efficient. But over the last year, we've been building new competencies around improving the guest experience through technology and testing new or enhanced offerings. Each of these is designed to improve convenience, add interest to our menu, and deliver a better overall experience for our guests.","Our digital sales continue to be the fastest growing part of our business. We hit new records in the fourth quarter as our second make-line sales were up 33% over the prior year. Our digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales while two of our regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. We continue to be optimistic as we further market this capability and as guests increasingly order Chipotle through digital platforms. This digital sales growth has been led by mobile ordering, which is up 50% over last year. And the increase has been driven by the new version of our mobile app for Apple and Android. The app's new features include quick reorder of favorite or recent orders and the ability to receive, store, and redeem offers. The app also introduces new mobile pay options, a more user-friendly store locator, and a streamlined user experience with enhanced design, and guest response has been consistently positive since the launch. For instance, average monthly users on mobile have more than doubled since the release of the app.","We're also seeing higher guest satisfaction in the restaurants that have the new second make-line, and we've seen further reduction in guest wait times to under 15 minutes, as we continue to optimize our Smarter Pickup Times. In 2018, we will accelerate the rollout of our digitally enabled second make-lines. These new lines enable a faster, more accurate experience for our digital customers and allow our crews to more easily support the higher sales volumes. Cumulatively, including new restaurants, we expect to have at least 30% of our restaurants outfitted with these new second make-lines by the end of 2018. We're prioritizing our markets and targeting locations that currently have the highest digital sales volumes to install these new make-lines.","We're also testing new catering offerings which include options for smaller groups, more convenient packaging, and new lower priced options, all of which should help accelerate growth. The test includes catering options for as low as $9 per person and for groups as small as ten people, compared to our current catering which requires a minimum of 20 people starting at prices of $12 a person. We offer delivery support for catering in about 40% of our restaurants now and will look forward to expanding this ahead of our peak graduation season.","With these initiatives taking hold, our catering sales have grown 20% over the last year. Catering is only a little more than 1% of our sales today, with tremendous opportunity for growth in the future.","We're also creating new restaurant designs which are optimized for mobile ordering, more ordering options, better beverage presentation, and more comfortable dining areas. These new designs have the ability to be applied to our existing restaurants and to any new restaurants that we build. Additionally, we'll reinvest in our existing restaurant base as we launch a significant refresh and maintenance effort to improve the experience. We are replacing dim lighting, upgrading equipment on our service lines, and addressing all areas where restaurants have become worn, both inside and outside. We'll continue to expand our digital infrastructure at our restaurants, and will also replace aging equipment. Some of these projects are relatively small in scope but with the potential to deliver a significant impact. Jack's going to talk in more detail on the financial impacts of these initiatives.","Chipotle has always been a purpose-driven company. We've had a relentless commitment to doing what's right for our guests and our employees. This year, we will invest more than one-third of our anticipated tax savings in our restaurant and support teams through a special bonus and expanded benefits. We will first invest more toward training programs for employees, including the formalized classroom program that we are establishing in Denver. We're also announcing a special bonus program for all employees this year, from hourly crew who will be eligible to earn $250 special bonus, to restaurant general managers who will be eligible to earn $1,000 special bonus.","And we are expanding our competitive benefits program with paid maternity and paternity leave, and expanding our short-term disability and life insurance plans for hourly restaurant managers.","All of these enhancements are especially important in today's low unemployment and highly competitive environment, and they come in addition to our average hourly wage that we pay, which is on pace to be more than $12 at the end of 2018 and in addition to our unique slate of benefits that we offer including discounted college tuition and tuition reimbursement for salaried and hourly employees, twice annual merit increases, paid vacation, and paid sick time, and stock awards at the restaurant manager level.","We have always been proud of our ability to attract and retain people who share our passion for creating an extraordinary guest experience, and our employees have rallied around our purpose to cultivate nourished communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day. I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication to making Chipotle an amazing experience.","Chipotle is a very special brand. The past couple of years have presented a set of challenges, but I know that the changes we have made are the right ones to help us move toward achieving our full potential. We will continue to focus on our long-term success and we'll continue to fight to preserve the things that make Chipotle special. An important part of this will be to bring in a proven leader with demonstrated success in meeting the kinds of challenges we currently face. The search for a new CEO is well under way, and as soon as we have found the right person, I'll transition to the role of Executive Chairman. The board and I are committed to bringing in a world class leader with demonstrated expertise to improve execution, build guest trust, and drive sales. We do not have an update on timing today, but we'll share news of our decision as soon as the process is complete. We firmly believe that a new CEO with a passion for driving excellence across every aspect of our business will be another important step in our growth, and I'm optimistic as we look forward to the next 25 years.","I'll now turn the call over to Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Last year held its full share of challenges, but we begin 2018 with optimism that the changes made so far and the changes and investments we'll make in 2018 will establish the foundation for a strong future. Our restaurant teams and field support teams are more committed than ever to delivering an excellent guest experience and will continue to emphasize the guest as we significantly increase our focus and investment on training. We've established incentives for our managers and field leaders to continue to elevate the guest experience and to build sales.","Our second make-line sales including online, mobile and catering are the fastest growing parts of the business and we expect that growth to continue or even accelerate. We also plan to invest much more in our existing restaurants during 2018 and beyond to create a better dining environment, but ultimately to improve the overall experience and flow of our restaurants.","I'll begin by reviewing results for the fourth quarter and full year, and then provide details related to our capital reinvesting plans and tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","For the fourth quarter, we reported $1.1 billion in sales on comp sales growth of 0.9%. Our reported comps include a 60-basis-point decrease as we lapped Chiptopia deferred revenue in Q4 of last year. If you recall, we recognized an additional 60-basis-point benefit in sales comp related to the deferred revenue in Q4 2016 and now that reduces our comp in the current period. We'll have a similar decrease in the first quarter of 2018 of about 50 basis points to our comp. Our restaurant level margins were 14.9% in the quarter, and we generated $1.55 in earnings per diluted share. Our EPS in the quarter benefited by about $0.21 related to the recent U.S. tax law changes. For the full year, we reported $4.5 billion of sales on a sales comp increase of 6.4%, which includes a 30-basis-point benefit related to Chiptopia. Restaurant level margins were 16.9%, and we generated diluted earnings per share of $6.17.","The Q4 underlying comp of 1.5% before the 60-basis-point effect of Chiptopia was driven by a higher average check as we expanded our menu price increase to an additional 900 restaurants in November, bringing the total menu price impact during the quarter to about 240 basis points. Average check also benefited by about 200 basis points from queso. And queso continued to add about 200 basis points to the average check in January as guests are currently adding queso in a little more than 10% of our transactions. Paid traffic in the quarter was down about 3% due to the negative transaction trends that began in July of last year.","January 2018 sales comp was 3.4%. We had one extra trading day in the month as we opened on New Year's Day for the first time. And that day contributed about 240 basis points and will account for just under 1% in the comp for the first quarter. Sales were diversely impacted during the first three weeks of January from the series of winter storms that impacted most of the country. As the weather has normalized over the past two weeks, our comps have been running in the 2.5% to the 3.5% range. First quarter comparisons will get tougher as we enter mid February and March, as warm weather last year caused our comps to surge, essentially bringing our normal seasonal spring sales bump earlier than normal. If our recent sales dollar trends continue through the first quarter, we would expect a comp of between 1% and 2% before the impact of Chiptopia.","Our full year comp guidance for 2018 is in the low single digits with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to the tougher comparison, then improving in the second half as comparisons ease. In addition to the menu price increase last November, we completed the final round of price increases in January in about 1,000 remaining restaurants or about 40% of our restaurants. The average price increase in these markets was about 5%, and we expect resistance of around 20% or less. We expect the average check will continue to benefit the comp by about 2% from guests adding queso through the first 8 months of 2018 until we lap the queso rollout in September. Of course, all this means we will likely continue to see negative transactions until we lap the beginning of the negative transaction trend which began in July.","Food costs during the quarter were 34.2%, down from 35.3% in the prior year and down from 35% in Q3. The decrease from last year was driven by menu price increases, better management of paper and packaging inventories, and lower priced avocados. We expect relatively stable prices in 2018 including for avocados which along with the price increase should lower our food costs to the low to mid 33% range. California avocado growth should be on the upswing for their alternate-bearing crop this summer and we're fortunate that the recent wildfires in California are not expected to impact supply.","Labor costs in the fourth quarter were 27.5%, flat with the prior year. Higher wage inflation of 5% was offset by a combination of factors including labor efficiencies due to fewer promotions, lower insurance and benefit costs, and slight leverage from pricing. Since early 2014, crew wages and benefits have increased by cumulative 29%, but we've only increased pricing by cumulative 12%. Our restaurant managers and crews are running some of the most efficient restaurant labor deployment we've seen in years. The labor pressures will continue at this level because of wage inflation, softer transaction trends and as we add our enhanced benefits that Steve discussed. Our labor as a percent of sales is typically flat from Q4 into Q1, although we anticipate it to increase slightly in Q1 related to regulatory minimum wage increases as of January 1 combined with the reinvestment into our employees funded by the tax savings.","Occupancy costs for the fourth quarter were 7.6% of sales versus 7.4% last year. The higher occupancy costs were driven by inflation from renewals and slightly higher average rents from new restaurants. We anticipate new restaurant openings in 2018 to continue to have modestly higher average rents than existing restaurants due to refocusing our development pipeline with a heavier weighting toward proven markets. As a percentage of sales, occupancy for the full year should be about in line with 2017 in the low to mid-7% range as a percent of sales.","Other operating costs were 15.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease from 16.3% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were 3.8% of sales in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 100 basis points compared to last year. Our other operating costs also included 50 basis points of incremental cost related to maintenance and repairs. Maintenance and repairs is expected to remain at elevated levels during 2018, which I'll explain more fully in a few minutes.","In 2018, we anticipate marketing and promo activity will be at or slightly above 3% of sales. Marketing and promo costs will be slighter higher in the second and third quarters with lower spending in Q1 and Q4. For the full year, we anticipate other operating costs to be about the same as last year as savings from the lower marketing and promo will be reinvested into existing restaurants with higher maintenance and repairs. With normal lower seasonal sales in the first quarter and the increased reinvestment in our restaurants, we would anticipate Q1 other operating expenses to be right around 15% of sales. So, overall in Q1, the restaurant level margins are typically similar to the fourth quarter with lower expected food and other operating costs and the full benefit of the price increase offset by higher maintenance and repairs investment and the investment in the special bonus for employees, Q1 margins should be in the 16% to 16.5% range.","G&A costs for the full year 2017 were 6.6% of sales, or a total of $296 million. And this includes $30 million related to the data security incident from April 2017, $60 million in stock compensation, and $8 million in our employee bonus program. During 2017, our employee bonus program underperformed our targets.","For the full year 2018, we anticipate G&A costs will be about $330 million, and this includes around $66 million for stock comp, $18 million for our employee bonus program, as we expect to return to paying bonuses at our target during 2018, $12 million for one-time executive retention bonuses and stock grants, and $12 million for our biennial all-manager conference. We expect underlying recurring G&A to grow by about $25 million after three years of flat G&A, despite the fact that we opened more than 650 restaurants during this time. The $25 million includes the formalized new training programs and the one-time special bonuses for staff related to the savings from tax rate reductions.","We plan to invest a total of about $300 million in capital expenses in 2018, an increase from our 2017 investment of $217 million. For the first time ever, our capital investment into existing restaurants will outpace our investment in new restaurant openings. The total CapEx will be funded from our cash flow from operations and includes several components. First, in addition to normal ongoing upkeep of our restaurants, for which we would typically invest around $10,000 per restaurant, or around $24 million, we'll invest another $50 million to fund the new refresh and maintenance program that Steve introduced. This $50 million is a discrete one-time investment that will average about $20,000 per restaurant and it will allow us to fully assess the interiors of every single restaurant, improve efficiencies, ensure that the environments are warm and welcoming for our guests. This focus on improving our restaurants is also driving higher maintenance and repair expenses, which we expect will continue throughout 2018. In early tests, we have seen modest investments can have a significant influence on the atmosphere for our guests.","In addition, we'll invest into new growth initiatives, including about $45 million to continue to retrofit our digitally-enhanced second make-lines into existing restaurants. Including new restaurants, the digitally-enhanced second make-line will be in about 1,000 restaurants by the end of the year. We'll also invest about $15 million to improve IT infrastructure, a portion of which will support and enhance our digital programs and digital experience. Our digital investments are targeted toward the fastest growing piece of our business, and will be accompanied by other digital-experience enhancements and focused marketing efforts to continue to encourage digital ordering. Beyond digital, we'll invest about $10 million in designing new prototype restaurants. The results from these prototypes will inform both new restaurant design and remodels of our older restaurants in 2019 and in 2020.","We also plan to invest around $25 million into initiatives around optimizing our energy uses in our restaurants and introduce better equipment to cook our food, such as a new rice cooker to make our restaurants more efficient. And while we're investing more aggressively into our existing restaurants, our development pipeline remains healthy and we expect to build and open around 130 to 150 new restaurants during 2018. The majority of new restaurants will continue to be built in our proven markets where we've had a loyal and growing customer base. New restaurants opened during 2017 performed at about 75% of our average sales volumes and continue to provide a strong return during the first year of operations. Our net costs to build these restaurants will be slightly higher in 2018 as every site now incorporates the new digitally enabled second make-line. And finally we'll invest about $25 million into other general corporate initiatives which includes the consolidation of our two separate offices in Denver so that we can create a more efficient and more collaborative environment.","Effective tax rate for the full year 2017 was 36.1%, compared with 40.8% in 2016, and for the quarter our tax rate was 28.8%. This lower quarterly tax rate resulted from remeasuring our deferred tax liability at the 21% corporate federal tax rate following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act becoming law in late December. The full year rate is lower than 2016 due to the tax rate changes along with lower state tax rates. We expect the 2018 effective full year tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, with an underlying effective tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range. There are a few moving pieces in this new rate. Relative to our normalized tax rate of about 39%, the last few years, our federal tax rate will decrease by 1,400 basis points as a result of the federal tax rate changes. But offsetting this decrease, our state taxes will be higher by about 100 basis points to 200 basis points due to the reduced benefit of deducting state taxes at the new lower federal tax rate. And under the new federal tax law we can no longer expense the full cost of our employee meals for tax purposes which is a substantial benefit that we offer our employees. That adds another 100 basis points to our tax rate. This underlying effective tax rate of 27% to 28% will then be impacted by prior and future stock based compensation plans.","We currently have deferred tax assets related to outstanding non-vested stock award that contain market and performance conditions. If market conditions are not achieved, then we may not realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets which will result in a higher effective tax rate in future periods. Our current outstanding awards such as the 2015 and 2016 performance stock grant, there are estimates that these award either may not vest or may vest at lower realized values than originally anticipated. Under either scenario we would not benefit from the initial deferred tax asset which would negatively impact our effective tax rate by around 300 basis points to 400 basis points. Overall corporate tax law changes will result in tax savings of around $40 million to $50 million in 2018. We plan to invest more than one-third of these savings in our people with investments in special bonuses to our crew, managers and support staff, investment in employee training, and enhanced employee benefits. The remainder of the tax savings will help fund our investment to enhance existing restaurants.","We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, and we finished the year with $509 million in cash and investments and generated $467 million in cash from operations during 2017. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $77 million of our stock at an average price of $297 per share and we repurchased $284 million in stock during the full year 2017. Even with our increased investment in existing restaurants in 2018, we still expect to opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the year, albeit at a lower level than last year.","As should be expected, our outlook for 2018 does not include any potential strategic changes that may be driven by a new CEO.","Despite a challenging year, we feel that we have a lot of momentum and energy throughout the company heading into 2018. We're more committed than ever to continue to perfect our dining experience and to build our sales. The investments that we're making in our people, into growing our digital and catering business, and investing in new innovation will not only help set up the foundation for a successful 2018, but also for the next 25 years.","Thank you, and we'll now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time we will be conducting a question and answer session. Our first question is with John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. First just on top line drivers, if you could comment about in 2018 how you're viewing either product development differently or approaching marketing differently. Does queso give you more confidence, for example, in more new product introductions in 2018 to drive traffic? And when you think about marketing, the same question. Your approach has been non-traditional in the past. Does that approach continue to work or do you think that this is the time to pivot to maybe a more traditional marketing message to get traffic going again?","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, John. So we've learned a lot over the last year as we've pivoted toward more traditional marketing using television in particular. So this year, we're going to do a number of things. Our marketing plan will consist as it traditionally has of three big components over the year, three big advertising components. So in the spring, we will launch another advertising campaign. This time though it'll be using addressable TV rather than broadcast TV, which is a learning that we took away from fall, where a lot of that TV we're reaching lapsed customers who aren't the best target for us. So we're really focusing in more with this addressable TV on the new and current customers that we have. And then in the summer, we'll head into our 25th anniversary marketing campaign which is largely targeted toward existing customers although certainly it will reach new as well. And then in the fall, there will be another large advertising campaign which again is likely to include television.","So the pivot I think toward more traditional advertising will continue, the one that we started last year. That's not to say that we won't do more non-traditional things, as we always have. The notable difference I think for this year will be in the addition of a much more robust CRM platform and the inclusion of a loyalty program which we should see in the second half of the year. So that'll give us \u2013 the combination of this more strategic approach to advertising, particularly the use of this addressable TV, along with a more robust CRM platform should allow us to reach the right customers more effectively. So I think it is overall a pivot to slightly more traditional, if you will, advertising, but we're doing it in a very targeted way.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And, Jack, if I could just sneak in one follow-up. You gave a number of detailed items around cost items individually. Could you just, if you were to hit your low single-digit comp guidance for the year in 2018, where do you think store margins land on a basis of what you just described?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, John, I think, we'll be in the \u2013 probably in the upper teens, maybe in the 17.5% to 18%, 18.5% range, something like that. A couple percent margin means that we would delever on the labor line with labor inflation running in the mid-single digits, and with only running a 2%, even though that's driven by price, that means we're still running negative transactions. And so I think it would be in that \u2013 probably constrained in that 17.5% to 18%, maybe as high as 18.5% if we really get cooperation from commodities.","We've also got some of the one-time things I mentioned as well, like the bonus that we're going to pay for tax savings. And then the additional M&R, maintenance and repair, that we're going to, in addition to extra capital, we're really going to place a heavy focus on making sure our restaurants look, feel, and are a wonderful environment for our customers. So I think that's about where you can expect margins to hit for the year, John.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon. I just have two quick questions. The first one, on point number 2 on innovations around digital and catering, how does loyalty fit into the mix there? And when might you be willing to launch a loyalty program?","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, as I just said, we expect to launch a loyalty program which is part of a larger CRM effort in the second half of the year. So the program is being designed as we speak. And so loyalty is a subset of the larger CRM effort, which will be an important part of all of our digital marketing, as well as catering, as marketing catering, obviously as those are things that we market to people who we know as existing customers. So they're very much linked.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And will you be \u2013 you'll get the customer data so that you can reach out to them. And is this a surprise and delight or points or dollar based program?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, yeah, I mean, absolutely. I mean, knowing the customer and having that one to one relationship with them is the central focus of it. The actual structure of the program is not something that we're talking about today, but absolutely everything is on the table with regard to that.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, and then just a second question in regards to the 130 to 150 new stores. To figure out how to model those, any sequence you would offer quarterly? And then are these new stores in new markets? Are they in existing markets? And is there any international growth to speak of?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Nicole, they should be reasonably even-filled throughout the year. You know, timelines always change throughout the year, but there's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of the way that they fall in through the quarters. And most of them will be in proven markets. We still will seed a few here and there in some of the newer markets, but most of them, way over \u2013 way more than 80% should be in our proven and established markets, which gives us greater confidence that they should open and generate an attractive return right out of the box.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","And none planned in international.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","And nothing planned in international right now, Nicole.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Nicole.","Operator","Our next question is with David Tarantino with Robert Baird. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","A couple questions on the traffic trends. First, Jack, on the quarter-to-date commentary, I think you sort of pointed to an underlying trend of around 2.5% to 3.5%. Could you just confirm the level of pricing that you have in that equation so that we can get to kind of an underlying traffic number? I believe you might be running 5% pricing or higher plus queso.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, it's right at 5%, David. There were some markets that had extremely high local costs, especially labor, so, market-by-market you would see some markets that were a little above 5%, but the overall weighted average across the country is running about 5%. We typically model in about a 20% resistance, so that 5% converts to about 4%. We might see less resistance than that, so, I would expect the comp to benefit somewhere between 4% and 5%. And then we're running 2% added to the check because of queso, so when we're running a 3%, for example, 3% positive comp, if you assume 4% from pricing and a couple percent from queso, you could back into a negative transaction of somewhere in the 3% range.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. And then your guidance for the year seems to assume that doesn't get a whole lot better, despite everything you're doing. Is that correct? If you look at sort of the seasonally adjusted traffic trends, are you assuming much improvement? Or are you just assuming that the year-over-year number gets better when you cycle the stepdown you saw in the second half of the year?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, yeah, there's a couple things, David. One, we do assume the back half of the year, the underlying trends do get better because comparisons get better. When we compare against July, we're comparing against the beginning of the negative transaction, so we do think the transactions get better. But we have a couple things also that roll off. We have some pricing that rolls off in April. We will compare against queso launch in September and it will compare against the pricing in November, as well.","Of course, we hope that we will build even more momentum, so we're not being overly bullish with our guidance. We're working on a number of things from an ops standpoint, from a digital standpoint, Mark mentioned loyalty, so we're hoping that we can spark a more positive transaction trend, but based on how tough it's been the last couple years to get that momentum going, we think this is the right level of guidance.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Makes sense. And then one more if Scott Boatwright is available to answer. There's a comment about guest satisfaction scores and a new system that you're using to measure those and some early signs being good on your progress there. So, I was just wondering if Scott could comment on sort of where you think you are today on those metrics and where you think you need to be to drive much better traffic trends. Thanks.","Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Hi, David, Scott here. Thanks for the question. We are using Medallia as our partner in the space. And we have just really started garnering the level of survey volume necessary for statistical relevance probably over the course of the last four to five months, and we have seen pretty significant growth in overall satisfaction since September of last year with a steady increase. And February is still ahead of January, although not fully baked, but feel really good about our current trends. I feel like we are really regaining consumer confidence all across the country by some of the steps that we took later in last year to really shore-up some of our operational deficiencies, and we'll see that to continue to improve. I am encouraged by the trend at this point. But to the last part of your question, I think to be best-in-class, we probably need to continue to improve probably another 600 basis points, 700 basis points from where we sit today.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is with Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. A few questions. I just want to clarify, Jack, on that 1% to 2% comp for the first quarter, are you including the New Year's Day benefit in that?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I am, Sharon, yeah.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","The New Year's Day overall for the quarter will give us about 1%. So that does imply that we're looking about just \u2013 on top of that a 1% positive, net 1% to 2% range. And the reason is just that our sales really surged significantly in the middle of February, and we're about to go up against those numbers. So, if we're lucky, we'll get mild weather again, but again, if we had kind of normal winter weather compared to how warm it was last year, 1% to 2% is about where we expect the quarter to fall.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I guess a question on the CEO search. I think, Steve, you mentioned being a purpose-driven company, and clearly, the culture has been one of the key hallmarks over time of Chipotle. As you look for that new CEO, is that purpose-driven dynamic? Is that a guardrail on that search? Or would somebody coming in kind of have free reign to take Chipotle in the direction he or she thinks it should go?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure, Sharon. You know, it's a delicate balance bringing in a new CEO. Of course, you've heard of examples where new CEOs have come in but have not really been allowed to act as a CEO, and I fully intend to have the new CEO be in charge. It's been great spending time with a number of candidates, and one thing has been consistent though, and that is how strongly Chipotle has impressed these folks, and it's based in the purpose.","So many of the candidates come from the restaurant industry and have been \u2013 either have led them or been a key player in these brands. And while they've enjoyed a lot of success in their companies, they've never had the kind of purpose that we've had at Chipotle, which is I think very, very exciting to all of them. I think it's not lost on them that you can really have both. You can have a purpose and you can have a product that's very, very popular with consumers, and you can have a great economic model. And for 25 years we never compromised on that. We had it all. And we need to get back on track and build momentum again, and all of the new CEOs realize that. I don't think you're going to see a situation where someone says \"To hell with food with integrity. We're going to buy cheap commodity meat now and really turn this thing around.\" I just don't worry that that kind of a thing would happen.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.","Operator","Our next question is with Sara Senatore with AB (44:46). Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Thanks. One question and one follow-up, please. So, the question is on the CapEx and some of the investment in the existing stores. I think the comment was that you're seeing some real benefits in terms of customer experience. But is that translating into same-store sales lifts? I think a lot of times in the industry we see lifts in the kind of mid-single digit range when there are some upgrades to the stores. So, just trying to get a sense if that guest experience improvement that you're seeing is actually also translating into top line. And then I do have a question on margins.","Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Hi, Sara, this is Scott Boatwright. It's a fantastic question. Once I joined the brand back last summer, I spent a great deal of time in our restaurants really from coast to coast and recognized there was a great deal of deferred maintenance across the country that needed to be addressed to ensure that we are best on block in each of the trade areas in which we operate. Unfortunately, Sara, those changes don't really alter the facade or the exterior of the Chipotle restaurants we've been talking about. So it wouldn't garner additional traffic, but I do feel, as a great number of our guests dine in that changing the experience for those folks will, although a slow build, will contribute to the overall sales performance here in 2018.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you. And then just on the margins, Jack, if you could talk a little bit about I think a year ago or what have you, we talked about 20% restaurant margins at $2 million AUVs, and now it sounds like maybe you're looking for 18% restaurant margins at roughly that number or even a little bit higher. Granted that you're reinvesting some of the tax savings as is the rest of the industry. But I guess is that 20% number off the table? And a related question, do you rethink how you approach pricing given that the nature of your pricing has meant that you've really lagged the cost inflation by quite a bit?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question. And let me try to answer it this way. Let me go back to Q2 of last year when our margin was at right around 19%, 18.9% or 19%, and then let's talk about what we can expect in the second quarter of this year, and that might be the best kind of way to show kind of before and after because second quarter of last year was right before we had the July where we started the negative transaction slide. So I would expect, Karen, that we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018.","Unknown Speaker","Sara.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I'm sorry, Sara. That we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018, about 19%, but there's a lot of pushes and pulls. First of all, we're having a net inflection point of about 500 to 600 basis points since the transaction trend last year. We were running positive 3% and then we switched to a negative 3%. So that 500 to 600 basis point, that impacts the margin by negative about 1.6%.","The ongoing labor inflation that we've seen is about 1.2%, 1.3% or so. And that's running about a 5% margin on top of our 26% labor. The menu price increases is helping us by 300 or so basis points. And so the menu price increase essentially offsets the deleverage from the comp and then the labor inflation. And then we have pushes in terms of this year we're expecting lower marketing and promo but a little bit higher maintenance and repairs. The maintenance and repairs we think is going to be a this year item, not a forever item, but still.","So you've got all these pushes and pulls, and so while our model still has the ability at higher volumes, if we can get transaction momentum growing, we can lever the model. We've seen us do that year after year after year. But this negative transaction hit is taking hits into the margin and then menu price increase, which adds 300 basis points to the model, is eaten all up by the delever and then by the inflation.","And so the important thing for us is to hopefully get some of these things that we're focused on to start transaction momentum, start positive transaction. And then in terms of menu price, we certainly are open to the idea instead of waiting three years and raising prices to perhaps, especially that labor inflation is an every year thing at this level, perhaps we take a smaller increase every year, just kind of hold on to our margins in terms of regular ongoing inflation. So I hope that helps in terms of comparing the quarters year to year because it really is a dramatic different picture since the transactions turned negative.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. That's helpful.","Operator","Our next question is with Jason West with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, thanks. I'm just trying to understand the level of investments that you guys need to make in the stores. You talked about some refresh of equipment and the ambiance, lighting and things like that. But then you also touched on a more significant prototype change with maybe things like mobile ordering pickup stations and things like that. So what is the plan there in terms of \u2013 I know this year, it sounds like more of a refresh plan, but then is it more of a full remodel in the future or are you doing both at the same time? Can you talk about that a bit?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, it's actually both at the same time. It's really low-hanging fruit to change light bulbs and to freshen with new deep thirds on the service line, the new stainless steel pans that aren't bent, things like this that really cause customers to notice that there's something different. It's shinier, it's brighter, it's cleaner. And we're going to continue to find those kinds of opportunities.","Right now, we have engaged with three different architectural firms to create the next version of the Chipotle experience, and we've deliberately asked them to remodel existing restaurants so that this new experience can be applied to existing restaurants as well as brand new restaurants. And we'll start to see some of those come online shortly. We've got three of them now mocked up as models in full-scale cardboard models in a warehouse, and we've walked through them and kicked the tires and really felt what that experience is going to be like.","It's really exciting. It combines the traditional Chipotle experience along with things like digital pickup, whether it's in-store digital or out of store digital, and grab and go. And it also allows for potential new menu items. So really exciting stuff and really preparing ourselves for the next 25 years.","Operator","Our next question is with Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Another question on the CapEx (52:24) side of things. So with this $50 million of spending on really maintenance this year, it sounds like you roll off some of that more as one time than ongoing in nature. Would that rolling off give you sort of more flexibility to then increase the \u2013 or reaccelerate unit growth? Or what's sort of the governing factor on maybe getting back to prior peaks of unit growth? Thanks.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, I think on a theoretical basis, it could lead to that, but I don't think it's a matter of access to capital because we've got enough access to capital through our operations and through our balance sheet to do the remodels, to do the repairs that Steve talked about, the bringing our restaurants up to standard, and we can accelerate growth.","I think the biggest driver right now is we want to give our ops teams a chance to really get on solid footing. The things that Scott has put into place have really just started to take hold. We're going to put a huge emphasis on training, a refocus on training so that we can have confidence that all of our teams, all of our managers, all of our crews will know what our standards are, they can execute the standards and they'll deliver an excellent guest experience including great throughput. We haven't had a great throughput year in the last few years, and that takes a lot of training.","So I think the new store growth, reaccelerating that is going to be much more about how we feel about the ops teams and are they on solid footing, are our training programs, are they really taking hold. And then I think we'll redeploy capital into the new stores. So I wouldn't say just because capital frees up that that automatically would move into a new store. And we're not commenting specifically on 2019 right now. I think it'd be prudent for us to get through at least half if not three quarters of 2018, and then we'll assess at that time and talk about what 2019 and beyond looks like for growth.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question is with Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Steve, I believe it was last quarter you talked about the NEXT Team whether it was for menu innovation or new segments and what not. And I know you talked about how queso was I guess their first foray. So I'm just wondering with greater time now under your belt as you think about that NEXT Team, what's the early evolution or thoughts around I think you mentioned new segments or new day parts? How would you prioritize the different opportunities that perhaps they're coming up with as you think about the next many years. And I know you just mentioned kind of new menu items, so what do you think kind of the genesis of what's the outcome of that NEXT Team in terms of over the next year or so?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure, I think the NEXT Team's biggest opportunity is to always look at our core menu and make sure that we're cooking better food, we're sourcing better food, we have better ingredients, we're improving our preparation techniques, our cooking techniques, our serving techniques. It's what drove our business for the first couple of decades, taking a core group of menu items and continually improving them, not only through food with integrity but through better restaurant execution. So that's a priority. But additionally, they need to work on new menu items and they have a whole host of menu items. New menu items at a place like Chipotle is tricky though. It's tricky not only because we've had the same menu for basically 25 years, but because of the linear format, it's not like you can put a whole new thing up on the menu board like at a typical fast-food place. Ingredients sort of become part of the overall offering, so it's a tricky proposition. But it's something that we're working really hard on. There are exciting new offerings that are around things like salads and different kinds of grains and also exploration of traditional things and these are things that customers are asking for, things like nachos and quesadillas. And so, how to integrate those into our service format so that we can maintain throughput and sort of the level of execution that we've relied on in the past is tricky. So, that's something that they're focusing on also.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then, Jack, I just want to clarify. I think you said more than one-third of the tax savings you're going to reinvest. It sounds like a lot of it is more one-time in nature versus ongoing, but did you say something about the remaining two-thirds? I thought you said maybe you'd be reinvesting that, as well, or should we assume that the remainder gets returned to shareholders?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, in essence, what we did say is that that will help us fund the increase in CapEx, but we'll continue, Jeff, we'll continue to generate more than enough capital from operations to support our CapEx. We still have a strong balance sheet, so you can expect us to continue to return cash to shareholder. Not necessarily an incremental amount. I think the incremental amount that we're getting from taxes is going to be funneled into the extra CapEx and into our existing restaurants. We still have room that we can return some of our capital to shareholders, as well, through buybacks.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

After which, we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Niccol","Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re pleased with our third quarter financial performance, which reflects further progress on our key strategic initiatives that are providing guests with a great experience and positioning the business to deliver above industry growth for many years to come. In fact, this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales, which highlights that running great restaurants with a purpose of cultivating a better world is a compelling proposition.","For the quarter, we reported 11% comparable restaurant sales growth that included nearly 7.5% transaction growth. Restaurant level margins of 20.8%, which is 210 basis points higher than last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.82, representing 77% year-over-year growth and digital sales growth of 88% year-over-year representing 18.3% of sales.","I\u2019m often asked what\u2019s next. I believe we still have a lot of opportunity in executing our five key strategies, which are; number one, making the brand more visible and loved; number two, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food, hospitality and throughput; number three, leveraging our digital make line to grow sales and expand access; number four, engaging with our customers by launching a new loyalty program; and number five, creating a stage-gate process for innovations.","Let me give you an update on each of these starting with our stage-gate process, which is designed to test an item in a few markets on three key areas, delighting our customers, driving our financial benefit, and of course ensuring a seamless integration into our current operations. This test tends to be predictive of what happens nationally and helps increase the likelihood of success.","I\u2019m pleased to announce that carne asada is the latest item behind Lifestyle Bowls and our Rewards program to be successfully validated through this process and all three are meeting or exceeding our expectations. Carne asada is a limited time offering that is easy to execute operationally and has a unique flavor profile. It\u2019s a tender cut of steak seasoned with fresh squeezed line and finish with hand chopped cilantro and a blend of signature spices. No wonder it\u2019s receiving terrific customer feedback.","As great as carne asada taste, it\u2019s success is amplified by all elements of our strategy coming together in unison. Specifically, digital providing more frictionless access, marketing enhancing awareness and emphasizing the deliciousness of carne asada operations, delighting our guests with great hospitality and throughput and our supply chain, ensuring we have the highest quality ingredients that meet our food with integrity standards.","I\u2019m so proud of the collective efforts of our teams rolling out this new premium steak. Beyond carne asada, we are also testing queso blanco, salads in quesadillas. These items are in various markets where we are gaining valuable feedback. As I\u2019ve stated previously, we\u2019re not going to roll out new menu items at the sacrifice of throughput nor will we add complexity to our restaurants by overemphasizing new menu choices. We will update you on our progress of all potential new menu items as they move through our stage-gate process.","Now let\u2019s talk about our marketing efforts, which have and will continue to be an important enabler of our growth. In fact, you saw this with the carne asada launch as we leverage our digital capabilities as well as a national TV campaign by teaming up with film director David Gelb. These spots are a continuation of our Behind the Foil campaign that launched earlier this year and highlight real Chipotle team members and providing an inside look at the real fresh food and skill for preparation that happens in Chipotle kitchens every day.","These efforts are designed to increase transactions and grow sales by driving culture, driving a difference and ultimately driving a purchase. In addition, we effectively utilize social media and ran several strategic promotions during the quarter to make the Chipotle brand more visible, while helping expand access. Going back to the question of what\u2019s next, we launched Chipotle Rewards in March and are just now beginning to leverage that platform.","We currently have 7 million enrolled members and have only scratched the surface on database marketing. We are encouraged by early signs of transaction increases across all frequency bands and going forward, we\u2019ll double down on our ability to leverage this data to incent behaviors. We expect this lever to become a bigger driver over time as we gain more experience gathering customer insight, while continuing to expand our digital platform.","Reducing friction and providing more convenient access for our guests has been critical to increasing our digital system penetration over the past couple of years. This quarter, digital sales grew 88% year-over-year to $257 million and represented 18.3% of sales during the seasonally slower summer quarter for digital. And we\u2019re knocking on the door of digital becoming $1 billion business. Consistent with past quarters delivery remained a key driver of our digital growth given enhanced capabilities on our app and website as well as our expanded availability from more than 97% of our restaurants.","Importantly, digital remains highly incremental and we continue to see residual lift in delivery sales that lasts beyond any promotion. Additionally, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we have finished installing our digital make lines in all relevant restaurants and this was completed slightly ahead of schedule and makes the system more efficient for our guests, team members and delivery partners, while driving more sales and loyalty for Chipotle. Now that we have the digital make lines installed, we are focused on ensuring that execution for this large and growing business matched that of the traditional front line.","This brings me to the evergreen topic of operational excellence. The reality is that all the growth initiatives I just mentioned are being supported by the terrific job our operations team is doing in providing a great guest experience. And we know cultivating a better world includes investing in our people. And we believe that\u2019s the right approach in creating an environment where our employees can thrive professionally as well as personally and be in a position to win not only today but also in the future.","Enhanced training and development, industry-leading employee benefits, including the recent Debt-Free Degrees program in addition to our newly expanded tuition reimbursement program and a new crew bonus that was paid out to more than 2,600 employees last quarter are just a few examples of how we continue to invest in our people to cultivate a better restaurant culture.","The result is our employees putting their best foot forward and remaining focused on our core fundamentals. This is leading to us attracting and retaining the right talent and having higher teams stability, which is allowing them to spend more time together and deliver on two important benefits. One, delicious food consistently being prepared and served every time, something our guests have definitely noticed. And number two, we\u2019re seeing a steady improvement in throughput aided by training, focus and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard that provides greater visibility on performance.","I want to recognize our team for their efforts and hard work in delivering another outstanding quarter. I believe we are still in the early stages of our journey and we need to stay focused on our priorities and executing flawlessly to support our growth, while providing our customers with the experience they expect from Chipotle. Thank you to all our employees for all that you do. We have a unique brand and I love the passion and determination that I see during my restaurant visits as our crew members constantly strive to be better today than they were yesterday.","With that, here\u2019s Jack to walk you through the financials.","Jack Hartung","Thanks, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered outstanding financial results in the third quarter as comps and margins continued to expand further highlighting the strength of our economic model. Connecting with guests through culturally relevant marketing focused on Chipotle\u2019s great taste and real ingredients, while providing more convenient access is helping lead to greater overall demand.","Sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, an increase of 14.6% from last year. Comp sales grew 11% in the quarter, which includes a 10 basis point reduction as a result of deferred revenue from our Rewards program. This deferral is lower than previous quarters due to a combination of an increase in free entr\u00e9e redemptions as guests earned enough points and an adjustment and breakage rate assumption for chips and guacamole now that we have more history.","Moving forward, we expect quarterly deferral to range between 20 basis points and 40 basis points based on various factors including the pace of signups and promotional activity. Restaurant level margins of 20.8% expanded 210 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.82, a 77% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had unusual expenses related to our transformation as well as legal reserves that negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.35, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $3.47.","Our comp of 11% was driven by an acceleration in transactions as nearly 7.5% of the comp came from greater guests visit. The higher average check includes a price impact of about 2% and a mixed contribution of roughly 1.5% driven predominantly by digital orders, which have a higher average check. Looking to the fourth quarter, factoring in strong sales we have seen thus far in October as well as the tougher comparison from last year, we expect Q4 comps to be in a high single digit range. This will result in our 2019 full year comp guidance being at the top end of our high single digit range.","We opened 25 new restaurants in the quarter bringing our total openings for the year to 60. And based on the early success of Chipotlanes, we shifted our real estate strategy to seek more sites that can accommodate a Chipotlane. As a result of the more than 80 restaurants currently at construction, about half of them will have a Chipotlane, which will result in a total of about 60 Chipotlanes by the end of 2019.","Given the longer construction timeline associated with Chipotlane, some of these new openings are likely to shift from Q4 into early 2020, so expect our total openings for 2019 to fall at or slightly below the low end of our 2019 range of 142 to 155 openings. For 2020 we anticipate opening between 150 and 165 new restaurants with more than half including a Chipotlane. And we expect these openings will be better balance throughout the year with around 60 openings in the first half of the year versus only 35 openings through June of this year.","Food cost for the quarter were 33.2%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year due primarily to a menu price increase that was partially offset by higher cost of several ingredients. On a sequential basis, avocado pricing moderated as we expected. This was the result of sourcing more supply from Peru, which reduced our reliance on Mexico. For Q4 we expect ongoing moderation in avocado pricing as a result of increasing supply in the back half of the quarter, but we believe this will be largely offset by the higher cost of carne asada resulting in cost of sales remaining in the low to mid 33% range.","Labor costs for the quarter were 26.6%, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation, which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range. It also includes 20 basis point additional investment related to our restaurant level performance incentives including the crew bonus, Brian mentioned earlier. We expect Q4 labor costs to be in the high 26% range given extra initial labor expenses associated with a significant number of new restaurants being opened in this quarter as well as lower seasonal sales in the fourth quarter.","Other operating costs for the quarter were 12.8% a decrease of 90 basis points from Q3 of last year due to lower marketing and promo cost as well as sales leverage. Marketing and promo cost were 2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 50 basis points compared to Q3 of last year as we decided to shift some of our marketing investment to Q4 to support carne asada and other promotions. As a result, we expect our marketing investment to be at or slightly above 4% in Q4, which will result in the full year investment remaining right around 3% of sales.","G&A for the quarter was approximately $115 million on a GAAP basis or $105 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding about $7.5 million for settlements of several legal matters and $2.5 million related to transformation expenses. It also includes $72 million in underlying G&A expenses, $25 million related to non-cash stock compensation, $5 million related to higher bonus accruals from our strong performance and payroll taxes on stock option exercises and $3 million related to other expenses including our All Manager Conference, which will be held in March of next year. Underlying G&A with a little lower than expected as we continue to finish rounding out our organizational structure.","We\u2019re expecting to fill open positions in Q4 and therefore, we believe our underlying G&A support will get to around $74 million to $75 million in Q4. Also, if we assume our current financial trends continue stock compensation, including performance adjustments, along with the higher bonus expenses should be right around $25 million.","Lastly, we\u2019re expecting to recognize between $2 million and $3 million for expenses in Q4, related to our upcoming All Manager Conference. And we expect the total expense to be right around $16 million, most of which will hit in Q1 of next year.","Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 17.9% on a GAAP basis and 18.3% on a non-GAAP basis. Both these rates are lower or below our full year guidance range due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation during the quarter. For Q4, we expect underlying effective tax rate to be in the 26% to 29% range, though it may vary based on discrete items as well as any stock option exercises.","Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling $844 million, as of September 30. We repurchased $39 million of our stock at an average share price of $783 during the quarter.","In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our Q3 results as our strategic growth initiatives continue to sustain strong sales momentum, which is a key driver of our economic model. We remain bullish about the future and we believe we still have plenty of runway ahead.","I just want to thank all of our restaurant team members for their contribution and their passion as they remain Chipotle\u2019s most valuable asset as we worked together to cultivate a better world.","With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Katherine Fogertey","Great, thank you. I\u2019m just trying to get a handle around the new unit guidance. So you guys expect additions to new units to go now at the lower end of the 140 to 155. And some of those are getting pushed into next year. Does the new unit guidance then implicitly state that you guys are slowing down the pace of new restaurant adds? I\u2019m just trying to get a handle on what are the puts and takes between unit growth here when coupled with the very strong comp momentum in the quarter? Thank you.","Brian Niccol","Yes. Thanks, Kathy. So no, the plan is actually, I think the guidance that we shared is we\u2019re going to be accelerating new units as we move into 2020. And I think, what we just wanted to share with people is, a greater blend of that will now include Chipotlane, which we\u2019ve accelerated the composition of Chipotlanes in our new unit kind of growth trajectory going forward. So the good news is with 11% comp and 7.5% transactions and really strong margins, we\u2019re now going to be able to push on how we continue to expand our new units going forward.","So this is really just one of these temporary things, whereas we take advantage of an opportunity with the Chipotlane, which really I think it is a terrific outcome because it will drive our digital results as well as drive the total business, which hopefully as we\u2019ve seen to date will result in even better returns going forward as we build out the new units. So no plan to slowdown, if anything, our guidance was intended to inform people we\u2019re going to be increasing. And we also wanted to be share with folks that we\u2019re going to have a greater mix now Chipotlanes.","Katherine Fogertey","Can you help us also just to remind us on the AUVs for restaurants with Chipotlanes versus those without? How we should think about how that blend might progress?","Brian Niccol","Yes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re disclosing exactly what the AUVs are on this. But here\u2019s what it is, I think we can give you some interesting facts on it, which is our digital business is roughly 50% bigger and the driver of that additional growth is our order ahead business, which as you know, it has got the best margin associated with our business going forward. So we loved the composition of the sales and we love the economics associated with new units, whether they have Chipotlanes or not. But we\u2019re very positive on which Chipotlane brings to our new unit program and why we\u2019re raising guidance for next year.","Katherine Fogertey","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead.","David Tarantino","Hi, good afternoon and congrats on another great quarter. Jack, I was wondering if you could maybe clarify what you meant around the Q4 guidance. I think you mentioned that October so far has been strong and you\u2019re expecting maybe that to ease, as it is cycle tougher comparisons coming up. So could you maybe just elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing in October so we have the right context for the rest of the quarter? And then Brian, you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing some progress on throughput in the restaurants, I was just wondering if you could contextualize what that progress has been so far and how you see that playing out in 2020? Thanks.","Jack Hartung","Yes, David on comp. We saw comps accelerate in September, when we initially rolled out carne asada, which is around September 12 or so. And then we started media around September 22. So we saw sales accelerate at the end of the quarter and then we saw those higher sales levels continue into October. The guidance that we\u2019re giving for the fourth quarter though it takes into account the strong comps as we start the quarter, but also that our strongest comp month last year was December, so going up against the tougher comparison in December. That\u2019s when we had the delivery bowls and those were very, very successful.","The other thing, I want to mention is, we only have enough supply for carne asada to last us for part of the quarter. We think we\u2019ll probably run out around the end of November, maybe into early December. And so we\u2019re being a little cautious with what happens once we run out of carne asada. But the momentum to start the quarter is great, but we got a tougher challenge as we move through the quarter.","Brian Niccol","And then, yes, to your second question, David, on throughput. The thing that I think is really exciting to see is as each quarter has gone by with the focus on this. We continue to see every region making progress on their throughput goals. So we\u2019re not all the way to where we have targeted, but we are making great progress and our throughput is better than it was last quarter and it\u2019s definitely better than it was two quarters ago. So the operational team is very focused. Scott has the guys dialed in on this and our throughput is continuing to improve quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month. So I\u2019m very optimistic about what that\u2019s going to do for the business going forward.","David Tarantino","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Sara Senatore","A question about margins if I could, which is just about the fact that it\u2019s been a little bit volatile this year, but in the end, very good margin expansion and maybe for the full year, EBIT margin on a recurring basis, maybe as much as high 100 to 200 basis points something in that range. But I guess that implies a very high flow through margin, even on a 10% comp. So could you just deconstruct that a little bit? Especially, because you have a traffic-driven comp, there\u2019s not a lot of price in there. Is that digital mix? Are there cost savings that are coming through? And is it still the case that when we think about potential return to peak volumes, we should think about restaurant level margins that are maybe below what they would have been at previous peaks? Or are you finding opportunities again between throughput order ahead is sort of structurally offset, whatever the headwinds may have been?","Brian Niccol","Yes, Sara. The way I would think about margins is I think most of the leverage, it\u2019s from flow through. So we do get a higher, a very attractive flow through, when we have higher sales, especially when they\u2019re transaction-driven like this. We have some headwinds in there. That we have to overcome, like we do have labor inflation that 4% to 5%, that\u2019s about a 100 basis point headwind, avocados to get better in the quarter. So we had bigger headwinds from avocados in Q2 than Q3. And then moving into Q4, we\u2019ve got a little bit of a challenge. The carne asada\u2019s more expensive, a cut of meat. It\u2019s a higher quality premium cut of steak. So that puts a little bit of pressure on our food costs.","But I would say that from overall margin standpoint, we\u2019re pretty much right on track. We talked about at $2.1 million volume, we should generate a margin of about 21% and we\u2019re right about there. In terms of as you move from $2.1 million to $2.2 million to $2.3 million up to if we get back to our peak volumes of $2.5 million, we\u2019re still confident that we\u2019ll be right in that same kind of margin range of like a 25%. So we think the flow through so far is pretty much right on track.","Sara Senatore","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Nicole Miller","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to understand what might be the tipping point on the acquisition of customer data. I believe, you said 7 million loyalty members. So right now the comps are producing, I would imagine it\u2019s not doing much yet with that data. So maybe you could talk about what you\u2019re doing with the data, but the power of what it can be \u2013 what it can do, now that you have a 7 million base and is that enough of a base to produce results?","Brian Niccol","Yes. Thanks, Nicole. The \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re delight we\u2019ve got 7 million users now in rewards program. We anticipate that\u2019s going to continue to grow. And as I mentioned in the past, we are already starting some experimentation with the various cohorts. And the good news is, when we have done some of these experiments, we\u2019ve seen meaningful changes in peoples\u2019 frequency and their engagement levels with the brand.","So I think this is something that ongoing, as we roll into 2020, it starts \u2013 it\u2019s going to start being a contributor to our sales growth. Because we\u2019ll have a meaningful database with meaningful numbers of users and I think we\u2019re learning really quickly and figuring out what really does result in behavior changes that rewards people and at the same time rewards the business with incremental transactions and incremental sales. So I\u2019m very optimistic about what this can do for us. The database marketing is showing signs of being a really meaningful growth lever going forward.","Nicole Miller","Thank you. And just a follow-up and last question, Chipotle is clearly getting stronger every day. So when you think about the development acceleration for next year, is there anything in there for international growth and if not, when and how do you leverage that international opportunity?","Brian Niccol","Yes. So the reality is exactly what you said, which is the health of the business and the operational performance gives us confidence to accelerate new units next year. And then you compound that with adding to the mix, new growth lever called Chipotlanes, which is a driver of digital sales and highly profitable sales. We\u2019re really excited about what our growth opportunity is from new unit standpoint in United States, so very excited about that. At the same time, we\u2019re continuing to work on our business in Canada, which they have made tremendous progress to date. And if they continue to deliver the financial performance that they\u2019re delivering, which is now getting close to what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S., obviously, that\u2019ll be a place down the road that we will look to accelerate new units as well.","We\u2019re still probably in the earlier innings in Europe. Because we\u2019re still learning there on what we can do with our Chipotle business. But again, the team there is making great progress as well. But still some work to be done there on both the model and how we continue to introduce Chipotle in the new markets. But I just want to emphasize, there is so much opportunity in the U.S., with the performance that we\u2019re getting out of our business. As well as frankly, the types of restaurants we can build going forward, the combination of end-caps, and now end-caps with Chipotlanes as well as the inline unit and then the freestanding restaurants that we\u2019ve done to date. So we\u2019re very optimistic about where we can go with our unit growth in United States. And then obviously, down the road, we\u2019ll figure out how we pivot outside the U.S.","Nicole Miller","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from David Palmer of Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good evening. Question on labor, I think your labor hours per unit went up more like high-single digits this quarter versus mid-single digits in the first half of the year. I know you can tell me if I\u2019m right on that, but if it did ramp up, why? And more broadly, even beyond this quarter, how do you view that leverage point going forward? Is that second make line, for example, fully staffed and ready to go? And should we see similar levels of labor leverage? Or is there more to be had or even less because you\u2019re not up to where you need to be? Thanks.","Jack Hartung","Yes, David. I would say, the labor leverage hit exactly where it should be. I\u2019m not sure, how you\u2019re doing your calculation. We had additional transactions of 7.5%. We grow our labor hours at a lesser percent than sales, quite a bit lesser percent. So when you say high-single-digit, that\u2019s not what we actually added. We would have added something quite a bit less than 7.5% in terms of the hours. And if you breakdown the labor leverage, we had labor leverage of about 60 basis points in the quarter and that\u2019s despite the fact that we had about 100 basis points of inflation challenge that we had to deal with. So we really labor \u2013 leveraged the labor line by about 160 basis points and that\u2019s really right on the target.","Now going forward with digital, we do think there\u2019s an opportunity with digital for us to get even more efficient. We\u2019re in the early innings there. Chipotlane, we\u2019ve only got 20 Chipotlane restaurants right now, but we\u2019re going to have 60 by the end of the year. And we\u2019ll learn more about how we staff the Chipotlanes and how we can really get as much as efficiency that we know is possible, out of moving more of the sales towards that second make line. So, so far we\u2019re really pleased with where labor is, but we do think that there\u2019s additional efficiencies as the second make line grows.","David Palmer","I guess my second point was really about, in that second make line, are those staffed and are you effectively at a low capacity utilization on that second make line currently and therefore that incremental margin is going to be outstanding, perhaps even better than the first line? Or is that something that you\u2019re not, where you need to be in terms of staffing when that mix gets up to where some of your better digital make line stores are staffed? Thanks.","Brian Niccol","Yes. David, I got your question. It\u2019s a good question. In our very busiest digital restaurant, those things are fully staffed and I think there\u2019s additional leverage to be had. There are areas of the country and there are individual stores where the digital business is not at that same 18%. We do have challenges in making sure we\u2019ve got the right staffing throughout the day and every single day.","So there are opportunities for us to staff those restaurants, so that the business will build, but I will tell you in terms of the levers that you\u2019re getting at with the restaurants that are already at 18%, 20%, 25% digital, those restaurants are staffed. And as we add more sales to the second make line, you\u2019re going to see greater sales leverage in those stores.","David Palmer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Glass","Hi, thanks very much. Just on digital sales, I understand there\u2019s some seasonality, but I was still surprised to see sequentially about the same percentage of sales as digital. So maybe what gives you confidence that you aren\u2019t hitting some sort of ceiling in that, the consumer doesn\u2019t want to transact more than they are in digital channels. And can you talk specifically about how delivery has performed in this quarter relative to prior quarters?","Brian Niccol","Yes, sure. So what we\u2019ve seen is the seasonality was more around the delivery aspect of the business, in our digital business because we continue to see growth in our order ahead business. And so, what we\u2019ve also seen is we\u2019ve come out of kind of the summer months where the seasonality was is, that strength in continued on with the order ahead business and then consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past, the seasonality played out in the delivery side of the business.","So we\u2019re definitely confident that we are far from the ceiling. And then we\u2019ve got other indications where when we\u2019ve added additional access like the Chipotlane, you get well beyond 20%. So that\u2019s what gives us confidence that we\u2019re far from the ceiling on this.","John Glass","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on carne asada, is this \u2013 was this intended to be an LTO or what \u2013 why are you running out of product and is it just temporary or is it, you\u2019re just going to pause this in-and-out? I thought it was more like, you were going to try attempting to build sort of permanent new sales items, not LTOs?","Brian Niccol","Yes. This was intended to be a seasonal offering where we would bring it in-and-out. There are other items like queso blanco, we\u2019re assuming it the success for the stage-gate-process, that\u2019ll be more permanent. But yes, this one initially was intended to be more of a product represent some news and we may use it again depending on how the whole experience plays out.","The early feedback we\u2019ve seen from our customers and our crew members is, they definitely would like us to do this again. So, we\u2019ll figure out exactly the right pacing and sequencing and whether or not it\u2019s something we want to have permanently in the business or if we continue to use it more as like a seasonal item.","John Glass","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Brian Niccol","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jake Bartlett","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask a follow-up on the carne asada, my kind of chats or just even my experience in the stores was that the carne asada was selling significantly more than the regular steak. And so I assumed that, that was driving a decent amount of checks. So within that the context of that, of those statements, could you talk about how October has been impacted by the carne asada? And maybe what we could expect to kind of fall-off with the carne asada\u2019s removal.","Brian Niccol","Okay. Yes, sure. So, we have gotten great response to the carne asada initiative. We\u2019re really excited to see that the stage-gate-process was predictive of what we\u2019ve seen nationally. So we\u2019re really delighted about that. We\u2019re seeing it drive both check-in transactions, which is also another thing we\u2019re very excited about. And what we\u2019re seeing is, it\u2019s sourcing new users as well as having people that have been users of the Chipotle business to try a new occasion. So we\u2019re seeing frequency compression and we\u2019re seeing new users coming in.","What we\u2019ll obviously want to continue to understand, which we\u2019ve got some understanding on is, what happens to all those new users that came in now that they\u2019ve experienced the Chipotle business and historically, Chipotle has been very sticky beyond just one product, it\u2019s the whole value proposition that get people excited about Chipotle. The idea of Food With Integrity, the idea of customization, the idea of speed, and then obviously putting that all together at a really reasonable price, it\u2019s something that\u2019s very sticky for the Chipotle business. So we think this is much bigger than just the product. It\u2019s more about introducing people to the Chipotle experience ongoing.","Jake Bartlett","Got it. And I don\u2019t know if Jack would you want to just share what it\u2019s kind of done to how much it\u2019s been helping the October sales in mix. But also just building on that question, if it\u2019s sounds like its successful in driving check and driving traffic and kind of hitting everything you want it to, why not keep it around or do it more permanently? Is it a matter of the throughput or is it a matter of the supply being a little more difficult? What would be the reason why not to keep on offering it?","Jack Hartung","Yes, so look, the main driver is, we were not willing to compromise on our Food With Integrity principles on the supply over this program. And so going into it, we knew the supply available would take us through November to early December.","And, something we\u2019re going to work on going forward, given the response we\u2019ve seen is, okay, how do we work on the supply of steak in that particular cut to be consistent with our Food With Integrity principles to give us the flexibility to do it beyond just the seasonal program. But I don\u2019t think we can answer your specific question that you\u2019re looking for on exactly how is it playing out in the product mix and the comp. Obviously it\u2019s playing a positive role.","Jake Bartlett","Got it.","Jack Hartung","That\u2019s where I would leave it.","Jake Bartlett","Okay. I appreciate it.","Jack Hartung","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good afternoon. I am wanted to follow up on the Chipotlanes and as well on the carne asada. So on Chipotlanes, could you \u2013 Jack give us any idea on kind of what the incremental cost is when you add the Chipotlanes to locations and maybe what the unit economics are that we should think about for 2020 associated with those new openings?","And then on carne asada, any quantification around what it did to COGS either in the September quarter or what we should expect in the fourth quarter?","Jack Hartung","Yes, Sharon on the investment, the investments about an extra $75,000 to add Chipotlanes, that would be for like an end-cap building. It\u2019s the same $75,000 on a free standard, but a free standard just cost more than an end-cap. So our emphasis so far has been on getting the vast majority of our sites should be on the end-cap. We\u2019re trying to get as many end-caps with Chipotlanes as possible, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to pretty quickly pivot so that we can have more than half of our portfolio. Now we\u2019ll have the Chipotlanes. So it\u2019s a relatively modest investment.","Too early to say on the sales what the difference is between Chipotlanes and non- Chipotlanes, Sharon, we\u2019ve got 20 of these that spread throughout the country. I\u2019ll tell you they\u2019re opening up nicely. We\u2019re very pleased with the results. I just wouldn\u2019t want to put a number on whether it\u2019s performing at or above from a sales standpoint, but the fact that it\u2019s 50% above on digital it\u2019s a very strong starting point.","We know that when you can operate Chipotlanes with less friction, meaning it\u2019s easier to order, it\u2019s easy to stop-in and pick up Chipotlane without even getting out of your car. That tends to cause our customer to want to get your Chipotlanes even more often. So our optimism, even though it\u2019s very early is very strong and the economics with even a modest increase in sales at that kind of an incremental investment is going to be very attractive.","Sharon Zackfia","And then on carne asada, if you could help quantify the impact on your COGS for the third and fourth quarters.","Jack Hartung","Yes, it\u2019s going to be about it \u2013 it\u2019s very small in the third quarter, Sharon, because it was only in for a few weeks, but it\u2019s going to be in the ballpark of 50 basis points. And so \u2013 that\u2019s what we mentioned in our guidance that our food costs in Q4 is going to stay about the same, maybe a tick or two higher. Even though avocados are going to cause less in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s going to be offset by carne asada and we\u2019re guessing right now, again, we\u2019re trying to predict what the rest of the quarter is going to look like when we\u2019ll run out. But it looks like it\u2019s probably going to be right around 50 basis point impact in the quarter.","Sharon Zackfia","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Two questions, just one following up on the, I guess menu relation. Brian, it sounds like the carne asada success, I\u2019m wondering how you literally would define success in terms of maybe what mix you\u2019ve achieved thus far or what you think is the target level and maybe any color on the case of DSL. In case, you talked about what potential hurdles there would be to overcome in the stage-gate-process before we might see any or all of those? And then I have one follow-up.","Brian Niccol","Yes, look on a carne asada, I mean what we did in this stage-gate-process was, we wanted to make sure we had a product that consumers wanted. We wanted to make sure we had a product that our operators could execute. And then obviously we wanted to make sure it made sense financially.","And the way we derive that financial benefit is through check and transactions. The good news is carne asada has done terrific on the traffic driving as well as the check driving. And then our operators, to their credit have done job in executing and the feedback we\u2019re getting from consumers, both new users and existing consumers, is they love the product. So by all accounts, we\u2019re delighted with what carne asada is doing for the business.","And as you fast forward to other initiatives, our intention is we want to derive all those types of benefits when we\u2019re launching a product. So, queso blanco, same expectations, needs to be something our crews can execute with excellence, consistent with our Food With Integrity principles. It\u2019s got to be something the consumer is going to say they love it and they want to try it again. And then obviously it\u2019s got to play a role in the financial model so that it\u2019s continuing to move Chipotle forward.","And that\u2019s the reason why we test these things. And, some will play a bigger role in traffic driving than others and that\u2019s why you got to have a pipeline of different products to play a different role in the business. So I\u2019m really excited about what the pipeline looks like and very delighted really about carne asada going through this whole process and then everybody executing with excellence. That\u2019s how we end up with a successful initiative.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. And can you just for color, maybe Jack on the marketing stand, I think you said 4% in the fourth quarter, which would lead the full year at 3%. I\u2019m just wondering how you measure the return on that and whether we should think about 2020 being more in the 4% range or whether there\u2019s a reason why you prefer to keep it up that lower 3% level?","Jack Hartung","No, I mean Jeff we have no plans to do that, that could change as the year unfolds. But right now we think 3% about the right level, right now we think we\u2019re getting a great return. You know the marketing team, every single campaign they look at what\u2019s happening in terms of transaction, what the return is and so far we\u2019ve been getting a great return on our dollar. So right now we think 3% is the right level. If we \u2013 should change in the future, we\u2019ll communicate that.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John Ivankoe","Great. Thank you. I was hoping to get an update on some of the supply chain initiatives that we\u2019ve been talking about in 2019. If there\u2019s an update in terms of how much money was saved in the third quarter, if there\u2019s an outlook for the fourth quarter and what the visibility is for some of the supply chain work on fiscal 2020 to start contribute more meaningfully the margins overall.","Jack Hartung","Yes. John, we\u2019ve saved another few million dollars during the quarter, but it was offset by other things including, some of the carne asada pressure that we saw in the last three weeks of the month. But listen, the team\u2019s been doing a lot of great work and we think that we\u2019ll see more savings in 2020.","Too early to predict what those are going to be. I mean, a lot of these things will take time because you\u2019re talking about long-term relationship with suppliers, but I expect we\u2019ll be able to talk next year about even more savings from the efforts of the supply chain team.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Andy Barish","Yes. Wondering on kind of looking out, obviously, the second half margin progress, which we thought wasn't quite going to be a strong as the first half may act otherwise, but I wonder if you look out to 2020 and kind of give us a sense of the puts and takes, I assume, pricing is going to remain around 2%. Any early thoughts on kind of the protein basket just as we try to gauge some of the margin levers for next year as we sit here today?","Jack Hartung","Yes, Andy, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary right now. It's too early to get a precise prediction, but it looks like beef generally to the extent that we can get the supply of food with integrity cuts that Brian mentioned, it looks like that should be pretty stable. We don't see anything out of the new ordinary in chicken. We see what's happening with pork supplies throughout the world. Our supplies are separate from that and so we haven't seen any impact there.","So right now we're kind of crossing our fingers and hope that everything continues to look stable. We're also hoping for a benign or maybe even a positive benefit from avocados next year is going to be the alternate year where we should see a more plentiful harvest. And so right now, knock on wood, cross fingers, all that kind of stuff. It looks like a pretty stable cost of goods sales environment for next year.","Andy Barish","And do you anticipate menu price kind of staying in this 2%-ish area?","Jack Hartung","You know, we're studying that right now. Andy, if we did anything, it definitely would be in that kind of 2% range, but no decisions have been made.","Andy Barish","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles","Great, thanks guys. On Chipotlanes, what percent of the existing 2,500 non-Chipotlane locations have the capacity or the ability to add a Chipotlane versus the amount that are structural enable and just also just curious about your appetite to retrofit these locations as you go through 2020 and beyond?","Brian Niccol","Yes, sure. So there on our current estate there really aren't that many options out there for us to retrofit into the Chipotlane only because we don't have that many end caps historically. Chipotle really was in line unit execution. So we're just limited with the real estate that we have and then you've got to have the end cap in the right location in order to do a retrofit. With that said, where the opportunity exist, we've done one, and not surprising, we saw positive result given for what Jack said earlier, when you get people more access with less friction, the order ahead business continues to take steps forward. So limited opportunity in retrofit but lots of opportunity going forward as we build new restaurants.","Andrew Charles","That's helpful. And I know you're reluctant to give numbers in details on Chipotlane, but when you talk about year-to-cash on cash returns for new store of around 40%. Is it right to think that Chipotlane is higher than that just given this is a winning prototype for future development?","Jack Hartung","I mean, it's early but, yes, we would expect to Chipotlanes are going to be a higher return than the average portfolio.","Andrew Charles","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question will be from Gregory Frankfurt with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Gregory Frankfurt","Maybe just going back on to Andrew's question, in terms of the operating model for Chipotlanes going forward, I guess, right now, you can only order ahead as you pull up to a Chipotlane. what's the likelihood that you shift this model to more of a traditional drive through operating structure at some point down the line? I guess what's going to I guess prevent you from making that shift at some point? Thanks.","Brian Niccol","Well, nothing would prevent us from making the shift. We just don't believe it's the right shift. So what we've seen is giving people the access through ordering ahead, so that they don't have to get other car is a nice unlock for the Chipotle business so that we don't have to provide the additional complexity of running a traditional drive through.","Frankly, I think this is the future of how people will want to interact with restaurant companies because this is arguably faster than any other way possible to get your food. You order ahead and you don't have to get out of your car and our model is already fast now. Now, we've made it fast assuming that we get out of your car, come into the restaurant, grab your food and go. So we don't see any reason to make that pivot going forward.","Gregory Frankfurt","Got it. Can you maybe talk about the experience so far in terms of balancing consumers kind of timing when they show up at the restaurant with kind of when the food is ready, and if they show up early, and how you manage through that and kind of how you would expect to manage that as you go forward? Thank you very much.","Brian Niccol","Sure. So you have \u2013 with our smart pickup times, you do select a time for when your food is going to be ready and then you show up with it. If you show up early, we usually have people just pull forward and tell them they can come into the restaurant at their time or there are times where we will bring the food out to them where they pull forward. The good news is what we've seen is after the restaurant opens and two or three weeks in, people get into a pretty good rhythm where they shop on time and once they realize this is how the Chipotlane works and we've gotten really great consumer acceptance and the right type of behavior going forward. So that's not been a problem to-date and it's really just a matter of people adopting the new approach to how you get your food in your car.","Gregory Frankfurt","Helpful perspective. Thank you.","Brian Niccol","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Peter Saleh","Great, thanks. With 7 million loyalty members now, can you talk a little bit about the composition of the customer. Are they new users or they lapsed customers and just maybe a little bit more detail. Are these loyalty customers, are they spending more, are they coming in more frequently? Any details around that would be helpful. Thanks.","Brian Niccol","Yes, of course. So this is a question I love to answer because the thing that's been great about the program to-date is it's definitely got bigger representation of new and light\/medium users, and what we're seeing is when we do communicate with them with certain incentives, we see behavioral changes that are very positive and so we're seeing all the things you would want to see in a rewards program from a standpoint of the composition of those that are in the rewards program and then the behaviors associated with those that are within the program. So a lot of new light and medium users, and then we're seeing really nice behavior associated with all those various cohorts.","Peter Saleh","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will be from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris O'Cull","Yes. Thanks. Brian, given the supply of Carne Asada, it is going to run out late November, what are the plans to continue driving usage from guests that came in for the product. I mean, I'm just wondering if we should expect a new product news before the end of the year? And then I had a follow-up.","Brian Niccol","Yes. Our plan is those that come in with Carne Asada, they get a great Chipotle experience that is going to result in them wanting to come back even with Carne Asada is not on the menu. And we're obviously focused on continuing to drive that message throughout the whole quarter. So we probably have already seen it on television; we are running ads that both talk about Chipotle as the brand and the total restaurant company as well as driving Carne Asada.","So \u2013 and what we've seen is the response has been positive to both messages. So people are very much in tune with the idea of food with integrity, real culinary, real ingredients, cooking done right in front of them, as well as some new product menu news around Carne Asada. And the good news is Chris and the marketing team, they've got a strong plan to finish the year that goes well beyond just products.","Chris O'Cull","Okay, that's fair. And then, Brian, would you talk about how the company to determine the appropriate number of unit openings for 2020 and what you would need to see to accelerate the number of openings?","Brian Niccol","Yes, look, the good news is, there are plenty of sites and the economics would support going faster and doing more. What we wanted to really make sure is we've got the people and capability in place and I think we're seeing more and more confidence as our stability has gone up, and as we've opened new restaurants, they continue to open really well. So we're going to continue to build a really strong pipeline, which we have for next year, and if the opportunity presents itself to go a little faster, obviously we'll.","But I think I've been pretty consistent with this one, which is the key for us to continue to have great unit growth is to have great unit economics. And I think that's what we're demonstrating is tremendous unit economics. So I'm not surprising as the unit economics continue to improve. There is more and more sites that are available for us and then now we've just added another lever called the Chipotlane, which I think is going to open even more sites for us in the future.","So we've been very purposeful to be \u2013 I think very measured in how we go about ramping up our new unit development. But I think there is plenty of opportunity for us to grow from where we are today and what we probably will do in 2020.","Chris O'Cull","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our last question today will come from John Tower with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Tower","Taking the question, just going back to the digital piece of the business, with digital and specifically order ahead mix moving higher as a percentage of your sales, does this potentially open up more opportunities on the menu over time? I'm thinking specifically about your Quesadillas and how, at least when you're testing now requires about a 30-second cook time with new kitchen equipment.","So in a traditional store that might gum up throughput, but if you're doing Chipotlanes where you've got a greater mix of order ahead, obviously that seems to tie in better in that type of a store. So does it potentially open up more opportunities for your menu?","Brian Niccol","Look, I think it's great about the digital business and the digital make line is it does present the opportunity for us to look at opportunities that historically we may not have been able to look at, because I think you can use that make line in various ways, whether it's fulfilling directly digital orders or helping alleviate the front line. So it's definitely something we're continuing to contemplate because it just presents a tremendous opportunity for us. We've got now additional capacity with really great economics associated with that additional capacity.","We before was not be thinking about how we can drive, why can't we drive that harder and that's what the team focused on is how do we drive that harder because we like the results every time that business growth. So \u2013 and I wouldn't just have it be the idea of just product. I think there's other ways to drive people into that digital business and then ultimately leverage that digital make line.","John Tower","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.","A - Brian Niccol","Okay, thank you. And thanks for all the questions and thanks for joining us today. Obviously, where I started this conversation is, I'm tremendously proud of the Chipotle team, all of our team members in the field. You don't deliver 7.5% transaction growth and an 11% comp unless you've got an organization that is all rolling together and I think the culture is tremendously strong, both in the support centers and in the restaurants, and I think what we've demonstrated with Carne Asada is we also now have a muscle where we can do new product innovation, as well as driving the digital system. And I'm also really delighted about the unlock that I think Chipotlanes is going to present for us from our new unit opportunities going forward.","So a lot of growth opportunities in front of Chipotle, a tremendous quarter I think that the team delivered most recently and couldn't be prouder of where we are, but I'm also really excited about where we're going. So thank you for joining us and we'll talk soon. Take care.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com.","I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements, including projections about comparable restaurant sales growth, new store openings, our effective tax rate and expected G&A expenses. ","These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement. ","Please see the risk factors contained in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statement.","Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Niccol","Thanks, Ashish. And good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong ending to 2019 as Q4 marks the eighth consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales, which highlights that running great restaurants with the right leaders and the right culture delivers outstanding performance.","Our guests love what they see in our restaurants and our team members deserve all the credit. They are more passionate and committed than ever to delivering on our purpose of cultivating a better world.","For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.4 billion, representing 17.6% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 13.4% comparable restaurant sales growth that included 8% transactions growth. Restaurant level margins of 19.2% which is 220 basis points higher than last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $2.86 representing 66% year-over-year growth and digital sales growth of 78% year-over-year representing 19.6% of sales.","Full-year results also showed great progress, with sales growing 14.8% to reach $5.6 billion, driven by an 11.1% comp with 7% transaction growth. Restaurant AUV, about $2.2 million, margin expansion of 180 basis points to 20.5% and digital sales of $1 billion dollars which grew 90% versus the prior year.","These results were driven by the same five key fundamental strategies that I've mentioned previously. Number one, making the brand more visible and loved. Number two, creating innovations utilizing a stage gate process. Number three, leveraging our digital make line to expand access and convenience. Number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program. And number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food, hospitality, throughput and economics.","While Chipotle had an excellent 2019, what excites me the most is that we are just getting started. I believe we have the opportunity to continue to expand AUVs, margins and store count over time. Our strategy has plenty of runway that should help drive healthy comps in 2020, while also improving flow through.","Let me provide you an update on each of these strategies, beginning with our marketing programs which are designed to increase transactions and grow sales by driving culture, driving a difference and ultimately driving purchases.","We continue to iterate our national For Real TV campaign to showcase our real ingredients, fresh food and the culinary skills of Chipotle team members in action. These ads are honest, transparent and highly effective at driving awareness and reminding customers what makes Chipotle great and a brand they love.","This campaign is connecting with our customers as evidenced by significant increases across almost all major drivers of brand strength, including trust and favor brand in our consumer brand tracker.","Our various marketing initiatives across both traditional and digital channels were successful in attracting new users to Chipotle as well as motivating existing customers to come more often. Importantly, we saw healthy transactions growth in 2019 without relying on short-term promotions. ","Although our overall marketing budget relative to 2018 remained consistent at 3% of sales, the promo portion was actually reduced by 15% and follows a sizable reduction in 2018 as well.","There's no doubt that marketing helped drive impressive sales during 2019. And based on the plans we have in place, I expect more of the same in 2020. Chipotle will continue to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense. We will be a part of culturally relevant events and we have an always-on social and digital program.","Our marketing efforts this year were elevated because we used the stage gate process to develop innovation that leads food culture and meets guest requests. We are pleased to have rolled out several successful menu items that were validated by this process. ","This included our preconfigured, diet driven lifestyle bowls which were launched in January 2019 and received terrific feedback as they showed that whatever lifestyle or diet you want to pursue, Chipotle's real ingredients are a perfect fit. We recently enhanced this platform by adding a new super green salad mix composed of hand-cut romaine, baby kale and baby spinach, as well as a whole 30 chicken to provide guests with specific dietary goals, more options.","The other noteworthy new item was carne asada, which was launched in September and will transition out by the end of the first quarter. This premium steak continues to exceed our expectations. As a result, our supply chain team is exploring options to see if we can add this as a permanent menu item at some point in the future, contingent, of course, on us finding enough supply of high quality ingredients that meet our food with integrity standards.","As you think about 2020 and beyond, our goal is to continue introducing one to two new menu items on average per year. Our pipeline remains robust with Queso Blanco, quesadillas and beverages currently being tested in various markets. In fact, Queso Blanco has recently been validated via the stage gate process, allowing for a national rollout and replacement of our existing queso shortly. Additionally, we have several items in the early stages of testing. We will keep you updated on their progress over time. ","The key takeaway here is that the state gate process is working as expected and gives me confidence that future innovations will delight our customers, ensure a seamless integration into our current operations and derive a financial benefit.","Let's move now to the third key initiative. Our digital platform designed to reduce friction while increasing convenient access. The progress we've made here continues to be a standout story.","Over the course of 2019, we significantly upgraded our capabilities by completing the rollout of digital pickup shelves, digitizing our digital make line and expanding our delivery capabilities to over 98% of our store base.","During Q4, these efforts resulted in digital sales of $282 million, which grew 78% year-over-year and represented 19.6% of mix. In just three years, we have quadrupled the digital business, achieving over $1 billion in sales during 2019.","Moving forward, I am really excited by the latest addition to our digital flywheel, the Chipotlane, which is off to a great start. Customers love the fact they don't have to get out of their cars, as well as having a pickup time that is significantly faster than their traditional drive-through.","We continue to see overall digital penetration for Chipotle in restaurant in the high 20s, with the majority of this being driven by our highest margin, order ahead and pickup transaction. We will more than double the number of Chipotles in 2020 because our guests love the convenience and it strengthens our economic model by making our highest margin channel more accessible.","The next potential piece to enhance our digital offering is a new restaurant design that helps evolve our mobile pickup shelves to an integrated digital pickup portal. We recently began to test several formats including one with a walk-up window across from Wrigley Field in Chicago. This 2,000 square-foot restaurant is slightly smaller, has fewer seats, the customer-facing grab-and-go beverage case and digital pickup shelves near the front door for easy access. By better suiting our restaurants to accommodate the digital business, we will be able to provide a better overall experience for our guests.","Now that we have many of the digital tools in place, 2020 will be about using them more efficiently and really leveraging our rewards program, which currently has more than 8.5 million enrolled members and is one of the fastest growing restaurant loyalty programs in history.","While in 2019, we focused on member growth. In 2020, we will not only further increase enrollment, but more importantly look to optimize the use of database marketing to incent behaviors as we build out our CRM capabilities.","Personalization and engagement are the cornerstones of our revolving loyalty strategy. We are encouraged by the early signs of transaction increases across all frequency bands. We expect this lever to become a bigger driver in the future as we gain more experience gathering customer insight while continuing to expand our digital ecosystem.","This brings me to the most foundational ingredient of having a successful restaurant company \u2013 operational excellence, which comes from great leaders building great teams who create equally great guest experiences.","We continue to focus on outstanding execution by being brilliant at the basics. This requires a significant investment in our more than 83,000 employees with regard to career development as well as offering industry-leading benefits. Recent enhancements, such as debt free degrees, crew bonuses and mental health benefits, help differentiate the Chipotle brand.","Nowadays, employees want more than just wages from a potential employer. They are seeking the right culture and the right skills to help them grow, both professionally and personally. Additionally, our purpose around Food With Integrity and cultivating a better world also provides us a competitive advantage in this tight labor market. ","Within our restaurants, we believe the general manager is the most important position to improving operational health and ensuring a great customer experience. During 2019, this emphasis on our general managers resulted in exceptional food that is being prepared more consistently, better stability with turnover being reduced by around 35% and nearly a 10% improvement in our max 15 minute throughput KPI, aided by training and a laser focus on the five pillars of throughput. ","This success reinforces that continuing to develop, grow and invest in our GMs is the right approach to creating an environment that allows our employees to be in a position to win, not only today, but also in the future.","We've made good progress this year on our operational goals, but still have plenty of opportunity as we strive to be better today than we were yesterday, a message we will reinforce at our all-manager conference in March.","In closing, I believe our strong performance this year highlights that our strategies are working and the Chipotle brand is thriving. I'm really proud of what we accomplished in 2019 and want to thank all of our employees for winning today and creating a bright future.","We're building a successful, durable model. And by staying focused on our priorities and executing flawlessly, while providing customers with the unique Chipotle experience, I'm confident we will be successful for many years to come.","With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials.","Jack Hartung ","Thanks, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. Once again, we delivered outstanding financial performance in the fourth quarter as comps and margins continue to expand, highlighting our strong economic model.","Sales were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 17.6% from last year. Comp sales grew 13.4% in the quarter which includes no net impact from our rewards program. Deferred revenue from our rewards program was essentially offset by a refined breakage rate assumption for chips and guacamole as we gather more historical data. Moving forward, as we begin to lap the launch of our loyalty program, we expect quarterly deferrals to have a modest impact on our comp.","Restaurant-level margins of 19.2% expanded 220 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $2.86, representing 66% year-over-year of growth. ","The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to our transformation as well as legal reserves that negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.31, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $2.55.","For the full year, sales increased 14.8% to $5.6 billion on a comp increase of 11.1%. Restaurant level margins were 20.5%, an increase of 180 basis points, and we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $14.05, an increase of 55% over last year.","Unusual expenses mostly related to transformation and legal reserves negatively impacted our earnings per share by $1.67, leading to GAAP earnings of $12.38.","We're pleased that our unit economics strengthened in 2019 with average volumes now exceeding $2.2 million and restaurant margin reaching 20.5%. This margin included temporary pressure from carne asada and avocado pricing, without which our restaurant level margins would have been just over 21% which is within striking distance of the 22% margin potential at a $2.2 million AUV.","The growth in AUVs and margins in 2019 is evidence that our strong economic model remains intact and we expect continued growth in both of these metrics during 2020 and beyond.","The Q4 comp of 13.4% was driven by an acceleration in transaction as 8% of the comp came from greater guest visits. We also saw an increase in check of roughly 5.4%, driven by price and mix, the latter being driven by carne asada and digital orders which have a higher average check.","Looking to fiscal 2020 where comparisons will no doubt be tougher, we're optimistic that based on healthy sales trends thus far in Q1, plus the 2% price increase taken in December, combined with our future growth initiatives that a mid-single digit comp is achievable for the full year.","During the fourth quarter, we opened 80 new restaurants, a record number of openings for a quarter, bringing total new restaurant openings for the year to 140. Productivity of these units is in the high 80% range, the highest in the company's history. I'm really proud of the hard work put in by our development teams and our operations teams, especially given the significant back-end loading that occurred in 2019.","We opened 46 Chipotlanes in the quarter, resulting in 66 Chipotlanes at year-end. And as Brian mentioned, we're excited by the early success of these Chipotlanes and we'll continue to aggressively open more moving forward.","For 2020, we anticipate opening 150 to 165 new restaurants, with more than half including a Chipotlane. While these openings will once again be weighted towards the second half of the year, we expect a modestly better balance in comparison to last year. About 35% of these openings are expected to occur in the first half of 2020 versus only 25% in the first half of last year.","Food costs for the quarter were 33.1%, a decrease of 10 basis point from last year due primarily to a venue price increase and lower avocado pricing that was partially offset by the higher cost of several other ingredients, including about 70 basis point headwind from carne asada as it was available for the entire quarter.","On a sequential basis, avocado pricing continued to moderate, given greater supply coming from Mexico as we begin the more plentiful harvest year. For Q1, we expect ongoing moderation in avocado pricing as a result of increasing supply, but we believe this will be partially offset by higher carne asada cost, resulting in cost of sales being in the mid-32% range.","We expect food cost for the full year to be in the low to mid 32% range based on better avocado pricing and further supply chain efficiencies being partially offset by what appears thus far to be a normal cycle of protein inflation.","Labor costs for the quarter were 26.5%, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range including the cost of benefits such as debt free tuition. We expect Q1 labor costs to be in the mid 26% range with sales leverage and wage inflation being the biggest factors.","Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.8%, a decrease of 70 basis points from 1Q4 last year due to sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs were 4.1% in the quarter, similar to Q4 of last year, but a 210 basis point increase sequentially to support carne asada and our free delivery bowl promotion. For the full year our marketing investment was 3% of sales as expected.","Looking at 2020, we once again anticipate spending around 3% of sales overall for the year, with Q1 being in the low to mid 3% range compared to the 2.5% we spent in Q1 of last year in order to support our ongoing menu innovation.","During the quarter, we booked $10 million for legal reserves related to US attorney's investigation that began in January 2016. This brings the total reserve to $25 million. We believe this amount is a reasonable estimate of what we may be expected to pay to settle this matter, but there can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached. We have been cooperating with the investigation and we're in active discussions to possibly resolve this matter.","G&A for the quarter was $112 million on a GAAP basis, $106 million on a non-GAAP basis excluding nearly $4 million net related to several legal matters including the $10 million reserve I just mentioned and about $2 million related to transformation expenses.","G&A also includes approximately $75 million in underlying G&A expenses, $25 million related to non-cash stock comp, $4.5 million related to higher bonus accruals from our strong performance and related payroll taxes and $1.5 million related to our upcoming all manager conference. ","Underlying G&A was in line with our expectations as we grew headcount responsibly to support our growth. Looking to Q1, we expect to continue hiring people to support future growth and invest in our emerging digital platform. This will lead to Q1 underlying G&A support in the range of $77 million to $80 million and total G&A is expected to be around $120 million.","We expect stock comp to be around $23 million per quarter, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. This is slightly lower than Q4 as the 2017 equity bonuses roll off post testing and are replaced with new 2020 brands, which are valued at target without any performance. ","We also expect to recognize between $3 million to $4 million of importer taxes associated with shares that vest at the beginning of our fiscal year.","Lastly, we're expecting to recognize about $13 million of expenses in Q1 related to our upcoming all manager conference.","Effective tax rate for Q4 was 28.3% on a GAAP basis and 27% on a non-GAAP basis. The difference was due primarily to tax implications related to transformation costs.","For fiscal 2020, we expect our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 26% to 29% range, though it may vary based on discrete items as well as any stock option exercises. ","Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling $909 million as of December 31. And similar to Q3, we repurchased about $38 million of our stock at an average price of $773 per share during the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $188 million at an average price of $684 per share.","In closing, we're pleased to report a strong ending to fiscal 2019, including 8% transaction growth which highlights that our strategies are resonating not only with high-frequency customers, but also with medium frequency and new customers.","Continuing to enhance convenience and access while optimizing our digital, marketing, menu and operations will help ensure the Chipotle brand remains healthy moving forward. ","Thank you to all of our employees for their hard work and their dedication this year and let's keep it going in 2020.","With that, we're happy to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on a strong year. My question, Jack, is about the margin performance at the restaurant level. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the flow-through that you saw in Q4 and throughout the year. And I think you mentioned that, at $2.2 million AUV, the expectation would be that you have margins in the 22% range and you're a bit below that. So, can you reconcile some of the factors that are driving that and what the algorithm might look like going forward as you grow the unit volumes?","Jack Hartung","Yeah, David. First of all, we still think that the margin potential at $2.2 million is right around 22%. There are a couple of things that were headwinds during the year. One, we saw some really, really high avocado cost during the summer. That had an impact. And then, we also had carne asada, which, I think, as you know, for most of the quarter, we priced carne asada at just $0.50 above steak and it cost us about $0.35 to $0.40 or so. And we did that intentionally as a transaction builder, but it did have a temporary negative impact on our margin.","Now, during the quarter, we did take a price increase. We increased carne asada another $0.25. We got a $0.75 upcharge and we didn't see any degradation in demand at all. So, we think there is room when we do additional premium offerings like that we can price them at full margin. ","The other thing that's going on, David, that also had what I would call temporary headwinds is, we just started our loyalty program last year. We did a great job of acquiring well over 8 million customers in the program. With that acquisition comes the discounts, and yet we hadn't really monetized that [indiscernible]. So, that has a little bit of an impact on the margin as well.","And then, our delivery business is growing well also. So, all these things are what I would call temporary or cyclical headwinds that we can overcome all of them and we still feel confident that, when we get to $2.2 million, we can generate a 22% margin. We get to $2.3 million, we could generate a 23% margin. We think that potential still exists within the model.","David Tarantino","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.","Please go ahead, Nicole. Perhaps your line is muted on your end.","All right. We'll move to our next question. That's Katie Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Katherine Fogertey","Great. Thank you. I have a couple of questions here. So, first of all, with the \u2013 bringing the super greens on to the menu in January and kind of expanding the lifestyle bowl offerings that you did in 4Q. Can you give us a sense of how your bowl versus burrito mix is changing here and how that is evolving and any kind color that you can give us on labor and margin efficiencies as you move to the bowl away from the burrito? And I have a follow-up.","Brian Niccol","Sure. The reality is continues to show a slight migration to bowls. The thing that's great about that is that's our fastest product on the Chipotle menu and which also provides, I think, the customer the greatest value proposition because of all the customization that they see right in front of them, with all our ingredients right in front of them. So, the good news is the super greens proposition has been well received. It's performing in line with expectations and the customer feedback on it has all been very positive. So, it's perfectly in sync.","And I think we talked about this earlier. One of the things we heard early on from our customer was they would like us to improve our salad and that's what we're doing with the super greens salad mix. ","Katherine Fogertey","Great. That's helpful. And do you have a sense of the mix of the bowls versus burritos?","Brian Niccol","Rule of thumb is two-thirds bowls is the way to think about it. And then, the next piece is burritos followed by tacos. Tacos are small.","Katherine Fogertey","Okay. And then, on the delivery cost side, we're seeing more and more restaurants pass on the delivery cost to the customer and not seeing really any kind of impact to demand. You kind of talked about having some room to move on carne asada and not seeing any traffic hit there. Is that a potential opportunity for this year for you guys to pass on some of the delivery cost to the customer?","Brian Niccol","Yeah. Look, the good news is our value equation is really strong at Chipotle. So, we have room if we find that the economic proposition requires us to pass along some of these costs in the delivery channel. Or if we want to bring out some elevated ingredients. The good news is our value proposition is really strong and the elasticity would allow us to do it. Currently, we like the economics that we have and we're more in the mortgage acquisition mode of using delivery as a tool to get people into our digital ecosystem. So, the good news is we've got the right value proposition that if we wanted to flex it, we could. ","Katherine Fogertey","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Next question, we'll move back to Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.","Nicole Miller Regan","Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay now? ","Brian Niccol","Yeah.","Nicole Miller Regan","I apologize for that earlier. I wanted to ask about how you think about directing the balance sheet. So, when we look back on last year, clearly, was better at every quarter versus where you started guiding the year, what the Street expected. So, maybe some of the things that you didn't do. So, not necessarily an acceleration in development. How do you view that as a use of cash? The share repurchase hasn't necessarily increased and would you use leverage? And then, when might a dividend be appropriate? Thank you.","Jack Hartung","Yeah, Nicole. Let me start with buybacks. We bought, I think, like $168 million during the year, $38 million during the quarter. Our cash balance did grow during the fourth quarter. We actually suspended our buys during the quarter for a while as we got into serious negotiations with the government. Our counsel advised us to suspend that for a while. With this release, we'll be able to get back in the market. And so, I think what you'll see is we will be opportunistic as we look at the share price and we look at our balance sheet just to do buybacks at the appropriate level. In terms of investing in return-generating assets, the best investment we can make is into our Chipotle restaurants. And I would not expect us to see \u2013 to do a stair-step increase in the opening, but you will see an increase over time. Our pipeline is building very, very nicely. And that's going to be a great return for us.","We're also going to dabble in remodel this year as well. So, we've got several hundred restaurants that needed refresh, so that they're more digital forward. So, we're going to experiment with that. And if that goes well, which we're optimistic about, that will be another opportunity for us and I would expect that would be a return generating asset as well.","We from time to time, Nicole, talk about dividends, but it's not really on the radar screen right now. We think that we're more in growth mode and opportunistic buyback of our stock and not dividend generating. That might change in the future, but right now we're not considering a dividend. ","Brian Niccol","The only thing I would add is we have a billion-dollar digital business that continues to grow nicely. And where we see opportunities to invest and continuing to push the digital access in our business, we're going to do that because it makes a lot of sense for both performance today and performance in the future.","Nicole Miller Regan","And just a follow-up, what's the practice on leverage? How do you feel about it? Would you deploy it?","Jack Hartung","No. Nicole, that's financial engineering. That's something that I think is more appropriate for a more mature slow-growing company. So, I would not expect us to put leverage on the balance sheet.","Nicole Miller Regan","Excellent. Thank you.","Jack Hartung","Thanks, Nicole.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Sara Senatore","Thank you. I have one question and one follow-up please. First on just menu innovation, you talked about the super greens performing in line with expectations. But if I think about carne asada, I think it's probably exceeded expectations, which is why you are bringing it back permanently and maybe was, we'd estimate, maybe much of a mid-single-digit mix or lift. So, how should we think about menu innovation going forward? Is that sort of a unique experience and we wouldn't expect to see these kinds of big hits or is it just that you could have more opportunities that would be as meaningful? And then, I have a follow-up please.","Brian Niccol","So, actually, we're really delighted with the carne asada performance. It's evidence that are our stage gate process towards innovation really is working. The thing that was great about carne asada is we stay true to our principles around Food With Integrity and bringing out great quality meat. And when the customers got to try it, they loved it and they came back for more. ","So, we're working right now to figure out, can we get a supply, so that we could make it permanent. And if we can secure that supply, then we probably make it permanent. But we haven't been able to finalize that point yet. So, customers loved it. The performance was great. As we figure out our supply scenario on this, we'll figure out the right time to bring it back. And if we can, we'll figure out a way to make it permanent. ","But regarding the innovation going forward, what I love about this brand is we have the ability to, I think, give people the access to food that they don't get access to anywhere else. And I think that's why we got the response that we did on our lifestyle bowls, the response that we got on carne asada, super greens and that's what we're going to continue to push against. ","And Queso Blanco is the most recent product that's gone through our stage gate process that now we are ready to bring this to market and replace our existing queso. I think we've mentioned we've been working on quesadillas and some beverages. So, the thing that's great is, I think we've got a cadence that's building. And as I mentioned before, we're not going to be moving to a place where we are doing something every 4 to 6 weeks. That's not our business. That's not who we are. You can expect us to do one or two of these initiatives on the menu because it's the right cadence for operators to execute really well and it's also the right cadence I think to give our customers the variety that they're looking for in our business.","So, I love what's happening in our menu. And I love what's happening in our pipeline. And I think this stage gate process is proving to be a very effective tool.","Sara Senatore","Okay, great. Thank you. And then, my follow-up is just, I think in terms of the guidance, mid-single-digit comp. I think, Jack, historically, you've kind of guided to whatever the current run rate of volume that you're not assuming much of an acceleration. But is it safe to say that quarter-to-date you're still seeing kind of low double-digit comps? That would be the implication I think if I...","Jack Hartung","Yeah. The way I would say that, Sara, is that these dollar sales that we saw in the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter, but the comparison is different. So, yeah, the comps are strong. Just keep in mind, we'll have to compare to our 13.4% in the fourth quarter of next year. And then, when we run through the carne asada, we'll lose some check as well. The carne asada added about 150 basis points to the average check, so we'll see that as well. We're optimistic we'll keep all those transactions, but that will have a bit of an impact.","Brian Niccol","The only thing I would add to that is, we mentioned that the brand has got, I think, really excellent momentum. And I tried to highlight that in the script by talking about how we've seen trust and favored brand metrics really move forward. ","And so, I just want to make sure people understand. I think the reason why we had the quarter that we had is not because we had carne asada, and it was just one thing that drove this business. I really do believe our operations are running better than they ever have been. We saw an opportunity to be even better. But our operations are running better. They're running faster. The food is more consistent. We have lower turnover. And I think we've got better execution.","If you think about all the progress on digital and then I think the progress we've made on allocating our marketing dollars, so that it is driving purchases without using discounting as the crutch. And then, obviously, layered on top, we had a nice menu innovation on carne asada. So, I just want to make sure people understand it's not a one trick here on why we've got 8 points of transaction growth and a 13.4% comp as a result of it. ","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles","Great. Thank you. Brian, you mentioned during the quarter an openness to work with other third-party delivery providers beyond the national partnership you have with DoorDash and also the agreement you have in place with Postmates. I'm curious, what would lead you to pursue working with other delivery providers? As well as, does your agreement with DoorDash indicate you would see higher commissions if you were to onboard another delivery partner? And then, I also have a follow-up for Jack.","Brian Niccol","Okay. Yeah, look, I think the reason why I said we're going to be open to it is, at the end of the day, we've got to give access to our customers where they want Chipotle, when they want Chipotle and how they want Chipotle. And I think the delivery channel is proving to be one of those access points. The relationship with DoorDash has been great. Working with Postmates has been great. We'll see how things unfold going forward. But I do think ultimately the delivery marketplace is not going to be an exclusive proposition. I think the delivery marketplace is going to be about giving customers access accordingly. So, we're continuing to talk to all the players. And when the right opportunity presents itself, we'll figure out whether or not we bring on additional players or not. But, yeah, we're open to it. And the real driver of it is we want to deliver on the needs of our customers.","Andrew Charles","Sure. And then, Jack, beyond if you would see a higher commission from DoorDash if you were to onboard another provider, looking at labor, it looks like labor dollars per store growth accelerated quite a bit. Our model is just about 10% growth, which is well in excess of the 4% to 5% labor inflation you called out despite the accelerated digital growth which is obviously more favorable for labor. What do you attribute this acceleration to? Is it the incremental benefits? Is it the greater number of crew members to handle the greater traffic? Just curious, for modeling purposes, how we should think about labor in 2020?","Jack Hartung","Yeah, it's traffic driven. So, if you just take a standard 10% increase in labor when we have 8% \u2013 keep in mind, we have 8% in terms of transactions, but we also had mix which means we're cooking more food as well. So, we only had a 2% price increase. So, the rest is more food, more customers that we're serving. It does take more labor. And so, our labor is more partially fixed, partially variable. Frankly, during the quarter, our labor performed the way that it should have. We saw 60 basis points of leverage even though we had about 140 basis points of inflation and then benefit headwind. So, we had to come up with couple of hundred basis points of leverage based on the price increase and based on the higher transaction.","We also during the fourth quarter \u2013 keep in mind, we opened up a record number of restaurants. And so, that's another piece where, just with that alone, you're going to add labor, not just to staff the 80 restaurants, but we also have to train those folks before the restaurants open. And we tend to have an allocation or allowance for more labor hours early on in the first week or the first several weeks because people are learning and we don't know exactly what the sales are. So, there's a number of things why you see higher labor in the fourth quarter.","Andrew Charles","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","Thanks. And congrats on a great year. Interesting that your digital mix increased by 7 points in that fourth quarter. Your same-store sales growth was obviously a lot higher at over 13%. So, you can see how the new product news is letting you not lean as hard on delivery and digital order growth to drive the comp. Looking into this year, how do you see your growth contribution going forward? You mentioned a new product. But then again, you're also talking about ways to engage that loyalty member. And I have a quick follow-up.","Brian Niccol","Yeah, David. So, the way we're thinking about it is, marketing, combined with our CRM is a real opportunity to grow the business both with new users and existing users. And then, as we think about our digital business, one of the things that I'm really excited about is our order ahead business, as we continue to get people into our digital system, they really see the benefits of, one, joining the rewards program, but, two, just the convenience, the ease of access by using whether it's the website or the app. So, we believe there's going to be continued growth there. ","And then, obviously, I continue to believe that there is more growth just running our restaurants better. As we continue to improve on our throughput, that just basically continues to be a multiply effect, right? It's like, carne asada, the digital business, none of it will be nearly as effective if we don't have strong execution on the basics with our restaurant. So, I feel like every one of these calls, people are always like, what was the one thing and what's the one thing to drive comp going forward. I really continue to believe the strategies that we've outlined all contribute to our ongoing growth model. And we've got lease on \u2013 some will provide more at certain times of the year and others will provide more at other times of the year. But, in the end, that's why we had the year that we had, and that's why I believe we'll continue to perform going forward.","David Palmer","The quick follow-up on that is related to, I think, a conception that going into this year, you're going to be lapping free delivery windows. And you've done those margin dilutive ways to onboard consumers. And I guess the question I would have is, once you have them on board, I think you said 8 million strong, how do you convert them into more digital users? Or you feel like you can maybe have your cake and eat it too with margins and sales as you grow that digital user base? And I'll pass it on.","Brian Niccol","Yeah, yeah. Look, David, obviously, what you just articulated is how we want this to play out where we continue to invest to grow the database. The good news is, I think, going forward, it's going to be more balanced between invest in acquisition as well as kind of driving behavioral changes. And, as our digital business continues to grow, as Chipotlanes become more prevalent, we think there is opportunity for us to become even more efficient in how we provide people that great Chipotle experience.","The one thing I would mention is, Jack said this at the very beginning, the bottom line is, we hold ourselves accountable to make the economic model consistent with what we've been talking about. You get to $2.5 million, we'll have 25% margins. And we think we see a clear sight of path on how that all happens through a combination of initiatives, and then just being really, I think, smart about how we manage the P&L accordingly.","So, it's a great situation to be in where we've invested. And now, we are going to be able to take advantage of those investments in the digital space. But I think it also plays out in a lot of different ways that people access the Chipotle brand. So, obviously, we're very proud of where we are, but I'm really excited about where we're going, is kind of the summary.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Lauren Silberman","Thanks. I wanted to ask about the loyalty program. So, now at the 8.5 million members less than a year after launching, what do you think makes Chipotle different than maybe some of the competitors as it relates to customer acquisition? And thinking about the trajectory of membership growth going forward, any color on kind of when you start to turn on more of the personalized marketing?","Brian Niccol","Yeah. Look, I think, Chipotle is a unique restaurant company. And any time we have found that we provide people the ability to have more engagement or more access, they want to be a part of that. And I think that's why the rewards program has had such quick adoption. I think it's a testament to the fact that we are committed to Food With Integrity, we've got a great value proposition, all the reasons why you love Chipotle. Okay?","Now, the thing that's great is we have 8.5 million customers and the personalization really is just getting started. So, I'm already seeing some of our tactics going to the marketplace. And what's great to see is we're seeing it have an effect on just about every cohort that we're targeting. And we define those cohorts both on purchase frequency as well as, I would call it, lifestyle. ","And so, I think it's going to continue to be something we're going to want to invest to continue to grow. But at the same time, we're now taking that universe and really using it as a smart way to grow the business. And it's a hugely valuable asset and it's an asset we're going to really drive going forward.","Lauren Silberman","Great. Just a follow-up to the digital sales growth. I think there is a perception that the majority is coming from deliveries, but the customers don't see the third-party platforms. Are there opportunities to convert them to the Chipotle digital ecosystem?","Brian Niccol","Yeah. I would tell you that's a little bit of a misconception. The thing that's great is, as we see people come into the digital system, we see really nice gains in our order ahead business. So, in the early days, obviously, delivery was on 8% growth rate, was one of the biggest parts of our digital business. But one of the things I'm really excited about is the progress we're making on the order ahead business.","And delivery is proving to be just a great experience for people that maybe didn't have that occasion with Chipotle in the past. Now, they believe it's convenient, so they can have those occasions with Chipotle, both order ahead as well as delivery. So, it's working nicely as a system between rewards, order ahead, delivery and now the Chipotlane.","Lauren Silberman","Great. Thank you.","Brian Niccol","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Peter Saleh","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the second make line. The second make line is digitized. The second make line is now in all the stores. Digital sales are now approaching 20%. So, are you starting to see some leverage on that second make line? Is there anything noticeable? Any which way that you guys can break out the contribution that you're seeing from our second make line now?","Brian Niccol","Look, I think we're going to be very smart about how we take advantage of that efficiency. Our most important thing right now is we want to give people a great digital experience. That's why we've invested in those digital make lines, we've invested in the \u2013 we're calling that \u2013 the digital portal pickup. ","The thing that's great is, we know the efficiency is there and we're going to be smart about how we implement that efficiency into the business, so that we don't affect our growth and\/or the experience that the customer has.","So, we're delighted that we're closing in on 20%. But that's not the end of this journey. That's just one of the stops on our journey to, I think, a much bigger business than where we are today.","Peter Saleh","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust.","Jake Bartlett","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on throughput. You mentioned an improvement in the peak hour throughput. I think you said 10% or maybe it's 10 seconds. Maybe I misheard. But if you could just remind us what that was and where you are in terms of throughput versus the kind of the low of your throughput. Trying to see how much you've improved since that low and maybe when that low was.","Brian Niccol","Yes. So, the 10% improvement is what I said. But, yeah, I think we talked about this as \u2013 at our peak, we're doing low 30s, mid 30s and the max 15. And unfortunately, that dropped to kind of the low 20s, mid 20s. And what I'm happy to say is, Scott and the team have really put a lot of focus on how do we get back to great throughput. And the more we have stability in the restaurants, the more we have consistency in our KPIs and what we're going to hold our teams accountable for, I think we'll continue to see this metric improve which just provides a better experience for our customer. ","But the way to think about it is we've had about a 10% improvement. And what I'm happy to say is, as we've moved into 2020, we continue to see the improvement. So, this is one of those things that builds on top of itself. And if you were to talk to any of our team members, they would all know throughput is a key pillar as well as having great food, great teams and having those restaurant staffed correctly. So, I'm really optimistic about where operations are going to take this metric going forward.","Jake Bartlett","Great. I think of throughput as a key sales driver, but it also could be a cost savings. Is throughput part of what you talked about in your prepared script around just flow-through \u2013 better flow-through of profits in 2020? Is that going to contribute to kind of keep labor in check?","Brian Niccol","Yeah. It's part of it. The flow-through I'm referring to is kind of where Jack started this conversation in regard to \u2013 look, for every incremental dollar, we expect X% to flow to the bottom line. And then, that's how we hold the model consistent, so that when we do get to $2.5 million, we'll have 25% margins or better. So, it's not just one thing, but obviously that's a key indicator that we're running the restaurants correctly.","You're not running the restaurants correctly if we're not going fast. And so, one thing we do know is a busy restaurant, a restaurant that's running quick is a well-run restaurant. The team members prefer working in that environment and the customers prefer getting their food in that environment. So, all really good stuff.","Jake Bartlett","Great. And then, Jack, last question on G&A. You mentioned this kind of the underlying G&A and the guidance for the first quarter, I think you said $77 million to $80 million, if I got that right. That to me is up \u2013 it looks, versus the first quarter of last year, up about 9%, 10%. Is that the right run rate just in terms of the underlying G&A, that underlying G&A should grow that quickly. I was kind of more under the impression that you could kind of keep a mid-single-digit G&A growth longer-term.","Jack Hartung","I think that's right. Over the long term, I think that's about right. We started the transformation in this move about a year-and-a-half ago. And so, there's a few gaps that we need to fill. And so, that's why we want to make sure you guys saw what we are doing into the first quarter. So, I think more of a mid-single digit-ish in terms of underlying G&A. So, we will grow our G&A at a less than the sales rate, so we can leverage it. So, I think that's correct to think about it long-term.","But keep in mind, as Brian mentioned, we're in the early days of digital. So, some of these resources \u2013 a lot of these resource, in fact, are making sure that we've got the right skill gaps, whether it comes to digital, whether it comes to some of the CRM and things like that. And so, we want to make sure we get ahead of those. But I think over a longer period of time, I think something more in that kind of mid-single-digit as opposed to a high single-digit is probably a good way to think about it.","Jake Bartlett","Okay. And just to be clear. The first quarter should be higher than the rest of the year, should be more in line with the long-term or the whole year is kind of a year of investment?","Jack Hartung","Well, the whole year is going to be up because we're going to hire people and then they're going to be into the base.","Jake Bartlett","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.","Dennis Geiger","Great. Thanks. Brian, you talked about employee benefits and initiatives, kind of how that's been translating into operational excellence. Just kind of wondering if you could talk a bit more about building the talent pool, what that's meant for the quality of restaurants. Looking ahead, in particular, as you \u2013 I don't know if you still frame it as far as a restaurant, et cetera. Just the progress that you've made there on the restaurant pool. ","And then, just going one step further, thinking a little longer term around restaurant development, it feels like this has always kind of been the limiting factor from an employee talent perspective. Just how you're thinking about those benchmarks from a talent perspective to where you can kind of see a step change looking ahead from a store growth perspective? Thanks.","Brian Niccol","Sure, sure. So, look, I'll give you a little bit of example to bring to light the progress that I think we're making on the restaurant. So, I was actually in Denver just a couple of weeks ago. And Denver is one of our older markets. And I was visiting with our team director there, Alfredo Ponce, and he has got just terrific restaurant general managers. And this one young lady who is running one of our restaurants, she's had three consecutive quarters where she hit all the KPIs and her and her entire crew have all gotten bonuses. And she is on her way in the fourth \u2013 the first quarter, but she \u2013 she just walked in there, she's like \u2013 she wanted to show me her AB scorecard. It was all green, it was As everywhere. And the first thing she told me is like we're going to get our fourth quarter in a row of accrued bonus. And every one of those employees had a smile on their face. They were truly energized, truly engaged. And I give that just as one example of what I see as I now travel more and more across the country. Whether you're in Arizona, Boston, New York, we're seeing our team members I think just be more energized, more engaged and just super-proud of making a difference. It's hard to put a value on that.","As part of this process, though, we ask them what does more support look like for you to be successful at Chipotle. And what they came back with is, look, tuition reimbursement is great, but I actually need a debt free program, like I need a program where I don't put myself in a place where I'm behind the eight ball and that's why we came up with the debt free degree program. We also heard loud and clear from a lot of young people mental health is top of mind for not only them, but their family. And so, we brought forward those benefits. So, English as a second language is something also too where people are like, hey, it's great to have a benefit for me, but it would be great if I could have for my whole family. The reason why this is important is we want the employee to feel great about working there, but we want those around them to feel great about them working at Chipotle as well. And I think we're seeing the impact of that. ","And we're going to continue to fine-tune the benefits. We're going to continue fine-tuning the employee value proposition. But my goal and our team's goal is, we want people to believe and experience that when they work at Chipotle, they get to be themselves, they will get to grow professionally and they will get to grow personally. And I think if we do that, we'll continue to attract the right people and we'll get much better outcomes than if we didn't have all these things in place to attract these types of people.","So, it's one of the plays that I'm usually passionate about and it makes you get really excited when you see it happening in our restaurants.","Dennis Geiger","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Thanks very much. First, just on the loyalty and program enhancements, Brian, that you're planning, how much work has been done? Are you ready to do sort of phase two and do more bespoke offers? Or is there more work behind the scenes that you need to do before you can do that? I know it's easier said than done. And when should we expect those more bespoke or personalized offers to start appearing?","Brian Niccol","Yeah, John. Great question. The bespoke or more personalized offers have begun. We're kind of rolling right now with it. So, it's going to be happening all year long, and I think as every week goes by, we're only going to get better at it. And I'm really \u2013 it's nice to see the work that's been done over the last year start to come to fruition in 2020.","John Glass","All right. And then, Jack, just two margin questions. One is, you didn't mention in the labor commentary the cost of the bonus program. Can you just quantify what that may have been? I assume that's entirely variable, right? So, if comps were to moderate, some of that bonus goes away, so we shouldn't worry about labor dollars per store growth. It's going to be relative to comp growth. Is that fair as it relates to that bonus?","Jack Hartung","Yeah. We're not breaking out the dollar amount, John. I would put that into the category of the 4% to 5% inflation. That's the piece where I mentioned we have about 140 basis points of headwind in labor. So, that includes normal wage inflation, includes debt less degrees and includes the bonus program, all these things that Brian mentioned. Those are all in that. And I know that doesn't technically qualify as wage inflation, the way that you might think about it, but these are all things we're doing to make sure that we have the best workforce we can and that we engage them and that we keep them. So, that's all included in that number.","And I wouldn't think of it as 100% variable, John, because there is qualitative figures in there as well. Sure, when sales are good, that means the margin is going to be good. And so, they'll be hitting those metrics, those other metrics as well that aren't as direct. So, I would call it semi-variable. So, generally, it's going to be tougher to earn the bonus. We don't have very strong sales, very strong margins, but it's not 100% variable to sales.","John Glass","Okay. And then, just finally, you mentioned there may be a modest impact to comp on the loyalty program or deferred benefits. What does modest mean? How big could that drag be?","Jack Hartung","We had seen 30 and 40 basis points early last year, John. And as we've seen the program mature a little bit and people have earned their rewards, they're redeeming them and the redemptions are now offsetting the deferrals. And so, it will be, we think, in most quarters, it's going to be less than it was early last year when it was in the 30 basis points, 40 basis points. So, like this past quarter, because we also made a little adjustment on our breakage rate on chips and guac, there was no net impact. And so, I think in the future, it's either going to be very little to no net impact.","John Glass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Chris Carril with RBC. Please go ahead.","Christopher Carril","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, you noted the very strong productivity of recent openings. And I think they were described as the highest in company history. I know you mentioned earlier in the context of investment that we shouldn't expect large accelerations in openings. But given these really strong productivity results, does this potentially shift your thinking incrementally at all on development in the near to medium term?","Brian Niccol","Yeah. So, I think we've been sharing this with you guys is, the economic model and the availability of sites for Chipotle continues to be a huge opportunity. And we increased obviously what we're going to build in 2020, and I think we're going to continue \u2013 you're going to continue to see us I think accelerate that into the future years for two reasons. One, the economics support it, the customers want it. And then, the second key piece is, I think we now have our operations in a place where we're developing leaders to be ready to take over those restaurants. So, we want to be smart about how we continue to move forward on adding new units. The good news is the returns continue to be great. Our operations are running better. Our people development is in a much better place, and I think it sets the stage for us nicely to continue to grow from where we are right now. So, I see a future where we could get back to the 200 plus restaurants. It's just not going to happen this year.","Christopher Carril","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.","Brian Niccol","All right. Thanks. And thanks, everybody, for taking the time. Obviously, very proud of Chipotle for delivering what was a great 2019. I think we touched on each of our key strategies. ","The thing I just want to emphasize, everybody, is I believe you don't get these results without developing the right culture and the right people and I think that's happening in all facets of our business, whether it's operations, marketing, digital, HR, public affairs.","I do believe we are building out a team that has world-class leaders in all aspects of this company, and those leaders are building a strong culture that's focused on cultivating a better world and developing future leaders, so that these strategies that I believe have a tremendous runway of growth can be executed flawlessly.","So, I do want to say thank you to everybody for a terrific 2019. But as we mentioned earlier, these strategies are not just about 2019. They're about 2020 and well beyond. And we're confident Chipotle is going to continue to be a unique brand that provides a unique experience that will continue to drive and attract great people and a great culture. ","So, thanks for listening and we'll talk to you in a quarter. Thanks.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

We are beginning to emerge from the most difficult year in our history and are seeing many reasons to be optimistic that we are headed in the right direction to restore our business to a place our many shareholders will be proud of. But please note that while we are on the road to recovery, we're not satisfied and we'll continue to work extremely hard to make the necessary adjustments necessary to restore our business and deliver results as quickly as possible.","From early this year, we have recovered more than 16 points of sales comp and we've recovered 20 points of traffic comp, and we're making steady progress toward further recovery. During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $1.04 billion, down 15% from last year on a comparable restaurant sales decline of 21.9%. During the third quarter, we opened 55 new restaurants, bringing our total number of restaurants to 2,178. And we generated diluted earnings per share of $0.27, which includes a negative $0.29 impact related to asset impairment.","Since our recovery began, we have seen a gradually improving outlook for sales and earnings and fully expect that those trends will continue. 2016 will be marked as a significant reinvestment year as we continue to work to make Chipotle a stronger company in the wake of last year's events. Looking forward to 2017, and based on current trends, we believe that we will produce diluted earnings of $10 per share on same-store sales growth in the high single-digits for 2017. We believe that the full year 2017, we can generate restaurant-level operating margins of 20% and save more than $100 million in capital and operating expenses combined.","To achieve these results, we must be steadfast in executing our recovery plan which remains the primary focus of everybody at Chipotle. Specifically, we're focused on delivering a safe and extraordinary guest experience in every restaurant, restoring trust and building sales, restoring our economic model and enhancing the guest experience through innovation. Monty, Mark and Jack will provide additional detail on some of these priority areas, but right now I'd like to speak to the last point which is enhancing the guest experience.","Two important enhancements to the customer experience are menu innovation and digital ordering. We are actively exploring ways to enhance the guest experience by offering new additions to our menu. We believe that this is a good way to entice infrequent or lapsed customers to return as well as a way to increase sales. Any time we consider new menu items, it's important to us that they remain consistent with our food culture, both in terms of the ingredients we use and how the new items are prepared.","A great example of this is chorizo, which we launched nationwide earlier this month. Chorizo now accounts for roughly 7% of entree sales around the country. Feedback from customers has been extremely positive and we plan to ramp up our advertising in the fourth quarter to support chorizo by encouraging our customers to come in and try it. We're also currently testing two different desserts and we hope to select one to offer in the near future. We believe that there's an opportunity to excite current customers and to attract new customers through thoughtful menu development and we're exploring these options.","We're also moving aggressively to make digital ordering more appealing to our customers and more efficient for our restaurants. Nearly all of our restaurants have a second make-line in the back of the restaurant where we fulfill digital, fax, and catering orders. By optimizing the use and design of these second make-lines, we envision a time when digital ordering could account for a much larger percentage of sales than the 6% it represents today. Maximizing our digital sales requires changes both to the second make-line itself, and to the ways by which our customers place digital orders.","Our original second make-line resembles the service line our customers see in the front of the house, though scaled down and it takes up less space. The new line is a much more ergonomic and efficient design, configured such that less labor will be required to produce higher sales volumes, and does so more quickly. The new line incorporates an advanced queuing system that takes advantage of a heads-up digital display, which allows our crews to assemble orders without distraction. The benefits of these new lines will be enormous, including faster, more efficient assembly of orders, reduced errors and more consistent portion sizes for our customers; all of which we believe will help us drive increased sales volumes.","After some additional testing is complete, we will begin to selectively add these new digitally enabled lines to some of our highest volume markets where it can best enhance our out-of-store ordering experience. It's important to note, however, that all of our original second make-lines are still able to take advantage of enhanced digital ordering options, even though they don't have the advanced indicating system of the digitally-enabled lines. Our crews in these restaurants will work from paper tickets until their restaurants are upgraded with the new system. To stimulate additional use of these second lines, we're introducing a new mobile optimized ordering site that provides an alternative to our iOS and Android ordering apps. Mark will talk more about this new ordering option later in the call, but the new site makes ordering and paying for digital orders easier than ever.","In addition to our new ordering site, we are testing a tablet based ordering option which allows customers to avoid the line and order in restaurant on available tablets and get their order made from the second make-line in the back of the house. This tablet-based ordering system will initially be tested in a series of restaurants that are equipped with the new make-line. When the full system is realized, the second make-line has the potential to deliver as much as 50% of the sales from some locations including digital orders from all sources, including catering and delivery services.","Finally, we fully impaired the assets related to ShopHouse, which totaled approximately $14.5 million on a pre-taxes basis. We opened the first ShopHouse in 2011. And currently operate 15 ShopHouse restaurants in three separate markets. ShopHouse is managed by a small independent team, which was tasked with creating a compelling brand, which could develop into a compelling growth strategy and enhance long-term shareholder value. We're proud of the ShopHouse team, the delicious food they've created and the excellent customer service they've delivered. But after operating in three distinct markets, and opening in a variety of trade areas, ShopHouse simply has not demonstrated the ability to support an attractive unit economic model. As a result, we have decided not to invest further in developing or growing the ShopHouse brand and will pursue strategic alternatives.","Although the exotic ShopHouse cuisine was not able to attract sufficient customer loyalty and visit frequency to make it a viable growth strategy for us, we continue to believe that our approach to food, people and unit economics with the right cuisine, with the right concept, can lead to a compelling growth strategy. And we are optimistic that our other growth seeds, serving pizza and soon burgers, both of which have broad customer appeal can become further growth strategies for us. While this was not an easy decision, we trust in our overall growth seed approach where we can innovate and develop new concepts, with a relatively small capital investment and little or no distraction to the Chipotle business. And we'll only invest additional resources, both time and money into growth seeds that show the potential to become meaningful growth vehicle, and a compelling way to enhance shareholder value.","We continue to believe that we have an extraordinary potential and are fully confident in our ability to achieve it. Monty, Mark and Jack will talk in greater detail about our plans to realize our potential and build greater shareholder value.","I'll now turn the call over to Monty.","Montgomery F. Moran - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thank you, Steve.","Achieving a full recovery means having all of our restaurants at their very best in terms of serving delicious, safe food and providing an excellent restaurant experience while continuing to grow sales. As we move forward with our recovery plans, the guest experience remains our greatest area of focus. Providing an excellent guest experience starts with serving food that's always safe and delicious. While many of our enhanced food safety efforts occur outside the restaurants in the supply and distribution network and with enhanced technology, we also rely on strong restaurant teams and field leaders to carry out additional elements of our food safety program in the restaurant.","Ensuring that we execute these procedures in our restaurants has been our top priority. To accomplish this, we have significantly expanded training, food safety inspections and third-party and internal audits in our restaurant. These audits help us identify opportunities for improvement and ensure that all of the programs we've put in place are being executed consistently and properly. To further these efforts and to continuously improve food safety in our restaurants and supply chain, we've also established an independent Food Safety Advisory Council made up of some of the country's foremost experts in food safety and food microbiology. This advisory council alongside Dr. Jim Marsden, our Executive Director of Food Safety, is charged with continuously reviewing our food safety programs and looking for opportunities to strengthen them even more.","This quarter we shared some key points about our enhanced food safety program with our customers through a PR campaign aimed at highlighting eight key areas of advancement that we made. The campaign included full page ads in newspapers, as well as online and social media advertising in addition to print and video materials of Steve describing why our food safety changes are so effective. The campaign was very well received and it was effective in communicating the comprehensive steps we've taken. Details surrounding each of these programs continue to be available for you to see on our website.","At the same time, we are keenly aware that safe food alone will not bring people into our restaurants. Instead, they come for delicious food and an excellent guest experience. This is why our restaurant teams are focused on delivering great-tasting food and excellent customer service in clean, friendly restaurants. This starts with our commitment to serving the best tasting food we can, food that is made with ingredients that are raised with respect to the environment, animals and the people that produce them. And we continue to look for ways to improve the quality of the food we serve, including our quest for better tortillas made with no artificial additives or preservatives, a promise we made last year and are close to fulfilling.","So, as we work to rebuild our company and strengthen our brand, it is critical that our entire organization is focused on those things that will most powerfully delight our guests and speed our recovery. For this reason, we used this year's All Managers' Conference as a time to articulate to our field leaders and managers three areas of focus that are in their control. First, providing an excellent guest experience; second, marketing their individual restaurants, and third, restoring and protecting our unit economic model. Our officer team asked our managers to first train the fundamentals of excellent operations so that they could then proceed on the path to restauranteur. Our relentless focus on the most important things and implementing them exceptionally well is what has always made Chipotle great and we know that to ensure our sales recovery, we have to do better than ever to win our customers back.","Also, great throughput is a key part of the guest experience at Chipotle and one of our key competitive advantages. To do it well requires constant training and focus. During the last year, where we made implementations of our new food safety program the highest priority, some of our restaurant teams have lost some of the throughput skills that they had developed before the crisis. And with high turnover at the crew level, it's even more important that we continue to emphasize and train the skills needed to deliver fast throughput, including the four pillars of throughput.","Of course a primary reason our throughput slowed was that our sales slowed after the crisis. But throughput still can be and will be faster as our restaurant teams commit to drive this critical aspect of an excellent guest experience. Additionally, we are emphasizing the proper use of the second make-line with our field teams to enable the teams on the front line to take great care of the guests in front of them. This will be even more important as we layer in some of the technology that Steve spoke about, which will revolutionize our use of the second way of serving our guests.","Our initiatives surrounding catering and technology adoption for mobile and online ordering, round out the makings of an excellent customer experience and will allow for further sales recovery and future growth. Our Restaurateur program remains central to our ability to continue to produce the leaders we need to accomplish our mission and guide our restaurants through the sales recovery. This program has allowed us the ability to relocate some of our best operational leaders in order to establish better uniformity of operations around the country.","Specifically, in our fast-growing and high-volume northeast region, which includes New York and New England, we were not satisfied with our guest experience in terms of throughput and dining room cleanliness. By relocating some of our strongest executive leaders directly into these markets, we are now confident that they'll quickly return these restaurants to the operational excellence that we and our customers have grown to expect. These leadership changes include the relocation of an executive regional director and an executive team director, as well as the addition of five team directors. We have confidence that our newly strengthened northeast team will provide much needed support to our general managers and quickly and dramatically improve the guest experience.","Over the last four years, we've added many field leaders to our ranks to be sure that we have the right ratios of restaurants per leader to carry out our mission. I have met with all of our field executives since then and I'm confident that they're all clear on our priorities and that they are the right people to help us achieve our mission. Prior to last year's issues, Chipotle had the strongest economic model in the industry. Of course, this model has been weakened due to lower sales volumes that we've seen this year. While it's critical to fully restore sales volumes and keep improving them from there, we also know that we need to improve our economic model now so that we can provide healthy returns even at lower volumes.","Key to restoring our business model is making sure that we are being as efficient as we can with our financial resources, but doing so without compromising the strength of our support teams and field leadership. We are using this crisis as an opportunity to take a critical and disciplined look at how we manage our financial resources and we've established a goal of saving $100 million across operational, G&A and CapEx expenditures.","These cost savings will not detract from the customer experience. Instead, we're finding these savings in a number of areas, including disciplined staffing and support departments in field leadership, better business terms with suppliers, operational efficiencies and new restaurant designs that remain true to our brand, but have lower investment costs. This more disciplined approach to managing expenses will allow us to strengthen our economic model to the benefit of shareholders while not compromising our ability to deliver an excellent customer experience.","Finally, we continue to believe that expanding Chipotle in Europe holds a lot of promise for our future, but we know that to best ensure our success there, we need to provide the area with more strategic attention. For this reason, we recently hired, as managing director in Europe, Jim Slater, a proven industry leader, who ran successful operations for Costa Coffee and led Costa to become the number one coffee brand in the UK. Jim will be working to develop our European markets into an investable growth strategy. We're excited to have Jim on board leading our European team and together they'll work to determine the best strategy for our continued development in Europe.","Through all of these initiatives, we're confident that the plan we have in place to drive our recovery, is the right plan and we know that we have proven leaders throughout this company who can inspire a culture of excellence and help lead the way to recovery. I'm confident that through our progress towards providing a better guest experience all of the time, increasing sales through marketing and strengthening our unit economic model, we will dramatically improve returns for our shareholders in the months and years ahead.","I'll now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Monty. I'm very glad to be back and I'm eager to share with all of you some of the important work that we're doing to bring customers back and restore our brand image. But first, I want to apologize to everyone for recent events in my personal life. I'm sorry that I caused a distraction for the company and I want you all to know that I've put this behind me, learned from it and returned to my role in early September, excited and with a renewed focus and determination to help drive Chipotle's recovery. I want to thank you all for your support and forgiveness, which has meant a great deal to me.","Today, I'm going to recap the marketing activities from Q3 and then I'm going to talk about several important breakthroughs with regard to customer data, technology and restaurant design before reviewing development expectations. During the quarter, we successfully concluded the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program, designed to restore the frequency of our most loyal customers. In all, we had just under 6 million participants with more than 2.5 million of those earning rewards in the program. We issued 340,000 super rewards for customers who maintained higher frequency levels, including more than 75,000 Catering for 20 rewards. We are excited by the potential positive brand impact of 75,000 catering parties over the coming six months.","Throughout the course of the promotion, we saw increased transaction and frequency levels. But most important, we have nearly returned to pre-crisis levels among our most loyal customers. After the completion of the program, we anticipated traffic to fall slightly, but we have instead seen our improved sales levels generally continue to hold, which is very encouraging.","During the quarter, we ran three marketing campaigns each with different but complementary objectives. The first was a food safety advancements campaign Monty referred to, which was designed to communicate what we've done to ensure the safety of our food. The campaign was broad reaching, with more than 90 million impressions. Lapsed customers engaged more than any others with the video component of the campaign. Results of the campaign are positive and we will continue to communicate the benefits of our food safety program so that every customer can rest assured that our food is as safe as possible.","The second campaign surrounded our Love Story, animated short film, which was distributed through digital media, social channels and in movie theaters across the country. The film has been viewed more than 60 million times and has proven to be highly effective at building trust in the Chipotle brand. The campaign also included the Love Story game, which challenges players to match fresh ingredients while avoiding fake ones. The game launched earlier this month and quickly surpassed the initial results of our popular Friend or Faux online game from the summer of 2015. Millions of people have played the Love Story game and more than 3 million BOGO rewards have been earned by playing the game. More than 35% of those have already been redeemed.","The third campaign running during Q3 was the Ingredients Reign campaign which is designed to increase visits to Chipotle and build brand's trust by focusing on the high quality of our delicious ingredients. Ingredients Reign is running across nearly all media channels including outdoor, radio, print, digital, social and theater. Both Love Story and Ingredients Reign's campaigns exceeded our expectations, for this reason both campaigns have been extended to run through much of the rest of the year.","Finally, with regard to Q3, I'd like to provide an update on our latest consumer research. Admiration scores and serves healthy and nutritious food attributes have nearly returned to pre-crisis levels. Agreements that we have appropriately addressed the food safety issues increased to 90%. Sentiment on social media is increasingly positive and press mentions were 80% positive last month. Both are at or near pre-crisis levels. However, considerations still lags pre-crisis levels by more than 10%, though it is up slightly for the quarter.","Moving on to Q4 and beyond, we will be leveraging significant improvements in our customer data capabilities along with a shift in marketing strategy to aggressively target new and lapsed customers. By combining transactional information with other customer data, we are now able to identify more than half of our customers and reach them with specific offers and tailored messages. This important breakthrough not only allows us to target messages and offers to current and lapsed customers, but it also allows us to accurately measure the effectiveness of those efforts by tracking return visits. We have already delivered two targeted campaigns using this data and we are continuing to refine our programs in real-time. But this new customer data has implications well beyond more targeted and measurable marketing. The data allows us to very accurately measure customer frequency and details about their orders and behavior.","For example, using this data, we now know that during the last six months, we saw nearly 30 million new customers with Chipotle. These new customers, or customers who we have not seen since before the food safety events of last year, in fact transactions from these customers accounted for nearly half of all transactions over the last six months. Additionally, we know how many of these customers returned to Chipotle for additional visits and how many of them became regular customers. When combined with our marketing and advertising efforts, this detailed view into frequency and behavior allows us to evaluate the return on various marketing and promotional activities.","Beyond customer data, we have also now begun to benefit from the strengthening of our technology infrastructure. In just a matter of days, we are launching a new online ordering experience that makes ordering and paying for Chipotle from any mobile device easier and faster. This mobile-optimized website works on any recent, web-enabled device and it requires no app download. The new ordering experience offers a beautiful and intuitive way to order from Chipotle. This new ordering experience is in addition to our existing apps for iOS and Android that currently have a combined user base of more than 2.6 million people.","Additionally, our test of smarter pick-up times has concluded and we are in the process of rolling this technology out nationwide. Smarter pick-up times allow us to adjust the wait time between order placement and pick-up times based on the demand and capacity of a given restaurant at a given time. This means that the customer is always presented with the shortest possible time between order placement and pick-up. Smarter pick-up times works with our iOS and Android apps as well as our new online ordering, and when combined with the advanced second make-line, Steve described earlier, has significant potential to increase our online ordering volumes and improve the customer experience. We expect smarter pick-up times will be rolled out nationwide by January.","Recent advancements in our technology infrastructure are also going to have a significant impact on the customer experience of ordering catering at Chipotle. Next month, we will enable online ordering and payment for catering which previously was only available via phone and required in-store payment. The ability to order and pay for catering online will dramatically improve the customer experience while simultaneously decreasing our call center costs. The next step with catering is to offer delivery, and tests are currently underway. Both catering and mobile ordering will receive significant marketing support during Q4, a time of year where we typically see an increase in catering volume ahead of the holiday season.","We have also been supporting the national roll-out of chorizo, and we're excited by the results. As Steve mentioned, chorizo currently accounts for about 7% of sales, and customer response has been very positive. 84% of customers who tried chorizo like it, and 70% of those who tried it say that chorizo increases their desire to visit Chipotle. And 77% say that the new offering makes them feel more favorably towards Chipotle. Because of these strong results, we plan to increase the reach of our chorizo advertising campaign by more than 400%.","Next, I'd like to talk about television advertising and the test that's currently underway. We recognize the need for wide-reaching efforts to invite new customers to Chipotle. The fact that nearly 30 million new or lapsed customers visited Chipotle over the last six months shows that customers are responding to our advertising and promotional efforts. But in order to accelerate that momentum, we are considering national television advertising. Because our Ingredients Reign campaign tested positively in terms of customer perception and brand trust, we are running a 30-second ad from that campaign in multiple test markets. If the test reveals that television advertising delivers the results we want, we may begin to integrate national television buys into our advertising campaigns.","You may also be aware that we are currently undertaking a review of advertising agencies. While we are pleased with our current agency partners, we have developed a robust new marketing strategy for 2017, and in order to ensure that we have the absolute best creative work on that strategy, we are reviewing potential new partners. The review will be complete by the end of the year and in time for the launch of a new campaign in the spring of 2017.","Going forward, we believe that there will be opportunities to incorporate new menu items into our overall marketing. We have been encouraged by the response we have seen with chorizo and see an opportunity to build excitement among existing customers and attract new customers through the thoughtful addition of menu items that are consistent with our brand. Any new menu item will be accompanied by extensive advertising campaigns designed not only to tout the new menu additions, but to excite customers about coming into Chipotle.","Finally, I'd like to report on the successful launch of a new restaurant design that has been in development for more than a year. The new design is an evolution of the current design, with improvements in lighting, acoustics, seating, customer flow and the presentation of our kitchen. Additionally, the new design is more cost-effective with an average cost of $760,000, which is about $40,000 less expensive than our current restaurant design. We also anticipate a reduction in maintenance and repair as a result of this new design. This new restaurant design is already open in certain locations and under construction in several others. We expect that more than 50 new locations in 2017 will utilize this design and even more than that, will benefit from some aspects of the new design.","Our new restaurants have been performing at approximately 73% of our comp restaurant volumes, slightly lower than pre-crisis levels. But in areas where we have increased marketing of our new restaurant openings, that performance has improved, and we are closing the gap of those pre-crisis levels. In total, we are planning to open between 195 new restaurants and 210 new restaurants in 2017. As our returns on new restaurants have compressed this year, along with our margins, we've lowered the number of restaurants we plan to open. We will continue to focus on opening up the best potential sites that combine the lower risk profile with the highest possible returns. And even with our lower sales levels in 2016, we are not seeing a marked increase in cannibalization from opening new restaurants, which remains at less than 1% nationally.","Most important, we view this reduction in new restaurant openings as temporary. Our long-term development pipeline remains robust, and with our new lower cost restaurant design, we are setting our new restaurants up to achieve even higher levels of return on investment. We strongly believe that the ultimate potential for Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. could total 5,000.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. When the year began, we described 2016 as a year where we will make significant investments to ensure our food is safe and encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. We knew these significant investments would put additional pressure on our margins in the form of elevated food costs, higher advertising and promotion costs, and higher labor costs to serve our returning customers. We intentionally did not emphasize restaurant efficiencies and even encouraged extra staffing in our restaurants during promotion period because we did not want to risk trading a few points of margin on the P&L in return for disappointing a customer, who visits an understaffed restaurant.","The sales decline, combined with these investments and inefficiencies, have resulted in significant declines to our margins. As we near the end of 2016 and we begin to look ahead to 2017, we'll continue to do all we can to restore customer trust and recover customer visits. We also are committed to taking important steps to restore our economic model. With the strategies you've heard Steve, Monty, and Mark talk about, we believe we can deliver comps in the high single-digit range for the full year in 2017. Of course, we hope these strategies will deliver an even greater sales increase.","But we believe this comp projection represents a stretch, yet responsible goal. With a focus on delivering greater efficiencies in our restaurants, identifying cost savings in everything we buy in our restaurants and in our offices, supporting our growing restaurant base with flat G&A, and beginning to normalize our promotion and advertising, we expect to deliver a restaurant level margin of 20% and an EPS of $10 in 2017.","While these projected results do not fully restore our economic model, it's an important step in the right direction. We continue to believe we can, over time, fully recover our restaurant margins as sales recover. From the unit economic standpoint, these projected results would lead to an average restaurant volume of around $2 million and restaurant ROI of around 50%. And the return potential for new stores is even greater as we expect the average new store investment to decline to around $760,000 in 2017.","I'll talk more about what to expect in 2017 and in Q4, but now let me recap our results for the third quarter. During the third quarter, we reported sales of $1.04 billion, a 15% decrease from the third quarter of 2015. Our reported sales were reduced by $11.5 million because of deferred revenue related to our summer Chiptopia promotion. As a reminder, Chiptopia ended on September 30 and we recorded deferred revenues associated with rewards earned but not yet redeemed. These rewards can be redeemed or will expire over the next six months and the deferred revenue will be recognized over this period. As a result, we reported a negative same-store sales comp of negative 21.9%, which included a negative 0.8% impact from the revenue deferral.","The Q3 comp is comprised of July down 23.8% and that includes 100 basis points from the revenue deferral; August was down 21.7%, which includes 70 basis points from the revenue deferral; and September was down 20.1% which includes 70 basis points from the deferral. And while October comps for the first two weeks are affected by Hurricane Matthew and were down about 21%, for the past 10 days have recovered and normalized, and we're down around 19%. But we're not satisfied, we're still being down around 19%. We continue to see small, but steady progress month-after-month. As a side note, July had improved to declines in the 21% range in the weeks before our Q2 earnings report, but then was impacted by a negative month end trading day effect, plus comparing to our Friends and \u2013 Friends or Faux BOGO from 2015 which ran the last week of July and into early August, and was also impacted by the Chiptopia revenue deferral.","Our traffic trends have also suddenly improved and were down 15.2% overall in the quarter compared to down 19.6% in June. Transactions improved to 13.4% in September and most recently are running down 14% in the past week or so. Chiptopia helped drive the sales and transaction improvement in the quarter, as our most loyal customers returned to their historic frequency pattern, as Mark mentioned.","On a regional basis, we continue to see wide variances in the progress of the recovery. With comp sales in the Midwest and middle regions of the country, down in the 17% range in September outperforming the coastal areas, especially in the Pacific coast in the northeast, which are down closer to the 24% to 25% range in September. From a transaction standpoint, there are several markets, including Kansas City, Chicago, Denver and Minneapolis where traffic is now down only in the high single-digits. We know that restoring customer habits takes time and to help ensure that renewed habits established during Chiptopia for our most loyal customers continue to hold, A Love Story campaign that Mark mentioned was launched this month.","Although hard to estimate customers' behavior in October from only a few weeks of data, so far our high frequency customers are continuing to visit this month with similar frequency to September.","Restaurant level margin was 14.1%, down from 15.5% in the second quarter of this year. The deferred revenue related to Chiptopia negatively impacted our restaurant level margin by nearly 100 basis points, so our underlying margin was 15.1%. The remaining decline from Q2's margin of 15.5% is due to higher marketing and promo costs related to Chiptopia and higher food cost. Food costs were 35.1% of sales but excluding the effect of the deferred revenue, underlying food cost was 34.7%. This represents a sequential increase from Q2 of 50 basis points primarily due to much higher cost for avocados.","Avocado supply declined during the summer. We began to experience higher pricing. Although we had hoped that this would be a temporary spike, in recent weeks though, supply has become even tighter and pricing has become much more volatile than expected. In fact, we've seen that some competitors recently have posted signs on their doors saying they are out of avocados altogether.","We have remained in supply of avocados, but case pricing has risen from an average of about $30 per case during the first half of the year to a case pricing approaching $80 this month. Because of these higher avocado prices, food costs will remain above 35% in Q4 before seeing relief in early 2017.","Our labor costs for the quarter were 27.6% of sales, up from 22.2% of sales last year. Without the revenue deferral, labor costs were 27.3% of sales. Sales deleverage accounted for approximately 300 basis points and the remaining increase relates to inflation and additional labor related to Chiptopia and other promotions.","Underlying wage inflation was in the 5% to 6% range in the quarter. Labor was about $9 million higher in Q3 versus Q2 this year to support higher sales levels as our transaction trends continued to improve. We also had increased labor as we returned to prepping produce inside of the restaurants. And we also had increased labor with the higher promo level activity of Chiptopia. In prior years, total labor dollars had been relatively flat from the second quarter to the third quarter.","Other operating expenses as a percent of sales were 16% during the quarter, an increase from 11.1% last year. About 290 basis points of the year-over-year increase is due to sales deleverage.","Marketing and promo expenses combined were 4.8% of sales during the quarter, which is double the rate of marketing and promo from the prior year, and it was 50 basis points higher than Q2 due to Chiptopia.","In Q4, we anticipate our marketing and promo will remain at about the same level as we test TV in a few markets. Also, as we invest in ad support in Chorizo, and as the Chiptopia earned rewards are redeemed and expensed in our promo line.","G&A costs for the quarter were $78.4 million, or 7.6% as a percent of sales. Underlying G&A, excluding stock comps was $61.9 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we held our bi-annual All Manager Conference which totaled about $10 million, and $8 million of that was expensed in the third quarter.","As a reminder, this conference will not be held in 2017, although we traditionally hold a smaller field leadership conference, which we expect would cost between $1 million and $2 million.","Excluding this year's AMC, our G&A was flat year-to-date on a total dollar basis compared to 2015, despite supporting an additional 247 new restaurants opened over the past year.","We froze our support head count early in the summer and have been actively prioritizing where we invest our support to ensure that we're investing in providing an excellent guest experience and recovering sales. As we look ahead to 2017, we're planning to continue to keep our underlying G&A expenses, before stock comp, flat compared to 2016, and lower on a percent of sales basis, despite growing our restaurant base by another 200 restaurants.","For the full year 2016, we estimate our effective tax rate will be 38.2%, in line with 2015. The full year 2016 estimated effective tax rate benefited from additional federal tax credits earned and a tax benefit from previously earned California state tax credit that we now estimate will be realized, and they were offset by higher estimated state tax rates.","We currently anticipate the full year 2017 effective tax rate will be 39.5% and this higher expected rate for 2017 does not include the benefit of the previously mentioned tax credits related to prior year.","Third quarter net income was $7.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.27. This included the negative impact of $0.23, related to revenue deferral and a negative impact of $0.29 for the impairment of ShopHouse.","Before these adjustments, Q3 EPS was $0.79 or $0.08 lower than Q2 of this year due to the AMC costs, the cost of Chiptopia, and higher avocado costs.","As of September 30, we maintained $609.8 million of cash and investments. During the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $101 million and generated free cash flow of $36 million.","We also repurchased $70.3 million of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $409 per share. Over the life of our share repurchase program, we've repurchased $1.9 billion of our stock at an average price of $289 per share.","We'll continue to manage our balance sheet to invest in our sales recovery, grow our business, and opportunistically return cash to shareholders via share repurchases.","Recently our Board of Directors approved an additional $100 million of repurchase authorization. And as of yesterday's close, and including the additional approval, we now have $154.6 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","Looking ahead to Q4, we will begin to compare against last year's comp of negative 14.6%. So of course our comp will improve against that soft comparison and will likely be in the negative low single-digits.","Margins are expected to remain in the mid-teens, as the benefit of a continued, steady sales recovery and a reversal of the deferred revenue from Q3 will be offset by Q4 having seasonally lower average daily sales.","G&A will be about $10 million lower than Q3 because of the AMC expense not recurring and slightly lower stock comp. And we believe EPS will improve to around $1 per share. Avocado pricing is the big wildcard as every $10 per case price movement up or down will impact the EPS by $0.17.","As I mentioned earlier, 2016 has been a year of significant investment in food safety and restoring customer trust and recovering customer visits. It has been a difficult year in terms of margins and earnings driven by lower sales including related deleverage and the impact from these significant investments. We will continue to work harder to recover our sales, shifting our strategy from giveaways, discounts and rewards to new menu items, technology-driven convenience, better operations including faster throughput, and more aggressive brand marketing, including TV. We know that fully restoring our previously industry-leading economic model depends on fully recovering our sales. We feel confident that we have the teams in place to execute our strategies in 2017 and achieve a high single-digit comp sales increase, a 20% restaurant-level margin, and a $10 EPS.","Our comp target will not be an easy hurdle to meet, and of course, we are not in complete control of it. But we are in control of how we manage our restaurants, and we are in control of how we manage our expenses both in the restaurants and with our support G&A. To earn a full year 2017 target of 20% restaurant-level operating margin, we need to earn about 50 basis points of additional margin versus the current underlying run rate of about 15%. We will recover this 500 basis points in several ways.","First, by effective scheduling of our crews to ensure we have the right staff at the right times to deliver an excellent guest experience. But also to ensure we're not ever overstaffed, especially during low sales periods. We can manage our food costs more effectively by reducing waste by ordering, prepping and cooking the correct quantities throughout the day. By cooking to ideal temperatures which not only makes our food taste better, it also results in avoiding unnecessarily \u2013 unnecessary yield loss. We can also more effectively manage smaller but important restaurant costs such as repairs and maintenance and kitchen supplies which has grown faster than sales in recent years.","We have invested heavily in training our field leaders recently to effectively manage the business culture in the restaurants they oversee. These field leaders spent two full days in what we have called a Business Boot Camp and they have been training their GMs and reinforcing how to create an excellent guest experience, while effectively managing their P&L. We also expect promo costs, which are in other operating costs, will normalize in 2017 as we reduce reliance on giveaways and discounts. And marketing will either normalize or will remain at elevated levels in support of efforts such as TV advertising, which we would expect will result in higher sales and create leverage on the rest of the P&L.","In addition, we have an internal goal of saving at least $100 million in recurring annual costs. This includes a review of everything we buy, both in the restaurants and in our offices. It also includes capital expenditures including the new, more efficient restaurant design Mark mentioned which will reduce our investment costs from over $800,000 to around $750,000 in 2017, a savings of nearly $2,000 \u2013 I'm sorry, savings of nearly $10 million in 2017 alone.","As I mentioned previously, we plan to keep our underlying G&A costs before stock comps flat from 2016 to 2017. In dollar terms, that would result in G&A before stock comp of around $220 million in 2017. We chose not to fill about 100 staff positions this year which were vacated during the turnover and not refilled but were approved in 2015, but were unfilled head count adds, all of which will save around $10 million annually and will help our underlying G&A dollars remain at the current level. Our teams are effectively supporting our restaurants by stretching the ratios a bit and focusing only on those activities that maintain safer food, lead to a better guest experience, that grow sales or strengthen our economic model.","We increased our field support significantly over the past three years and have nearly the lowest ratio of stores per field support staff than we've had in 10 years. We currently have nearly 300 field leaders, which include the area managers, team leader, and apprentice team lead. So even as we build 200 new restaurants on average, the field leader ratio will increase by less than one restaurant per field leader in 2017. Our restaurant teams and support teams are responding well to the challenge of more effectively managing costs and are energized by helping us restore our business.","As we challenge our restaurant managers at the AMC, one of our restaurateurs, Philip Esposito, from our Newbury Park restaurant in California reached out to me the very day after the conference with an idea to simplify some our back-office functions. His idea affects every restaurant and will save us more than $1 million across the entire company. And I've seen similar commitment throughout the company in our restaurants and in our offices to be more disciplined and more discerning with every dollar we spend. And everyone feels ownership to do their part to help strengthen our economic model while we work to bring our customers back. We're confident that the approach we're taking will help restore our margin and our earnings capabilities without taking away from the customer experience.","In fact, the techniques our field leaders are teaching will result in scheduling and deploying the restaurant teams to deliver the best experience and the most delicious, safest food possible which also leads to a better financial result. These efforts will allow us to generate respectable results in 2017, but more importantly, we believe we will ultimately emerge from this challenge stronger than ever as our cost structure will be leaner, we will be more focused than ever, and our skill levels throughout the company will be sharper. And our economic model with sales fully restored will be stronger than ever.","Thanks for your time today. We'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to our first question from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. Steve, I just have a general question on the overall operating approach going forward. One of the hallmarks of the Chipotle business is how simple you've kept the operations and how focused you've been on delivering high quality. And now we're hearing that you're going to shift the focus a bit towards menu innovation and perhaps traditional marketing tactics or strategies. So just wondering why you think that shift is needed now versus perhaps just going back to basics on focusing on delivering the high-quality experience.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, David, I think that we're going to do both. We're going to focus on fundamentals and try to continually deliver a better experience through that method. But we also want to try new things. Again, to get some customers who may have lapsed, to reinvigorate our regular customers to encourage them to come more, and perhaps to even entice new customers who haven't tried Chipotle. It's important that when you add something to the restaurant, you take something away. And although with the addition of new menu items, we're not going to take away other menu items, there are things that we can do to create efficiencies in the way we prep, in the way we get ready for business, in the way we find leverage. Finding leverage is interesting because there have been suggestions that we add breakfast, for instance.","Well, I'm not saying that we won't add breakfast, but when trying to find leverage, our second make line now has an enormous opportunity. The second make line can attract or provide for catering, for delivery, for the mobile app, to enable customers that are in line to get out of line and go to a tablet, and probably things we haven't thought of yet. It's extraordinary leverage because the labor to produce the food is much less at the second make line because of the new technology.","So my point is that you need to balance everything in the restaurant. And so we will make some things more efficient, so we will be able to add things like a dessert item or a new menu item. Again if you look at some other examples of fast food places getting too complicated, I don't think they kept this idea of taking away whenever you add something. So on balance, you still have the same amount of ability to focus on delivering the extraordinary experience that they've been accustomed to.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I guess just a quick follow up to that, if I may. I guess you've gotten to $2.5 million without any of those new menu items. So I guess the question is, why do you think you now need new menu items to get back to those kind of levels versus just going back to the old operating approach? I guess I'm a little confused by that point?","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, David, this is Mark. The new menu items, I wouldn't worry that we're going to slip into the traditional fast food model of introducing multiple new menu items wrapped with advertising multiple times a year. Our business really doesn't support that anyways because it's really a one price for everything you get at Chipotle, unless you get something extra like meat or guacamole. So we really don't have the ability even if we wanted to, to add lots and lots of menu items. However, there is a considerable amount of value to being able to advertise to people, or to market to people something new. And we've seen it now with chorizo.","It's been very effective, which is why I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're going to increase the amount of reach of that campaign four times. And what it does is it gives people a reason to reconsider Chipotle or just to add it to their routine where they may have dropped an occasion, and we're seeing it to be very effective. And so I wouldn't worry that you're going to see us switching to this model of repetitive menu additions with lots and lots of advertising around them. But there is a real value that we've seen now very tangibly with chorizo in terms of adding something new every now and then. So I really wouldn't worry that it's going to be a complete change in strategy at all.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. You highlighted a number of technology initiatives that will eventually drive sales, but at least one of the competitors in the marketplace has done that, it's taken a toll on earnings for several years as it turns out there's a lot of training costs, there's technology costs. So how much of that, if any, of those costs have you factored into 2017? Do you have a sense of not just the buying of the technology but what the training costs might be for such initiatives?","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Let me start, John, by talking to you about how the primary component of this thing works with regard to the technology. So the second make line that Steve referred to, we've had one in our restaurants for many, many, many years but the classic version. This new version is much more efficient. Whether or not you have the tech component added to it or not, it's just a better layout. It's got bigger bins. It's set up to be more efficient, and that new line actually is slightly cheaper than our existing second make line. And so that line that is about all the technology component on it is actually a little bit cheaper than our existing line. And so we're going to move quickly to have all of our restaurants outfitted with that new line starting in March 2017. So all new restaurants will have it and then we're going to selectively retrofit high volume restaurants with it over the coming year. And so I think it's going to be relatively quick.","Now what I just described was the line itself without the technology component. It's completely set up to handle it. We add that line to the restaurants and then as we see fit, we can add the technology component to it and it's not a tremendously expensive addition as well. And so you're not going to see lots and lots of the need to build big kiosk in the front of the house, that sort of thing, because this system actually whether you're using it from a tablet inside the restaurant or from your phone in your pocket, uses a very, very similar ordering system to the one I described in my call, the new online ordering site that we've developed. And so there's very, very little overall investment in this thing and I believe that we can turn it around fairly efficiently as we roll it into our restaurants.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I would also add that often with the introduction of technology, there is a lot of expense in training to this new technology. With the second make line, this technology actually is very intuitive. So it's actually easier to train a crew person how to operate the second make lines with this new indicating system than with the old method.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So in your plan for 2017, have you factored in costs, training costs, labor cost to do this or is that not in the plan for 2017? You don't think it will be an impact?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","John, we don't think it's going to be an impact. We think the labor is going to be neutral. We think over time it's going to be a labor saving. The labor per sales dollars on the second make line is more efficient than the labor per sales dollars on the front make line. Even though this is early on, what the teams have shown so far with this new approach is they can produce food a lot faster, more accurately. And so there's really built-in efficiency. If we didn't have second make lines, I would say this would be a major undertaking. It'd be a lot of training and it would take quite some time.","The fact that virtually all of our restaurants already have a second make line and what they're doing right now, they're struggling to make the food on the second make line with a little piece of paper with a lot of abbreviation. What they're going to get instead of that is they're going to have a very clear indicator with the slate screens. And so they're going to be doing the same things they always have and with the restaurant that that was retrofitted in New York, the team just intuitively stopped, just gravitated towards the display screens and just intuitively just kind of made the food the way they always would except they weren't stopping like in between every ingredient or two to look at this little bitty piece of paper that's on the sides of a register receipt.","So it's early, but so far we don't think there's going to be an increase in labor. The equipment cost is not that expensive. There will be an impact on depreciation depending on how many we can roll out, but it's not going to be significant. And not something that's going to affect our ability to get to within $10 EPS.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jason West with Credit Suisse.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Thanks. Just a couple of sales questions. I think you guys mentioned, Jack, you're running it down about 20% in October. But I also thought I heard you say that you've seen a full return to your kind of most frequent users, which I think is new. Could you try to explain what's going on there with the different customer buckets? You're still down 20%, but it sounds like things are improving. Just trying to reconcile those issues. And then the other question on the comp outlook for next year, does that include any incremental pricing? Thanks.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, the Chiptopia was designed to go after our most loyal customers. It's a relatively small customer group, but it's a group that comes very often. When we look at \u2013 we slice and dice our customer group a number of different ways. And when we look at our customer group for those customers that come at least a couple times a month to one time per week or greater as one group. Another group would be a customer that comes, say, once a month. Another group would come two to three times a month and another group would come once per every six months. When you take that most frequent group, by the way, all of those groups were negatively affected by anywhere between 20% and 25%, meaning they all dropped down their visit frequency. And in case of the infrequent customer, we just lost customers. And we lost them to the tune of about 20% to 25%.","After Chiptopia, we recovered to a point of where our most frequent customers were back to 95% to where they were before. Now some infrequent customers did not increase their frequency, but we were able to see some customers that were not coming as often as, let's say once per week, now were coming once per week. So we don't have the exact same customers we had before. One thing we've learned as we've gone through and we've gathered this data mine, this data that Mark talked about, we found that we have kind of a constant movement of customers that are coming. Some are coming more frequently, some are coming less. What Chiptopia did was encourage those customers who either were coming frequently and reduced. A lot of them did come back and then we encouraged some that were coming a couple times per month to come at least once per week or more. But if you look at that most loyal customer group that are coming multiple times per month, that group we've recovered 95%.","Now the rest of the group is a much, much, much larger group of customers that come much less frequent. That's why the things that Mark talked about make so much sense. That's why TV advertising makes sense. That's why advertising things like chorizo, which is new news, makes a lot of new sense. Dessert, once we decide which dessert we want to go with, to try to go beyond a test market. These are things that you can advertise and appeal to a broad group of customers. And so that's what our approach is, to get that much, much larger, tens of millions of customers, to come to Chipotle until we can recover that group as well. And then in terms of the comps, we don't have any menu price built into the comp at all.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Two if I may. First, on that $100 million of recurring cost savings. I think you called out $10 million of CapEx. Does that mean there is $90 million of OpEx savings that you expect in fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016, just as a clarification?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Not necessarily. There may be other things that we buy. For example, small wares, most small wares would be OpEx. There might be some equipment that will do a more efficient job of buying and we might be replacing. So it might not be a new store impact, but with replacing equipment, let's say grills for example, we're looking for a reduction in expenses or in what we pay for everything, and so there may be some additional CapEx. But I would say the majority of the $100 million is going be in operating expenses.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And secondly, the Chiptopia program obviously was successful with your most frequent customers, but given some of the complexity regarding the program, maybe some of your not-as-frequent customers didn't know necessarily how to use it or what their benefit would be or going that number of times in a month would be a lot to ask if someone that doesn't go to the brand, for example, once a week. Is there a way to approach loyalty in a different way that would have a broader appeal and is that potentially part of the plan in 2017 and 2018 to have something that's simpler and that will be a permanent part of your offering?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yes, John, an interesting thing which I mentioned in my remarks I think that's worth noting is that over the last six months, we saw 30 million customers that were either new or people that we hadn't seen before come into Chipotle. And this is thanks to this new data capability that we have. And additionally we're now able to reach a very large number of those people. And so we have dramatically improved our ability to reach out to these customers. And they're in all frequency categories by the way. Those 30 million people range from one to more than 10 times in terms of number of visits during that six-month period. So they're all across the different frequency bands. But we have such an extraordinary new ability to reach them that we're evaluating exactly how best to use that in order to create incentives for them.","We don't want to rely on a continuing basis on discounting. Obviously that cheapens the brand and creates a sense of entitlement ultimately such that people just begin to expect it. So we're very carefully evaluating how that's going to look. But to answer your question, I would say, yes. We're going to look at how we can use this new information we have about our customers and this really amazing ability to track whether or not what we do with them drives them in. So we can determine now with a very high degree of fidelity, whether or not an offer or an ad of a particular type or any other type of promotion or communication actually resulted in a visit from these customers.","And so I don't want to commit right now to exactly what we're going to do, because it's really just been over the last few months that we've developed this capability. But we're absolutely going to use it in a way that allows us to create ongoing incentives, to create the momentum for these less frequent customers to become more frequent.","I'm very excited about just the simple idea that so many new customers came to Chipotle. I mean, it says a couple of things to me. I mean first it says, even though it's tempting to think that, well, people are still reluctant to come to Chipotle, with that volume of people coming in as new customers, I think that's unlikely. That's showing a pretty major shift in people's attitudes.","But also, those somewhat infrequent new customers have extraordinary potential to become frequent. They're the ones who have the potential to create great comps for us in the future, and so we're going to be doing whatever we can to make their stay at Chipotle as enjoyable as possible. So I can't give you a firm answer, but I hope that helps you understand sort of how we're going to be looking at it.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go for our next question to David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, and good evening. First to follow up on some of that questioning about the marketing, you mentioned a few things, the new product news, National TV, all these things will be part of Chipotle's future, potentially. And you've tinkered with loyalty and now looking to make your bigger push behind mobile order and may be even delivery. Based on the analysis you've done so far, because it's hard for us to assess, what potential changes to marketing among these and maybe some other stuff do you believe will be the most promising and most likely that we will see?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, they all have promise in their own right. I think though that as I mentioned in answering the last question, we've seen very, very large numbers of new customers experiencing Chipotle. And so I think there's extraordinary potential for us to continue bringing in large groups of new customers, and that's the reason why we're currently testing television.","And television isn't a panacea. It's going to be a component of larger campaigns that we do, but it's very efficient when we get to the level of doing it nationally. And so, I believe that that probably, you know, has some of the most significant potential for us to bring in lots and lots and lots of new customers. And then, assuming that we create a great experience for them, when they come in the restaurant, they will then turn into more and more frequent customers. So I suspect that amongst those things, that has huge potential, but I will follow that with a very close second, which would be the increase in our digital promotion and the capability of online ordering.","And I just want to take a second to tell you a little bit more about what I'm talking about with regard, for example, to smarter pick-up times, which is the ability for somebody to come into Chipotle and get an order very quickly after they ordered it. We've been conducting a test over the last several months of this technology and through our analysis of that, we found that when people place orders at Chipotle, there's a very significant lag between when they place the order and when our restaurants allow them to come pick it up. This new technology actually eliminates our restaurant's ability to set that time gap and instead, sets it automatically based on the load of the restaurant.","And so we're seeing the potential to do as many as one entree per minute using this new system. And so the marketing that goes around that, that encourages people to place their orders via digital, assuming then again, those orders are fulfilled in this efficient and excellent way, I think has a tremendous amount of potential. So I put that as a close second to the top-of-mind marketing that we're going to be doing.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess, just thinking about some of the other pieces that have been or some of \u2013 part of improving the digital experience at the store. I know the POS system has been a part of upgrades that were needed to be able to move forward. Are there \u2013 is sort of everything else in place that you think a lot of this can be pretty plug-and-play once it's in store? Or are there sort of technological hurdles or technical hurdles that you think you're still going to be working your way through?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, I think that most everything is in place. And I say that wanting you to know that a couple of the key pieces are actually going to be rolled out throughout the month of November. So we have, as you mentioned, we've had some issues with regard to payments in particular, and the new responsive online ordering website that we've talked about in this call and some other, including catering, will now have a more streamlined payment process and I won't go into the technical details as to why it's more efficient, both for us and for the customer, but having gotten over that hurdle actually enables us to do a lot of the things we talked about without further technological investment.","Now, I do want to caution though that, of course, when you're adding anything that consumers are interacting with, and new technology for customers, there's always room for things to go wrong and we're going to need to iterate and refine those things, but I don't see any large technological hurdles that we need to overcome in order to implement this. We've overcome a lot of those over the last 18 months actually, and we're just now, in November, going to be taking advantage of a lot of them.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then as a follow-up on the digital, the more one-to-one marketing. Is the dataset that you're working off of, my impression or my understanding is that the average consumer isn't scanning or swiping a dedicated Chipotle card at Chipotle, is that working off of last names and last four digits of credit cards? And then how does that evolve or change as we move towards chip-and-pin implementation when you don't get that data anymore?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, yeah, I mean, we are using a combination of last name and four digits of the card, but also it's a unique combination of both Chipotle-owned and commercially available databases to create actual profiles of each customer. So we have the ability to now, as I mentioned, reach many, many, many of our customers using this technology. Chip and Pin is something that we have yet to implement at Chipotle for throughput reasons and we very much hope that we're going to leapfrog chip and pin, but I feel reluctant to go too far into the technological reasoning behind that without Curt, our CIO weighing in on it.","But there are more efficient ways of making payments than chip-and-pin and it doesn't seem to be \u2013 even though it is required by the credit card companies, it does not seem to be the technology that's going to be readily adopted by choice for consumers. And so we are simultaneously working on a variety of payment options ourselves and we expect that those will augment any loss should we ever implement chip-and-pin.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. I'm just curious what are the pros and cons of maintaining an almost 10% unit growth range in 2017 on the heels of what looks to be like almost 12 months of a 20%-plus average transaction decline. Just curious why you guys are sticking with the big numbers instead of essentially taking it down 10% or 20% just until the transactions stabilize a little bit?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Jeff, we took a careful look at our whole portfolio and we did pare it down \u2013 we pared it down, where we eliminated either remote sites that are hard to operate or new or developing markets where the risk of low sales and the risk of trying to staff a team and attract customers in an area where that doesn't have, perhaps, a strong brand awareness or brand appreciation. And so we pared those down.","But to cut the openings even further, there just isn't an advantage to doing so. The impact, when we open up restaurants on our existing comp is minimal. It's always been less than 1%; it's still less than 1% this year and so it's not like there would be a significant comp rebound. We have the pipeline, so, other than paring down as I mentioned, we have a strong pipeline, there just isn't an advantage. The recovery doesn't get jumpstarted just because we would peel off another 25, 50 or 100 openings. So there wasn't any advantage to doing so. So we thought we did the responsible thing in doing what we could to shore up the quality of the portfolio. But going beyond that just didn't offer any benefit from what we could see.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just one follow up, on the potential timeline for the National TV and heightened digital capability rollout, you guys mentioned it a couple times, but theoretically, how quickly could we see TV and under what circumstances would we see TV?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, right now TV is being tested in three markets between October 21 and November 20. We'll evaluate that on a number of different levels and that television in two of those three markets is running concurrently with other supporting advertising, which is normally the way we'd do that, television doesn't stand on its own typically.","And so as a result of those tests, we will integrate television, and as I mentioned probably at a national level, that is where the great efficiencies come in when you are making point buys like that. We would integrate that into most likely the campaign that we have launching in spring.","Now that doesn't mean that we couldn't add some selective TV for certain reasons before that. But I'd say that certainly by March 2017 you'd see, if the test is successful, television integrated into the campaign.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go now to Joseph Buckley with Bank of America.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Two questions. One, curious what the second make line today is contributing to sales? Are the sales off that second make line a significant part of the business today?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yep, about 6%, Joe.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then bigger picture question, as you shift the focus next year to a little bit more on the unit level economics, are you coming to accept that the base level of average unit volumes and base level of restaurant margins may be lower and resetting that as the bar from which you'll grow going forward, is it somewhat of a concession that recovering the full sales level seems less likely?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","No, we're not conceding at all, Joe, that our top line sales can't be dramatically improved over the coming years. We are just recognizing that in the meantime though, it behooves us to do everything we can to be as efficient as we can be so as to drive the very best margin possible, even during a time where our volumes are still negatively affected.","But like I said in my remarks, we're not going to drive those costs down to the point where we're negatively affecting the guest experience or the ability that our field teams have in order to continue to create really great restaurant teams and have great restaurant operations.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our final questions from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon. What level of share repurchase is accounted for in fiscal 2017 earnings guidance? And then also what will the cadence of new store development look like?","Montgomery F. Moran - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Nicole, I would expect a similar buy as what we've seen in the last month or two. We bought about $1 billion worth, aggressively and that took us through like about April or May or so. But I would expect us to be at more this kind of steady level.","We'll want to keep a strong balance sheet, somewhere in the $0.5 billion or a little higher on the balance sheet. And then we'll take excess cash flow and use that. So if in your model, if you take excess cash flow to assume that we kind of keep what's on the balance sheet or about what's on the balance sheet today and use any excess to buy back stock, I think you'll be in the ballpark of what we'll actually do now. We'll be opportunistic and we'll be more aggressive if the stock drops and less aggressive when the stock increases, but generally that's the approach we'll take.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","And to answer the question with regard to the new restaurant openings we've said that it'd be between 195 and 210 restaurants for 2017.","Montgomery F. Moran - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, and the cadence will be fairly level-loaded throughout the year, Nicole, if that's what you're asking.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, they tend to pile up a little bit in Q4 typically, but we'll level-load as best we can.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Montgomery F. Moran - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thank you, Nicole.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Nicole.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session and brings to the end of our conference. We thank you for your participation.

After which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Niccol","Good afternoon. Thank you, Ashish and welcome to the Chipotle team. We are really excited to have you on board. Additionally, I am also happy to share that we have hired our Chief Development Officer, Tabassum Zalotrawala in December and therefore completing my executive leadership team. I am confident Tabassum will make a terrific contribution to our development organization.","With that, I am very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results with 6.1% comparable restaurant sales growth that included 2% transaction growth, restaurant level margins of 17%, 210 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items with $1.72. I am also pleased to report for the full year 2018 restaurant average unit volumes achieved $2 million and our digital business went beyond $0.5 billion, representing 10.9% of sales. The growth acceleration this quarter gives us confidence that our strategy to win today and create the future is working. When we connect with guests through culturally relevant marketing focused on Chipotle\u2019s great taste and real ingredients and provide more convenient access with less friction, they respond enthusiastically. I am excited about the momentum we built heading into 2019.","Now before I talk about the future, let me review the many positive changes at Chipotle during 2018 by going through the five key pillars that drive our purpose of cultivating a better world. The first is to be more visible with culturally relevant communication and the innovation that increases brand engagement. Our marketing mandate is to drive culture, drive a difference and ultimately drive a Chipotle purchase. In late September, we launched our For Real advertising showcasing Chipotle\u2019s point of difference in real ingredients and real cooking techniques. We drove significant awareness of the brand through a holistic media plan on culturally relevant programming.","We published our entire ingredient list for the world to see in Times Square across numerous social and digital channels, a full page ad in the New York Times and in our restaurants with the headline, the hardest ingredient to pronounce at Chipotle is Chipotle. The next iteration of the For Real campaign called Behind the Foil is launching February 11 and builds on this success. It feels more like a documentary than traditional advertising. It showcases our fresh ingredients, food preparation and celebrates the work our talented team members do everyday in our restaurants to provide our guests a great dining experience.","Our free delivery bowl offering which ran from December 17 to January 7 help to expand access and was not only a great way to attract new guests to our app and delivery capabilities, but also to Chipotle as nearly half of the guests taking part in this offer were new or lapsed users. Collectively, these marketing initiatives help drive a noticeable lift in sales during the second half of the year. Additionally, beginning January 2, we launched our first menu innovation called Lifestyle Bowls for mobile and web orders that really resonated with consumers in a big way. It generated over 1.3 billion earned media impressions in the first few days of January.","Overall, Chris Brandt and his team have done a great job of making Chipotle more visible in culturally relevant social and traditional media channels. For example, our 2018 overall digital impressions increased nearly 20% year-over-year, while social impressions increased nearly 40% year-over-year. This was all accomplished without increasing our overall marketing budget. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to continue to be a part of culture, have our presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always on social and digital program. I am excited about the continued evolution of our marketing strategy as I look into our 2019 plans.","Our second pillar is to digitize and modernize our restaurant experience with enhanced access and less friction creating a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience. We continue to hear the number one reason consumers eat elsewhere is because they don\u2019t have convenient access to Chipotle. In 2018, we opened 137 new restaurants with industry leading returns and will continue to be one of the leaders in developing new restaurants. For our existing restaurants, we completed the big fix and stayed focused on expanding the reach of our digital system to provide our guests easier access and greater convenience. The digitized make lines are now in over 1,000 restaurants and remain on track to be in all restaurants by the end of 2019. The digital pickup shelves are in approximately 1,000 restaurants and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants by the middle of 2019.","Curt Garner and his team continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 66% year-over-year, an acceleration from the 48% we saw last quarter. Digital sales totaled $158.6 million during the fourth quarter and represented 12.9% of sales. For the full year, digital sales exceeded a $0.5 billion and accounted for 10.9% of sales. App downloads increased 72% year-over-year in 2018 and we continue to see strong interest from new and frequent as well as frequent guests at Chipotle. Similar to last quarter, we saw particularly strong traction in delivery. Although off of a relatively low base, delivery sales increased roughly 13 fold compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The free delivery bowl promotion drove growth in the latter part of December offsetting normal expected seasonality. Encouragingly, we are seeing some residual lift in delivery sales that last beyond the promotion and have seen very little guest overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner apps.","As we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pickup process, we expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Based on data shared with us by our white label delivery partner, we are consistently among the quickest delivery times in their system and we expect this to only get better with the addition of pickup shelves and delivery prepay capabilities that enable delivery drivers to walk in, pickup their order and walkout without any delays.","As part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring a new format that leverages digitally enabled convenience. Our test of the initial 10 restaurants with the mobile order pickup lane that we call Chipotlane is showing promising results with a higher mix of digital sales and total restaurant sales. We will continue to explore and learn about this opportunity by opening a few dozen more Chipotlanes in 2019 with a mix of freestanding and end-cap building. These restaurants are a great extension of our digital system as they help to increase convenience and access to Chipotle. We are also encouraged by our loyalty test sign-ups and early user data. As we have seen with our app, we are seeing a nice mix of new lapsed and medium frequency guests. And while it\u2019s still early days, we are pleased to see changes in behavior across all frequency bands. Our stage-gate process is working and we are making changes based on the feedback received thus far and remain on track for a national launch in 2019.","Our third pillar is to run restaurants with great hospitality and fast throughput in a great environment. During Q4, we rolled out several operational improvement initiatives to drive better food, feel and flow. This includes training that reiterates our four pillars of hospitality, which are be and look your best, be guest obsessed, surprised and delight and make it right. In an effort to enhance our best-in-class food safety program, we adopted a quarterly food safety training requirement, which trains crew members on their role in keeping our food safe every quarter.","In addition, we implemented a new prep process, we call focus prep. Focus prep reduces the number of people preparing our great food, which makes it more consistent as well as food safe. Ancillary benefits include better service as our hospitality teams are now singularly focused on delivering a great guest experience. And the GM is now in a position to lead the restaurant versus managing every single process of the production. Our teams have embraced this new process quickly and we are already seeing benefits from the rollout. In the coming year, Scott Boatwright and his team are focused on team stability, throughput and consistently great tasting food. Additionally, reducing turnover particularly at the GM level through better leadership training and a clear direction on career progression are critical factors to our long-term success. Internally, we are calling this the year of the General Manager. We are also doubling down on throughput training and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard that provides greater visibility on their throughput performance.","Lastly, we are elevating our culinary prowess through chef-driven cooking demonstrations as well as consistently executed line tastings to ensure our food is cooked to perfection everyday. In the first half of 2019, we are also launching Cultivate You 2.0, whereby we bring leadership training to the restaurant General Manager level to further drive in-market talent development. As a reminder, we retrained all of our field leaders during Cultivate You sessions at our corporate support centers throughout 2018. We previewed many of these initiatives at our All Managers Conference last fall and our managers know that when I am visiting with them in their restaurants, I\u2019m always going to ask their team, how is the culture and how is throughput here? I am going to ask our general managers about team stability, the development of our team members and obviously the Food Safety Seven. And of course, since we are a restaurant company, we are going to be doing food tastings. It\u2019s clear from my numerous restaurant visits this quarter that Scott and his field leadership team are making tremendous progress and are focused on the right operational initiative.","The fourth pillar is to be disciplined and focused in order to enhance our powerful economic model. Our biggest lever remains sales and transactions growth. Over the past year, we have become more strategic about pursuing projects that generate sales growth and healthy returns. We are in the process of building sales growth layers for multiple years and putting them through our stage gate process to ensure we are learning and iterating prior to national launches. While we are focused on winning today, we are also cultivating our future.","Last but not least, we are building a great culture of accountability and creativity. This is one of the things I am most pleased about as we have made significant progress during 2018 in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guest want and better at executing so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us. Our people are our biggest asset and I could not be more proud of the team we have assembled. With our restructuring and relocation largely behind us, we are well on our way to building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent that is dramatically improving our ability to deliver great food and service to our guests. I love the energy and enthusiasm I see everyday when I am with our employees, in our restaurants, and in our support centers.","Chipotle has always thrived by being different, by being the best version of ourselves, not another version of someone else. And we have earned the deep loyalty of our guests, because we are different and deliver a unique experience and being different means always changing. Right now, we are investing in many areas that further position us to win. So as you think about 2019, the main initiatives that ladder up to our five key pillars are: digital system investments, which includes pickup shelves, digitized make lines, loyalty and delivery; marketing programs that celebrate our real ingredients and classic cooking techniques; elevating our core menu by developing innovation that leads food culture and meets guest requests and lifestyle; and of course, a dedication to improving operations with General Manager stability and development, excellent throughput, consistently great food, all in a great restaurant environment.","With that, let me conclude by thanking all of our team members for their belief in Chipotle. Their dedication and passion provide our guests with a great experience serving real food, cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. Their efforts are helping Chipotle cultivate a better world. We have an exciting journey ahead of us and while we accomplished a great deal in 2018, I believe the best is yet to come.","With that, here is Jack to walk you through the financials.","Jack Hartung","Thanks, Brian. I am really pleased with the high-quality fourth quarter results, which provide a glimpse of our powerful economic model and a leverage we can deliver, we drive top line sales and provide a great guest experience. Our marketing and digital strategies led to increased guest visits and our restaurant teams responded by ensuring every guest enjoyed a delicious meal.","Our revenue was $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 10.4% from last year and comp sales growth of 6.1%, our highest comp in six quarters. Restaurant level margins of 17% expanded 210 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items, was $1.72. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to the transformation and these negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.57 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.15.","For the full year, sales were $4.9 billion on a comp sales increase of 4%. Restaurant level margins were 18.7%, up 180 basis points and we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $9.06, an increase of 33% over last year. Unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation, negatively impacted our earnings per share by $2.75 leading to GAAP earnings of $6.31. In Q4, we recognized $23 million in non-recurring expenses, with $7 million related to underperforming or closed restaurants and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. We continue to expect transformation cost from the restructuring and restaurant closures as well as certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million. We recognized about $91 million of these charges during 2018 and expect that the remaining $9 million to $29 million will hit in the first half of 2019. We will continue to provide specifics on the transformation-related costs each quarter, so you can follow the underlying trend. The Q4 comp of 6.1% was driven by a trend change in transactions as 2% of the comp came from greater guest visits along with a higher average check. The check increase includes a price increase of 3.3%, which was a result of increases taken in late 2017 and in January of 2018 and a mix contribution of 0.8%.","Our For Real campaign during the quarter really resonated with our guests and the Free Delivery Bowl campaign in late December made it easier than ever for our customers to enjoy Chipotle. We expect full year comps in 2019 will be in the mid single-digit range with the recent modest price increase contributing about 1.7%. This is lower than the 4% price increase seen in 2018. We are optimistic that with the recent trend change in transactions plus the modest price increase combined with our 2019 growth initiatives, a mid single-digit comp is achievable. We opened 40 new restaurants in the quarter bringing our total count to 137 for the full year. The new restaurants opened in 2018 have continued to open up strong as our development teams have done a great job emphasizing high-quality and high returning sites.","For 2019, we continue to expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants, but these openings will be weighted towards the second half of the year. We expect about 10% of these openings will occur in Q1 and about 25% will open in Q2. Food costs for the quarter were 33.2%, slightly lower than Q3 due to price increases as well as lower avocado prices based on our seasonal shift from California to sourcing from Mexico, Chile and Peru. We expect food costs to be approximately 33% in Q1 as the slight leverage from the December menu price increase is largely offset by an expected increase in beef prices. We also expect food costs for the full year to be about 33% as an expected rise in avocado prices this summer will be offset by other efficiencies. Our new supply chain team is now fully in place and we set to find efficiencies later in the year by strategically reviewing this sourcing of all of our ingredients. We will keep you updated as these potential opportunities arise.","Labor costs for the quarter were 27.1%, a decrease of 40 basis points from last year. Our restaurant teams did a nice job of scheduling and managing labor in the quarter while labor inflation in the 4% to 5% range was partially offset by the menu price increase. We expect Q1 in the full year labor to be in the low 27% range as leverage from the menu price increase and sales growth is expected to largely offset ongoing wage inflation in the 4% to 5% range. Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.5%, a decrease of 30 basis points from Q4 of last year and that was due to sales leverage.","Marketing and promo costs were 4.2%, an increase of about 40 basis points compared to Q4 of last year and that funded our For Real campaign in the fall as well as our Free Delivery Bowl campaign in late December. Marketing and promo finished the year at 2.9% of sales and we expect to invest about 3% of sales in 2019 and this includes investing in the low to mid 3% range in Q1, which is higher than the 1.8% we spent last year in Q1 as we launch our Behind the Foil campaign next week. Other operating costs were also higher due to the inclusion of delivery fees, which rose with the increase in our delivery sales. For 2019, we expect other operating costs to be in the 14% of sales or perhaps slightly lower as sales leverage and M&R efficiencies are expected to be offset by our fast growing delivery business.","G&A for the full year was 7.7% of sales or $375 million, which included $32 million related to the transformation and other unusual expenses, $64 million in stock compensation and nearly $11 million related to our biennial All Manager Conference. Without these items, our underlying G&A support totaled about $270 million in 2018. In 2019, we expect our underlying G&A support to be in the $275 million to $280 million range. Our annual stock comp is typically approved and granted in Q1, so we will be able to provide updated clarity during our next earnings call. And this underlying G&A does not include non-recurring transformation costs, which will continue to clearly call out each quarter.","Depreciation expense for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from Q4 of last year and it\u2019s increased due to the accelerated depreciation from the restaurant closures as we discussed earlier and to a lesser extent the accelerated depreciation from our office closures and we expect depreciation to be about 4% in 2019. Our GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 26.3%, which is slightly lower than our underlying rate of 27.4%. For 2019, we expect our underlying effective rate to be in the 27% to 30% range. While expected 2019 underlying effective rate has settled into a tighter range than it was throughout 2018, it maybe effective from time-to-time by items such as executive comp related adjustments or deferred tax assets related to previously issued equity and we will fully disclose these adjustments as they occur.","Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments balance of $677 million as of December 31. This allowed us to repurchase $45 million of our stock at an average price of $452 per share during the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we repurchased $161 million at an average of $370 per share. We also funded CapEx during the year totaling $287 million, which is lower than the $300 million we guided early last year as we reprioritized our CapEx to support our new strategies. In 2019, we expect CapEx will be around $300 million with around 40% to 45% invested in new restaurants, 30% to be invested in growth-related initiatives, including digitized second make lines and digital pickup shelves and the remaining invested in normal upkeep of our restaurants and strategic corporate initiatives. Our new restaurant investment will increase to an average of about $860,000 per new opening and that\u2019s mostly as a result of further testing of the Chipotlane. The guests convinced with Chipotlane along with the potential for superior economics support allocating a portion of our portfolio to this new format.","In closing, we are encouraged by our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results as our teams remain focused on the guest experience while seamlessly managing a significant restructuring and relocation. The results as a company that is well on its way to building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth. I am excited about 2019 and I believe we are in a great position to win today and create a bright future for our guests, for our employees and for our shareholders. And now we are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","David Tarantino","Hi, good afternoon and congrats on the progress you made last year. Question I guess on the sales trends first. I think, Jack, you mentioned multiple times change in the trend line during the quarter. So can you maybe elaborate on what you meant by that, maybe talk about how the trends progressed during the quarter? I know you mentioned comps in October were up around 4%, so that implies quite a bit of an acceleration. So can you maybe talk about that and maybe what you are seeing so far in 2019? And then underneath that, Brian, can you maybe give an update on for what you think the impact from that For Real advertising campaign was on the comp trajectory and I know you pulled some of that advertising during the quarter, what kind of tail did you see from that approach when it wasn\u2019t running? Thanks a lot.","Jack Hartung","Yes. Hey, David, I will start. We talked about during our third quarter release that the For Real campaign did bring more customers in at that time and we talked about October sales or actually sales in late September moving up to a higher level. We maintain that during October and then through the quarter, October, November, were pretty similar months, David. So even as we are getting near the end of For Real, we held on to those sales and then we had a nice bump at the end of the quarter as we had the Free Delivery Bowls as we were advertising on all the college bowl games and our customers responded in a big way and so that was nice acceleration. I think the things \u2013 the two things that make us really encouraging is that the For Real campaign was just resonating with our customers in terms of Chipotle stands for real food and real cooking and that resonated with customers and then two when we made Chipotle more convenient to our customers by making available through delivery and free delivery during the Free Delivery Bowl campaign. They responded, because it was convenient access and those are two levers that we can continue to pull throughout the year. In terms of January sales, it\u2019s really difficult to give you an underlying trend. We maintain the momentum from the delivery bowls end of the first week of January, because we were advertising and offering the promotion through the BCS Championship game. Then we also introduced the lifestyle bowl as well and that created a lot of buzz and interest and activity as well. And then in the second half of the month, we have weather and so really difficult to give you what the underlying trend is. I can tell you we are just encouraged with what we saw during the quarter and we are optimistic about how 2019 is shaping up.","Brian Niccol","Hey, David. This is Brian. The only thing I would add is the thing that was exciting to hear from consumers as well as our team members, is when we started talking about Chipotle, a point of difference in regard to real ingredients, real cooking that results in just better tasting food. Everybody agrees that is why they originally found what with Chipotle and that\u2019s why they\u2019re falling back in love with Chipotle. So the good news is that message is proving be very sticky and I think the team has done a great job of making the brand much more visible with that key point of difference. And it continues to carry momentum with the execution in the restaurant as well as the guest experience that consumers are actually having. So, we are very excited, I think we mentioned obviously, we\u2019re going to continue to pull that string and the team is getting ready to launch kind of the next wave of the For Real campaign through Behind the Foil next week.","David Tarantino","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Leo for Sarah. So I have a question on the restaurant margins. It seems that it went up this quarter given the menu price increases, sales leverage, but we were just wondering if there were also some operating efficiency in here and if you could perhaps give more detail on what they might look like in 2019, but ideally some kind of quantification through the supply chain or labor metrics? Thanks.","Jack Hartung","Yes. They were efficiencies and we talked about. We started to see efficiencies in the third quarter. And this is the way our field teams and restaurant managers are scheduling and deploying labor. They found ways to get more efficient in the second half of the third quarter that continued into the fourth quarter. And so that definitely drove part of the margin. The rest of it was from sales leverage and a little bit from the price increase. And then going into next year, it\u2019s really going to be more of the same. We are hoping that will or expecting that will hold on to the efficiencies that Scott and his team drove in the second half of this year. We are expecting with a comp guidance that we provided with a very modest price increase that we will be able to offset some of the labor inflation, the biggest challenge is going to be labor inflation. And labor inflation, we expect to continue in that 4% to 5%.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Karen Holthouse","Hi, thanks for taking the question. One quick housekeeping one and then a real question, could you just walk us through given the pricing actions have been taken, why\u2019s that cadence of price through the year will be in 2019 and then there are some encouraging commentary on the loyalty test, in a best-case scenario what one could we think about that getting to a broader rollout?","Brian Niccol","Sure. So, the way to thing about pricing is, we take in a price increase of just shy of 2%. And I think we\u2019ve mentioned this in prior calls, we now brought in a partner to help us manage our pricing approach going forward. So, the good news for us is even with the pricing of below 2%, we continue to have the best value scores in the fast-casual segment and we\u2019re always going to want to hang on to that strength. So, any pricing that we will take going forward, will continue to be probably in smaller increments than we\u2019ve done historically, with obviously more frequent basis, and right now we\u2019re working through what that frequency will look like. But through all of it, the thing that we\u2019ve kept our eye on, is how do we maintain the integrity of that value proposition that we provide to our consumers.","Your second question on digital, the loyalty program specifically, we\u2019re in the stage gate process with the loyalty program. I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about one of the things we\u2019re delighted to see is one, the enrollments and how this is one of those things that just keeps building on itself. So, you get started with some level of enrollments, you see cohorts of people coming in, the thing that\u2019s nice to see is how those that enroll, utilize the loyalty program in their behaviors. And then what\u2019s nice to see is how that builds throughout time and what we continue to be very optimistic about is the cohorts that we\u2019re seeing are, like last meeting users as well as our heavy users. But the thing that we\u2019re most interested in has the data that we get on this, our ability to then turn around remarket Chipotle to influence people\u2019s behaviors going forward. And we\u2019re still in the early days of understanding a lot of those implications, but so far are very promising, and that\u2019s why we continue to move this through the stage gate process, still on track for 2019 launch.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good afternoon. I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but I think Brian, you\u2019ve talked quite a bit about throughput and the opportunity there. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s anything where you saw any measurable progress in the fourth quarter? And then I guess just to clarify Sarah\u2019s question, can you just talk about how the price benefit will impact the quarter. So, how much are carrying in first quarter versus full year?","Brian Niccol","Yes, I\u2019ll let Jack answer the pricing question here. And then I can answer the other question around throughput. So, go ahead Jack.","Jack Hartung","Just make sure price, it\u2019s 1.7 through the first three quarters. And then about 1.3, something like that. We took the pricing in two stages during December. So, it\u2019s pretty much going to be an even 1.7 through 11.5 once a year.","Brian Niccol","And then your question on throughput, the guys have actually made a lot of progress on throughput. We just launched our throughput dashboard. And, I think I mentioned this in our All Manager Conference, we reemphasize the pillars of throughput. So, we\u2019re in the process right now, giving our teams visibility that they\u2019ve not had on throughput in a long time. And we\u2019re already starting to see that have an impact on our results. So, it\u2019s very early. But the good news is the dashboard coupled with the focus and going back to the core of what this business was built on, which is fundamentals of great throughput. We\u2019re already seeing an impact in the business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.","Joshua Long","Great, thank you for taking my question. Kind of following up on that point on throughput, I was curious if you can talk about the opportunity around GM turnover. I know that\u2019s something that you mentioned in your prepared comments, Brian, but just curious on where turnover levels are at now. And then how you think about kind of rebuilding that over the course of 2019 and beyond, if there\u2019s other initiatives in place, or if it\u2019s really a function of just getting the messaging and things that we\u2019ve talked about here thus far in the call and then other venues getting traction with that as we go forward?","Brian Niccol","Yes, thanks for the question. I think I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we\u2019re making 2019 the year of the General Manager. And the reason is because, we want to improve the stability of the General Manager level. And we also want to improve the development of our apprentices and General Managers, so that they\u2019re ready to step in the growth opportunities that are going to be presented. It\u2019s a focused effort. We actually have all of our field leaders together here in a couple weeks, where we\u2019re going to be reviewing the best ways to develop future General Managers and future field leaders in this organization. And, Scott and his team are very much focused on keeping stability in the restaurant with our A plus leaders and then those leaders that need development, they get the right development, so they become A plus leaders as well. And I think what you\u2019ll see is that builds a culture of growth both from a standpoint of career opportunity, as well as sales and guest experiences. So, we\u2019re very much focused on continuing with right initiatives to drive more stability, lower turnover at the General Manager level, goes from that, that just gives us a position of strength to get better throughput, better food execution, and better environment for our customers.","Joshua Long","I appreciate that color. Thank you so much. In terms of thinking about the Chipotle lane and the prototype that goes along with that. How should we think about that in terms of, for those of us who haven\u2019t necessarily seen it in person and is there an opportunity to shrink some of that square footage as the sales make shifts towards digital and pushing things through or pushing sales through the app rather?","Brian Niccol","Yes, so great question. A lot of folks probably have not seen our Chipotle lane. The way First I want to explain it so, you order ahead in the app or on the website and what it does, is it provides another access point at the restaurant where you don\u2019t have to get out of your car. So, you are able to just pull up to a window, our team member then has a quick conversation with you, you just said pickup time and then what happens is, literally it\u2019s like, I\u2019m here for my burrito, out of the window comes your burrito, you never get out of your car. So arguably, it will be possibly the fastest way to Chipotle is going through the Chipotle lane. It does require you though to order in advance and pick your pickup time. We have that in about 10 restaurants right now. The nice thing is we\u2019re seeing both digital sales as well as total restaurant sales elevate with this new access point.","To your question about what does it mean from a restaurant design standpoint. This is one of the reason why I\u2019m really excited to have Tabassum on our team. She is going to have the flexibility to think through with this new access point, what are our opportunities to change the footprint of Chipotle, and I think that means finding trade areas that historically we haven\u2019t gone into, because we haven\u2019t had this access point and also finding trade areas where potentially we could have a smaller footprint because of this access point to get into those trade areas. So, it really opens the door, so I think additional convenience with less friction and get people to Chipotle closer to where they want a Chipotle. So, we\u2019re still in the early days, so I do want to make sure people understand that. This is still very much in a testing phase and we will continue to test, learn, iterate throughout 2019 and will be happily sharing the results as we get them.","Joshua Long","Great thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","John Glass","Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about delivery. First, how much of the fourth quarter sales particularly, I guess December sales results you ascribe to delivery and particularly that free offer, how much accomplish did that give, you can tease it out? Second, you did offer free delivery earlier in the year. So, it sounds like this time around, it had a greater impact on sales, why do you think that was? And third, maybe Jack, I know, you\u2019ve talked about delivery economics in the past. But just to be clear, when you look at a delivery sale, I think it\u2019s generally understood, it\u2019s lower margin because of the commission, and it\u2019s hard to offset that even if the higher check. Is that the way you think about it, or do you think yours is structured somewhat differently, or somehow there\u2019s a different proposition where you actually see a restaurant margin going up, and it\u2019s accretive not dilutive to restaurant margin, I\u2019m talking about the average margin now, not maybe an incremental margin?","Brian Niccol","So, John, I\u2019ll touch on the first part, and then I\u2019ll let Jack share on your margin question. Two things to think about. The first time when we did the delivery promotion, it was not available both through in the app and across the marketplace. Now, delivery is accessible both in our app and across marketplace. The other thing I would share with you is, we now have more coverage of our restaurants than we did when you go back the first-time we did this. The other key piece of the puzzle obviously, is I think our marketing team and Chris did a great job of smartly connecting the idea of delivery to an event, that was happening in a lot of people\u2019s homes that just made the occasion that much more relevant. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of more access, more visibility, the access being in our app, in the marketplace and then the visibility being done through television, tied to an occasion that basically trip to what thought for the consumer, hey, I should be doing Chipotle at home while I\u2019m doing this event. So, I think the combination of all those things just built on top of each other to really drive our delivery business in the fourth quarter. I think I\u2019m excited about it, it is the delivery business continues to stay with Chipotle because the speed at which it gets delivered, I think we talked about this before, we\u2019re still best-in-class when it comes to speed. And the second piece is our food is really great when it gets delivered. That burrito, it\u2019s really delicious. And so, to get people delicious food in roughly 30 minutes at home while they\u2019re watching, whatever they\u2019re watching, it appears to be a good idea for our consumer. Jack, I\u2019ll let you answer the margin question.","Jack Hartung","Yes, John, the way to think about the margin first of all is Chipotle is really set up where our operations are geared towards great delivery experience, from through the entire process for our crew, for the driver and for the customer. First of all, let me start with our second make line sales before you consider delivery, is higher margin than our frontline sales, because we start with an advantage there. We have a second make line which means our operator setup who take these extra sales, we\u2019re not running the sales through or the production through the same frontline that our customers are waiting through. We\u2019re investing to make that experience even better with digitizing the second make lines. So, our capacity is going to go up, our accuracy is going to go up, and our timeliness is going to go up. We have stayed at times where when a delivery driver comes in, they know they can come in Chipotle at x time. They know that it\u2019s going to be ready. We are putting shelves in our restaurant as well and we\u2019re about to launch prepaid for even for our delivery partners, so that there is no stopping to pay for the order. So, everything is set up to be very efficient, very seamless in everything we do. There is a delivery fee, but John, right now the incrementality is so high as long as these are extra customers, additional customers coming to Chipotle, we can cover the fee because our morning starts out at a higher level, because it\u2019s incremental. We still can cover the fee and it\u2019s still a accretive. So, it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s profitable, it\u2019s accretive to our margins. The way we\u2019ve got it set up right now.","John Glass","And Jack, just to be clear you\u2019re talking about accretive to the consolidated average margin, not an incremental margin that the second make line can offers in higher check or whatever else elements can offset that commission fee, is that the way you look at it?","Jack Hartung","That\u2019s right John. When we are at a 19 margin, when we cover the delivery fees, our margins are still much higher than the 19%. Now if you\u2019re going to compare this to an incremental customer that\u2019s going to order on their app and come and pick it up, that is our highest margin transaction in the whole restaurant. When you then attach a delivery fee, it\u2019s going to be lower, but it\u2019s still going to be a very attractive margin and again the way we\u2019ve set this up, it is so convenient for everybody and about our crew, the driver and the customer. We think our growth is just going to continue to grow here we\u2019re just going to continue to be incremental and so you know we\u2019re bullish on where this goes both from the sale as well as margin standpoint.","John Glass","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","John Ivankoe","Hi, just a couple if I may. Firstly overall, if we do think a while like what is going to be necessary at this point in terms of adding other customers in terms of your peak day parts are, we at the point now where overall throughput is now at the point where that customer can be reaching. And then secondly in terms of the shoulder periods that we\u2019ve talked about before in between the 2 and 5, for example, if there are now programs in place, again it\u2019s meet, the shoulder periods that couldn\u2019t otherwise being met with the overall peak staffing and day part demand?","Brian Niccol","Yes. Hi John, the simple answer is we still have plenty of capacity to handle more throughput during our peaks. I think we\u2019ve mentioned this before, you know, Chipotle in the past was doing $2.5 million on average out of these restaurants and you know, we were doing 35 transactions in 15 minutes and we\u2019re still in the mid-20s today. I\u2019ll be at making progress from the 20, so, you know, Scott, his team know that when we have a line and they go faster, the good news is the line just keeps moving, as opposed to somebody peeling off of the line. And the peak business still has a lot of capacity when we execute throughput really well. So, there\u2019s plenty of upside there. Then your question on the shoulder, you know, the thing that\u2019s great about Chipotle is our proposition really resonates lunch through dinner and consumers are becoming more hour-less on the time of day that they want to eat. And we\u2019re continuing to see us make progress in our throughput in those shoulder hours. But the focus right now is those peaks, how do we get back to where we once were on that throughput because we still have so much headroom in that space. And it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s an impressive operation when you see us operating at our throughput capability, and I think we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but plenty of headroom, but we have lots of focus to capture that headroom in our peaks.","John Ivankoe","Yes. And from your perspective, it\u2019s more of a supply, in other words, a throughput constraint than it has been a demand constraint as the number of customers like you serve for 15 months has been reduced?","Brian Niccol","Yes, yes, I mean, look, I think our \u2013 the good news is, we smartly guide our team members focused on their roles, accountability and making great food and now we\u2019re pivoting to, okay, now this is how you do the four pillars of great food, but which was at the core of Chipotle 5 years, 6 years ago. So, we believe we can open more transactions during those peaks by getting people up to speed on what it\u2019s like to run the four pillars of great throughput in a Chipotle.","John Ivankoe","That\u2019 great, thank you. And then secondly, if I may, on the supply chain, and I know you talked about this in the past, but in terms of the bigger structural changes that are happening in the supply chain, how far are we in this journey at this point. I mean, obviously, you hire new people, you have new teams, you have new office, and you have a completely clean slate in terms of what Chipotle could be in 2020 versus 2015 or 2014. I mean, I guess how much efficiency and effectiveness opportunity maybe there\u2019s a basis point number, I think we\u2019d all love that. But whatever it is and then maybe there\u2019s a quality number or a service number that you can talk about in terms of the work that you\u2019ve done on the supply chain in terms of how much that could deliver going forward?","Brian Niccol","Yes, I think we\u2019ve talked about this and I think you categorize it correctly. We\u2019ve got a new leader with Carlos and we are really taking a clean sheet to how we approach our supply chain. But one caveat, food with integrity is still going to be a key driving principle on how we operate in our supply chain. So that means supporting the farmer, supporting the right animal welfare and then also protecting clean food and farming practices that we believe is the future of food culture. With that said, I think Carlos and his team working with Jack, have already started to identify opportunities for our business that we\u2019re going to attack and as we understand what that really means for the business, I\u2019m sure Jack and myself will update you guys, but right now, it\u2019d be premature to give a specific number, John, on what that entails. But I think it\u2019s part of one of our pillars of doing our business, which is we need to take a disciplined approach to protecting the economic model to pull back and that\u2019s what we task Carlos to do here. So, I don\u2019t know, if you want to add anything to that Jack.","Jack Hartung","No, it\u2019s just the only thing I would say, it\u2019s a whole new team as well John. So, we\u2019re fully staffed right now. The team is up and running, it\u2019s really a great team that believes in Chipotle purpose. They believe in Chipotle, our ethos of sourcing high-quality sustained [indiscernible] food, and they\u2019ve had significant outreach to all of our suppliers. So, we\u2019re really optimistic about the team, about the relationship with our suppliers and Brian is right though there\u2019s nothing to report right now, but if there\u2019s opportunities there, I\u2019m confident this team is going to find them.","John Ivankoe","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thanks. Just your 2019 comp guidance calls for mid-single digit same-store sales. Should we expect an inflection at some point or you think it\u2019s really just kind of a slow and steady march back to the 2.5 million AUV level you achieved 4% last year. So just kind of steady and slower would you expect inflection point?","Brian Niccol","Yes, look, obviously I think the way we think about this is, if we do the right marketing with the right communication, our consumers will respond enthusiastically to the Chipotle business. And is that slow and steady, is it inflection, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re focused on. What we\u2019re focused on is, how do we get to a place where we\u2019re communicating the things that are meaningful to people about Chipotle, we\u2019re doing the initiatives that we believe will drive returns and growth and we\u2019re running great operations so that when people come in, they have a world-class experience and they want to come back. I think we do all those things right. We\u2019ll continue to be rewarded with customers\u2019 business and we\u2019ll continue to be rewarded with employee loyalty and engagement. So, we\u2019re optimistic about the various initiatives we have in our stage-gate process and how we\u2019re going to attack growth going forward. But what we\u2019re really zeroed in is, how do we make sure we run great operations, do the right initiatives, and then give the consumer the message that makes them feel good about being a part of Chipotle, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll get rewarded with sales and transactions. How that plays out, we\u2019ll update you guys quarterly.","Greg Badishkanian","Alright. Thank you.","Brian Niccol","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Brian, you mentioned a few areas of focus for 2019, I\u2019m just wondering as you internally I guess, think about measuring success. I mean, you\u2019re more focused, do you think on the comp to kind of drive kind of acceleration in traffic or do you think about it more as you\u2019ve got the comp momentum back and are you focused more on the margin, just trying to think if this comp upside to \u201819 versus the mid-single digit level, especially because you\u2019re off to a strong start with the initiatives kicking in whether or not you\u2019d be reinvesting that in a variety of initiatives you have or the initiatives really require stage-gating, and therefore, there would be more flow through the margins and earnings in \u201819, if you would have beat that the comp expectation?","Brian Niccol","Yes. Look, obviously we\u2019re concerned about both, is the way I would respond to your question. We want to invest in the business so that we continue to drive momentum in sales and transactions because the best \u2013 look the best leverage for the economic model here is growing sales and transactions. We do that well, our margins will expand. At the same token, I think this is kind of to somebody\u2019s question earlier, where there\u2019s opportunities to be efficient or take some of the upside to the bottom line, if we don\u2019t have an investment vehicle that would suggest you should go reinvesting, will take it to the bottom line. So, the thing I\u2019m excited about though at Chipotle is, we\u2019ve got a lot of levers and we\u2019re validating with those levers at work through the stage-gate process, whether it\u2019s a delivery program, a loyalty program, a menu innovation or an ops initiative around throughput. We\u2019re starting to better understand how these things play out, both from a top-line and then how it flows to the bottom line, and we\u2019re going to continue to fund that balancing act. Because ultimately, and I think Jack has talked about this in the past, we want to get back to that 24, 25 with margins that would be best-in-class at 24 and 25. So, we\u2019re really striving towards doing both.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Got it. Just because you mentioned the delivery and the loyalty in the menu, it seems like you have a variety of initiatives at various stages of rollout as we think about \u201919. And as you started \u2013 like you started in the year strong, it seems like you are back into it maybe December was up in the 10% range. So, obviously, there\u2019s some nuances in short-term trends, but you\u2019re starting very strong. I\u2019m just wondering whether you\u2019re expecting the comp to accelerate through the year or whether for some reason get posting some things and some things out that we shouldn\u2019t expect comps to accelerate through 2019 versus where they are today?","Brian Niccol","Yes, look I think we talked about this, right, the fourth quarter, we definitely saw a trend change with the combination of I think improving operations, more penetrated digital system, delivery having more coverage and being more visible about the point of difference in Chipotle. We\u2019re going to keep doing that in 2019, because we believe those are the right strategies to engage with our customers in a unique way.","So, what I would say is, we feel really good about the strategies and the programs we have in place. The trick for us in 2019 is executing those with excellence, so that we maximize with each of those at work. But I know \u2013 I think it\u2019s really important for people to understand it\u2019s a multi lever that we\u2019ve got going on here, great operations, a great digital system, more visible marketing that is more resonant than we have been in the past, coupled with some smart innovation, both done in digital and in the menu. So, we\u2019re going to continue to drive that. It served as well in \u201818 and we believe it\u2019s going to continue to serve as well in \u201819.","Jeffrey Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Andy Barish","Yes, just a couple of points on the physical plan. Chipotle lane, are you \u2013 those new builds as well as remodels? And then secondly, on the new stores, could you discuss kind of a recent performance history on new store openings relative to the $2 million system average where those stores are kind of coming in?","Brian Niccol","Sure. So, your question on the Chipotle lanes, it is really a new build effort. We are going to do one or two kind of remodel efforts. But the emphasis of this is going to be really a new build approach going forward, at least that\u2019s what our learnings would suggest today. And then your question on the economics around our new openings, they continue to really perform with great opening volumes, as well as terrific returns both on a one-year and two-year basis. Jack, I don\u2019t know if you want to add any \u2013 ","Jack Hartung","Yes, just Andy, I would say it\u2019s relative to some of the best results we\u2019ve had historically, meaning there are about 80% or even a little bit higher than what our existing mature stores are and so it\u2019s right where we hoped it would be. You might remember a few years ago, we had fallen down to about 70% of the average mature store, so we closed that gap and the quality really is really, really attractive. The team\u2019s done a great job.","Andy Barish","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Andrew Charles","Great, thanks. Just Jack one quick housekeeping question, and then Brian, one question for you. Should we interpret mid-single digit same-store sales guidance for 2019 to mean 4% to 6% or 3% to 5%? And then Brian, why doesn\u2019t the effect just play devil\u2019s advocate? What is the effectiveness of the marketing spending you saw in 4Q that 4.2%, what does that lead you to rethink the 3% of marketing spend budget plan for 2019 is clearly efforts are working? Thanks.","Jack Hartung","Yes, just a housekeeping real quick, when I say mid low is 1%, 2%, 3%, mid is 4%, 5%, 6%, so I\u2019m saying somewhere in that 4%, 5%, 6% range.","Brian Niccol","And yes, your question regard to marketing as a percent of sales. The \u2013 I think the way we thought about this is, how do we have a communication program that will get the brand to be visible, where we want when we want, and to Chris and the teams\u2019 credit, as they\u2019ve looked at the existing budget, we don\u2019t see a problem with being able to allocate those dollars in such a way where we can be, where we want, when we want and how we want to show up. I think we mentioned this in the past, if we find ourselves in a place where look there\u2019s an opportunity for us to go beyond the 3%, we\u2019re not afraid to go do it. But as of right now, we believe reallocating the budget is the better way to go to optimize result we\u2019re looking for right now. But Chris appreciates that question, I\u2019m sure. So, thanks for the question.","Andrew Charles","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we\u2019ve reached the end of today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Brian Niccol","Okay. Well, thank you everybody for taking the time. I just want to reiterate again, how proud I am of the culture we\u2019re creating here, the leadership team that we\u2019ve put in place over the last 9 months to 10 months, and the fact that our reorganization a lot of it is behind us and what we\u2019re really focused on now is executing our strategies, so that we show up for our customers where they want us, how they want us, and then for our team members, that we continue to develop them, grow them and get the opportunities of growth. I think Chipotle is a one of a kind brands and our goal here going forward is continue to drive that one of the kindness with customers and everybody that chooses to be a part of Chipotle.

On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Mark Shambura, Director of Brand Marketing; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer; and Curt Garner, Chief Information Officer.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. Our sales recovery that began midway through the first quarter continued at a modest pace in the second quarter and we saw a return to profitability along with the opening of 58 new restaurants.","During the second quarter, we generated total revenue of $998 million. Our sales comp improved by 6% from the first quarter to a negative 23.6% for the quarter. As a result of promotional activities, we are seeing slightly better improvements in comparable traffic with customer traffic down 20% for the quarter. While we would like to see the sales recovery occurring more quickly we're optimistic our Chiptopia Summer Rewards Program, which launched on July 1, will encourage more guests to visit our restaurants and that this will help lead to a sustained higher sales recovery.","Though the program is just a few weeks old, we're already seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. We are seeing further improvement in both comparable restaurant sales and transactions with comp sales down about 21% in July and traffic improving so that it is now down to a negative mid-teens for July so far.","Diluted earnings per share was $0.87 for the quarter, down from $4.45 earned in the second quarter of last year. While our unit economic model has been significantly affected by the sales hit, it continues to fully fund our current level of new restaurant growth.","Last week, Chipotle celebrated its 23rd anniversary. Throughout our history, we have been working hard to change the way people think about any fast food. And as we have grown into a national brand, we have cultivated and been supported by a very loyal customer base. As customers have fallen in love with Chipotle, they have also placed an extraordinary level of trust in us and have come to know that we will do the right thing when it comes to our food, our employees and our approach to running our business. Through the food safety events we faced last year, we lost some of that trust.","Our customers have come to expect a lot from us to prepare, cook and serve fresh delicious food while pushing the envelope to encourage farming and ranching practices that respect animals and the environment and the people who raise the ingredients we use. We're committed to exceeding our customers' expectations and restoring their confidence that we will deliver upon our promises.","While there are no quick solutions to restoring trust and bringing our sales back to previous levels, we're focused on a number of activities which will continue to emphasize driving traffic in the near term and increasing customer frequency. We will also focus on longer-term brand messaging and on advancing our Food With Integrity efforts, which have been key to building trust and loyalty with customers over the years. But the best thing that we can do in the near term is to encourage customers to come back into our restaurants and to ensure that our restaurant teams are delivering an extraordinary dining experience on each and every customer visit.","In the first half of the year, we have invested more heavily than ever in marketing and promotional activity and those investments are beginning to pay off. Since the CDC's investigation into Chipotle concluded in February, we have done a number of things. First, we launched our largest ever mobile offer and to our largest ever direct-mail program. Second, we introduced a new menu item, chorizo, and we expect to have it in all of our restaurants by the end of the year. Third, we created our first-ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia. And fourth, we launched a new animated short film in an effort to help customers appreciate what is unique about Chipotle. Collectively, these efforts, along with excellent operations are bringing customers back into our restaurants and our teams are working hard to provide an extraordinary experience in all of our restaurants every day.","The introduction of a new menu item such as chorizo is unusual for us. As you know, we have always maintained a very focused menu and rarely changed it. Instead, we focused on doing just a few things in our restaurants so that we can do them better than anybody else. But we have never ruled out additions or changes to the menu, and chorizo is one of the few changes that we have made to the menu in 23 years.","Our chorizo is made with a blend of responsibly-raised pork and chicken seasoned with paprika, toasted cumin and Chipotle peppers. We sear the chorizo in our restaurants to give it a perfect char and we believe it's a great addition to our menu. It gives customers another option and one that has been well received, accounting for approximately 6% to 7% of entr\u00e9e sales in the restaurants where it's available.","During the quarter, we also resumed serving locally grown produce in all of our restaurants. Typically, our local program for produce runs the summer and early fall months, during the time that makes up the local growing season for much of the country. As we look to establish Chipotle as a leader in food safety, it's also important to us that we remain true to our commitment to serving Food With Integrity, including locally grown produce.","Through a partnership with PrimusLabs, funded by Chipotle, we are working with local growers to make certain that they can achieve our high standards for food safety and we are auditing any farms that we work with to be sure they are compliant with all of our rigorous safety standards. Initially, as we layer in new local produce suppliers that have met our new food safety standards, our local produce program will have fewer farm partners than it did in the past year but as we scale the program in the coming years, we'll have more local farms participating in the program than ever before.","We're also working hard to achieve our goal of eliminating the very last artificial additives from our tortillas. Tortillas are the only food item on Chipotle's menu that contain any additives, which include a minimal number of preservatives and dough conditioners. While we have made significant strides in reducing the number of additives in our tortillas to date, the goal is to achieve a simple recipe with only a few ingredients, much like tortillas made in the more traditional way that includes wheat flour, vegetable oil, water, salt and starter for the flour tortillas.","Finally, I'd like to address recent headlines surrounding Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Creative and Development Officer. We were surprised to learn of these personal issues and placed Mark on a leave of absence. We believe this will allow us to remain focused on our work and our efforts to serve great tasting food, to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience and to continue winning back our customers.","One of the cornerstones of our people culture is to build top-performing teams, Mark certainly had accomplished that in our development and marketing teams, and we have the utmost confidence in those teams and the people who lead them. And we know that they will do an excellent job running those departments. In Mark's absence, we have asked Mark Shambura, our Director of Brand Marketing, to lead our marketing team and Carolyn Anderson, Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design, to lead our development efforts. And we have asked Curt Garner, who joined us as CIO late last year to lead our e-commerce team.","Mark Shambura joined our marketing team in 2013 but his experience with Chipotle goes back further than that. Mark led our team at CAA Marketing from 2009 to 2011 working on some of the first innovative branded content programs including the animated short Back to the Start, and also worked on the development of our Cultivate Food, Music and Ideas festivals. In his role as Brand Director of Marketing, Mark already has been overseeing several critical marketing functions including all brand planning, content programs, digital \u2013 which includes web, mobile and social \u2013 and promotion and events.","Carolyn Anderson began working with Chipotle 20 years ago as an outside vendor in charge of facilities management. She joined us as National Facilities Manager in 2005 and was promoted to Facilities Director in 2008 where she was able to streamline our reinvest efforts to create programs to empower our restaurant managers to be better stewards of their restaurant, leading to substantially lower maintenance and repair costs.","Carolyn's leadership and the exceptional work she and her team were doing led to her promotion to Director of Facilities and Construction in 2012 and again in 2014 to a promotion to Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design. She has proven in building top-performing teams that have paved the way to redefine development's roles and responsibilities, and she has been critical to developing and executing our strategies surrounding sustainability, food safety and increasing our cash-on-cash returns for new restaurants.","Curt Garner has been involved with our e-commerce team since he came on board last November and has been extremely valuable as a member of the management team over just the past nine months. Curt oversees all of our information technology infrastructure and its impact on future sales channels. So shifting our entire pipeline out of store sales projects to Curt's guidance has been very natural fit.","We are confident in the current strategic direction of these teams and have full faith and confidence in Mark, Carolyn and Curt's abilities to deliver great results.","I'll now turn the call over to Monty.","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Thank you, Steve. As we work to bring customers back to our restaurants and to reinforce Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety, it's never been more important to have top-performing teams in our restaurants and among our field leadership. It's the strength of our people culture and our teams that has allowed us to quickly implement many new programs in food safety as well as marketing.","To be sure that our restaurant teams are aligned around our current priorities and that their efforts are directed at the right things, we have realigned some of the success measures for restaurant managers and teams and we're tying incentives increasingly for our most urgent priorities of having an exceptional guest experience, as well as effective local store marketing.","We've also changed the prerequisite to becoming a restauranteur, placing a greater emphasis on measuring the guest experience, business fundamentals and food safety compliance. Historically, these measures have always been important but we are emphasizing them even more and providing additional tools and training to be sure our restaurants are exceptional in achieving these high standards. We've also changed how we calculate our manager bonuses to reward excellence in these metrics with the greatest emphasis on food safety.","This renewed focus on an excellent guest experience, local store marketing, food safety and business fundamentals will be the means by which restaurant managers are eligible to be interviewed for restauranteur. Once they meet these green fees, as we call them, they are interviewed as before to determine if they have a team of all top performers and power to achieve high standards. Historically, these fundamentals were always important to becoming a restauranteur but our audits for them have become more specific and rigorous, and our expectations for their achievement more stringent. The added focus we applied to that part of the process is already paying off in terms of generating sound business fundamentals in our restaurant and the improved food safety audits that we're seeing.","During the quarter, we made significant progress completing the implementation of an industry-leading traceability system which will be fully implemented in all of our restaurants by the end of this month. Already the traceability program has been rolled out in more than 1,900 restaurants. This has been a significant undertaking to put in place and we're very pleased to be so close to completion of this industry-leading food safety enhancement.","Prior to this year, we had traceability in place between our suppliers and our distribution centers, and from the distribution centers we could trace ingredients to our restaurants using ordering and distribution data. But the significance of this state-of-the-art traceability system is that we will have the ability to know exactly which supplier we got any particular food item from, as well as the lot number of all produce, meat, Sofritas, beans, salsas, dairy and tortillas that are received in our restaurant.","The system uses barcodes on every package to allow it to be traced from the supplier to restaurant the same way that overnight delivery services trace package shipments all over the world. This system is another significant way that Chipotle is becoming an industry leader in food safety because it gives us the ability to quickly investigate food quality issues in our supply chain or immediately remove food from our supply chain that we may find not up to our high standards.","This September we will host our biennial All Managers Conference. This year's conference will include restaurant managers, field leaders, operations leadership and select individuals from support departments. The content for this year's conference will be focused on helping our restaurant teams to create an excellent guest experience and teach them to more effectively market their individual restaurants. This conference is an excellent forum to reinvigorate our restaurant teams and ensure that they are totally focused on the things that will most powerfully allow Chipotle to achieve its goals.","On the development front, our openings continue to be on pace with our guidance for 2016. We have opened 116 restaurant so far this year, which is about half of our total planned openings of 220 to 235. We are pleased that we have a strong pipeline of real estate locations under consideration. But as I explained last quarter, we will continue to be judicious in evaluating those locations in light of the current operating environment with an eye towards delivering strong returns.","We've refocused our real estate team on assessing future openings with a more conservative lens that takes into account our current economic model, particularly given recent changes to our average unit volumes. We have also temporarily shifted markets into our developing markets category in order to direct our new store investments towards markets with the strongest track record of opening sales. This may slightly temper the number of openings in these markets in the near term as we look to rebuild our sales momentum and will help us ensure strong new store productivity.","The impact from this is primarily on where we open new stores with a minimal impact on the total opening. Because the real estate pipeline is inherently long term in nature, some of our efforts to reprioritize our market mix will not be realized until late in 2017. Of course, we will update you in the coming months as to how many restaurants we do expect to open in 2017.","We're also working to strengthen the returns in our new restaurants by optimizing our average investment cost. This year, we will realize some cost savings through a collaborative effort between our design and procurement function. In addition, our real estate team has been able to find an increasing number of great sites with strong landlord work letters, providing for landlords to invest more in our build-out costs. The benefit of these efforts translates to an average investment cost that is shaping up to be around $800,000 for 2016 in spite of increased market pressures on materials and labor.","The strength of our teams continues to be our key advantage. Top-performing teams allow us to take on new tasks more rapidly than others might be able to integrate and to create the great restaurant experiences that drive more traffic to our restaurants and delight our customers. We are confident that our teams will lead our recovery through this difficult time in our history such that we will emerge a stronger brand as a result of these challenging times and allow us to provide excellent value for our shareholders as well as the many additional stakeholders who benefit from our successful achievement of our vision.","I'll now turn the call to Mark.","Mark Shambura - Director of Brand Marketing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Monty. Throughout the quarter, we continued to heighten our marketing initiatives to drive sales and increase positive perception of our brand. Through quantitative and qualitative research we've undertaken regarding purchasing habits, we have a better understanding of customers, their motivations and visitation patterns than we ever had before. We continue to increase promotional efforts more than we generally would because we think it's critical to reestablish contact and frequency among our guests so that they can recall how much they enjoy Chipotle.","In the last few months, we executed an integrated approach which included a number of different marketing activities. We launched our largest ever mobile and direct mail promotions, we introduced chorizo as a new menu item and we will have it in all of our restaurants before the end of the year. We developed and launched our first-ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia, and we'll be studying the initial three-month program to help us develop a more lasting rewards program.","We maintained a larger ongoing advertising presence than usual and we launched a new animated short film, A Love Story, to support Chiptopia which was aimed at reminding and inspiring our fans and attracting new customers. It's already been viewed in totality more than 17 million times with support from PR, paid digital and social media buy, along with placement on more than 10,000 movie screens. These marketing activities are an important part of our strategy to help drive our sales recovery and we are seeing encouraging results in the consumer research.","In a June 2 survey by YouGov, for example, consumer perception for Chipotle turned positive for the first time since November. While sentiment is not back to where it was prior to these issues, it shows movement in the right direction. This improving sentiment is also supported by our own ongoing brand health tracking study which shows consistent upward trends since mid-January's all-time lows. During the second quarter, we saw modest improvement in consideration and admiration across key customer segments. And with Millennials 18 to 34, the key customer group for us, we continue to see they have the most favorable opinion of Chipotle.","During the first quarter, new customer acquisition was down from the previous quarter but we saw improvement in this area in the second quarter and a trend in new customer acquisition which we can directly attribute to our aggressive promotional offers.","While we still have work to do to increase key brand metrics and traffic volumes, we have a very full slate of marketing programs planned for the remainder of the year that we believe will continue to support our recovery.","The first phase of our recovery plan, which began in February and which we are just coming out of, focused on winning back our customers. Based on the data we have, we believe that the majority of our most loyal customers have returned but many of them are not coming as frequently as they used to.","The second phase of our recovery plan, which we are in the early stages of now, continues our win back strategy but adds a focus on increasing frequency and attracting new customers. Programs such as Chiptopia Summer Rewards and Love Story are aimed at helping us achieve these objectives.","Just three weeks after launching the Chiptopia program, we have more than 3.6 million participants and are seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. This is a significant start to the program and we anticipate our participant levels to continue to increase over the coming weeks. Most importantly, we are seeing growth in the number of guests that are visiting Chipotle at a run rate of more than 24 visits per year, our most frequent customer tier. These increased visits have helped the top line and have grown our traffic comp by about 5 points from June. It's still very early to draw conclusions on the long-term sustainability of these trends but every incremental visit from a customer provides an opportunity for us to further restore trust.","All of these programs are helping to change the conversation about Chipotle. Q2 social sentiment is at 93% of the level it was pre-crisis and the response to our Love Story film has been extremely well received: 80% of consumer conversation is positive. Overall, our marketing awareness is at its highest since Q1 2015.","Lastly, according to a survey by Ace Metrix, A Love Story is the highest scoring QSR ad they've ever tested, delivering strong results on breakthrough, which means high attention and likeability relevant to other measures, as well as change, meaning viewers feel strongly that the brand is moving in a new direction. The survey indicates that the film delivered strongly not only with our brand loyalists but also with lapsed customers and brand considerers.","For the remainder of the year, our marketing programs will continue at a robust pace. Among the programs you can expect to see in the coming months are ongoing emphasis on advertising and digital content to highlight our commitment to using high-quality ingredients and preparing food using classic cooking techniques just as we have always done without cutting corners, and new content demonstrating how Chipotle has become a leader in food safety; targeted promotion inviting groups like students and families; the national rollout of chorizo by the end of the year; our annual Burrito Halloween promotion which will have a charitable component with our Cultivate Foundation; a holiday promotion and a gift card incentive program, continued improvements to our mobile and e-commerce programs and continued emphasis on restaurant level marketing, which allows our restaurant managers to delight customers on a very local and individual basis.","We are encouraged by the progress we are making to improve sentiment about our brand and drive traffic to our restaurants. While we recognize that there is a lot more work to be done to restore confidence, we believe we have the right programs and the right teams in place to improve in these areas.","I will now turn the call over to Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Mark. The sales comp in the second quarter showed modest improvement from the trends we reported in April when we reported that comps were running in the negative 26% range. We'd like to see the sales recovery happen more quickly but we are as committed as ever to do all we can to reengage with our customers to restore their trust in Chipotle and reestablish customer frequency.","The first half of 2016 has been focused on establishing and executing industry-leading food safety practices along with aggressive offers to invite our customers to return to Chipotle. As we begin the second half of 2016, we are optimistic about engaging our customers at a deeper level, going beyond basic, broad-based free food offers with things like Chiptopia, with branding efforts that are uniquely Chipotle such as the Love Story video, rolling out chorizo, and continuing to show leadership in food quality by removing the few remaining artificial ingredients from our food.","Although it's very early, we're optimistic about the customer engagement with Chiptopia so far. Over 3.6 million actual or digital cards have been issued and, as Steve mentioned, nearly 30% of all transactions are engaged in Chiptopia. Sales comps over the past two weeks have improved to down 20% to 21%, in that range, but importantly transactions have improved from down 20% in June to down 15% during the first half of July, an improvement of 500 basis points.","Our main objective with Chiptopia is to reward and incentivize our loyal customers who have decreased their frequencies since late last year and to restore their visit frequency back to their previous levels. Our research has shown that most of our loyal customers have returned to Chipotle but not at the same frequency, so Chiptopia is targeted at those customers, and the early frequency results are very encouraging. In fact, since Chiptopia began July 1, we've seen a 90% increase in the number of customers who visit 2.5 times or more each week compared to June. We've seen a 200% increase in the number of customers coming in from 2 times to 2.5 times per week compared to June. And we've seen a 140% increase in the number of customers who visit between 1 time and 2 times each week compared to June.","So we're off to a great start with Chiptopia so far. We'll continue to engage and encourage our customers to visit often during entire the three-month program and when our restaurant teams delights them with delicious food and great service we have a great shot at maintaining or even improving these reestablished higher frequency levels.","The average check has declined slightly during July by nearly 3% versus June as many customers have already redeemed their free chips and guac for registering in Chiptopia or they've redeemed their free burritos for earning frequency status. Some customers are spending a little less on extras. There's only a $6 minimum purchase price in Chiptopia and we're also seeing a slightly smaller group size.","One important note in the accounting for Chiptopia, although the program is intended to last for three months ending September 30, there will be rewards available to be redeemed in the fourth quarter or beyond. Therefore, at the end of the third quarter, GAAP accounting requires that we defer a portion of the revenue from the third quarter into the fourth quarter or later when the awards are ultimately redeemed or the awards expire. It's not possible to project what that deferral might look like right now but we'll fully explain the impact during our third quarter earnings call.","Our entire company is eager to see the sales recovery happen even faster in all restaurants and all markets throughout the country. Many of you on the call today probably feel the same way. While we'd certainly like to be further along, there are signs that the recovery is well on its way and continues to march along. The company-wide July sales comp of down approximately 20% along with the July TC comp down about 15% has come a long way from the low point in January when sales were down 36% and TCs were down 34%. July so far represents a recovery versus a low point in January of 42% on lost sales, meaning that we've recovered 42% of lost sales from January, and we've recovered 53% of the transactions that we lost in January. So, most of our markets across country are further along than this in the recovery. For example in Middle America, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and the Southwest, which combined account for nearly two-thirds of our comp restaurants, the comp sales are down about 18% and the comp TCs are down 13% in July. This represents a recovery rate versus January of 46% on sales and nearly 60% on TCs. Our best market in the country is in Ohio where comp sales are down just 12% and TCs are down just 6% in July.","We still have a ways to go but we're making progress. Unfortunately, the recovery is not as far along in the Northeast and on the West Coast where comp sales are still down around 26% and comp TCs are down around 21% in July. Of course, these are the areas closest to the events of last year and so the recovery is just not as far along as it is in the rest of the country. In fact, sales recovery for the Northeast and the West Coast combined is only 35% and TC recovery is about 45% when comparing July to the January lows.","We returned to profitability during the quarter with EPS of $0.87 per share. Of course, fully restoring our earnings power is highly dependent on the pace and the magnitude of the sales recovery, which remains a top priority for us.","Running through the P&L for the quarter, we reported $998 million in sales, a decrease of 17% versus the second quarter 2015. We generated restaurant level operating margin of 15.5% in the quarter, which is down from the second quarter 2015 but up sequentially from the first quarter of 2016.","During the second quarter, sales deleverage contributed about 800 basis points of pressure compared with Q2 of 2015. Food costs were 34.2% in the quarter, up 110 basis points from the prior year. Underlying inflation was minimal during the quarter as increased supplier costs for our new preparation of tomatoes, lettuce and steak along with food waste more than offset last year's small increased menu prices and lower stock pricing for paper and beef.","Food waste added about 70 basis points as we are still inefficient with some of the new procedures and we're still navigating through ordering and prepping the right amount of food at the right time, especially surrounding promotions. Looking at the rest of the year, we anticipate food costs will remain at right about the same level as any efficiencies we achieve are likely to be offset by higher avocado pricing in Q3.","Labor expenses during the quarter were 27.7% of sales compared to 22.6% during the second quarter of 2015. Nearly all of this drop or about 450 basis points is due to sales deleverage. The remaining increase is due to labor inflation offset by better labor scheduling this year versus Q2 of last year. In Q2 of last year, we had a system reporting issue which led to elevated labor scheduling. Our underlying labor inflation is running at about 6% while hourly wage inflation is closer to 9%.","Occupancy costs were 7.2% of sales, higher as a percent of sales by 180 basis points, all of it related to sales deleverage. Other operating costs were 15.2%, up from 10.9% during the second quarter of 2015 driven by deleverage and higher marketing and promo activity. Marketing costs during the quarter were 2.7% of sales and promo activity added 1.6% of sales for a total of 4.3% combined compared to 2.3% last year. Our investment in marketing and promo will remain at elevated levels as we continue to aggressively engage with our customers to regain their trust and loyalty.","G&A expenses were $70.8 million in the quarter, which was virtually identical to last year's expenses of $70.2 million. A few months ago, we made the decision to temporarily hold off on hiring any new G&A head count in an effort to manage our support costs during challenging times. Instead, we've narrowed the focus of all of our support teams to only those efforts which will lead to safer food, a better restaurant experience for our guests or increase sales. Our teams have stepped up to the challenge and are supporting a greater number of restaurants without adding resources and are focusing the vast majority of their efforts on those three things: food safety, the guest experience and sales building.","Of course, we continue to hire at the restaurant level to support our new restaurants and ensure every restaurant is fully staffed and ready to delight our customers when they visit. As a percentage of sales, G&A expenses increased 120 basis points to 7.1% of sales due entirely to sales deleverage. Underlying G&A for the next two quarters will remain at about this level but the third quarter will include the incremental cost of All Manager Conference, which is expected to be around $10 million.","Our pre-tax income was $41.7 million and our tax rate during the quarter was 38.6%. For the full year 2016, we also estimate our effective tax rate will be about 38.6% compared to 38.2% in 2015, a slightly higher tax rate as a results of higher state taxes.","During the second quarter and through yesterday, we repurchased $117 million of CMG shares at an average price of $438. We generated cash from operations of $118 million during the quarter and we continue to maintain more than $600 million in cash and investment. As we work to restore customer trust and restore our earnings capability, we still have the ability to fund our growth and buyback our stock optimistically. As of today, we have $123 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","These are challenging times, the most challenging we've ever faced. Our company is committed to restoring customer trust. recovering customer visits and restoring our economic model to its full potential, which we believe will position us to add significant shareholder value for a very long time.","Thank you for your time today and we'll be happy to open the lines for the questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. I just want to better understand the strategy of your new loyalty program, Chiptopia, because with the comps still down over 20%, I guess the impact to the overall trend of the business does seem pretty muted despite all the data that you talked about including 30% of transactions using it. Can you just comment on the reasoning behind why the strong data isn't necessarily having a bigger impact on the recovery? And secondarily, what's the plan when summer is over regarding loyalty? Are you going to maybe switch to something that's aimed less at those that have already come back and maybe more at regaining those that you've lost? Thanks.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the program has only been around for less than three weeks and the first week had a holiday weekend which we saw some pretty choppy enrollment during that time with the 4th of July being closed and the buildup to the 4th of July, it's just not a regular transaction or sales builder for us. Since then, we've seen a very regular engagement. We've seen a very regular ramp-up of people that are participating in the program. We have significant \u2013 every single day, we have over 100,000 people that are added to the program. The majority of them are registered in the program. And we've seen significant repeat visits. We've seen like 28% of the people that are enrolled, they're engaged in Chiptopia, have come back a second time. So we're seeing saying exactly the results we had hoped that our already loyal customers who had reduced their visits after the results of \u2013 or after the events of last year are coming in more often.","We're hopeful that will happen is as we get into the end of this month \u2013 and, by the way, there's an incentive for people to come back more often as the months close because each month account towards earning the big end-of-program awards. And so achieving a level in July is the starting point, then it starts over. Basically, now you need to achieve that same level in August and then September. So it's very, very early and so we're optimistic that we got a 500 basis point impact in effectively less than three weeks.","In terms of what's going forward, after this, we're going to watch this very closely, we're going to learn from it. We're going to find out what works, what doesn't work both for our customers and for our teams in the restaurants. And we anticipate we will have another program. We just don't know yet whether it will be another temporary program, will it be a permanent program? But it's very, very likely that we'll have something to follow on when Chiptopia ends at the end of September.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I guess, a couple of questions on Chiptopia as well. The improvement in July, you gave us sequential improvement in June, is some of that showing the benefit from the year-over-year comparison? If so, how much? And the GAAP widening between transactions and same-store sales, should we read into that the cost of Chiptopia is going to be rather high? And the last one on Chiptopia, and the last one, as you roll it out, are there learnings about the technology framework within the company? And do you have a sense that you have to invest more heavily in technology either on the expense side or CapEx side over the next couple of years?","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Joe, I'll take a shot at these. The first question was about the comparison. The comparison is not easier in July. In fact, if anything, the comparison is tougher in July. So we feel good about the 500 basis points of improvement so far.","In terms of the average check, it's only down less than 3% in July. We had a gap even before July started, Joe, and a lot of that was due to lower group size. It's also due to the fact that we've had promos throughout the last few months as we tried to earn customers back. With the less than 3% that we're seeing in July so far, right about half of that is due to the retention of awards, that was part of the program.","We were prepared to offer compelling incentives to get people signed up, and so all you have to do is come in, get a card. You don't even have to register yet and you'll free chips and guac. A lot of those have been redeemed already. The fact that there's a lot of redemption of burritos already means that our customers are marching through the levels. They're already earning Mild status. A bunch of them have earned Medium status. And believe it or not, within the 12 or 13 days, we have thousands of people that had earned the Hot status, which means they came 11 times already and you can't come more than twice in a day. So you have to come basically 11 days and people had already been part of the program within the first 12 or 13 days that we were open. So, the redemption of awards we totally expected that.","The other thing we did on purpose, we had a pretty low threshold where if you came in and spent $6, which basically means come in and get a burrito, you'll be part of the program. Again, Joe, our objective was to get as many visits as possible, the idea there being, once we get people in the restaurants and if we can delight them with a terrific experience we have a shot at keeping them. And so we didn't want set a high threshold and so that has contributed to folks participating without all the add-ons, without the drinks and things like that.","So the average check, we are ready for that and we think gaining the customer visit is most important and we'll work on the average check later. And then, in terms of technology, I don't know if Curt is on the phone. I think the question, Joe, was have we learned something about technology and do we have to make significant investments in technology going forward with our customer?","Curtis Evander Garner - Chief Information Officer","Hi, Joe. This is Curt. Chipotle has got some great technology assets already in place with the mobile app that's very popular in the marketplace and in-store technology that's very capable. I think \u2013 and certainly we're committed to continuing to innovate and build upon those experiences and reduce friction in the customer experience with them. I think the great opportunity that we have going forward as we look at investment is capitalizing upon these programs to understand the incredible amount of data that we now have available to us as our customers engage in programs like Chiptopia. We're already starting to see some significant insights and learnings from that data and I think there's an opportunity for us to continue to do more in that space around personalization and other ordering capabilities that will, again, remove friction for our customers.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Just two related questions on the comp. One, in terms of the recovery, you mentioned a couple times that maybe the pace was slower than you had initially expected. I'm just wondering what you believe the greatest impediment or frustration is with the survey work you've done or learnings or whatnot, and whether or not you feel confident in that full recovery or whether that just seems harder to see at this time? And the second one was just how would you define success with the comp? I'm just wondering going from here, it seems like you are down 21% in July. What's the pace of expected improvement in 3Q? How do you think about the 4Q comparison? I'm just trying to define what success might be. Thanks.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Jeff, success to us is getting all the sales back. The timeframe, we can't predict what that is. We're frustrated that we're further along but there's never been a case like this. Any of the case studies that we looked at in the past just didn't have the amount of publicity and didn't have things like what happened in March where nothing happened and yet there was a news story about somebody \u2013 or that some of our crew that didn't work because they were ill, didn't show up to work, no customers got sick, and yet that turned into a news story. So it's been frustrating that there have been things beyond our control where things had worked perfectly well and we followed all our protocols, and yet that still caused our recovery to see a setback. So it's been challenging and frustrating but our objective is to fully win all of our customers back. How long it will take, we just don't know.","In terms of some of the things we've learned on why it's been slower, we know that we have to build our customer trust back. A lot of the research has told us that customers are looking for more information. They're looking for a longer time period where nothing happens. And so, so far, so good in that. Mark had mentioned this. I don't know if you picked up on it, that he and the team are starting to put together a strategy where we will communicate what we've done in a compelling way. It's not something that we're excited to talk about in terms of food safety but we're doing some amazing things. We're talking to some of the best experts or the best experts in the country and so we are doing things that are industry-leading and we are going to find a way to share that with customers so that they will \u2013 we can rebuild their trust back that it's okay to come back to Chipotle.","We're also going to continue to introduce things that make Chipotle special. And I don't know, Mark, if you want to talk more about that where we're going to talk about Food With Integrity, we're going to talk about what we're doing with ingredients and talk about the things that people have come to love about Chipotle.","Mark Shambura - Director of Brand Marketing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I think in addition to the content and communication specific to food safety, you're starting to see us get back into a pattern of the marketing that we used to do with A Love Story. We're adding new news with chorizo. We're adding new news with Chiptopia and trying to reclaim our voice with the Love Story film and begin to get back into a rhythm of new programs and new news that reminds our fans of the Chipotle they know and love, and introduce Chipotle brand to new people with efforts like A Love Story.","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff, for the question.","Operator","We'll go next to Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Two questions, if I may. One about the product and one about margin. First, on the product, obviously with all the changes you've made about in your supply chain, there's always some debate about whether people like it as much, whether the food just tastes as good as it did before you made some of these adjustments. The social media coverage varies on what people are saying. So I wanted to see if you had a view on that, whether that's played any role, a change in pace or perceptions on customers' traffic? That's one.","And then the second question I had was for Jack about margins. I'm trying to reconcile what we're seeing in your margin structure now versus historically, which is to say I think you suggested at the current run rate roughly $2 million AUV, restaurant margins are kind of where they are in the mid-teens. If I go back to 2011 when your volumes were around $2 million, your restaurant margins were 26%. So I understand that there's been inflation and you clearly have some food costs associated with it, but I'm just trying to understand where that \u2013 if there's any way to bridge that roughly 1,000 basis point gap between what your margins have looked like at these volumes in the past and what you're guiding to now?","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Sara, I'll start with the food and the taste of the food. So during the time of the incident last fall, we didn't know the cause and so we looked at every single ingredient that we were bringing into our restaurants. And working with a number of food safety experts, tried to understand what the risk of those items were. The individual items coming in and I'll just give you an example that I think illustrates sort of how things happen.","Take bell peppers, for instance. One of our experts said that it would be helpful if we could test the bell peppers before we bring them into the restaurant. Well the way to test them though is to slice them up in a central kitchen and then wash them, test them and then package them. That turned out to degrade the flavor. It does not taste as good as when our crews would expertly chop using a cutting board and a knife right there in front of the customer and then saut\u00e9ing. But in order to make sure that we had the highest food safety, we went right to the central kitchen. And we did this with a couple of other items also. And I fear that we probably did negatively impact the flavor and I think maybe some customers noticed that also.","We have reversed that though with bell peppers and other items because we have developed with our in-house food safety expert, Jim Marsden, a number of interventions that we put in place from the farm all the way through the distribution system and into the restaurants. And so, with peppers, for instance, we now have our crews blanche the peppers in boiling water which would completely eliminate any pathogen that might be on the surface because blanching doesn't actually cook the pepper because it's for such a short period of time, but it's plenty of time to kill any pathogen that may be on the surface. Our crew then goes with the old process of with a knife and a cutting board chopping right in front of the customer and then saut\u00e9ing as usual.","We did the same thing with lettuce. We put a number of interventions in place so we brought chopping lettuce back into the restaurant. And so we've returned, I think, our food to taste levels that were where we were before the crisis. But we're going beyond that and we're going beyond that in the elimination of preservatives and dough conditioners in our tortilla. If you look at the ingredients at Chipotle overall, it's a really, really clean ingredient list. And what do I mean by that? It doesn't have the kinds of things that are very hard to pronounce: preservatives and fillers and artificial flavors and artificial colors, all these kinds of things.","So once, in the fall, our tortillas are rid of the preservatives, we will be in an extraordinary position to tell people, our customers, about our very, very clean ingredient labels and be proud to display them. And I think that's not something typical fast food can do. So again, we're not only bringing the great taste that we had pre-crisis but we're continuing to push Food With Integrity in ways that are going to set industry standards.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And your customers, when you survey them, they recognize this and they kind of agree with your take on it?","Mark Shambura - Director of Brand Marketing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","They do. And in fact, Sara, our complaints amongst customers have actually gone down in terms of food complaints. So we feel very, very strongly about the quality of our food, the taste of our food and the customers' perception and satisfaction with the quality and taste.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer","Sara, on the margins, if you look at our 15.5% today and what's different then, it would've been a few years ago \u2013 and listen, I don't have the details of 2011, but I do know the pieces. There's about 300 basis points and, call it, 350 basis points are so, between 325 basis points, 350 basis points of what I would call nonrecurring expenses. Two hundred of that is in our marketing and promo. We're intentionally overspending on that line item and it's way above historic norms. There's another probably 125 basis points to 150 basis points or so of inefficiencies. We're wasting a lot of food. We're not very efficient with labor. And part of it is because we are taking on a lot of new procedures and that's been inefficient. We're being inefficient in terms of dealing with the promotions and we're tending to overstaff rather than understaffed. So that's in that 325 basis points to 350 basis points.","Food costs, I believe back then was probably in the 31% range or so, maybe even below that. There was a time when our food costs was in the 30% range. And so without the details in front of me, I'm guessing that was probably 300 basis points or so difference in food costs. And what's happened there is we just haven't raised prices very much over the years. Our model a year ago so it could handle a 34% food cost. With the deleveraging effects and all the efficiencies, the 34% food cost is a lot more painful today.","We also have labor inflation that has crept in since then, and I'm just guessing that's probably at least another 200 to 300 basis points. The labor inflation especially in the last year has been significant. We had intended to pass on the wage rates that we were seeing because of local pressures, because of raises in minimum wages, some of them very significant at $10, $12, $13, and we haven't really raised prices. We haven't passed on the cost of those higher wages. Probably a couple hundred basis points there.","We do have recurring food safety costs that you heard me talk about. We talked about that being in the maybe 200 basis point range. I think it's going to be better than that. I would say that's probably going to end up in the 100 to 150 basis point. Right now we've got about 150 in there. And so that's the only thing that's really what I said is an absolute permanent. So if you add these things up together, you're probably in that 1,000, 1,100 basis points or. So those are the items. We're very aware of the items.","We believe the most important thing we could do, we've lost 800 points because of deleverage. That's most of our focus this year, of course food safety first. Now, secondly is to recover our customers and we're doing that through offers, through Chiptopia, through branding, and then our focus, as Monty mentioned, is making sure that our customers have a wonderful experience when they come back because if we get our sales back, we get 800 basis points of margin. These other items though, we think we can chip away at these other items as well but we don't want to go after them aggressively until we've recovered as many or all of our customers. And once we've done that, then we know that we can make a lot of progress on these other margin items as well.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you. Good afternoon. What data are you collecting through the loyalty program? And what do you intend to do with it? And a follow-up, how is the turnover at the store level? And as you realign the incentives, is it changing? Or do you expect it to change? Thanks.","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Nicole, I think I'll take a shot of that and I don't know if Mark wants to add onto it. The single biggest thing we're doing is we can now match up specific customer behavior using credit card data and people's enrollment in Chiptopia and we've been able to go back, so far, we've gone back to June but we're going to go back to even a year ago before all these events happened to see the loyalty of our customers. We've got lots of outside data showing us what's happened to the loyalty of our customers.","So we're going to be able to do a better job of seeing those customers that were once loyal a year ago, they were coming twice a week or three times or four times a week and have dropped their visits now to once or twice a week, we're going to be able to see whether Chiptopia is bringing them back up to the two or three or four times a week that they visit. We've done that so far just going from June to July and we're very encouraged and I shared that data with you. We also now have greater engagement with a lot of the customers where we can actually reach out and market to them. And so we have a communication link that we have with our customers as well. And then, Mark, I don't know is there any other customer data that you...?","Mark Shambura - Director of Brand Marketing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I would focus mostly on \u2013 we used the data and the regression analysis to really hyper-target those who had descended in their frequency or those who had lapsed to make sure we could invite all of those people into the program. And now, we can match up those who are now in the program to determine what their return frequency level is and utilize all of that data we're mining there to help influence the evergreen loyalty program we are currently evaluating in the months to come.","Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","And then the other question was on turnover. Monty, I don't know if you wanted to comment on turnover?","Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director","Yeah. Our turnover is going various directions for different positions. The crew turnover right now is fairly high. It's in the 130%-plus range and our kitchen manager turnover has sneaked up a little bit, whereas the manager \u2013 or the general manager turnover has gone down quite a lot. And we've really targeted general manager turnover in particular. In an effort to try to reduce general manager turnover, we are making certain to communicate and understand exactly the reason for every single person turning over. And in fact, you need officer approval for a general manager to turnover at Chipotle because we want to have that intimate of an understanding as to why they turnover. So that system has really worked.","But we also implemented a similar program where any manager turnover is something that has to be approved by our team director, team directors in the company. And so we anticipate that we'll continue to work on that. We'll get a better understanding as to why some of the turnover is happening and continue to work on reducing turnover.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you.","Montgomery F.

Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Alexee, Manager of Investor Relations.","Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter of 2017. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation, I'll remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws.

On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Mark Crumpacker, Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Last December, I returned to the role of sole CEO, committed to restoring the operational excellence that made us successful. It's been a challenging year and the third quarter was no exception, but we are making meaningful progress. We're entering the fourth quarter with a positive sales trend that I believe demonstrates our strategy is paying off. During our prepared remarks today, we're going to share with you the progress we've made toward our goals and provide more details about our plans for the future.","Upon my return as sole CEO, I implemented a plan that realigned our organization toward the following five essential goals. Number one, deliver an excellent guest experience; number two, restore brand trust and drive sales; number three, foster innovation around the menu and the guest experience; number four, restore our economic model; and number five, strengthen our culture and recommit to our purpose.","In order to execute against these goals, we made changes to our board of directors, our officer team and our field operation structure. I'm pleased to report that the addition of four new board directors in December 2016 has been extremely productive, and they have provided excellent guidance as we execute against our strategy. Over the course of the year, we also made several very important additions to our officer team, including one that I'll announce today.","Over the last several months, we added Scott Boatwright as our Chief Restaurant Officer and Laurie Schalow as our Chief Communications Officer. Both Scott and Laurie have hit the ground running, and we'll hear from Scott directly about his progress toward improving our restaurant operations.","And today, I'm excited to announce that we have retained Mike Malanga to advise the Chipotle officer team and lead our development function. Mike has been consulting with us on key development initiatives over the past several months. He's been so insightful and added so much to the team that we asked him to expand our consulting engagement to lead the development team beginning immediately.","Mike will align our development organization with our long-term strategic goals and identify a permanent leader for development. He has more than 30 years of experience in development, most recently serving as Senior Vice President, Store Development, Americas at Starbucks. During his 12-year tenure there, Mike was responsible for all aspects of development, including real estate design, construction, facilities management, and lease administration.","Mike's addition will allow for Mark Crumpacker to focus on addressing our long-term customer strategy in his new role as Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer. Mark will oversee our marketing efforts and our strategic planning process. This will include oversight of our NEXT Team which is responsible for innovation of both menu and customer experience. Mark has been central to the development of the strategy against which we are currently executing, and he will share some details of our longer-term strategy later on the call.","These leadership changes are essential to achieve the strategic goals I outlined earlier, and we will continue to assess the need for additional leadership roles. With our strengthened board and officer team, we are successfully executing against our strategy. I'd like to provide some examples of the progress we've made against these goals we set a year ago. I'll give you a high-level summary, and then Scott, Mark, Curt, and Jack will go into specifics during their prepared comments.","We have improved operations throughout our organization by focusing our teams on the customer, redoubling our training efforts, and aligning manager and field leader compensation around customer-driven measures. Under Scott's leadership, we've streamlined our field leadership structure and clarified the roles of our field leaders and restaurant teams. Scott has our teams focused on the basics of running great restaurants, and he is delivering on a plan for operational excellence. We still have more work to do, but we're already seeing results in our restaurants.","We've also made important strides in restoring consumer trust and driving sales. Our third quarter saw the rollout of our largest ever television advertising campaign, which we used to promote queso. Not only did this campaign successfully change the narrative about Chipotle, early indications are that it's driving sales at the start of the fourth quarter. The marketing team continues to be focused on communicating our commitment to serving only the best, high-quality ingredients in the food we serve.","We also drove sales through our ongoing efforts to strengthen digital ordering, which continues to perform near record levels for us. Since implementing Smarter Pickup Times earlier this year, we've seen a 51% increase in digital orders. Because our digital orders are made on a second make line, it allows us to deliver excellent throughput and enhance the experience for our customers who are increasingly moving to digital ordering.","We've also made significant progress toward fostering innovation. During the year, we created the NEXT Team which is focused on innovations in the kitchen and restaurant design, the menu, and the guest experience. One notable effort of the NEXT Team is the addition of the NEXT Kitchen in Manhattan. The NEXT Kitchen allows us to test operational impact of potential new menu items prior to broader market testing, while at the same time providing some early indications of customer acceptance.","But the NEXT Team will also explore new strategic opportunities across the business, including how we incorporate digital technology into the guest experience. This could include developing a new digitally-forward restaurant design, a new remodel program, or exploring new customer segments and day parts.","We have also made significant progress in restoring our economic model. Clearly, the third quarter was very unusual due to non-recurring events that impacted our performance, including hurricanes that prompted the closure of hundreds of restaurants across three states, and the costs associated with the data security issue we saw earlier in the year.","In spite of these challenges, we closed the quarter on a positive note, with sales trends that we hope will continue during the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated revenue of $3.37 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the first three quarters of last year, with comparable restaurant sales growth of 8.3%.","Finally, I'd like to address the last strategic goal we've had for the year, which is strengthening our culture at Chipotle. It's always been my goal to prove that food could be served fast without being a typical fast food experience. Over time, as I learned more about how the ingredients we use are raised, we became a champion for ingredients raised with respect for the farmers, the animals, and the environment. Chipotle continues to lead in choosing ingredients without antibiotics or added hormones, buying local and organic produce when possible, rejecting genetically-engineered ingredients and eliminating industrial additives, including preservatives from our food.","Many of our employees work at Chipotle because we are a purpose-driven company, committed to choosing the harder right over the easier wrong, but we have a powerful opportunity to more strongly connect our employees and our customers to our purpose. I'm pleased to report that we are making significant progress towards strengthening this connection. We have reengaged our company with our values, connected them to our long-term strategic goals and begun working with all of our leaders to become champions for our purpose and for their teams. In doing so, we are continuing to reignite the passion our loyal customers have found in our brand.","Last quarter certainly presented its share of challenges and distractions, but we are responding to these challenges and are strengthening our company. We have built better, stronger teams, refined our strategy with a renewed focus on our guests, and committed to innovation inside our restaurants. I'm confident in our team's ability to return Chipotle on the path of success and sustainable growth for shareholders, all while remaining true to our purpose of cultivating nourished communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day.","I will now turn the call over to Scott Boatwright.","Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. A little over five months ago I joined Chipotle and I can't begin to explain how excited I am to be here. I spent my first few months physically working inside our restaurants and I traveled to meet our crew, our managers, and our field leaders. In my time in the field, I was able to observe the many things that make Chipotle truly special, the amount of real cooking we do every single day, and seeing the passion from our employees in this brand.","There is an immense amount of pride across Chipotle to bring real, wholesome food to our guests. I saw this passion again in late August when we held our biennial field leadership conference. I had the pleasure of meeting all of our field leaders from across the country. We discussed how the guest experience begins with leadership, specifically the role of the general managers and field leaders, as well as training inside of our restaurants. And we are removing the distractions and tasks that limit us from focusing on the guest. By narrowing the role of leadership and returning to a culture of training, we will deliver a consistently great guest experience across the country.","Through this time in the field, I have identified several opportunities for improvement. I have found the general manager and field leader roles to be unclear. And without defined roles and responsibilities, people are often distracted as they are not focused on the things that ladder to a great guest experience.","As the leaders of the brand, it is incumbent upon us to simplify what we are asking of our field teams. And while we have great training tools, we are not consistently using them. Our teams want to deliver an excellent guest experience and we must be singularly focused on building a culture to support that goal. The care in which we take in sourcing and prepping our ingredients must now be applied to the care and consideration for how our guests feel when they dine in our restaurants.","Fixing these opportunities will not require a revolutionary change. The solution is rooted in the way that Steve built our operations years ago. By focusing on the guest first, keeping things simple, and acting with an owner's mentality, we have outlined a plan to achieve these goals and are rolling out a number of changes.","Earlier this month, we reorganized our field leadership teams and operating structure to align our resources with our commitment toward leadership development and training. To add leadership support closer to our restaurants, we reduced the number of layers at the top of the field hierarchy and added more field leaders directly above our restaurants. This is more effective when managing large-scale operations, consistent with industry best practices. Our field leaders will be far more impactful when they are not stretched too thin with too many restaurants. And we have clearly articulated the roles, purpose, and responsibilities of field leaders to help them be more effective with smaller spans of control.","In addition, we've restructured our operation support. We will now have an operation services department responsible for training, facilities, ops integration, and new restaurant openings. This effort will be led by a single executive director reporting to me. This allows us to create a better support model for our restaurant teams and will help minimize the volume of activity coming from our support centers that can ultimately create distractions. It will also ensure that we only work on those processes, tasks, and innovations that will make the GM's job easier and\/or allow us to deliver a more consistently great guest experience.","Lastly, we are improving our hiring process so that we can find really great talent, we hire quickly, and get crew members trained thoroughly and properly. Comprehensive trainings instills confidence within our managers and our crew members to successfully complete the prep, serve our guest, or address any potential issues inside the restaurant. That confidence helps create a productive culture that attracts hardworking team members. More importantly, it also helps us retain those great employees who want to be a part of this very unique brand and begin to develop them into terrific future leaders for Chipotle.","During all of these important changes, we have asked our development team to temper our new restaurant openings for the next 12 to 18 months before reaccelerating our growth. This is designed to give our field teams a greater opportunity to absorb the new operating strategy and structure, restore emphasis on a strong training culture within our existing restaurants, and deliver the high standards our guests deserve 100% of the time. Mark Crumpacker will talk more about this shortly.","Conversations I've had with our restaurant and support teams have reinforced my view that we will accomplish a lot in a short period of time. I know that our teams are motivated and energized. And after a challenging couple of years, our teams are hungry to win. I thank all of our field teams and the rest of the organization for welcoming me, welcoming my ideas and plans for our operations.","Steve has charged me with shifting the mindset in our restaurants to be more focused on our guests and operational excellence. This is an area in which I have a lot of experience. I look forward to providing updates on the hard work that we're putting into our operations and the progress we make to ensure our restaurants are the very best that they can be.","I'll now turn the call over Mark.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. Operational excellence inside our restaurants is fundamental to long-term sustainable growth. As we work to achieve a consistently great experience, we are also executing against our customer experience strategy. Building customer trust and loyalty and ultimately the sales volumes we once enjoyed will result from the thoughtful evolution of our customer experience combined with consistent operations. This evolution is ongoing and includes menu innovation, an enhanced digital experience, re-envisioned store environments, more convenient ways to enjoy our food, and better hospitality and customer service, all combined with marketing that drives an emotional connection to our brand and to our commitment to making delicious wholesome food accessible to everyone.","In addition to the work we are doing to strengthen our operations, our strategy and innovation teams are hard at work evolving the customer experience across all aspects of our brand. In this new chapter defined by innovation and an evolution of the customer experience, there will be much experimentation, testing, and refinement along the way. Our teams are working on a variety of initiatives, including several new menu items, which include frozen margaritas, desserts, new salad greens and dressings, and a range of other menu items which are currently in the R&D process.","Our team is also designing a new beverage program for Chipotle, which includes a top to bottom redesign of the beverages we serve and how they are merchandised to our customers. Simultaneously, our design teams are working on evolving our restaurant environments. This includes design changes that can be applied to existing restaurants as well as designs for new sites. These enhancements are driven by our customer experience strategy which emphasizes digital, convenience, and hospitality.","During the quarter, our menu and marketing teams launched queso nationally. The launch followed a large-scale consumer test in more than 350 restaurants, during which we experienced encouraging sales and research results. Unlike nearly every other fast food company, Chipotle rarely adds new menu items, so the addition of anything new generates significant interest, positive and negative. Nevertheless, our sales data and research results show that many of our customers enjoy our queso made with no preservatives or artificial ingredients, and it was an easy decision to roll it out nationally.","With the national queso launch, we saw an immediate sales lift in the high single-digits as a percentage, which leveled off after initial trial. And when advertising support began at the end of September, we saw another increase before leveling off again. Currently, about 15% of our customers continue to order queso. This new menu item not only increased sales with existing customers, it also attracted new and lapsed customers into our restaurants. About 19% of these new and returning customers are trying queso, while many of the others were simply driven in by the advertising. We know that each of these visits is essentially a test run of Chipotle, and is an opportunity for us to remind our guests of the delicious food, quality of our ingredients, and convenience of dining at Chipotle.","Awareness and sentiment surrounding queso are also encouraging with more of 80% of our customers indicating that they are aware of our queso and more than half of respondents indicating that they thought our queso was better than that offered by our competitors. 93% of customers that tried queso on an entr\u00e9e said they like our queso, and more than half indicated that they would be likely to visit Chipotle more often because of the queso.","The queso advertising campaign, which consists of television, digital, and social, continues through mid-November and has included television ads that aired during 12 broadcast premiers, including This Is Us, the second highest rated premiere of the season, and Sunday and Monday night football games. Social media support centered around an Instagram campaign called the Queso Cup, which was very successful in engaging customers with a completion rate of 70% among customers who opted into the week-long challenge to win free queso.","Support for digital and out-of-store ordering continues into the fourth quarter, since enhancing our digital ordering capabilities with the roll out of our Smarter Pickup Times initiative. Online advertising support for digital ordering is continuing to be very effective, driving more than 40% of all online orders.","During the third quarter, our return on investment for online order advertising is about sevenfold. We will continue advertising support for online ordering into the fourth quarter, as well as advertising support for catering, which sees a historical seasonal lift through the holiday season.","As a follow-up to Scott's comments about new restaurant openings, we expect to open between 130 and 150 restaurants next year, a reduction from this year's openings. While we still firmly believe that we have the potential to open up 5,000 restaurants in the U.S., we have decided that it is a higher priority right now to focus on operational excellence, including improving our training, culture, and elevating our guest experience in our existing restaurants. Ultimately, we believe this temporary reduction in openings will make us stronger in operations and we expect the quality and returns of our real estate portfolio will strengthen during this time.","There is still much work to be done rebuilding trust and loyalty, but we are well on our way. There's no quick fix, but we are evolving our customer experience to be the most compelling of any restaurant brand. That, coupled with ongoing marketing that reinforces the quality of our ingredients, the deliciousness of our food, and our commitment to doing the right thing will ensure our future success.","I'll now turn the call over Curt.","Curt Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are making with our key digital commerce initiatives. Second make line sales as a percentage of overall sales were 8%, the highest level we've seen for a third quarter and are up 32% over the prior year. Importantly, we continue to see strong results in our busiest restaurants, with the top 10% of restaurants seeing second make line sales exceeding 15% of total sales mix.","We expect this momentum to grow as we continue the rollout of our new technology-enabled second make line. We have now deployed this system to 62 restaurants and are accelerating our installations and will have over 200 restaurants live by the end of this year. We have prioritized the installations so our busiest second make line restaurants receive this new technology first.","We also have a robust innovation pipeline, with several new capabilities set to launch in the near-term. I'm excited to announce that the new Chipotle app, available on both iOS and Android, is scheduled to launch on November 6. In addition to significant improvements that we have made in user experience and ease of ordering, we are launching new capabilities that will enhance the guest experience, our marketing capabilities, and speed of service.","As an example, the new Chipotle app offers our guests the ability to rapidly reorder their favorite meals by displaying on the home screen their favorite entr\u00e9e, nearest restaurant, and fastest pickup time. We are also launching a digital offer platform that allows customers to receive, manage, and redeem Chipotle offers directly from their app wallet.","An additional feature that will be available at launch is the integration of mobile payment methods, including Apple Pay, which is one of the most requested items from our customers. Supporting mobile payments will enable us to remove pay-in-store as a payment option, which will not only further speed up throughput in our digital channels, but will help customers pay in an easier way.","Heading into the fourth quarter, we also launched a new ordering partnership with Facebook. Through this partnership, Facebook users can order Chipotle from local restaurants using popular delivery services such as Grubhub and delivery.com, among others. While it's way too soon to have a sense for how this ordering option will be received, it is very consistent with our belief in finding innovative partnerships to make it more convenient for guests to engage with Chipotle through channels that they choose.","In addition to the Facebook partnership, during the quarter, we completed the integration of all of our delivery partners into Smarter Pickup Times, and we are looking to add as many as four delivery partners between now and the end of the year. While still fairly new, we are encouraged by the potential of these third-party delivery partnerships, as delivery orders were up 33% in the third quarter.","We are also confident that catering has the potential to be a sustained growth driver for Chipotle. Over the last year, we launched several improvements to catering, including online ordering, payment, and delivery. Customer response is strong, with catering sales increasing 14% in the quarter. And there is much more we can do with this channel.","In the fourth quarter, we will start by piloting new catering offerings. Currently, the minimum catering order size is a group of 20, and we will introduce a new group size to accommodate a party of 10. Currently, we offer only one price tier, which is approximately $13 per person. But we're piloting three new price tiers, with prices starting at under $9 per person. We believe that these changes will significantly broaden the appeal of our catering offering and increase the frequency and accessibility of Chipotle catering.","I'm encouraged with the response we've seen with the improvements we've made to the digital experience and the new capabilities I've mentioned today, plus the rich innovation pipeline we have in front of us position us well to continue to see growth across all our channels.","I'll now turn the call over to Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Curt. When you consider all the changes we focused on this year, all of it has been examined through the asking the question, how can we improve the guest experience? When a guest visits Chipotle today, we want to make sure we're doing everything we can to provide a delicious meal and provide great service by a talented, well-trained team.","We have made some very important strides this year, strengthening our senior leadership, simplifying our restaurant operations, placing a greater focus on the guest, and fostering a culture of innovation. And while there's still much more to be done, we believe the changes we're making and our renewed focus have us on the right path.","In the third quarter, we reported revenue of $1.13 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.69. The third quarter was impacted by several unexpected items as we had unusual impacts related to hurricanes from this summer, historically high avocado costs, store closures and a data security incident. We believe the combination of these factors negatively impacted EPS by about $1.05 per share. I'd like to address these unusual impacts first, then provide a sales review, and finally, I'll walk through the highlights of the P&L.","First, our core business was adversely impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma that hit Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. About 425 of our restaurants were directly in the path of the storms, and even more restaurants were indirectly impacted by the subsequent rain all along the East Coast. The safety of our employees and guests is always a top priority when we encounter dangerous situations like these, and we could not be more proud of our field leaders, our restaurant managers, our crew members and our facility staff for taking care of each other during the storms and for getting the restaurants up and running so quickly despite managing their own personal hardships at home.","Due to the downtime from the hurricanes, we estimate that our sales were lower by nearly $6 million or 50 basis points of comp for the entire quarter. We also have four restaurants that remain temporarily closed and two expected new openings that have been substantially delayed. The lower sales impacted our earnings by about $0.06 in the quarter.","There were $3.3 million of incremental expenses directly related to the hurricanes, from paying all of our hourly employees even while restaurants were closed, from charitable contributions to support recovery efforts and related to write-offs and repairs associated with the damage to our restaurants. Expenses directly tied to the hurricanes accounted for an additional $0.07 of EPS impact.","We also had historically high avocado prices, especially in the wake of Tropical Storm Lidia, which in early September began to inundate the western coast of Mexico and continued to move east across the growing regions of the country. The rains and cooler temperatures in Mexico slowed the maturing process, delaying the harvest of the fruit which caused a gap in available supply. This coincided with the end of the growing seasons in California and Peru, resulting in a severe price spike.","In a matter of weeks, our case costs nearly doubled, before beginning to ease in October. The harvest in Mexico is now shaping up nicely and expectations are for pricing to normalize. The impact for the full quarter was 40 basis points higher than Q2, even though we had actually expected relief in avocado prices from already high levels in the second quarter. This impacted EPS in the quarter by about $0.19. As a historical perspective, the avocado prices in the quarter are about 150 basis points higher than normal levels seen two years ago.","In addition to the impact of the hurricanes, we also made the decision to close two restaurants and relocate a third restaurant during the quarter, along with the expected closure of three additional restaurants in October. Impairments for these restaurants and other miscellaneous write-offs for equipment totaled about $4.4 million in the quarter, which impacted EPS by about $0.09.","Lastly related to unusual items, we recorded a $30 million liability for the anticipated assessment by payment card networks related to the data security incident announced in April of this year, and that reduced EPS by about $0.64. This expense is an early estimate and a final determination, which we expect sometime in 2018, could differ from this estimate.","Although our IT security team identified and isolated this incident in a matter of weeks during March and April of this year, this level of potential exposure is a result of our high daily transaction volumes. This $30 million expense is included in G&A for the quarter, and we'll continue to assess any possible shift in that potential liability going forward.","For the full quarter, our comps increased 1%, and adjusting for the Chiptopia revenue deferral from last year, the underlying comp would have been flat. This 100 basis point benefit will reverse over the next six months and there will be a drag of about 50 basis points to 60 basis points on the comp in both Q4 2017 and Q1 of 2018. While comps ended up flat overall for the quarter, adjusting for the revenue deferral, the actual daily and weekly comps varied widely.","And I think best way to provide insight into sales during the quarter is to separate the quarter into three distinct underlying sales trends. Initially, comps in the first half of the July were up 4.5%. Then, from mid-July through September 11, just before the unadvertised launch of queso, our comps were down about 2.25%. And lastly, from September 12th through the end of September when queso was launched and then advertised, comps were a positive 4%. I've excluded the hurricane impact from these segments as those impacts were relatively short-lived and each market impacted bounced back nicely. So, the hurricane effect was truly temporarily.","In October, comps so far are running in the 2% to 3% range, before the negative impact of the Chiptopia deferred revenue. So, the launch of queso has added about 6% to the comp in September and is adding an incremental 4% to 5% in October so far when compared to the negative 2.25% trend pre-queso.","The additional comp boost upon national launch, as well as just after the advertising launch came from a combination of increased check, as a lot of our existing customers added queso to their entr\u00e9e, and also from increased transactions as the advertising drove a lot of new and lapsed customers into our restaurants.","And now in October, most of the added comp is coming from increased average check with about 15% of our customers adding queso to their entr\u00e9e or adding it on the side. In the fourth quarter, we plan to expand our price increase that we trialed earlier in the year.","As we've mentioned previously, we've seen little or no resistance to the increase taken last spring in about 500 restaurants, and we're now going on four years without a price increase in most of our restaurants. In mid or late November, we will increase prices by an average of about 5% in just shy of 900 restaurants, primarily in restaurants located in the Midwest and Texas, with some pockets in the Southwest and Southeast.","We'll continue to evaluate any potential resistance in these markets and if all goes well, we'll decide on a potential increase in the nearly 1,000 remaining restaurants in early 2018. This pricing will help offset continued high inflationary costs, especially around increased labor wages and higher occupancy rates.","While we typically provide comp guidance for the upcoming year during our third quarter release, we're going to hold off at least until our fourth quarter release. That will allow us the opportunity to see the sustained impact of queso, the completion of our ad campaign, the response to our new app, and monitor the customer acceptance of the price increase I just mentioned. We'll also continue to refine our marketing plan for next year and finalize our 2018 field plan over the next few months, all of which we will incorporate into our expectations for the 2018 comp.","For the quarter, our food costs were 35%, an increase of 90 basis points from Q2, largely driven by higher avocado costs. Heading into the fourth quarter, we believe that our food costs will normalize to just over 34%, and early indications for 2018 are that we may be able to improve even further due to an expected abundant avocado crop, along with a benefit of the menu price increase.","We continue to make improvements in labor management in the restaurants, but higher wages offset much of that benefit. In Q4, we'll increase wages during our semiannual merit increase for crew, but we anticipate labor expense as a percent of sales will remain similar to the third quarter. Heading into 2018, labor will continue to be a challenge in the tight labor market and with rising wages, but we'll continue to search for ways to effectively schedule and manage our restaurant labor to deliver an excellent guest experience, while driving labor leverage.","Within other operating costs, our marketing and promo expenses were lower versus last year as we lapped the significant investment for Chiptopia from last year. Marketing and promo expenses were 3.3% during the third quarter. Our combined marketing and promo costs will increase in the fourth quarter to about 4% of sales as the majority of our national ad campaign is occurring in the fourth quarter.","Our G&A expenses during the quarter were $99 million, which included the $30 million estimated charge related to the data security incident. Excluding this charge, we anticipate that our fourth quarter G&A expenses should be relatively flat in dollar terms to the third quarter.","Non-cash stock-based compensation expense was $17 million during the third quarter. During the quarter, we accelerated our stock buybacks to $102.5 million at an average price of $341 per share and we ended the quarter with over $548 million of cash and investments. We also announced today that our board has authorized an additional $100 million in share repurchases.","From a capital allocation perspective, while we'll continue to buy our stock opportunistically, we also believe that the best use of cash is to continue to invest in the Chipotle business. This includes continuing to build additional Chipotle restaurants, but also includes thoughtful investment in innovation such as digital, new menu options and refreshing or reimaging our restaurants where it makes sense.","Despite what was a noisy and challenging quarter, we've implemented substantial changes to our operational leadership, launched a significant menu item, rallied our restaurant teams to focus on training. All of these changes to date and our strategic goals are designed to deliver an excellent guest experience.","As we look to the end of the year and begin to plan for 2018, we're confident that we're moving in the right direction, and are making the necessary moves to ensure the long-term success for our brand, our employees, and our shareholders.","Thank you. And now, we'll open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","I guess first on queso, if you could give any perspective on kind of the tail you're seeing in California and Colorado since those were the earliest markets. And then secondarily, as you slow development next year, Jack, I mean, what's the plan for the extra cash that you'll generate? It should be, I don't know, an extra $100 million of free cash flow, should we build that into share repurchases, any thoughts there.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. Sharon, first on the queso, Colorado and California both held up after the first few weeks we saw a spike, especially in Colorado, that leveled off. But it leveled off after just a few weeks and then it held. And so what they saw after, I'd say, three or four weeks, Colorado continued to hold as an incremental comp, even to this day. Pacific, Southern California, they had a lower overall impact, but again, things settled after like three or four weeks. So, we're hoping that we saw in October the 2% to 3% comp or so that I mentioned in my prepared remarks that that will continue through the rest of the quarter.","In terms of cash for next year, Sharon, yeah, the additional cash will either go into strategic investments such as digital, things like remodels. We won't be able to do much in a way of remodels early in the year because we want to actually have a few reimaged, reimagined restaurants. In the first quarter, we'll examine those, and we may decide to remodel more stores in the second half of the year. But to the extent that we don't have strategic investments in our business, I think you can expect that we'll continue to buy back stock at this higher level that you just saw.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","And just to clarify, Jack, Colorado and California, I mean, on average, are those at a mid-teens attachment rate? Is it single-digit? I mean, any clarity there?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, if you average them together, Sharon, they average about what we're seeing at a company-wide level. Colorado was higher. Pacific was lower. But when you add them together, they're pretty close to what we're seeing with the national rollout.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from David Palmer, RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good evening. You mentioned a few things on the call today that are drivers for sales. There's even a mention of a food innovation pipeline and obviously you've talked again about digital and delivery and improved operations focus. If you were to rank order the things or the reasons why sales would climb faster than the industry, and this recovery could be reignited so to speak after some of these food safety issues, how would you rank order those and what are you most excited about? Thanks.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, I'll start by saying that we've had a lot of change in the last year, a lot of restructuring, so starting with adding four new board members, adding two new officers, including Scott Boatwright and Laurie Schalow. We've restructured our field leadership, and this is all toward the eye, in the eye of making sure that we deliver an extraordinary guest experience because we got away from that, as I stated about a year ago. We made a lot of progress.","And I think fundamentally, when we deliver an extraordinary guest experience, it's really compelling and it's going to bring a lot of people back. Scott and I were just in restaurants all last week and when we were in excellent restaurants and we were in a few that were better than I've seen maybe ever and the way our crews connect with folks and the way people connect with our food and the experience is extraordinary.","And I know by dedicating ourselves to bringing back operational excellence, we're going to get a lot of customers back. But that's not the only thing we need to do. We need to be an innovative company. For the past 24 years, we haven't really been an innovative company. We've leveraged the excitement around a very focused menu and about sourcing great ingredients, so we need to continue to do that and bring that back, and then also set ourselves up to be innovative and that's where I'll let Mark Crumpacker comment.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. If I were to rank the opportunities, I would say, as Steve said, I would put improving the guest experience at the top. I mean, there's a tremendous amount of room for us there and we've seen that that when we focus on that, we dramatically change the trajectory of a restaurant.","Next, I would put enhancements to the digital experience in catering next on the list. I think those are two opportunities that we've not fully exploited for sure in the world of catering, but also in digital. And as Curt mentioned, we have a new version of the app coming out, new payment methods. We have that coinciding with the rollout of the digitally-enabled second make line. There's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to increase the percentage of digital orders, which has the associated benefit of reducing congestion on the main line when we do that well.","And then the third thing that I'd rank would be changes to the menu. As Steve mentioned, Chipotle is a company that historically hasn't added a lot to the menu. When we do it, we get a lot of attention for it. And there's a lot of potential for us to reignite interest, and particularly with lapsed customers, by making relatively small changes to our menu. It's really untapped potential for us. And so, that's the way I would rank those things.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Sara Senatore, AllianceBernstein (sic) [Sanford C. Bernstein] (42:20). Please proceed with your question.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I have a follow-up on the top line and then just a question about margins. The first is, I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the comments and the enthusiasm about all of these initiatives with a comp that is 2% to 3% before the deferred revenue. And the implication, I think, is that basically you're back down to where you were before the impact of the credit card breach, kind of that down 17% from peak. So, I guess I'm just trying to understand how to sort of reconcile what seems to be a lot of enthusiasm, a big launch of queso, and also the marketing, all of which would seem to have been very successful, and yet it seems like you're still having difficulty just budging from that volume run rate.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yes. Sara, this is Jack. So, listen, I'll start. We had to suffer through several weeks of negative sales during the quarter, as I mentioned, when I described those three segments. And so, I don't know that we'd call ourselves enthusiastic about overall sales trends, but we did change the trend line. We were sitting on a negative 2%, I guess that average of negative 2.25% for several weeks during the quarter, and we've been able to change that trend line. Do we think we're done yet? Of course, not. Nobody's going to be jumping up in joy for a 2% to 3% positive comp, but it did take a negative 2% comp and turned it into a positive comp, and so it's a starting point.","I think the enthusiasm is more about what we're focusing on, the strategies that we're working on right now. It's a lot of back to basics. It's a lot of focusing on our people so that they are well-trained, well-equipped, and confident about delivering an excellent guest experience. We've got some exciting digital developments, as Curt just mentioned, that are right around the corner. So, we've got a number of things that we think can enhance the guest experience. So, we're optimistic that those things will reignite the sales trends. So \u2013 but that is yet to happen. So, until that happens, we're going to continue to focus on these things that will make the experience better and hope that it will take the 2% to 3% comp up to a whole other level.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And just on the margins, if you could, are there any implications for slowing store growth with respect to the lower \u2013 sort of less of a drag on margins, but also maybe on the other hand, I think ramping up maturity curves has typically been a little bit of a contribution to comp. So, if you could just talk about those two things with respect to the slower unit growth.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Sara, it's a very modest impact. As an example, our non-comp stores right now, those stores that have been open anywhere from one month to 11 months, they still generate a margin of about 10% for the year, so far, and so, yeah, they're lower than the 16% that we just generated, but \u2013 so, it will have less of a drag effect, but you're talking about a few dozen restaurants or so, maybe three or four dozen restaurants or so, so there is a little bit of relief and less of a drag, but it's not that significant.","I'd say the same thing on the comp. Yes, our newest stores always are the highest comping layer, and then as you go to the two-year-old stores, they're the second highest comp. Three-year-old stores are the third highest comp. But again, you're talking about a matter of a few dozen stores, and so, it will have a bit of an impact and that would be a negative impact, but really, on a base of 2,200, 2,300, 2,400 stores, it's going to be a very, very modest impact.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Sara.","Operator","Our next question is from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. The question was on future development. Presumably opening fewer stores is going to allow you to open better stores, so can you kind of comment what you think the new unit volumes are going to be going forward? And secondly, and, Jack, just to the previous question you just made a helpful comment, you're doing around a 10% margin on the newer stores, at least by our calculation. The newer stores look like they're tracking somewhere in the $1.5 million, $1.6 million range, which certainly isn't the returns that you used to have. But would you continue to open stores even at the new lowered pace if those unit economics in fact prove to be sticky?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, John, I don't know that we can comment on what we think the new sales will be. We're optimistic that as we move the number down that we'll go after the most risky or the most speculative site, and so we do think the volume will increase. You're right in the ballpark. Our average volumes are, for new stores that are opening up, at about $1.5 million. We do expect that number \u2013 if not higher. We do expect that number will go up as we open up fewer stores, but I don't know that I can give you a number.","And in terms of returns, these are respectable returns. A 10% return at call it $1.5 million, $1.6 million volume, that's $150,000 cash flow at a less than $800,000 investment. It's only a 20% investment. It's not the 50%, 60%, 70% that we've historically delivered. But incrementally, that's going to add to shareholder value at that level, especially because those stores do comp at a higher level than other restaurants. And so, you're starting out at a 20-ish percent return and you're going to grow from there. So, these are returns worth investing in.","But right now, we really have to allow our 70,000 employees out there to focus on the existing restaurants, the existing customers, focusing in on training. That's where the biggest opportunity is for us right now. So, this idea of pulling back on openings for the 12 to 18-month period, we think is absolutely the right thing to do.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And if I can, is it \u2013 pulling back on 12 to 18 months, is 2018 the bottom or is the run rate of store openings actually going to be the lowest as we kind of finish up 2018 and you put the brakes on development, which obviously takes time to slow it down?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, there's a tail there, John. So, I think you pull back for 12 to 18 months and then near the end of that 12 to 18-month period, I think we then start to say, okay, let's start ramping up. And so, I think 2018 is likely to be the bottom, although you may not see the reacceleration until late in 2019, just because there is a tail to get things ramped up again.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from David Tarantino, Baird. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Jack, just a couple of clarification questions. First, on the comps you're running so far in Q4, you mentioned up 2% to 3%, could you talk about maybe the breakdown of the check versus the traffic in that most recent trend? And then I have a follow-up.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, David, it's hard for me to give you any meaningful insight because we're comparing in October to the biggest month of the year. And so, if you look at just the pure math, the traffic is down a bit and the check is up a bit, but the problem is we were in a heavy promotional period, we had Love Story where customers can earn the opportunity to get free food or buy one get one, and so, that looked artificial to me. So, there's nothing I can give you meaningful in terms of what the real underlying traffic is, and what the real underlying check is. I think as we move away from comparing against this extremely high promotional period, we'll be able to see what kind of the normal underlying traffic trends and average check trends are.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, if I could have one more question on the margin outlook, any way to frame up how you're thinking about restaurant level margin as you move into next year? And I know in the past you've given us a framework that's sort of associated with different levels of same-store sales, but any way you can sort of give some initial thoughts on how 2018 might look at the \u2013 at whatever comp run rate you want to assume?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","David, I think this is similar to what we've talked about in the past, so this isn't necessarily meant to be a guidance, but at the nearly $2 million volume we're at right now, with normalization of food costs, especially avocados, and then allowing this price increase, and if we're able to push some or all of the remaining stores that haven't had an increase were able to increase prices, we believe we can deliver a margin in the 20% range at this $2 million volume.","And the price increase, I don't want you to think that we're relying on the price increase to fund our margins, but it really has been four years for the vast majority of our stores that we've put any price increase through, and yet we've absorbed 4%, 5%, 6% of labor inflation during that time, and so, our margins have taken a huge hit during the past four years. And so, we think allowing us to pass on some of that increase, and it's only a portion of the increase, on through slightly higher menu prices, we think that we can normalize our margins. So, I still believe in the $2 million volume range, we can deliver margins in the 20%-ish range.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Okay, thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Andrew, are you there?","Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, can you hear me?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I'm wondering with some of the building out of the overhead structure and adding layers of \u2013 at the field level and things like that, how should we think about G&A going forward, the contributions of G&A going forward?","Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I'll do that.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Okay.","Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Hi, Andrew. This is Scott here. A great question. We are actually removing layers in our field hierarchy today and removing some of the \u2013 what I believe to be just top-heavy field hierarchy in a work structure and instead of it being a G&A grab, we're going to repurpose those dollars to add additional field leaders closer to the restaurants, so we can reduce the standards of control.","Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great.","Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","And I was going to say, Andrew, I presume it to be, we haven't done the math yet, net neutral as it relates to G&A spend.","Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. And then I just had a question on taking down the development pace, can you help us understand the process you went through to identify that this is the right level of development going forward and kind of where you prioritize, or de-prioritize, I know you gave some of the regions, but just the thought process as you reached this level in terms of the guidance for 2018.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Andrew, I don't know that there was a precise science to it, but as Scott really got involved in working with our teams, it was very clear that, the analogy that I would use is we're changing the tire while the car's still moving and here we have a lot of people that we need to train or retrain how to run a great restaurant, how to deliver great throughput, how to execute our standards at a very, very, very high level.","And yet, opening up new stores is a big distraction. You have to start thinking about hiring people months and months in advance. You've got to train people in advance of the opening. You sometimes are taking people from existing restaurants to staff a new restaurant. Turnover of a new restaurant often is high. You hire people and they didn't know what they signed up for, and so the turnover is very high. So, it's a distraction in a lot of ways.","And so, from an ops standpoint, it just makes sense to pull back. Then you combine that, we're looking at our portfolio and saying, okay, there are certain areas where the team looks good. The team is able to handle this, the financials are great, the opening sales are great, and it's like you don't want to pull back on those. And so, it's a combination or an intersection of those two imperfect sciences, or imperfect arts if you will, where we come up to what we think is the right number.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, and if I could just expand on that very quickly, I think it's important to note that it requires a great deal of talent planning to open up the volume of restaurants that we do today, and it has been a strain on our bench strength across the enterprise, and so this will allow us to restore some of the depleted positions throughout the organization, the field structure specifically, and get stronger in our current asset base, but also get us prepared for much additional or larger growth in the future.","Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. I have a question on comps and then a question on unit growth. On the comps, you guys are comping 2% to 3% positive in October, and your guidance is for slightly negative comps for the fourth quarter at least implied by the full year is. Is that just a function of facing tougher compares in November and December, or is that not the case, should we really start looking at your trends on a three-year basis once you get into November. Any color on that would be helpful.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","First of all, we're not predicting negative comps in the fourth quarter. We're predicting that if comps stay in that same kind of level, that the year-to-date comp will drop down to 6.5%. But it's not a negative comp. We had a negative comp...","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, okay. Thanks. Thanks for the clarification. The full year guidance I just had plugged in implied something in the fourth quarter, so if it's not...","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","No, we're not expecting any kind of downturn whatsoever. So, yeah.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just on the unit growth, you guys have opened around 500 restaurants since late 2015, and I think some of these or a lot of these are in existing markets. The question is just based on your ability to analyze these restaurants internally, is there any evidence that the addition of these stores over the last three years is one of the reasons why you're having a difficult time restoring the unit economics in comping in the recovery that you kind of were expecting?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","No. No evidence whatsoever. We open different number of stores in different markets and we're not seeing that the number of restaurant openings has had an impact on our recovery whatsoever. And it's got \u2013 and that has nothing to do with our desire to pull back at this time. It really was let's focus on the existing 2,300 and so there's no correlation whatsoever that you're suggesting.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Just one maybe on the broader menu evolution. I know you mentioned it earlier, Steve, but in the past, it was all about kind of over the existing menu and fine tuning for greater efficiency rather than broadening, and now it does seem like with the competitive pressures and the goal to bring back lost traffic, you guys seem quite keen to expand the menu, whether it's proteins, queso, beverages and desserts, and whatnot. So, I'm just wondering how you visualize the menu maybe three years out, whether we should assume it broadens meaningfully further from here. I think you mentioned maybe day parts, segments, I'm assuming people are thinking about breakfast and otherwise, I'm just wondering what's your vision for the brand menu three years out relative to where it is today. And then I have one follow-up.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. Well, first and foremost, we want to offer items that fit into our Food with Integrity philosophy. Chipotle is about being able to purchase premium ingredients, the kinds that are in high-end markets and gourmet shops, and making these kinds of ingredients available for everybody's every day fast food, and we've been doing a really good job at that, making these things available. And they cost more, but we have an economic model that could support them. So that \u2013 it's really important to design a system that enables us to continue to do that.","And as we evolve the menu, we also evolve the way we prepare and cook our foods in a restaurant. So, we can take advantage of technology, I think the new digitally-enhanced second make line is a great example of that, and I've been talking about that for well over a year. The labor efficiency that comes with that allows us to continue to invest in the business. And so, it also is a platform that allows us to create menu items that wouldn't fit into the linear assembly process that we have on the customer-facing make line.","So, our ability to try different kinds of menu items that we wouldn't have been able to in the past, you'll start to see that ability in the future and that's \u2013 that really opens the doors much, much wider. So that's exciting. But again, Chipotle has traditionally had a very high frequency, repeat frequency with our loyal guests. And so, we want to develop foods that people like to eat often. And so, there's a lot of emphasis on things like salads and fresh veggies and things like this that customers want.","But at the same time, they've asked for indulgent things like queso. So, we're going to have to do both ends of the spectrum and things in between, too. But again, we've set ourselves up to be very innovative and we've revamped the culinary development team and staffed it with some really high-powered folks. And so, we expect to see some really fun stuff come out of that.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. In other words, Jack, just \u2013 I know in the past people have asked about balance sheet leverage, just wondering whether you consider taking on any \u2013 take advantage of what has been an extended stock pullback, especially if you believe in the underlying, perhaps encouraging signs and recent results and optimism for the future. I was just wondering whether that's ever a consideration at this point.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, it's certainly something, Jeff, that we've talked about, but it's not something that we put a very high priority on right now. We know the most important thing we can do is get back to basics in our restaurants, execute our standards 100% of the time, and we know that's going to turn into guests wanting to come in more often. Right now, our balance sheet has been a strength through this. We've weathered the storm for a couple of years. We were able to buy back a lot of our stock, we're still able to grow at the appropriate rate, and so, the balance sheet has been a strength. If there's anything I hate to do is take that strength and turn it into a weakness, and now all of a sudden we're kind of squeezed by \u2013 kind of debt covenants or cash flow. So, I would not see us \u2013 expect to see us looking at leverage in the near future.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Okay, thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Mark Alexee for closing remarks.","Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Great.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce Chipotle\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, Alex Spong. You may begin.","Alex Spong","Thanks Amber. Hello everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter 2013. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com at the Investor Relations section.","Before we begin our presentation I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include projections of the number of restaurants we intend to open, comp restaurant sales increases, potential menu price increases, trend in food costs, marketing spend, G&A and other expense items, effective tax rates, stock repurchases and shareholder returns, as well as other statements of our expectations and plans.","These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks.","Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which can be found on the presentation page of the investor relations section of our website.","I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we\u2019ve adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter it will begin in January and continue through our fourth quarter release.","On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer.","With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells","Thanks Alex. I am pleased with our results for the third quarter and the continued strength of our business throughout the year. During the quarter we generated revenue of $826.9 million, an increase of 18% from the third quarter of 2012. Comparable restaurant sales grew by 6.2% in the quarter and diluted earnings per share increased 17.2% to $2.66. These results are the product of our combined focus of our special food and our special people cultures.","This focus is helping us realize our vision of changing the way people think about any fast food. Throughout the quarter we continued to make progress in each of these areas. We introduced more customers to the new menu item, Sofritas, expanding our catering program, continued our quest to remove GMOs from our food, develop more Restaurateurs and field leaders, brought our field leadership together for a conference to share thoughts on how they might become more successful and continued to nurture the seeds we have planted for our future growth.","During the quarter we expanded the rollout of Sofritas, the vegan option we have been testing in our West Coast restaurants and that is now available in all of our restaurants in California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho and Utah or about 25% of the restaurants overall. Recall that Sofritas is an organic artisan tofu that is braised with chipotle peppers, roasted poblanos and a blend of aromatic herbs and spices.","We are encouraged by what we are seeing with Sofritas so far. It currently accounts for over 4% of sales in the restaurants\u2019 where it\u2019s offered. And our customers, including vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters alike really seem to enjoy its complex and bold flavors. In developing Sofritas our aim was to create a menu item that would offer another delicious option for our vegan and vegetarian customers, that would also appeal to meat eaters who might want an occasional meat-free option and that would fit into our service line and not burden our operations or throughput.","So far we are seeing success in each of these areas as about 50% of Sofritas sales seems to be coming from vegan and vegetarian customers and about 50% coming from customers who are substituting Sofritas for one of our meat options.","Our Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Richmond and Washington D.C. restaurants will begin testing Sofritas on October 21st and by the end of the year we plan on having over 650 restaurants serving Sofritas or about 40% of our total restaurants.","Another change we are making that will appeal to vegan and vegetarian customers is the removal of bacon from our pinto beans. From the beginning our pinto bean recipe included a small amount of bacon. In testing some different recipes for pinto beans we determined that the bacon was not adding to the flavor in a meaningful way and that removing the bacon would not negatively impact the taste of our pinto beans. In fact, we noticed that the smoky background notes come mainly from the addition of Chipotle peppers and not the bacon. By removing the bacon we are widening the appeal of pinto beans to even more customers, including those who may have other dietary restrictions. And I am pleased to report that we have already phased the new bacon-free pinto bean recipe into all of our restaurants.","Our efforts to replace GMOs in our food with non-GMO ingredients is an important focus for us in our ongoing quest to improve the quality of our ingredients. There is considerable debate right now about the environmental, health and economic implications of GMOs in food and more than 60 countries have restricted or prohibited certain GMO foods. Given the lack of consensus regarding the impact of GMOs we feel that it\u2019s best not to use them in our food.","In March, Chipotle became the first national restaurant company to voluntarily disclose the presence of GMOs in the ingredients we use in our restaurants. And while these and other GMO ingredients can be found in the food at virtually all national restaurant companies we have been working quickly to remove \u2013 working quickly to move to non-GMO alternatives.","We are also making progress in our marketing efforts to help get customers thinking about where their food comes from and how it\u2019s prepared. During the quarter we hosted our cultivate festivals in both Denver and Chicago following the San Francisco event earlier this year. And all these festivals drew over 100,000 attendees who came to enjoy live music, celebrity chef demos and to learn more about the food Chipotle serves and how it\u2019s prepared. Each of that includes a number of important Chipotle experiences where attendees can learn more about our ingredients, the elimination of antibiotics and added hormones, alternative to processed foods and more. Visiting four or more of the experiences earns attendees a free Burrito at Chipotle.","Additionally, the advertising and PR outreach around the events has shown to have a strong positive impact on the perception of Chipotle, even for people who only see the advertising or PR and do not actually attend the event.","During the quarter we also released an animated film, an arcade style game called \"The Scarecrow\". The film immediately went viral across Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Since its release the film has been viewed more than seven million times online and the game has been downloaded more than half a million times.","We supported the game with a small online and mobile advertising campaign, along with a PR outreach which has generated more than half a billion media impressions so far. In making \u201cThe Scarecrow\u201d our aim was to generate curiosity about where food comes from and how it\u2019s prepared. The film is set in a future world where all food is produced and processed by the fictional company, Crow Foods. The film also depicts the length that Crow Foods goes to in order to obscure the truth from unsuspecting customers. The film is a cautionary tale about the future we may all encounter unless we commit to producing affordable, healthful food in more sustainable ways. Ultimately, our aim in making the film was to spark conversation about these issues and that has certainly happened since the film was released.","To help keep Chipotle top of mind with customers we have continued to run our skillfully made advertising campaign in Chipotle markets around the country. Results of these advertising are encouraging as the campaign appears to be resonating with consumers. During the course of the campaign we saw noticeable sales lifts in sales comps and average daily sales compared to our non-advertising markets. Another wave of this campaign began in August, in proved and mature markets and will continue through October.","Finally, in the quarter we opened the third ShopHouse, this one in Washington D.C.\u2019s Georgetown neighborhood. We will open several more ShopHouse locations all in the Washington D.C. and Los Angeles areas over the next 12 months or so.","We also opened our first Chipotle in Frankfurt, Germany bringing our total number of international restaurants to 14. We continue to view both ShopHouse and our international expansion as future growth opportunities rather than near term drivers of our growth. And we will continue to carefully support these growth seeds as we develop them for long-term success.","ShopHouse is the first test of our belief that Chipotle success is not dependent on serving burritos and tacos but rather is rooted in our commitment to finding the very best ingredients, preparing them using classical cooking techniques, welcoming our customers into a space that is thoughtful and that says something about the food we serve and developing teams of top performers that are empowered to achieve high standards and create a welcoming customer experience. ","Our restaurant in Germany opened in September and we are encouraged by its strong performance in the first few weeks of operation. But I would remind you that opening Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. will continue to be the primary driver of our growth for the foreseeable future.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Monty.","Montgomery Moran","Thank you, Steve. To advance our objective of developing restaurant cultures with teams of all top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards we held a Field Leadership Conference in Las Vegas last month. Our aim in hosting this meeting was to bring together all of our field leaders, Restaurateurs, apprentice team leaders, area managers, team leaders, team directors and regional directors to lay out very clear expectations about their priorities and to provide them with tools to help them with the most vital aspects of their jobs, which is developing Restaurateurs and Restaurateur cultures.","To help better prepare our field leaders to do this we clearly laid out expectations for them in terms of how to best use their time in their restaurants, we shared new tools with them to help them identify and diagnose opportunities in their restaurants and we conveyed thoughts in how they can dedicate themselves fully to developing teams of top performers empowered to achieve high standards.","We continue to make progress in developing and expanding our Restaurateur programs by developing 28 new Restaurateur\u2019s in the quarter, which now gives us a total of 409 Restaurateurs, 40 apprentice team leaders as well as 47 team leaders. But I know we can do much better and I am confident that we will over the next year because our field leadership structure is better staffed, the tools we provided at the conference are the best and most impactful we\u2019ve ever had and we experience the incredible energy and commitment of our field leaders at the conference and as we leaving the conference to go back to their patches.","So while I am happy with our current development of Restaurateur cultures in our restaurants I do expect to see a significant uptick over the next few quarters in terms of Restaurateur development. We also talked at our conference about the importance of leading our teams to provide great throughputs since this is key to providing a great customer experience and driving our unit economic model.","During the quarter we made strong progress in delivering faster throughput in our restaurants at the busiest times of the day. In the third quarter we saw our throughput increase by an average of about five transactions during the peak lunch rush and our lunch comps just about caught up to our all day comp. This is on top of last year\u2019s increase of four transactions during lunch.","In addition our throughput also improved during the dinner rush between 6 and 7 PM by four transactions in the third quarter. We expect to see further improvement to this already high levels as we continue to emphasize and teach the four pillars of throughput to our crews and to our field leaders.","While you\u2019ve heard me talk about these four pillars for some time now we still have a significant opportunity to execute them consistently which we know is going to lead even faster throughput, and we now have better tools in place to identify exactly where our greatest throughput opportunities lie. For example you\u2019ve heard me say that of the four pillars the expeditor is the most important because this person speeds up the slowest part of our line which is the cash register.","Our new tools demonstrates the incredible opportunity as it shows that we are deploying an expeditor in our restaurants during the lunch peak hour only 65% of our time, in other words 35% of the time that person is not in place. If they were in place it would go even faster. Having a linebacker in place is also critical during the lunch rush to ensure that the front line has great communication with the kitchen, that food is flowing smoothly from the kitchen to the line and that the line staff can focus 100% of their attention on the customer at all times to provide great and speedy customer experience.","But again while it\u2019s critical to have this position for fast throughput our new tool show us that we had the dedicated linebacker in place only 73% of the time. We also know that some of our markets are showing very strong dedication to the four pillars. For example, our team director, Steven Hart on the West Coast has a dedicated linebacker in his restaurants 96% of the time at lunch and [Lou] Martinas and Travis [Moe] both team directors in the central region had dedicated line about 80% of the time. This had led to them having very impressive gains in speed of service.","All of our field leaders know the importance of consistently executing the four throughput pillars but now we have tools in place that they know exactly which markets and which specific restaurants need their attention and we have this kind of performance information for each of our four pillars and for every one of our restaurants.","Given the improved strength of our field leadership team we know that we will improve even more in this regard in the coming months and with these improvements our guest experience will be even better.","Another significant accomplishment at our Field Leadership conference was the roll of a new tool that helps our field leaders write specific plans to help their General Managers become Restaurateurs more quickly. Using this tool, our field leaders will provide quarterly plans for every single General Manager in the company, which we believe will improve our ability to develop more Restaurateur cultures throughout the company more quickly.","The tool asks field leaders to use the symptoms that they see in the restaurant to identify themes that once corrected will allow a General Managers to create a more empowering culture in their restaurants and ultimately a Restaurateur culture.","Let me now give you an update on the catering program we launched in January and how we are expanding our ability to bring its full experience to more people outside of our restaurants. On October 7th, we rolled catering out to 17 more markets, serving an additional 460 restaurants and next week on October 21 we are going to roll catering out to all the remaining restaurants in the United States with the exception of New York City which is going to be rolled out in 2014. We remain encouraged by the performance of our catering program. Overall for restaurants that are offering catering we are already seeing catering sales approach 1% of total sales with most of this being incremental. We will also be starting our first national catering promotion in mid-November, in time for the holiday party season.","We believe catering is off to a promising start, and showing great potential as we continue to roll this program out across the country and as more customers have an opportunity to try it out.","During the third quarter we opened 37 new restaurants or a total of a 129 restaurants year-to-date. Total company-wide restaurants totaled 1,539 at the end of the third quarter which includes three ShopHouses, six restaurants in London, five in Toronto, and one each in Vancouver, Paris and Frankfurt.","Based on our year-to-date openings and our scheduled openings for the balance of the year, we are confident that we will meet or exceed the high end of our guidance range of between 165 and 180 new restaurants openings.","I\u2019m pleased to report that our real estate pipeline continues to look very solid right now and we can now announce that we expect to open between 180 and 195 new restaurants in 2014 which gives us confidence that we can continue the strong unit growth next year and beyond.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Jack Hartung.","Jack Hartung","Thanks, Monty. We are pleased with the strength of the underlying business trends during the third quarter, despite operating in a very competitive industry and with mixed signals about the strength of consumer demand we continue to show improved traffic as more and more people chose to visit our restaurants. Our top performing crews and management teams continue to delight new and existing customers by providing an exceptional dining experience to our customers during their each and every visit.","Our same-store sales were up 6.2% in the third quarter and our average sales volume for restaurants that have been open for at least 12 months is $2,140,000, the highest that it\u2019s ever been. Overall sales for the quarter increased 18% to $826.9 million driven by new restaurant openings and a comp of 6.2%.","Year-to-date sales were $2.37 billion, an increase of 16.7%. The quarter and year-to-date comp increase was driven by increased customer visits. We are pleased to see our underlying transactions accelerate sequentially during the year from an underlying comp of 3% in the first quarter to an effective 4.5% comp in Q2 to the 6.2% comp we saw in the third quarter. Our improving sales trends are benefiting from the greater awareness we believe we are achieving with our marketing campaigns, as Steve talked about, as well as from faster throughput, as Monty mentioned.","Our comps accelerated around the end of July or beginning of August and have continue at that higher level though September and now in to October. Assuming these trends continue through the rest of the year we would expect Q4 comps will be similar or slightly better than what we saw in Q3.","As a result of these stronger trends we are raising our full year comp guidance for 2013 to mid-single-digits up from our previous guidance of low to mid-single-digits. As we look to 2014 we expect comps in the low single-digit range excluding the impact of any future menu price increase and I will talk about how we are currently thinking about menu prices a little later.","We expect to end the year with a total new restaurant openings at or above the high end of our 165 to 180 opening range and in 2014 in light of our strong real estate pipeline, we expect to increase our restaurants openings to a range of 180 to 195 new restaurants. And our new restaurants continues to perform very well and as a result we now expect opening sales volumes in the $1.6 million to $1.7 million range, up from our previous expected range of $1.5 million to $1.6 million. These new restaurant opening volumes along with our current comp trends and strong margins allow us to deliver industry leading unit economics and returns for both our new and existing restaurants.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.66, an increase of 17.2%. Our operating margins were down 20 basis points to 16.6% while restaurant level margins were down 60 basis points to 26.8% compared to last year as higher food and other operating cost more than offset sales leverage in the labor and occupancy lines.","Year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $7.93, an increase of 16.7% over last year. Restaurant level margins year-to-date were 26.9%, a decrease of a 110 basis points primarily due to higher food cost as labor leverage was offset by the higher other operating cost. Food costs were 33.6% in the quarter, up 50 basis points from Q2 primarily related to the higher cost of California avocados, which as we mentioned on your last call have been challenging from a supply standpoint and therefore are more costly.","To a lesser extent our tomato salsa cost also increased a bit in the quarter due to adverse weather on the East Coast causing us to incur higher shipping cost to some of our East Coast markets as we are forced to source from other distant suppliers. Our tomatoes on the East Coast will continue to cost more until next month when tomatoes will begin to be harvested from nearby Florida.","Compared to Q3 last year our food cost is up 90 basis points due to higher prices for all of our salsa ingredients, our tomatoes, corn and tomatillos as well as higher cost for dairy and chicken. We are also beginning to see higher oil cost as we convert from GMO soy oil to non-GMO sunflower and rice bran oil.","On a sequential basis going forward we expect our food cost to remain in this 33.5% to 34% range for the next few quarters or so as we expect continued pressure from avocados as suppliers in New Mexico are expecting near term supply constraints which combined with rising demand for avocados will keep the cost at an elevated level. And we hope that inflation on the rest of our proteins and our meats will be relatively tame.","As a result of this elevated food cost level and with expectations of making additional investments in moving to non-GMO ingredients for all of our food by sometime next year we expect to raise prices sometime in 2014. Now while the timing is difficult to predict as we still have work to do to remove GMOs from our ingredients a price increase around midyear is a reasonable assumption.","Labor costs were 22.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 40 basis points from last year, driven by the higher sales comps. Labor leverage was a little better than we might normally expect as our average crew labor rates were similar to last year as we were able to offset higher wages from inflation with lower overtime as a result of better staffing levels at the restaurants. Year-to-date labor cost were also down 40 basis points and we expect labor cost as a percent of sales will move higher in fourth quarter due to seasonally lower sales.","Other operating costs were 10.8% in the quarter, increase of 30 basis points and year-to-date other operating cost were 10.6%, up 40 basis point from last year. In the quarter other operating cost primarily from higher marketing cost, which were 1.55% in the quarter, up 15 basis points from last year and year-to-date were 1.4% or up 30 basis points from last year.","We expect marketing to be at a similar level in the fourth quarter and to step up to around 1.7% in 2014. G&A was 6.4% in the quarter or 50 basis points lower than last year and remember that last September we held our third biennial All-Manager conference which will also occur in 2014. The conference cost about $5.5 million in 2012 and will cost an estimated $7.5 million to $8 million next year and so we expect about 2,300 managers and support staff to attend.","The decrease from the All-Manager conference held in 2012 was partially offset by higher legal cost. G&A includes non-cash, non-economic stock comp expense of nearly $16 million in the quarter and nearly $50 million for the year so far. And we continue to expect non-cash stock comp for the full year to be around $66 million.","Our annual Burrito promotion and fund raising event will add about $1 million in G&A in the fourth quarter which will benefit the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation. In 2014 we expect to manage our underlying G&A to grow at a slower rate than sales before considering the impact of the All Manager conference and before any increase in the non-cash stock comp.","Off-course this stock comp next year will depend on the stock price at a time of grant and the number of options issued. But if a similar number of options were granted next year with a stock price equal to about the current stock price the accounting charge for non-cash stock comp would be about $75 million compared to about $66 million this year.","We expect our effective tax rate for 2013 to be 38.9%, in 2014 the tax rate will rise to about 39.9% without the benefit from the work opportunity tax credit and the R&D tax credit. If these credits are renewed by Congress for 2014 our rate will be lower by about 50 basis points.","During the quarter we repurchased about $17 million worth of our stock or over 41, 000 shares an average share price of $402. At the end of the third quarter we still had nearly $103 million left on our share buyback program previously approved by our Board and over the last five years we have invested nearly $600 million to purchase about 4 million shares at an overall average price of $148 per share.","We finished the third quarter with over $835 million in cash and investments with no debt on the balance sheet and we continue to believe that the best use of our cash is to invest in our high returning restaurants and we\u2019ll continue to plant seeds for future growth including ShopHouse and Chipotle outside the U.S. In the meantime we\u2019ll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value.","Thanks for your time today. At this time we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Yes, thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll go to Matthew Difrisco with Lazard Capital.","Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital","Thank you, very much. I was just curious about sort of the international strategy and the success that you were speaking of as far as the volumes in the U.S. Can you speak about the volumes that you are seeing internationally in respect of markets and what that might mean for growth in \u201814 and beyond as far as more meaningful growth potentially?","Steve Ells","Yeah, I would still expect over the next year or so that international won\u2019t be a very large part of our growth. We are still in the brand building phase. There is still the vast majority of people in the markets we are in, in outside the US are not yet aware of Chipotle. We are seeing nice growth trends in the restaurants that we have opened. Most of the restaurants we have opened in London for example have gone [comp] and the comps we\u2019re very pleased with the comps, but the awareness level is still very low. And so I would expect to not see the number of restaurants be meaningful part of our growth.","And in terms of sales you know the sales are, when you convert to dollars are attractive. I would call them in the same ballpark. We are similar level to what we are seeing in the U.S. but because costs are much higher we are in major cities there, the rents are higher, there are social cost that are higher as well. So that as awareness builds we expect those volumes will grow over time to a much more significant level than our average in the U.S.","Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital","And then ShopHouse as well, are they seeing similar type volumes or is that too early to tell on the LA market?","Steve Ells","I think it\u2019s too early to talk about the volumes of ShopHouse. I would say though we are really focused on building a great in-store experience and introducing a new kind of Asian cuisine than most fast food customers are accustomed to and if I compare teaching them about this new kind of cuisine and the ordering system it\u2019s much the same as it was at Chipotle 20 years ago.","I would say though that it\u2019s going a lot faster. Our growth at ShopHouse is much faster than Chipotle was in their early days. But really now we are just building better awareness and improving on the customer experience and introducing people to a new kind of Asian cuisine and if we do this all very well I think we\u2019ll be preparing ourselves for future growth potential which is really what it\u2019s all about.","Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital","Excellent, thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jason West with Deutsche Bank.","Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, thanks. Just a question around the pricing. Can you guys talk about sort of magnitude what that might be and the timing? I think you said mid-year and I guess what SKU you are thinking there earlier or later in the year?","Steve Ells","Yeah Jason we are not going to make a decision today on pricing but I think that it\u2019s probably in kind of a mid-single digit range, whether that\u2019s 3, 4, 5 kind of percent. What it will depend on is what happens with general ingredient inflation between now and then and then what it costs us to remove GMOs from the rest of our ingredients.","Once we have all that information at hand we\u2019ll be able to do a better job of figuring out what the price increase might be. And in terms of timing it\u2019s really hinging more on removing GMOs. We\u2019d really like to make more progress, understand what that\u2019s going to cost, how much time that\u2019s going to take, all that kind of stuff and then we\u2019ll feel better about coordinating a price increase around the time that we\u2019re removing GMOs and we think that there might be an opportunity as well. We think it will be a pretty exciting time for us when we can announce that.","We are not aware of any other restaurant company anywhere near our sight that\u2019s even attempting to do this and so to actually accomplish it will be pretty exciting and we\u2019d like to time that excitement around with the price increase.","Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And just one other one on that throughput opportunity Monty, you talked about some nice lifts in the peak lunch period, I think five transactions per hour. Can you remind us what the sensitivity is to comps for say each transaction per hour improvement that you see on throughput and so kind of how that flows through comps?","Montgomery Moran","Yeah Jason it just it really, really depends store-by-store. I mean we generally say that there isn\u2019t a direct tie to comps in the sense that if you have certain amount of people in line at lunch and you go faster you might serve them from the twelve to one hour as opposed to the one to two hours, so in various quarters in the past you\u2019ve heard me say that at times we had an increase in the comp sales or comp transactions in the peak lunch hour only to lose a few in the one to two o\u2019clock hour, sort of cannibalizing from ourselves that kind of thing.","So initially speeding up throughput does not automatically generate a comp unless it\u2019s done in a restaurant where people are walking away from the back of the line and a shorter line would have kept them. But that being said we do see over time a really nice correlation between our ability to continue to move faster and customers willingness to come to Chipotle, willingness to wait in line and so forth. So there is no formulae or way to measure that Jason.","But we have absolute confidence that it\u2019s one of the key drivers of our success, it\u2019s one of the key ways in which we distinguish ourselves from competitors because we are so much faster. It\u2019s really a huge advantage to us and it\u2019s such a critical part of giving a great customer experience to our customers, most of whom would report the only thing negative about Chipotle is the need to wait in line.","So we were able to improve substantially at the peak hour of lunch and substantially at the peak hour of dinner which makes us really, really proud and also we had faster comp transactions at absolutely every single hour of the day as well.","So we are really pleased we are incredibly thankful to all of our teams in the field for generating that kind of throughput improvement which is really one of the most substantial we\u2019ve achieved in any quarter I think in our history in terms of absolute numbers.","Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay got it thanks for that.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks first could you talk a little bit about the lift you are getting in the ad spending, in other words you said it\u2019s some specific statistics where when you were on either air or advertising in a much certain material point you had a discernible lift. Could you talk about how great that lift was, how sustained it was and can you just tie it into what are you figuring your final ad spend will be round this year in total?","Jack Hartung","Yeah, John we\u2019d rather not parse the components of the comp. Overtime we believe that if we does do a better job of hiring great people, empowering great people, great restaurateur cultures in our restaurants and they communicate well with our people, communicate this message about where our food comes from and that we really have skill and we use classic cooking techniques with these higher quality ingredients and we can do that with our ads in an automatic way because when our customers come into our restaurants, actually see that we are cooking and they can see the ingredients and we think all that adds up to creating a great experience, creating this feeling that people have where they trust and they enjoy coming to Chipotle.","Steve had mentioned that we did see, we don\u2019t often see this because a lot of our marketing is more about educating and encouraging people to be more curious about where their food comes from. But we did see in markets where we did advertise compared to markets that we didn\u2019t advertise that we saw a lift and it was a meaningful lift. But in terms of saying how much of that was in the comp we\u2019d rather not say.","I would say in general though we believe going forward, we believe that in the past and going forward the vast majority of our comp is based on creating a great restaurant experience that the marketing should complement that. It should be authentic to what the actual experience is but we believe the vast majority of our comp will always be based on having wonderful people creating a wonderful dining experience.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Then just two other follows. One is just on Jack do you have a view yet on food inflation next year and will, is it going to be the kind of thing where your pricing will be fully used to offset that or only partially, give a view generally in the basket for next year?","Jack Hartung","Yeah, I mean I wouldn\u2019t say first of all it\u2019s, great John. I don\u2019t see anything that looks terribly troubling. So we would hope that we would stay in this kind of 33.5% to 34% range, not counting the extra cost related to removing the remaining GMOs. So if it stays in that range I would call that pretty tame. I mean I would mean from here we\u2019ll be looking at a 1% to 2% inflation. And so if things don\u2019t change, if weather doesn\u2019t, if extreme weather doesn\u2019t change things we think that our food cost should not rise very much.","Then in terms of the menu price increase talking about this kind of mid-single digit we think that should be more than adequate to cover the inflation that we have seen so far as well as hopefully absorb the cost of removing GMOs as well and hopefully there will be some leftover to and we expect there would be some leftover to improve our margins as well.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, and just one final question. Steve, you mentioned in your comments about ShopHouse as one other example of how you are going to extend the platform at Chipotle into other brands. What would the timing be? I presume that means the 3rd and the 4th, correct me if I am wrong and if that\u2019s the case how do you think about the right time to introduce those seed concepts to give them time to grow?","Steve Ells","Do you mean grow the existing ones, John?","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","No, I mean like have a third concept beside the first two you have and a fourth because you need time to let them expand so they become meaningful. I am just getting a sense of if that\u2019s something imminent or something at a very long-term that you think about, not anytime in the next few years.","Steve Ells","Sure, well if I think about the last 20 years I mean the vast majority was spent building the Chipotle brand really, really showing that there is a better fast food model. I mean we wrote \u2013 rewrote the fast food rules by introducing high quality ingredients and interactive service format and this concept of having empowered teams who are really top performing to deliver a different kind of experience. It takes a long time and we are really perfected \u2013 we are all perfecting this model and just a couple of years ago thought it was prudent to explore a different kind of cuisine.","I think that if you could envision many different kinds of cuisines fitting into these models it is potentially the new fast food model. And while it would be exciting to open a bunch of different brands now, I think there is really an importance that we have learned at Chipotle of focus, on focusing on just doing a few things and doing them very, very well. Once you have done them very, very well and are confident things are moving forward nicely then you can layer on additional projects and challenges.","We feel that we have got a really good pace going now with introducing the ShopHouse brand. We are really pleased with the results. I was in Washington D.C. ShopHouses two weeks ago and sitting down and talking to customers and the kinds of things that I heard coming from them were just music to my ears which was this food feels so good, I love the way it tastes, the kind of food that I want to come eat often. And it\u2019s creating a dining experience that people want to have often which I think is really powerful.","It\u2019s the kind of thing that we heard about Chipotle in the early days and it\u2019s the kinds of things that obviously drives Chipotle\u2019s comps today. So we are going to focus on those two things right now.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks, good afternoon. In talking about the development you outlined for next year, can you give us a little color on how many are maybe LOIs, time leases where you are accelerating development, is it existing market, new markets, is it international and how might it look by quarter? Thank you so much.","Montgomery Moran","Yeah Nicole I think you are not going to see any particularly different in next year except for a little uptick in our development as we forecast in going up to higher number of new restaurants. But we are still going to have a similar ratio of new markets and proven markets and developing markets. You won\u2019t see much additional work in international. We have talked about how we are working on Germany, we got that open and we\u2019ll be again letting those stores mature. So you won\u2019t see a significant push international.","Again there is going to be a few additional ShopHouse restaurants and you won\u2019t see a huge push there either because we want to really make sure that those brands are established, that we start to develop awareness and that we allow them to generate the kind of demand that will cause us to be able to respond by giving more supply. So I think you will see a lot more of what you are seeing now with a small number of A models.","Again, we\u2019ll look for as many A models as we can find this year, can end up being something like 25 for the year. Next year I would love to see that many again if we can find them. We are always out trying to find those opportunistic deals. But again I think you will see a very similar ratio of new markets to existing markets as you did this year, just a little bit more per quarter. And I think very level loaded again as best we can and we anticipate that they will be quite level loaded next year because the pipeline is very, very healthy right now.","Nicole Miller \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, it looks like that pre-openings dollars were just a little tiny bit weighted towards the back part of the year. So just want to make sure that we didn\u2019t need to front end load anything in the next year but it sounds pretty even.","Steve Ells","Yeah, the third quarter was pretty high, Nicole. we typically have pre-openings costs in kind of the $75,000 to $80,000 or $85,000range. This quarter I think was more like $120,000. That\u2019s more a function of we\u2019ve got a nice pipeline of openings teed up for the fourth quarter but those pre-opening costs they are incurred, most of that is rent, most of that preopening cost is rent. And so because of all the restaurants we got under construction, that we will open up for the fourth quarter we have a little bit disproportionate amount of the preopening cost hit in the third quarter.","If you look at kind of year-to-date for 129 we have opened so far, our pre-opening cost averaged about $83,000 and I think that would be more normal. And so fourth quarter should return to a more normal pre-opening and then next year, as Monty said, we feel like the pipeline has set us up for reasonably level loaded, nothing too extreme to expect.","Nicole Miller \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you.","Steve Ells","Thanks Nicole.","Operator","We will go next to Jeff Balmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Balmer \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great, thanks. Just looking to follow up a little bit on pricing. I guess, how do you guys generally test a price increase if you are still doing that, would a price increase be across most of the menu, would it be most of the markets, how would you guys talk of a price increase this time around?","Steve Ells","Yeah, we don\u2019t really test it per se Jeff. What we do we go market by market and we look at competitors and we look at what prices they are charging and we look at item by item. So we look at sandwiches and burritos and drinks and things like that. And so we will look at the whole menu. It\u2019s likely that the entire menu will be touched. But we \u2013 like for example if we had an overall average increase of 4%, we might increase some items higher, some items lower just based on what looks competitive out there in the market place. And end market-by-market, we\u2019ll also look at what consumer demand looks like as well.","If we feel like there is room to increase based on where our competitors are in terms of their pricing and we have healthy comp momentum as well that might cause us to take that particular market, that we are looking at and maybe inch up the price increase a bit there. And our expectation is that we will have increases in every single market, most of our markets by the time we get to next year there will be three years that we have had a price increase in any of the markets except for on the West Coast, when it would be more than two years. And so our expectation would be when we do this, we have a price increase it will be across all markets.","Jeff Balmer \u2013 Wells Fargo","That\u2019s helpful. Just one other quick one. just coming back to catering a bit, I think it\u2019s been in Denver since the early part of this year, but really I am just looking for any color you can review on sort of the sales progression, you continue to point to approaching 1%, but I didn\u2019t know if you started at 20-30 bips and its grown to 1% over the summer, and then any other sort of pieces of information you have learned as you rolled this out in to new markets in terms of potentially how they get customers little bit more on board with the idea of potentially using the catering service.","Jack Hartung","Yeah, Jeff we are learning a lot about catering, and we are not even been through a full season yet, what we did see though is the early summer was a lot bigger than any part of the rest of the year we have seen so far and that\u2019s because of graduations. And so when we look at catering in markets like Denver that we\u2019ve had it for the entire year, that was our peak season so far. We think we might be moving into another peaks season, now with the holiday and Steve motioned that we are be doing some advertising around that to encourage people to try it.","The other thing we have seen is that the longer catering is in the market that generally we do see the catering build over time. Now it\u2019s not a straight line because like I said there is seasonality where we had a lot more catering in the kind of graduation season in the May and June period. So it\u2019s not a straight line, but generally like in Denver, it\u2019s started out slower, and I would say Denver is higher than average. So when Monty talked about catering being, approaching 1%, the markets that have had it the longest are little higher than that. The market\u2019s that have not had it as long are little lower than that in general, that\u2019s not a perfect formula, but that\u2019s generally what we have learned so far.","And we do know that we have to create awareness and so I know that Mark is considering a number of ways in addition to advertising about how we can create more awareness. What we\u2019ve found so far that is that when our customers get a chance to try the catering, it\u2019s a really neat experience and they love every bit about it, they love the control, they love the food, the love the packaging, they really love everything about it.","And so I know Mark\u2019s working on a number of ideas in terms of how to encourage more people to try catering because we think that will help us continue to build the business.","Jeff Balmer \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you for that thoughtful response.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys it\u2019s [Amod] filling in for John. You are very forward thinking on a lot of different things, including moving to non-GMO. I was curious what your thoughts are on development of a stronger mobile app platform and maybe more specifically how you could tie that into throughput? I know there is some companies out there that have mobile payment for instance and on top of that also layering in loyalty?","Steve Ells","Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. We are working on it. We have something that\u2019s in, what I will call a beta test right now. We think it\u2019s got a lots of opportunities right now. We just want to make sure that the technology works, just from the payment standpoint. If we come up with technology that has any glitches whatsoever it would kill us from the throughput standpoint. And so we have to make sure technology is perfect from that standpoint. And so we are working on that right now.","Once we get that we do think there is a lots of opportunities to communicate with our customers to speed up throughput to communicate with our customers on a more customized way. Customers who haven\u2019t been for a while, customers who have never tried guacamole for example. There is lots of ways to communicate but we are actively working on this and hopefully we will see something in 2014.","Unidentified Analyst","And then can you help us understand the non-GMO supply chain I don\u2019t think a lot of us are that familiar with it. I would think that as you switch over to that it\u2019s obviously a lot of demand probably coming on the market with a company of your size. So is the entirety of kind of the potential structural cost increase going to be passed on with the price increase that you take the middle of next year or should we expect cogs to just move up because of that?","Steve Ells","Well we don\u2019t know for sure but right now we don\u2019t have many ingredients that have GMO and so while it\u2019s complicated to change some of our recipes we\u2019ve made very, very good progress so far with changing out some of the oils. We need to work now on our tortillas and there is just in some case it\u2019s just small amounts like our flour tortillas, just small amounts of oil in the tortillas that we need to try different recipes with different oil and make sure that the taste is still delicious, that we can still roll the burritos, that they hold up well with our ingredients and things like that.","So we don\u2019t have that many GMO\u2019s left so I wouldn\u2019t say that we are going to have this huge demand per se. So we are hopeful that while it will cost more in our foods we hope it\u2019s not, I think you are implying that it would be a dramatic increase in our food cost. We are hopeful that it\u2019s not going to be dramatic, that it\u2019s manageable and that the menu price increase that we are thinking about would more than cover the inflation we\u2019ve seen so far and cover the GMO, the cost of removing the remaining GMO\u2019s as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Steve Ells","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities.","Nick Setyan \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Hi thanks for taking my question. I\u2019d just like to ask sort of a bigger picture question around how you guys think about pricing in general. I mean really just a function of your unique supply chain and the way you source the food? And to what extend do you think about competitive pricing within both fast casual and obviously the casual dining category has been lot more competitive in terms of pricing as well? To what extend does the competitive pricing come into that decision?","Steve Ells","Well when we think about pricing we already have and had for a long time spent more money on our ingredients as a percentage of sales than our competitors or in fact more than any public company or company for which we have the records. And so we have high food cost and that\u2019s not something that troubles us too much as long as we are able to run a very successful unit economic model, which we have been able to do primarily through having really high sales volumes in our restaurants.","And so we do buy more expensive ingredients but that\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been doing for quite some time and our purchasing department is really, really good at going out and working, finding suppliers who are eager to do, raise animals or grow crops in ways that are consistent with our protocols. And so they are always working constantly on trying to increase the supply of those ingredients that are available to us so that we can continue to increase the amount of food and integrity that we serve in our restaurants.","So the main thing the governs our thinking about pricing is that we want to continue to make this kind of \u2013 this new way of eating very accessible to people. So we want to keep our prices low so that our customers continue to enjoy this very different way of eating, but by the same token we want to still have a strong unit economic model and we have been able to do that by virtue of the fact that our food tastes better and we have high average unit volumes enough to cover this more expensive food cost.","Nick Setyan \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Great. Thank you. And then just you mentioned the very strong pipeline in terms of development. Are you seeing a nice acceleration in new construction is that the key factor in why you are able to up the guidance for next year?","Steve Ells","Yes, I think certainly \u2013 it is only a small part of it but yes, the answer is yes the amount of new construction has increased. It\u2019s been increasing just incrementally each quarter over the last several quarters but it does continue to keep making up more and more of our future portfolio, just like it was making up correspondingly less and less of our portfolio after 2008 and 2009.","But yes that amount of new construction has ticked up such that it\u2019s exceeding 40% of the restaurants that we\u2019ll see \u2013 that we will open in the fourth quarter of this year and probably a little bit higher than that for next year. So in other words more than 40% of the restaurants we open next year will come from new construction. So that amount keeps ticking up gradually as a result of more folks being willing to put their money into building new shopping centers and so forth. So that is helping us I think to find more great real estate.","Nick Setyan \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Okay. And then just lastly I\u2019ve been getting lot of pictures today from friends here in LA of your opening of ShopHouse in Santa Monica, looks like I can\u2019t see the end of that line, there is a huge line out the door apparently and it goes all the way to the street.","Steve Ells","That\u2019s great news and again we\u2019re really, really excited about the ShopHouse, not only about the team that we built but the incredible food and this different kind of food that we are making available to people. It\u2019s an exciting way to eat and it\u2019s fun to make this available to people.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bryan Elliott with Raymond James.","Bryan Elliott \u2013 Raymond James","Good afternoon. Just a point of clarification on the move to non-GMO food is it the proteins need to be only fed non-GMO corn?","Steve Ells","No, I mean right now if you want animals that have not eaten any GMO you have to find organic meat. And so when we talk about GMOs, right now there is really no way to find adequate supply of animals that have not eaten any crops containing GMO ingredients. So that is not what we\u2019re talking about, when we\u2019re talking about getting rid of GMOs right now, because none of the animals are obviously genetically modified, but animals in this country are eating grains that are often GMO.","Another thing that I would mention Bryan just while you are clarifying that issue is that our soft drinks contain high fructose corn syrup which is a GMO ingredient. So there is not an effort on our part to eliminate GMOs from soft drinks. So this an effort to go through all of our food ingredients and remove GMOs from every single food ingredient that we serve.","Bryan Elliott \u2013 Raymond James","Where possible, yes. Okay.","Steve Ells","Where possible but we will be able to remove them all of our food ingredients, because again in animal that each GMO ingredient is not a typically a GMO, is not genetically modified organism because the organism is the animal.","Bryan Elliott \u2013 Raymond James","All right I am sorry, maybe I misunderstood the soft drink comment then.","Steve Ells","In making the distinction between food and drinks, I guess I am saying the soft drinks are...","Bryan Elliott \u2013 Raymond James","And you really can\u2019t get regular cane sugar drinks much in the U.S. anyway right?","Steve Ells","I mean we always are looking at it, it\u2019s very difficult to do at this point and certainly not from the main stream soft drinks that you would see.","Bryan Elliott \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks so much.","Steve Ells","Thanks Bryan.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Steve Anderson with Miller Tabak.","Stephen Anderson \u2013 Miller Tabak & Company","Good afternoon. A couple of a quarters ago you mentioned about having some of the breakdown of new units or looking more at food courts as a potential source of unit growth. Have you given any more thought to that as a percentage of your unit portfolio?","Steve Ells","We are looking more at food courts per se, but as a part of our continuing expansion of our portfolio we have found success in a whole bunch of food courts settings. But there is a number of real estate locations that we call sort of non-traditional and in 2013 we had, we opened 13 food court locations by way of example. But it\u2019s not that we are looking to increase that, we just are open to considering those kinds of locations as well as airports locations or highway locations and even military locations in the future is something we are looking to get more involved with.","So we call all of those sort of non-traditional locations. If you talked to us five, six, seven, eight years ago we were very hesitant to get involved with locations like that because it was a time during which we were establishing the Chipotle brand and it was very, very important to us that we did so in a way that represented what we were doing. But as the awareness of chipotle has grown and as the demand for this new way of eating has grown it is been appropriate we find to go into some of those locations to allow folks the Chipotle experience in malls, airports , highway stops and other places that wouldn\u2019t have considered while in that initial brand building stage.","Stephen Anderson \u2013 Miller Tabak & Company","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird","David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co","Hi good afternoon. Jack just a question a follow up on how you are viewing the food cost ratio and if I look at how that has trended historically 33.5 to 34 is this high as its been in the last 10 years. And I just want to come back to the question of where you would like to see that food cost ratio long term and specifically where you\u2019d like to get it to when you take the price increase at the middle of next year?","Jack Hartung","Yes, David. Our food cost generally is ranged between 31% up to around 34, it\u2019s gotten as high as or close to 34% and that\u2019s kind of the range that we are talking about right now as a perspective. While our preference would be around 32% seems to be kind of sweet spot. But the food cost isn\u2019t as important as what our overall margin is and then what our return is. And so let me give you an example, just as perspective just on math if you push the math around a 4% price increase and if you have little or no resistance on that price increase the food cost will improve by about a 130 basis points. And so 4% now I am not considering the cost of GMOs but just to work through the math here.","So our food cost which is now in a 33.5 % to 34% range now drops down much closer to that 32% or 32.5% range and so that\u2019s nice. But the margin on a 4% price increase again it\u2019s just based on today not taking other factors into account would increase by 250 basis points to 260 basis points or so. And so that would put us at all time high margins and even if there is more inflation and even with covering the cost of GMO\u2019s there is a lot of room there for our overall margin to be kind of at record levels. It would give us the opportunity to have returns that are at or above what our record levels have been and our returns have been in the 65% to 70% cash on cash return range.","And so when you think about the pieces and when I think about the inflation that\u2019s happened and is about to happen I think about the cost of GMO\u2019s and I think about our pricing power which we believe and everyone who is trying to go out there I need to prove or disprove whether we have pricing power either by surveying customers or by comparing us to competitors just confirms that we have pricing power. I feel like a mid-single digit inflation and we\u2019ll do everything we need to do.","And if our food costs ends up being closer to 33% than 32% or so but our margins end up being at or above where are they ever been that would be just a fine result as far as we are concerned.","David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great that\u2019s really helpful. And then I guess on the inflation outlook for next year you mentioned that being pretty tame. I guess with corn prices where they are what are the chances you might see some favorability on the food cost themselves as you move into may be the second part of next year?","Jack Hartung","Well, what that might affect David it would affect the prices of our meats, if corn continues to be favorable. I don\u2019t know that it would. We are not predicting at least or nothing we are seeing is predicting that cost will go down but if they hold kind of at this level that\u2019ll be great. We buy white corn for our salsas and so that is more expensive already and so we are not saying that that\u2019s going to go down but certainly we would welcome if the feed prices do decline and if that causes our meat prices to relax a little bit, that\u2019ll be welcome. But right now we are seeing more of a tamish environment not a deflationary environment.","David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co","Okay, thank you very much.","Steve Ells","Thanks David.","Alex Spong","All right, thanks everyone. It seems like we lapsed our time. But we thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Jack Hartung","Thanks everyone.","Montgomery Moran","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our conference.

By now, you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter of 2018. It may also be found on our Investor Relations website, at ir.chipotle.com.","Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities laws.

The quiet period will begin on the 16th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter of 2018, it will begin December 16, and continue through our fourth quarter earnings release.","We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A period.","And now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report our third quarter results, which demonstrated that our strategies to win today and cultivate a better future are working.","Total overall sales grew 8.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases of 4.4%, and 28 new restaurants opened in the quarter. The positive comp sales trends enabled us to expand restaurant level margin, which were up 260 basis points year-over-year, to 18.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual cost grew 62%, to $2.16, and our GAAP earnings were $1.36. While the quarter experienced some sales headwinds, we had a noticeable lift in sales with the launch of our new 'For Real' marketing campaign in late September. And that increase has sustained through October. Marketing that drives culture, drives difference, and drives purchase combined with great operations, drives results.","Additionally in Q3, key growth initiatives moved forward at a healthy pace. And the team executed with excellence the relocation, the restructuring, the hiring of new talent, and our All Managers' Conference. We exited the quarter with momentum, which sets us up for a solid fourth quarter. And we remain focused on building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth.","Before I dive deeper into this quarter's bright spots, I'd like to take a step back to remind you that our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is based on five focus areas: one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu, and the restaurant experience.","This quarter, we made strides towards becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand. Our 'For Real' campaign celebrates what is uniquely Chipotle, that our food reflects our belief that there is a connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. Real flavors, real ingredients, and real cooking techniques result in food that simply tastes better.","We are making much better use of our advertising budget by more effectively communicating who we are and by being in better communication channels, thereby increasing our resonance and visibility. We'll continue to be present on national TV through the middle of November, and the 'For Real' messaging will remain visible in digital and social channels for the balance of the year. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always-on social and digital program.","While we are a brand that speaks to everyone, our consumer research tells us that we are particularly relevant to millennials and Gen Z consumers who share our values. And our customers also want to be our employees. During September, we hosted our All Managers' Conference and it was clear from looking at our general managers and field leaders in the audience, that they reflect our customer base. Our teams came away from this conference energized around our purpose, our values, and our goals, and ready to get back to their restaurants armed with inspiration and information on how to improve the hiring experience, the training experience, and the guest experience.","In Q3, we made progress on our purpose of cultivating a better world with the announcement of a new accelerator program called the Chipotle Aluminaries Project. This is funded by our Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to help food-focused growth stage ventures that share our belief of cultivating a better world and are seeking to disrupt the current food landscape and take their business to the next level. We are using insights from our consumer research to refine our innovation pipeline and how we communicate with our guests. We continue to hear that the number one reason that consumers eat elsewhere is because they don't have convenient access to Chipotle.","Expanding the reach of our digital system remains a key priority in providing our guests with easier access and greater convenience. The digitized second make lines are now in nearly 750 restaurants, and continue to be on track to be in all restaurants by the end of next year. The digital pick-up shelves are now in nearly 350 restaurants, and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants before the middle of 2019. We continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 48%, accelerating from the year-over-year growth rates we saw in the first half of this year, and now accounting for 11.2% of sales.","App downloads have increased 25% since last quarter, and we are seeing strong interest from new and infrequent customers as well as frequent customers. As was the case last quarter, we are seeing particularly strong momentum from delivery. In Q2, we added DoorDash as a new partner, and in Q3, we added delivery capabilities directly from our app and website. A free delivery promotion from our app in September drove an acceleration in delivery sales in the quarter. We continue to see good incrementality in delivery and we see very little customer overlap between our in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner app. We are pleased with how delivery in our app is attracting and retaining new and lapsed customers, and the results we're seeing across our delivery channel has validated our strategy to be available wherever and however our guests want to access us.","As we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pick-up process, we would expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Our current average delivery time is under 30 minutes, already making us one of the most attractive choices for customers on our delivery partners' website, and this will keep getting better. As part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring new formats that leverage digitally-enabled convenient. We're pleased with the early results from our initial digital pick-up lane restaurants and we will expand this test to additional new restaurants in 2019 across several markets. These restaurants have a convenient drive-up window for guests to pick-up digital orders. It's clear from these tests that our guests appreciate the added convenience as these restaurants generate digital sales that are far above our national average. This format is also a win for operations, as the window leverages our digital make-line.","We're also excited about our loyalty test, which launched in September in three test markets. It's very early, but sign-ups look promising, and we'll evaluate and learn from the loyalty test as it moves through the stage-gates in preparation for national launch during 2019. We also have a number of menu items going through our new stage-gate process so that we can build a pipeline for future years. We're testing quesadillas, nachos, bacon, lemonade and a Mexican chocolate milkshake for example. These items are in different phases of the stage-gate process. Importantly, we're improving our ability to deliver great innovations for our customers and restaurant teams with a new concept screening process, more consumer insight, and a better cross-functional process from idea to launch.","Lastly, I'd like to touch on where we are in our organizational transformation. At our all-managers conference last month, we rolled out our new values. These are, One, the line is the moment of truth. Two, teach and taste Chipotle. Three, authenticity lives here. And four, the movement is real. These values were very well received at the conference by our restaurant managers who are more energized than ever. We also emphasized the following key areas for operations to focus on going forward. Number one, throughput excellence, number two, team stability and development, number three, great tasting food, and number four, great customer hospitality. We did a number of store visits following the conference and asked our restaurant managers what they took away. I'm happy to say we are aligned from the support center to each individual restaurant. These values and focus areas also form the foundation for the culture we are building in our support centers, which exist to serve our general managers and team members so that they can delight our guests. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guests want, and better at executing, so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us. I'm delighted with the great talent that we're attracting, as well as the talent that we relocated.","We've continued to enhance our leadership team, adding Roger Theodoredis as General Counsel, who joins us from WhiteWave. The restructuring and the relocations are nearing completion, and we are building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent. I love the start-up energy that greets me every day I come in.","Finally, before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the company that are providing our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. I'd also like to thank our general managers, who collectively did a great job managing the restaurant P&Ls during quarter three, enabling Chipotle to deliver on financial commitment.","Okay. Over to you, Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. I'm equally pleased with how our team rose to the occasion and didn't miss a beat, despite managing a significant restructuring, to deliver a solid quarter and create sales momentum that has carried into the fourth quarter.","We generated revenue of $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.6% from last year, and comp sales growth of 4.4%. Restaurant level margins of 18.7% expanded 260 basis points from last year, contributing to underlying earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items up 62%, to $2.16. The third quarter had unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation. And that negatively impacted our tax rate and our earnings per share by about $0.80, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.36. As discussed last quarter, we'll continue to see costs over the next two quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation, and underperforming store closures.","In Q3, we recognized $26 million in total charges, with $10 million related to underperforming or closed restaurant, and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. As a result of the transformation, as well as non-cash tax items, our reported effective tax rate increased to 36.8%, or about 690 basis points higher than our underlying effective tax rate of 29.9%, which I'll explain later. The Q3 comp of 4.4% was primarily driven by a higher-average tax on the price increase taken last November and January. And to a lesser extent, the addition of queso to our menu.","During the quarter, comps were in the mid-single digits during July and August, before softening to low-single digits in September, when we compare to the advertised launch of queso in 2017. With the launch of our 'For Real' campaign, with national TV in late September, comps moved back up and are running 4% so far in October.","Looking to Q4, we'll lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants in November, which will be a headwind to our overall Q4 comp by about 100 basis points. We would typically provide a first glimpse of our comp guidance for 2019 right now. But with the growing pipeline of initiatives still early on in a stage-gate process, we'll hold off in providing 2019 comp guidance until we have a better perspective of the timing and expected impact of each of these initiatives.","We opened 28 new restaurants in the quarter, and continue to expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new openings guidance for the full year. Our new restaurants this year have opened at stronger levels, and we continue to emphasize high-quality, high-returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. As a result of these strong unit economics, combined with a healthy pipeline for next year's openings, we expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants in 2019. As mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. In the third quarter we closed 32 of these restaurants, and 38 in total, including the six closed in Q2, all related to the restructuring. The remaining underperforming restaurants will close over the next several quarters, as we pursue strategic alternatives to manage our future rent liability.","Food costs for the quarter were 33.4%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 35% in Q3 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase, as well as more favorable avocado prices. These were offset by elevated prices for beef and paper and packaging items. We expect to be in the low 33% range in Q4, with the slight decrease from Q3 due to the shift in the supply of avocados back to Mexico, Peru, and Chile.","Labor costs for the quarter were 27.2%, or flat compared to Q3 of last year. The price increase offset wage inflation of about 4% to 5%. We also decreased our worker's comp liability by about $4 million in the quarter, due to better management of claims activity so far this year. We expect labor costs to increase to the mid 28% range in Q4, as a result of deleverage from seasonally-lower sales, as well as continued wage pressure.","Occupancy costs for the quarter were 7.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points from Q3 last year, and that's due mostly to the increase in comp sales. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points from Q3 of last year. Our marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, a decrease of about 70 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. The lower-than-expected marketing in Q3 is due to a timing shift into Q4 as our 'For Real' campaign began in late September and will continue through mid-November.","As a result, we expect marketing and promo cost will be in the low 4% of sales during Q4, while full-year marketing and promo will still be right around 3% of sales overall for the year. Other operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on the Q4 2017 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year before abating in 2019.","SG&A in the quarter increased $24 million compared to Q2 of this year, the increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to $16 million in charges related to the restructuring and other unusual charges in the quarter, as well as $11 million for our biennial all-manager conference. Compared to Q3 of last year, the items I just listed mostly offset the one-time charge we had in the same quarter of last year.","Underlying G&A increased compared to last year, primarily in support of our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. For Q4, we expect total G&A to be right around $95 million, which includes an estimated $10 million to $12 million of restructuring related expenses. Underlying G&A in Q4, excluding bonuses and stock comp, is expected to be at similar levels as Q2 and Q3 of this year, however, both bonuses and stock comp are expected to be higher year-over-year as a result of better performance.","Depreciation for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the 3.7% in Q3 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for the restaurant closures we discussed earlier and to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation from the office closure. We now expect transformation costs from restructuring and restaurant closures and certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million versus our initial estimate of $115 million and $135 million, again, with most hitting in 2018.","So, far this year, we've charged nearly $70 million, and we estimate that another $10 million to $25 million will hit in Q4. And the remaining charges mostly related to terminating restaurant and office leases will still end in 2019. We'll continue to provide specifics on future transformation related costs when we have more certainty around timing and we'll break out the unusual costs for normal costs you can follow the underlying trends.","Our pre-tax income was $50.5 million, and reported effective tax rate was 36.8%. Our 36.8% recorded effective tax rate was higher than our 29.9% underlying rate due to the transformation costs and non-cash tax items related to the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with the underwater option. While we anticipate the underlying rate in Q4 to remain in the 28.9% to 29.9% range, we anticipate our effective Q4 tax rate to be in the high 30% range or higher through the impact of transformation changes as well as anticipated additional non-cash tax write-offs.","During the quarter, we repurchased $19 million of our stock at an average price of $474 per share, leaving about $100 million in our current buyback authorization. Our buyback rate will remain at this lower level, as we fund the transformation cost. This decrease is short term, and we expect to return opportunistically repurchasing shares at a higher level once we've completed the restructuring.","We're encouraged by our third quarter results, as our team has demonstrated that they can stay focused on serving our guests and executing growth drivers, while also being nimble on managing the business. Meanwhile, our support center made important progress in relocating and hiring talent, hosting our All Managers' Conference, and rebuilding an organizational structure designed to innovate and deliver on commitments to our guests, to our employees, and to our shareholders.","And now, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now being the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions on the comp trend. First, Brian or Jack, could you maybe talk about your estimate of the impact, if there was any, from the Ohio incident that was pretty well publicized? And I guess based on how you look at the business looking at maybe your average daily sales trend and seasonally adjust for that, do you think this most recent uplift from the marketing program has got you back on trend, if there was an impact in Q3? And then I have a couple follow-ups.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, David, this is Jack. There was a lot going on in the quarter. We compared in the middle of the quarter to some soft results from last year. We had Avocado Day that turned into a double day, once we broke the internet. We had a back-to-school promotion, then we compared to queso, then we had marketing at the end. So teasing out any single impact was very difficult. That's why I walked through and I wanted to give the comp trends throughout the quarter. The thing that we know for sure is that marketing did have an impact. As we went on air and as customers started seeing the commercials, we did see an improvement in our sales. And I think when I look through the net-net of it, by the time we left the quarter, I don't think there's any lasting impact of anything that happened in Ohio.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. That's helpful, Jack. And then on the quarter to-date, you mentioned up 4% for the comp. I know you're cycling now the mix benefits that you had with the queso. So I guess is traffic now running positive in the quarter-to-date period behind the advertising?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","David, it's right around flattish. When you look at the 4%, we're still carrying a price increase in about a couple thousand restaurants. We'll lap the next wave in November and then the final wave in January. So, I'd call the traffic right around flat.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. And then last question for Brian, you talked a lot about the stage-gate process with some of the menu innovation you're working on. So I guess at a high level, when do you think we'll start seeing some new items added to the menu? And then, if you can maybe share your perspective on what you've learned in adding new items to the menu in this operating model.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. So yeah, we've got obviously a couple items in the stage-gate process, all in various stages actually, both digital initiatives as well as food initiatives. And I think you're going to see both a digital total system from loyalty to our mobile app to our digital shelves. All those things are in test markets right now. And we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're continuing to learn, and the plan is they will start to touch in 2019, consumers; same thing with a food initiative or two. So, we're still early days, David, but we're learning a lot. We're optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're feeling like this stage-gate process is working, and it's going to set us up to execute with excellence on some of these initiatives coming to market in 2019.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Sounds great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. There were a couple of operational initiatives, Brian, you talked about either on or offline during the quarter, including throughput seemed like an early opportunity for you, and I think you talked about maybe purchasing, professionalizing that organization. Just some of the operational things that you're taking on, where are you on those, and did they have any impact on the past quarter?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","So, we are early days into both of those, and the good news is, I would say our operational focus, I feel like we're out of the starting blocks with getting our throughput to a higher level than where we've been. But really our focus was, at that All Managers' Conference to get everybody aligned on values so that we're hiring the right people. So that ultimately we can end up with a stable team with the right leaders. And then the other key focus for that meeting was to make sure people understood we're getting back to the throughput excellence, great-tasting food. You do those two things, you end up with great customer hospitality.","And what I love is I feel like we're out of the blocks on all these things. And we should \u2013 as we go into 2019, we'll continue to make progress as opposed to just getting started with it in 2019. And the same thing goes for the supply chain leadership. Carlos, actually myself, and Jack, we've already started our visits with some of our key partners, and it's been great to understand the relationships that were started, in some cases, 25 years ago, to some that are relatively new. And the good news is, I think this is an iterative process where there's opportunities for Chipotle and our suppliers to benefit going forward. So I'm very optimistic on both of those fronts, and I feel like a lot of good work has been put in place so that when we walk into 2019, we'll start to see some real tangible benefits.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just one more for me. On the digital sales growth this quarter, which was impressive, are you seeing the operational benefits you hoped? Particularly some of maybe the margin benefits you hoped, utilizing the second make-line? Or is it too early, and you have to get sort of a threshold of volume going through that second make-line to really start to see some of the margin leverage benefit that you might expect?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's a little too early on the margin side of it. But one of the things that's been great to see is where we have the digital make-line, where we have our shelves, and you've got, obviously, the customer app everywhere. We're seeing increases in customer satisfaction, and we're continuing to see a higher ticket. And it's playing across all those digital channels that you would expect, the app, the web, and in delivery.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon. It seems to me you've had \u2013 or you're in the midst of a headquarter cultural reset in combination with what is store alignment that could be very powerful. So I'm curious, what are today's store-level incentive metrics? And I've noticed on some of my visits some customer contacts in the dining room, and I'm wondering if that's a particular element that you're focusing on?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. We are very much focused on, we want people to walk away from Chipotle with a top guest experience. I think you heard me mention this. When we say the line is the moment of truth, we believe the whole stage is set from the second you see our line. And those are both digital lines, as well as our customer-facing lines. And I think what Scott and his team have been also focused on is we've got to make sure our hospitality matches that line experience. So, you will see some table touches. You'll see what Scott calls his four cornerstones start to roll out across the system. So, I'm delighted to hear that you're seeing that first-hand.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And could you speak more specifically about the incentive metrics for the store-level employees?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. We can talk a bit more about that. Scott, I don't know if you want to chime in here, but this is all based on our restaurant AB (27:31) scorecard. So why don't you take that?","Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Hi, Nicole. Good to hear from you. Scott here. Yeah, so our incentives currently are tied to our AB (27:38) scorecard, which encompasses sales and profits, obviously, but also incorporates the guest experience, food safety obviously being paramount to our business. So when we ladder that up, we understand where we are from a business unit perspective. And everyone's striving to reach the A level. We've made great progress this year of getting there. So hopefully that answers your question around incentives specifically.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's very helpful. And just a last question. Brian, when you first talked to us a couple conference calls ago, you talked a lot about enhancing and aiding the Chipotle awareness. And today I heard you talk about customers wanting accessibility. So could you compare and contrast those opportunities? And how are you approaching and prioritizing the strategies and tactics between those two opportunities?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I think you have picked up on what I think are the two biggest levers outside of our operational excellence, around throughput and great hospitality. I think what you just saw with the 'For Real' marketing campaign \u2013 and this is what meant by being more visible, and also being more focused on what makes Chipotle unique, different. So you're going to continue to see us push very hard on getting across what makes Chipotle different, what makes Chipotle driving food culture. And then obviously, we want our marketing to be driving the purchase as well. And I think that can be done at the brand level, which is very exciting for Chipotle. Because I think our purpose is powerful.","The other big lever for us is access, and I think it's going to be driven by this digital access. So, those are two things that we are very focused on getting front-and-center. And then obviously, I think there are opportunities for menu variety and a few other things that we talked about. But probably the two biggest focus areas here in the very near-term are the visibility of the Chipotle brand and purpose. Because I think we're creating a new category with folks, and changing food culture. And when we're much more visible with it, customers respond. And then the digital access aspect is another place where we're seeing great response across that whole digital system that we're rolling out.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So is it fair maybe for us to think about awareness is really generating the call to action, and the access is just reducing the friction to get to you? Is that right?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well said. I should have started there.","Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you for your time, appreciate it. Congratulations.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I got two follow-ups. One is just on traffic. I think in the past we've heard there's been a bit of a struggle with frequency, in the sense of just all tiers of customers maybe coming a little bit less. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there? Is this where loyalty comes in? Or is it the new menu items that'll bring people back more frequently? So besides access, what are customers telling you that they want to see most, in order to ramp up that frequency curve, which used to be such a tailwind to Chipotle comps? And then I'll have another one.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. So, yes, what we've seen \u2013 and this is early days \u2013 is with our loyalty pilot, we're seeing people that have less frequency entering the program. And we don't have enough time to truly understand what ultimately is going to be the impact on their frequency. But we're very excited about the cohort that we're seeing come into the loyalty program in the early days. So we think that is going to play out where that program will be a key vehicle for driving frequency among key cohorts that today have an opportunity to increase the frequency. The other thing that's been really exciting is a lot of our digital business is attracting new and lapsed users to our business. So that's been another real exciting learning for us. Then I think your point on what about the people that historically were coming all the time? I think that's where we need to get back to talking about what makes Chipotle unique in culture, specifically food culture, what makes our purpose so different. Because that really resonates with our heavy users that are bought in. And we've seen some early indications that that's a great way to drive frequency into our loyalists.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, that's helpful. And then just on the unit, you were sort of at the low-end of the range this year, but obviously will be above that in fiscal 2019, according to guidance. I'm just trying to understand the extent to which this year's build rate was maybe a function of re-establishing your growth pipeline or your development, how you approach it, versus just the how many attractive trade areas are left? And next year, I guess, would we expect to see more of a mix shift towards some of the newer, less established? Or are you going to continue to mostly focus on these established markets?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I'll answer and then I'll let Jack chime in as well. But yeah, look, what we're really excited about is the restaurants that we opened this year opened very strong. And the economics support continuing to open Chipotle restaurants above the rate at which we opened this year. And I think that was the guidance we just shared with you all. The thing that's also exciting about Chipotle is we're finding we're having success in some new formats. As I mentioned in the earlier statements, the digital pick-up lane is a very exciting proposition. We're going to do more of those next year. We're also very excited about how we're seeing success in proven markets, and the new markets that we tapped the brakes on, frankly, a while ago. But the economic model of new restaurant openings is very powerful. And as such, we're building the pipeline accordingly, so that where the opportunities present itself, we can take advantage of those. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing, Brian, I would add is, Sara, we did increase the quality this year, and that showed. We've got better economics this year than we have in the past few. We were more discerning. We were more selective. We did focus more of our attention in the proven and fully-developed markets. But we also had great success in some of the new and developing. So I think by being discerning, both in our proven markets and our developing and new markets, we've got better quality. I think that sets the table now, for us to take this stairstep up that we talked about next year. And I fully expect if we continue to build this kind of quality, we'll look for another stairstep the year after. So we focus on quality first and then quantity second.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much, very helpful.","Operator","The next question will come from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Just wondering if you could \u2013 I know you've probably given us a bunch of thoughts coming out of your consumer research, but more importantly, on pricing for next year, any initial conclusions on how you're going to approach pricing versus the historical practice of a larger price increase every several years?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I'll let Jack \u2013 go ahead, Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, Andy, we have mentioned on previous calls, we're open to a whole different approach. We're in the early stages of talking to some outside parties about our menu compared to competition, customers that shop within our menu, and are there opportunities? I think you'll more likely see us take smaller price increases rather than wait two or three years or so and then take a larger one, but nothing to report right now.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on again, looking out to next year, having 'For Real' for the full year, how do you anticipate the marketing windows to fall versus, obviously, the late roll this year?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. So we are still in the planning phases on exactly when and where we want to use national media. But what we feel really good about is we believe we've got the right communication, and now we're working through how we use the right communication vehicles at the right time. But what we do know is we'll have an always-on social, mobile, digital effort. And then we're still working through how we use the traditional mediums throughout the year in 2019.","Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I guess just a follow-up to Andy's questions. 3% for marketing, how are you arriving at that as the right number? And how do we think about that going into 2019?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. So we believe 3% is the right number based on what our planning process is sharing with us. We're using our stage-gate process to really understand what does each initiative provide, as far as growth goes, layered on top of our throughput effort. And what we've seen is as of right now, as we re-approach the marketing budget, we're going to change the allocation from a lot of local marketing to more national. And in that switch, it changes the level of visibility that we can achieve with our marketing dollar. What should happen is, our 3% should feel like we're much bigger than what our 3% has been historically. And that's our ingoing assumption. Obviously if we find, through our stage-gate process, that we have an opportunity to enhance the marketing, because the result matches the increased investment, then we'll do that opportunistically. But the going-in plan is to make more out of the 3% than we have in the past.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Can I ask just a quick follow-up? For your 2018, what percent of that marketing budget is digital?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Chris? Do you know that off the top of your head?","Christopher Brandt - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I don't know the answer off the top. And I don't know that we necessarily want to give everybody a clue into that. But clearly, with our consumer base skewing more millennial and more Gen Z, that digital is an integral part of the program for us. And one of the things we have a lot of things going on with stage-gate, in terms of five initiatives. But even the media that we're running, we're constantly in a state of where we look at how it goes and how we evaluate it, and how it moves the business. And we'll feel free to shift things between more traditional linear media and digital media as the results warrant.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, a couple follow-ups for me as well. You talked about operations, digital menu innovation, and obviously you've done a lot of research and testing. But if you were to rank your biggest bucket or buckets of opportunity from this point, how would you do that, in terms of what is going to be the biggest source of improvement? I think the assumption might be new menu news being the unlock from here, but wanted to hear your thoughts.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, look, I don't think new menu news is the primary unlock. I think it plays a role. But I think the digital access, removing friction, and getting into digital access is a big unlock for the Chipotle business. Throughput, reclaiming our throughput capability is another big unlock. And then obviously, I think making the brand more visible and more resonant with this 'For Real' campaign is another unlock. So menu will play a role. But I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput, and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be big unlocks.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And Jack, in the past, you've had these rules of thumbs about margins, restaurant-level margins, and their commensurate level of sales per unit. How has your thinking been changing on that? Obviously you see innovation in delivery or things that bring complexity, and you think that could be margin dilutive. And on the other side, you've talked about productivity. And of course, there's labor inflation and pricing. Have you really shifted how you think about what margins are possible at what levels of sales?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","No, David, we go through and study this carefully. I think everything with digital, with delivery, we feel good that any time there's an added cost, that there's an opportunity for inefficiency there. So I still think when we get to $2.1 million, we can be in the 21% margin. $2.2 million is a 22% margin. Wage inflation is a bit of a wildcard. We can't overcome that with transaction growth alone. That will require some careful timing and place in a menu price increase. But if we can (41:57) well-thought-out menu price increases to make sure that we manage labor inflation, the model is still intact. And there's efficiencies of moving our customers from the front line to the second make-line. And then it's a matter of working with our delivery partners to make sure that the economics work for both us and them. But everything I've said in the past, David, still intact.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick housekeeping questions and I have another one. What was the actual cost to the manager conference in the quarter? And what are you looking for first stock comp for the year?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","What was the numbers for the conference?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","It was like, $10 million in the quarter, $11 million for the year. Stock comp for the year is in the \u2013 between $60 million and $65 million.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then, as we've started to see some of the marketing digital initiatives take hold, is there anything you're seeing, in terms of regional variations, in the comp performance? And what I'm really getting at are markets that might be thought of as having more competition in the overall fast-casual space, and specifically with concepts that share a lot of the same philosophies and values around food quality and sourcing. Are those regions keeping pace with the system?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. We're not seeing big variations in performance based on the initiatives that we've rolled out to date. When we've done our stage-gate process, we've tried to be true to representing the full United States, so we get a picture of how this performs across the country. So no, we've not seen that issue.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Thank you. On the labor rate in the quarter, you did a good job of managing that relative to what you had anticipated, or told us what it would be in July. What improved relative to what you had assumed back in July?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","I missed the first part of your question. Sorry, you cut out.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","The labor rate looked a little better than you had guided in July, and I'm curious what came in better than what you had anticipated, from a labor standpoint?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, two things. Our teams worked really hard to manage workers comp and workers comp is something that you don't see the benefit week-by-week or month-by-month. But we saw steady progress throughout the year, and so we were able to make an adjustment there. And then secondly, Scott and the team, they challenged the team during the third quarter to really take a close look at staffing and making sure you got the right people throughout the day. And so we saw some efficiency gained throughout the quarter as well. So those are the two things. And I agree with you that we did a nicer job with labor in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","In the quarter, you ran a few offers to grow digital usage. I think you ran a BOGO and you had the free delivery offer. Did that have any impact on the margin? And is promotion something that you would use on a go-forward basis to drive utilization of that? Or would you expect it to be more of just a more natural increase in digital usages as awareness of the platform builds?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Let me answer the latter part of the question, then I can hand it back to Jack on your margin question. Yeah, what we have seen is when we increase awareness of the digital platforms, we get a good response. And I think over time, our loyalty program and using analytics to inform how we incentivize behaviors is going be the future. You'll see us continue to use what I would call broad scale incentives as we build the database and get people into our loyalty program, get people using the mobile app. But where we're ultimately headed is we want \u2013 I think we're less than 50% awareness on these digital platforms. We need to improve that dramatically. And then once we get them into the platform, we need to create a capability around using analytics to drive the right incentives for the right cohort at the right time. So with that approach, we think good things happen throughout the entire P&L. But Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything else.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. Listen, I think that was well said. Yes, it does have a theoretical impact on our margin. We give away guacamole. Guacamole, our customers love it. It comes with more than 50% of our transactions. And we gave away a lot of it that we planned on giving it away for one day. We gave it away for two days. But not anything that I would call out when you look at $1.2 billion in sales over the entire quarter. It wasn't material enough to look at. But it's an investment worth making, because we attracted a lot of people into our digital platform, and so it's an investment that will pay off. So it has a theoretical impact on the margin, but not enough to call out during the quarter.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you very much. Two questions. One, just following up on the unit growth discussion. Clearly, you're upping the absolute number in 2019. I'm just wondering how you actually arrive at that absolute number? You talked about how there's lots of opportunities and different types of stores that you could do. I know a few years back you were doing well north of 200 stores a year. So I'm wondering how do you think about, maybe what are the guardrails or challenges to a greater stairstep in growth? I don't know if you think there's certain markets that are at saturation, or is it real-estate availability, or cost to build or quality of managers? I'm just wondering what keeps you from ramping up that number more meaningfully in the short-term?","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Look I think one of the things that always have to go hand in hand with new restaurants is having managers ready to take over those new restaurants. So you have to take it at a measured pace as we increase year to year. Because the last thing you want to be doing is opening restaurants ahead of your capability to run them.","The good news is, I think our economic model suggests we still have room to grow in a meaningful way. And the Chipotle employee value proposition is very compelling. So we're able to attract managers, apprentices, to get them prepared and developed so that they can be part of the growth story as well. So it's really that balancing act if you got to have the teams ready to work and lead the restaurant, coupled with making sure you've got the right economic sites available to open it in. You can't just all of a sudden \u2013 well, you could, but we're not going to just go guardrail to guardrail on this thing. I think we would find ourselves not executing very well. So those are the principles we're using.","Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then you mentioned the unlocks earlier, which I thought was interesting. You didn't mention anything about, I guess, maybe extended store hours. I know there was some talk of selling burritos earlier in the day or going into breakfast store. I know certain markets you're now doing more late-night initiatives. I'm just wondering how you assess what extended hours might work, what might not work, and the potential opportunity.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah. I think one of things we learned through the stage-gate process is ours is going to be a surgical approach. It's not a blunt initiative. And so I'm delighted that we learned that in pilots, as opposed to on a national level. You'll see our hours be very surgical. Where it makes sense, you'll see us have some different hours. But it's not going to be a national, blunt effort.","Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks.","Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, everybody, for listening and joining in. I think as I said in my earlier remarks, very proud of what this team has accomplished in the third quarter. I do believe our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is making tremendous progress. The team that we're building in the support center, I am very excited about diversity of the talent and the caliber of the talent.","I'm also very excited about how we've moved all these initiatives forward while moving the company to a new cultural space through this relocation and restructuring. So the Chipotle brand continues to be a purpose-driven brand that we continue to learn, over and over again, means a lot to our customers, means a lot to our team members, and very proud of what we accomplished to date, and also very optimistic about the pipeline that we're building and the initiatives that we're focused on going forward.

We also have Scott Boatwright, our Chief Restaurant Officer and Jim Marsden, our Executive Director of Food Safety available for questions.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. When I opened the first Chipotle restaurant 24 years ago, I set out to prove that food served fast doesn't have to be a typical fast food experience. I spent hours preparing the freshest ingredients using the classic cooking techniques I had perfected as a chef. When it came time for service, I was able to serve the food I had prepared incredibly fast in a format that allowed my customers to get exactly what they wanted. Fast forward 24 years and Chipotle is still fundamentally the same experience I created in that very first restaurant, but much within the company has changed. As we grew, we had the opportunity to work with our farmers, ranchers, and suppliers to change the way our ingredients are produced. I'm proud of the positive influence we've had on the development of a more sustainable food system in our country. I remain true to my original vision for Chipotle, and am more committed than ever to be a champion for positive change in making real food accessible to more people than ever before.","But as we've grown, we have also encountered our share of adversity. Our unprecedented success leading up to 2015 has masked operational weakness in some key areas of our business. The food safety incidents of 2015 revealed that our food safety program needed to be more robust and it became clear that we were focused too much on building cultures that didn't drive the results we were expecting, and too little on the operations fundamentals required to deliver an exceptional guest experience.","Upon returning to the position of sole CEO at Chipotle late last year, I committed to fulfilling the promise of dramatically improving the guest experience and making Chipotle the safest place to eat. I'd like to discuss our progress toward each of these goals now.","With regard to food safety, we have formed an independent food advisory council comprised of the nation's leading food safety experts to oversee and advise us on our food safety practices. Additionally, I directed our Head of Food Safety, Dr. Jim Marsden, to develop the most comprehensive food safety program in the industry. Jim has implemented a robust food safety program, which includes the implementation of a HACCP food safety program in all of our restaurants. HACCP stands for hazard analysis and critical control point, and we're the only major restaurant company to have such a program; the implementation of a third-party food safety auditing system, all managers earn a rigorous food safety certification; the installation of advanced ventilation purification systems in our restaurants; and the implementation of a rapid deployment team, including food safety experts and nurses in the event that any food safety incident does occur.","All of this creates one of the most advanced food safety programs anywhere. However, no matter how advanced our systems are, it is not possible to completely eliminate all risk, and unfortunately, we had a norovirus incident in one of our restaurants in Virginia last week. Norovirus is a common and highly contagious illness affecting nearly 20 million Americans each year and is unrelated to our food supply chain. It's commonly spread within closed environments like cruise ships, schools, and restaurants. We're disappointed that we failed to prevent it from affecting our customers and employees in our Virginia restaurant. We deeply regret that anyone became ill and I'd like to apologize to those who were affected.","We quickly reached out to our employees and customers to provide assistance, and to ensure their well-being. Our safety systems are designed to provide very fast detection and rigorous procedures to quickly remedy the situation. In this case, we were able to quickly detect the problem, proactively alert the Health Department and close and sanitize the restaurant. We have isolated the failure that occurred. It was a failure in one restaurant to comply with our procedures used to prevent norovirus.","We know that our procedures work when executed properly, but compliance in each restaurant is essential. In order to reduce the risk of this happening again, we are undertaking an additional comprehensive communication and training effort to ensure that every manager and every field leader understands and execute these norovirus prevention procedures, and that they understand that compliance with our procedures is non-negotiable and a condition of their employment. We will continue to build a culture of compliance in our operations through relentlessly training and enforcing adherence to our policies.","Beyond my commitment to continued improvements in food safety, I also promised to dramatically improve the customer experience in our restaurants. Core to this was focusing our teams on delivering an excellent guest experience. This included a new measurement and bonus system that rewards our managers and teams on a handful of easy to understand metrics, the majority of which are customer satisfaction oriented. We have increased the number of restaurants meeting our high operational standards, and have reduced general manager turnover. We have also recently implemented a new guest satisfaction survey, and are intensely focused on steadily improving our scores.","During the quarter, we hired Scott Boatwright as our first ever Chief Restaurant Officer. Scott comes to us from Arby's, where he was responsible for the success of nearly 2,000 franchised and company owned restaurants. Scott has a very strong vision for creating a compelling guest experience and he's already demonstrated that his expertise will dramatically improve operations inside our restaurants. All our field leaders now report directly up to Scott and we are confident that we will continue to see strengthened operations in our restaurants under his leadership.","In addition to strengthening our leadership team and simplifying our restaurant operations, we are now executing with more discipline against a clear set of strategic priorities, which is enabling our teams to pursue innovation projects in a more effective manner. As you are likely aware, we opened the Chipotle Next Kitchen in New York City earlier this month. The Next Kitchen is a Chipotle restaurant where we explore changes to our menu. The Next Kitchen is primarily intended to test the operational impact of potential new menu items. This includes how they'll be prepped, cooked, presented, and served, in addition to the operational implications of the training required for proper execution.","While the restaurant is not intended to definitively determine customer acceptance of new menu items, it's open to the public so that we can interact with the customers, while they order and enjoy the new menu items. Once the new items have been evaluated in the Next Kitchen, they may be put into wider consumer testing in various markets to determine customer acceptance. The Next Kitchen is currently serving queso, frozen margaritas, new salad greens served with an avocado citrus dressing, and bu\u00f1uelos, our crispy cinnamon dessert with a Chipotle infused chocolate dipping sauce.","I work closely with the menu development team to create the recipes. Each item is delicious and it complements our current Chipotle offerings nicely. I believe they all have the potential to earn a place on our menu, and because of the early operational success we found with our queso offering, we'll expand the test to two markets in August in order to evaluate its customer acceptance.","As you know, one of the hallmarks of Chipotle's success over the years has been our focused menu and our commitment to doing just a few things so that we can do them exceptionally well. As part of our larger customer experience strategy work, we're exploring innovations that will appeal to our guests, while being mindful to avoid adding unnecessary complexity to our restaurant operations.","Of our last 24 years, there's no doubt the last two have been extremely challenging. But we are emerging as a stronger company. We've built stronger teams, refined our strategy, enhanced our technology, advanced our food with integrity offerings, and are carefully evolving our customer experience with changes to our menu and to our environments. We are doing all this with the aim of creating loyal customers by delivering a compelling dining experience and ensuring that real food, raised with respect, is accessible to more and more people, ultimately creating greater shareholder value.","I'll now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Our marketing efforts have always included a combination of brand-building efforts and transaction-driving promotions and advertising. The brand-building programs target existing customers and are designed to strengthen brand loyalty. The advertising campaigns cast a wider net and target current lapsed and new customers. For the last year, we have increased all of our marketing activities, first with increased promotional activity, and then with increased advertising.","While this increased marketing activity has been effective, it's clear that winning back occasions lost to competitors is going to be an ongoing challenge. The solution to winning back customers is not simply to spend more on advertising or tweaks to the creative approach. To win new customers, attract lapsed customers and increase the frequency of our existing customers, we need to evolve the Chipotle experience and create more compelling reasons for customers to visit.","There's tremendous demand for something new from Chipotle, and we are actively working to add excitement to our menu and our environments and to add new ways to order from Chipotle, all while staying true to the core promise of our brand. To accomplish this, we took a comprehensive look at our overall customer experience with an eye toward the future. We carefully examined all the different ways our customers order from Chipotle today, and how that might change in the future. We looked at what our customers order and how single orders, group orders, and family orders differ. We looked at how customers might like to access Chipotle, including in-store physical and digital ordering, out of store digital ordering, dining in, in-store pickup, in-vehicle pickup, and delivery.","And we took a close look at the different ways people might like to access Chipotle, including smaller catering formats, family meals, and-grab-and-go options, and, of course, we looked at the menu itself with an eye toward appealing to new customers or to create new options to encourage existing customers to visit more often. From this strategy, we have begun to enhance the Chipotle experience in areas with the most potential. An obvious example of this is the Next Kitchen in New York, where we are experimenting with four new menu items. But other examples include the new digitally-enhanced second make line, where digital orders are fulfilled, which is currently active in 25 New York restaurants. And it includes changes to the design of our existing and new restaurants to optimize them for digital orders, new types of ordering formats, and new menu items. This includes the first ever Chipotle vehicular pickup window that will be opening at an Ohio restaurant this fall.","These changes, and especially the changes to our menu, also enhance the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We know that many of our lapsed customers are waiting for a reason to return to Chipotle and new menu items are an ideal way to spark the necessary interest. New menu items are also ideally suited to advertising, especially the 15-second television spots that make up the majority of our television ad buying.","Along those lines, I'd like to share with you the details for expanding the test of queso that Steve mentioned. Now that we have successfully completed the operational test in New York, we will be rolling out queso to more than 350 restaurants across markets within Central and Southern California and Colorado, beginning on August 1. We will measure customer acceptance of queso, during which time we will evaluate a national rollout, which we think could happen as early as mid-September. But the decision for a national rollout is subject to the results of the test that begins August 1. At this time, the other items in the Next Kitchen are still in their operational test phase, but we expect that some of those items may also proceed to consumer testing at some point.","Last quarter, we launched our first national marketing campaign that included television. The campaign is called As Real as it Gets, and is focused on the use of real whole ingredients in our food. The campaign consisted of television, out of home, digital, radio, social, and search marketing. The digital component of the campaign was successful in driving 45% of all online orders and 60% of all catering orders during the advertising flight.","Based on our research, the first wave of television advertising during the April flight resonated with existing customers, but was less effective at driving transactions among non-customers, even though it scored above industry averages for television effectiveness. Prior to the second flight in May, we updated the creative to feature more appetite appeal, which contributed to a 10-point increase in intended visitation among fast food and fast casual diners who viewed the advertising. But while the feedback on the campaign was positive, we have an opportunity to make the television advertising more effective at driving traffic into our restaurants. In preparation for the upcoming advertising push in September, which again includes significant television advertising, we further refined the ads to include even more appetite appeal and tested the creative approach. We anticipate these ads will drive increased consideration in visitation with new and lapsed customers.","In anticipation of successful consumer testing of queso and a subsequent national rollout, we have developed advertising, both for television and elsewhere that features queso. The inclusion of a new menu offering has the potential to significantly improve the impact and traffic-driving potential of the campaign, especially with the television advertising.","As we head into the new quarter, we just launched a new traffic driving program called SAVOR.WAVS, working in partnership with RZA, the multi-platinum hip-hop artist, producer, and founding member of the Wu Tang Clan. We created an interactive experience where customers compose their favorite Chipotle order, which SAVOR.WAVS then translates into a unique musical and visual experience based on their order. During the experience, customers see how each of our real ingredients was paired with a musical sound created by RZA. We also invited several well-known artists to create their own order and remix the songs in their style. RZA and the Wu Tang Clan created one of the remixes, all of which are available on Spotify.","We are supporting SAVOR.WAVS with an advertising campaign that targets our fans as well as new and lapsed customers through our own social channels, as well as paid promotions that include unique partnerships with Spotify and support from Pandora, SoundCloud, Complex, Bustle, Facebook, and Instagram. And to tie SAVOR.WAVS directly to our continued effort to drive sales, we have included a BOGO offer for consumers that go online and complete the SAVOR.WAVS experience. So far, 2.6 million customers have composed their order within SAVOR.WAVS and earned a BOGO offer.","Before I turn the call over to Curt, I'd like to provide an update on our development efforts. During the quarter, we opened 50 restaurants and remain on track to open between 195 restaurants and 210 restaurants this year.","I will now turn the call over to Curt.","Curtis Evander Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. As we've discussed before, Chipotle has taken a holistic approach to digital. We've made significant improvements to the digital customer experience through the launch of our new ordering website, smarter pickup times technology and most recently, meal customizations, which allows our customers to personalize their Chipotle meal through our digital ordering platform the same way they order in line. We've also improved our staffing and training of our existing dedicated second make lines, which we have in nearly every restaurant, to ensure that digital orders are fulfilled without impacting throughput on the front serving line. And as Mark mentioned, these improvements have allowed us to begin to invest in digital marketing with a clear call to action for digital ordering.","This holistic approach has created a digital flywheel that has driven a strong customer response and set records during the quarter. Web ordering increased 52% compared to Q2 2016, while mobile ordering increased 37%, and catering increased 9%. Second make line sales as a percentage of overall sales rose to 8.5%, a new record for the company in terms of sales dollars and percent of overall sales. Our busiest restaurants continue to see the highest sales gains on the second make line, with our top 250 restaurants recording second make line sales at almost 15%, a sign that our flywheel is improving the customer experience in our highest volume locations.","Looking forward, we will continue to invest in improving the digital experience for our customers as part of the overall customer experience strategy that Mark discussed. We've recently deployed our new tech-enabled second make line to 25 restaurants in Manhattan and have plans to have approximately 100 of these new second make lines installed by the end of the year. Early results have confirmed that these new tech-enabled lines have as much as a 40% improvement to throughput. We are working through the details of the plan for 2018 and estimate several hundred additional restaurants will receive the new tech-enabled line next year.","Additionally, we remain on track to launch a new mobile app this year. This will be the first major release of a mobile app at Chipotle in years, and will contain substantial improvements to the digital experience for our customers, including the ability to pay with a mobile wallet, rapid order and reorder, and integrated digital offers. Customers ordering from restaurants with the new tech-enabled second make line will get enhanced features such as order completion notifications and arrival detection for the vehicular pickup window. While we are in the early days of positioning Chipotle as a leader in digital, we have great momentum and are encouraged by the customer reaction and results we have seen so far.","I'll now turn the call over to Jack.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Curt. We continue to face significant challenges as we work to restore customer trust and restore our economic model. The events of the past week have made those challenges even more difficult. But we've made important progress so far this year, and we have opportunity to build on that progress in the coming months. Specifically, we changed how we define and reward success, based on providing an excellent guest experience, which has resulted in improving internal restaurant grades each month since last year.","We have the highest percentage of internally rated A restaurants that we have had since we redirected our Restaurateur program. Our general manager turnover is the lowest it has been in more than eight years and our labor deployment is the most efficient it has been in the past seven years. And while we're pleased to see this early progress, we remain committed to continue to elevate the guest experience by investing in the training and development of our restaurant crew and managers. We know there's a strong correlation between restaurants with a strong culture of training and creating an excellent guest experience, and there's also a strong correlation between great training and low turnover at both the crew and manager levels. At our upcoming field leader conference next month, where all of our field leaders throughout the country will gather, the main focus will be around creating a strong culture of training and development in each and every restaurant.","We also have the potential to delight our guests with new menu items, such as queso, as Mark discussed, which is the single most requested item our guests ask for. We'll continue to invest in technology to improve the guest out of store ordering, which already is our fastest-growing sales channel, as Curt discussed.","And finally, after absorbing inflation in our economic model for more than three years now, we believe we have the ability to recover some of that inflation through price increases, as the increase we have taken so far in about 500 restaurants has seen little resistance. And I'll talk more about that in a few minutes.","During the second quarter, our comparable restaurant sales grew 8.1%, fueling a 17.1% total sales growth to $1.17 billion. The comp was primarily driven by an increase of 5.3% in paid traffic comps over last year. Average check increased about 2.8%, mainly as a result of fewer promotions, primarily BOGOs from last year. The news surrounding a cyber-event had a temporary impact for a few weeks, and overall for the quarter had an impact of around 30 basis points to 50 basis points on the comp.","In markets where we increased prices, the overall resistance was less than 20%, and most markets saw no resistance at all. This gives us confidence that we do have pricing power with our existing guests in those markets. Remember, we selected the first group of market primarily based on identifying them as low-risk markets where the negative sales impact in 2016 was less severe, where competitor prices were generally high, and where we expected the resistance would be low. We are currently reviewing the next year of restaurants for a possible price increase using the same risk profile analyses. While we would like to execute the price increase on the next tier of market sometime in the fall, the exact timing will depend on the timing of a possible queso rollout and the consumer sentiment and visit habits following the events of last week.","Through the first two and a half weeks of July, our average daily sales levels have held steady to June and the two-year comp trend was holding at the same level as Q2. As a perspective, with last year's Q3 comp of negative 21.9%, maintaining the same two-year comp trend would require a Q3 2017 comp of a positive 5.6%. It is too soon to know what enduring impact last week's events may cause, if any, but comps have been negatively affected by about 5.5% on average over the last several days. Of course, our hope is that the impact will fade over the coming weeks, and that the marketing and buzz around the queso expanded test will change the narrative and encourage our guests to quickly return to their previous visit frequencies. While at this early stage visibility is limited, we have reiterated our full-year comp guidance of high single-digits, which assumes some recovery of the impact from last week, along with the possibly of a queso rollout and a likely menu price increase in Q4.","Our restaurant level operating margins improved in the quarter to 18.9% from 15.5% in the second quarter of 2016. While sales growth remains the most important lever to restoring our economic model, we continue to look for opportunities to find cost savings through better contract negotiations with our suppliers and improved controllable costs inside the restaurants, especially with our food costs and our labor management lines. Our margins are not quite at the 20% target we had set late last year, but we are within striking distance and can get there with help from normalizing avocado prices and by building greater comp momentum.","Food costs during the quarter were 34.1% of sales, mostly in line with last year. The short supply environment for avocados continue to pressure our food costs by about 140 basis points compared to last year and by 70 basis points compared to last quarter. These higher avocado costs mask our cost savings achieved related to reduction in food waste and resulting from changes in food safety procedures and lower paper and packaging costs. We also benefited from higher rebates at the end of the quarter tied to an agreement milestone that contributed 15 basis points. And this benefit was not anticipated in our prior guidance for the second quarter.","On a sequential basis from Q1 to Q2, our food costs increased 30 basis points from 33.8% to 34.1% due to higher avocado prices. We are already starting to see some minor relief in pricing as we transitioned seasonally from California to Mexico in July along with higher supply than expected from Mexico. If avocado prices continue to improve, we believe that our food costs can improve by about 40 basis points in Q3 and move to the low 33% range in Q4. And that is before the impact of any possible future price increases.","Our labor costs in the quarter were 26.2% of sales, or a 160 basis point improvement over last year. The combination of sales leverage in our peak seasonal sales period and better scheduling and deployment of labor contributed to year-over-year decrease. These efficiencies were offset by wage inflation of about 4% and we believe that that inflation will continue at least at this level through the back half of the year.","Other operating costs were 14% during the quarter, down from 15.2% during Q2 2016. Excluding marketing and promo costs, other operating expenses improved by 50 basis points. Our combined marketing and promo expense was 3.7% in Q2 and decreased 70 basis points compared to last year as we lapped a high volume of promotional offers related to direct mail in Q2 2016. For the second half of the year, we currently expect our marketing and promo costs will ease slightly to about 3.1% of sales. On a sequential basis from Q1, underlying other operating expenses, including marketing and promo, improved 35 basis points due to leverage on higher seasonal sales, but was offset by 25 basis points due to higher advising and promo in Q2.","To add a bit more perspective on other operating expenses, as you know, the line item consists of about 20 individual expense line items. In addition to marketing and promo, some of the other larger line items include bank fees, which actually grow faster than sales, as credit card sales continue to grow at a faster rate than cash sales; and utilities, which are generally fixed and will move with energy cost changes and seasonal usage, but typically not move with sales fluctuations. All other components are under 100 basis points each, and include items such as employee meals, M&R, insurance, et cetera, and generally are semi-fixed in nature. These grow in absolute dollars as we build additional restaurants, so sequentially from Q1 to Q2, excluding marketing and promo, other operating expenses grew 6%, or $6.8 million to $121.5 million and were 10.4% of sales. This $6.8 million increase is comprised of a $2.4 million increase in credit card fees, about $1.7 million increase from net new stores with the remaining $2.7 million increase arising from the semi-fixed nature of the remaining line items.","So prior to adding new stores to the base and prior to the increase in credit card fees, our underlying leverage on the other operating expenses would have been about 70 basis points from Q1 to Q2, but including the new stores added and the higher credit card fees, the leverage was about 35 basis points, again not counting changes in marketing and promo. To add a bit more clarity, the nature of these line items sometimes results in quarter-to-quarter volatility, such as with insurance adjustments or changes in energy costs and often these moves go both ways among the line items and often offset each other. And when they don't, we will point out unusual non-recurring increases or decreases. In the second half of the year, these other operating expenses, including marketing, will continue to grow in absolute dollars with seasonal expenses like utilities and as we continue to open new restaurants. I hope this discussion provides better clarify for how sales leverage works for this relatively small collection of often misunderstood line items.","G&A was 6% of sales, down from 7.1% of sales last year. G&A dollars were down $700,000 from Q2 of last year, driven by lower legal expenses and maintaining a disciplined approach across the rest of our underlying G&A costs. These reductions were offset by increased employee bonus accruals and stock comp expense. For the quarter, stock comp was $19.2 million and we continue to expect full-year stock comp to be approximately $65 million to $70 million. In Q3, we'll also hold our biennial field leadership conference, which will cost about $1 million.","For the full year, we now expect G&A to be slightly lower than previous guidance, in the $290 million range, which is down from prior expectations of $300 million for the year. However, I would note that we have not accrued any possible liability related to the cyber incident from earlier this year, and we also haven't included any possible liability in our G&A estimate for the rest of the year.","During the second quarter, we reported a slight gain on the disposal of assets due to $3 million related to proceeds on the disposal of a ShopHouse, along with a reversal of ShopHouse straight-line rents. For the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 38.1%, and for the full-year, our effective tax rate is expected to be about 38.4%. The Q2 tax rate was impacted by non-recurring adjustments related to state income taxes \u2013 tax deduction for stock compensation. This new effective tax rate is lower than the prior year of 40.8%, as our pre-tax income has improved.","During the second quarter and through yesterday, we repurchased $77 million worth of our shares at an average share price of $423. We have $167 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization as of yesterday. We generated cash from operations of $93 million during the quarter and finished the quarter with cash and investment of $569 million.","Our entire organization is aligned behind supporting an elevated guest experience. We're committed to creating a strong culture of training, simplifying our operations, pursuing innovation that will lead to a better guest experience. Creating and sustaining sales momentum is the most important lever for restoring our economic model, and that begins with great execution and delivering an excellent guest experience in each and every restaurant. We're grateful to all of our team members for their hard work and commitment and we're confident that strong execution of our strategies will result in long-term profitable growth, all while fulfilling our mission of preparing better tasting food made from real ingredients for our guests.","Thank you for your time today and we'll be happy to open the lines for questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, thanks. I guess, Jack, just starting off, I just want to clarify some of the comments you made about recent trend, just so we're all on the same page. So, when you said the first two weeks of July had a similar two-year to 2Q, can you just clarify what that implies on a one-year? Just I'm not sure which two-year stack you're using there.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, well, the two-year stack, I think it would be better to clarify what the two-year stack is. If you do the geometric two-year, in the second quarter our comps were in the down 17.4%, 17.5%. To maintain, looking at the first couple weeks of July, we were at that same kind of two-year rate. The one-year is going to be lower, Jason, because we're going up against Chiptopia, you've got the holiday. We did pick up a little bit because we opened for part of the day on the July 4th, but I think the way to think about it is on a two-year trend comparing back to 2015, first couple of weeks were right in line with June and right in line with the rest of the second quarter on that two-year, down about 17.4% range.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, so the first two weeks of July last year on a one-year, what would that have been?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, on a one-year, like the second week, for example, it was the best week we had during, I believe the entire quarter, because remember that was the kickoff of Chiptopia. And so, we left the quarter, or the entire quarter, and the second quarter was down 23.6%. We were in for that second full week, not counting July 4, we were like in the down 20% range. And that was, I believe, the best or near the best week of the entire third quarter. So, that's why the one-year is going to be lower, but that's because of comparing against some of the early Chiptopia returns.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then July commentary on the first two weeks does that include the benefit of being open longer on July 4? Or is that...","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, the relatively, Jason, in terms of the week and two weeks, relatively modest impact. And we were only open for part of the day. And I would say even for the hours that we were open, our hourly sales were less than normal. It was the first time we opened on July 4. We're not sure how many people knew we were open and people are not in their normal trading pattern. So, it had an impact, but not a very significant impact on the week or the two-week comp.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And the last thing for me is just the comment that trends have been slow the last few days, down 5.5%, is that \u2013 you mean it slowed by 5.5 points from where you were running? Or are you saying it was down 5.5%?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","No, if you go back and look at like the last few Mondays, look at a normal Monday for the last two weeks, a normal Sunday, normal Friday, we're down from where we were running by 5.5%. So, it does not mean a negative 5.5% comp.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","Thanks, good afternoon. I just wanted to ask about the latest round of TV marketing. It ended with great money, yet you have ongoing BOGO offerings. So, what's the right balance between those messages and why? And I was just specifically wondering basically what's the brand proposition or value messaging at this point? Thanks.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Nicole. So, the campaign that we ran in the spring actually included actually three different waves of television across one flight. So, what happened across those three waves of TV is that we actually changed the creative. So, you may remember actually the campaign started with the comedian spots, and those were typically longer spots of 30 seconds. But, as the campaign went on, we optimized it to ads that included more appetite appeal and it eventually ended up running predominantly something that we called the burrito assembly spots, which is the one you're referring to, the bring money spot.","But all of these ads are part of the real ingredient marketing platform that we have. You know, I think as you're probably aware, this spring we accomplished the ultimate removal of the very, very last preservatives and any other industrial additives in our food, leaving us with 51 real ingredients, all of which you could just go buy at the store and you'd recognize as a real ingredient. So, the campaign across all the different facets of it is built on that platform. You'll see, though, different manifestations of it. On the digital ads and a lot of the online work that we do, we have an opportunity to be a little bit more descriptive and create a more immersive experience. When you're on television, and particularly when you're on television in these 15-second formats, there's room for some appetite appeal and then we get some of the brand voice into it.","What I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that we've continued to refine the creative. I mentioned that that entire flight, although it improved from the beginning to the end because we morphed the creative, still has the opportunity to be way more effective in terms of driving the traffic into the restaurants. So, the creative that we're going to be using for the upcoming flight of TV, which begins in mid-September, has gone even further on the appetite appeal side. And, as I mentioned, if we decide to roll queso nationally, will include queso. It also includes a comedic tone, although it's much more oriented toward the appetite appeal. So again, the brand proposition is that Chipotle serves food that's delicious but made with real ingredients in a way that no other brand does and it manifests itself in different ways, depending on the actual medium that we're using. But hopefully that answers your question.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. Obviously, a significant amount of robust drivers you guys are implementing, but Steve, what gives you the confidence that you guys have done enough here, just damage control, that last week's events just won't set off a similar sales pattern that persisted through 2016?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Well, so, Andrew, we need to ensure that we do a much, much better job after the events of last week, and we take this very, very seriously. We conducted a thorough investigation and it revealed that our leadership there didn't strictly adhere to our company protocols. And we believe someone was working while sick. And we took swift action and made it clear to the entire company that we have a zero policy for \u2013 zero -tolerance policy for not following these protocols. Our protocols are excellent. I mean, these protocols were designed by leading experts on our food safety council and in-house by our food safety expert, Jim Marsden, and \u2013 but you need to ensure that you're following the protocols. They work. When followed, they work perfectly. So, I'm thrilled that we have Scott Boatwright joining us. He's already brought a really high level of discipline and greater focus on the fundamentals of operating great restaurants. Something that we're getting better at, we were in the past, perhaps too focused on softer cultural kinds of things, but he's brought back a real rigor and I'd actually like to invite Scott to share his thoughts on this.","Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Hi, Andrew. Steve's right, we conducted a thorough investigation of what transpired here in Sterling, and we found out it was very clear that procedures were not being followed as prescribed by Chipotle's rigorous standards. I assure you that we've taken swift action on what's transpired there and making it clear to the entire organization that not following our procedures will have severe consequences. Beyond that, we're putting in stronger measures in place to uncover when our procedures break down, and we will \u2013 we have and will continue to reinforce our zero policy \u2013 zero tolerance policy to our standards. I've talked to Steve and the officers here, and what I plan to bring to the organization here at Chipotle is a maniacal focus on the fundamentals of our business, more specifically, ensuring the integrity of our training programs to lay a strong foundation for the organization's success. This type of rigor and discipline has been absent from the brand for some time and we will re-instill, again, a maniacal focus on how we operate our business and one best way to run a Chipotle restaurant.","I will say, after spending several weeks in training in our restaurants since joining the brand, I am inspired by the uniqueness of our offerings, the quality and the freshness of our products, and the culinary skills that go into preparing our foods on a consistent daily basis. I'm also inspired by the wonderful people throughout the Chipotle family, specifically in our restaurants that work tirelessly every day to not only deliver a great and consistent guest experience, but also ensure the safety of our food really nationwide. It's unfortunate that this incident happened on the heels of again what transpired months prior, but I assure you that we will get back to the discipline and the rigor necessary to ensure that we protect our employees and our guests as we move forward.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And just one more for Jack. As we kind of think longer term here, historically, even as kind of the margin sensitivities to different levels of AUV recovery; can you just refresh us on that? Just anything else we should be thinking over those numbers that you presented a few quarters ago, are those still intact?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, they're still intact. We're within striking distance of 20% right now. We're not getting any help from avocados, although avocados has \u2013 the pricing has receded recently. If we can also build some complement, and we do have some exciting new news ahead with technology that Curt talked about with queso. And queso is by far the most requested item we've ever had, and so if we can build some \u2013 complement them, get a break from the cost of avocados, we can push up to that 20% level at this current sales volume. And then as we continue to gain complement them, as we move from just about 2 million to 2.2 million to 2.4 million, we can step-by-step recover our entire economic model. Some of that will require offsetting some inflation. We've eaten inflation now for more than three years, we've absorbed the highest labor inflation that we've ever seen over a three-year period, so that's eaten into the model, but we think that with a little help from avocados, build and complement them, and passing on some of the inflationary costs to our customers we can get our full margin back.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful, thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","The next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good afternoon. Just a question on the sales trends that you were seeing, I guess, before the latest norovirus incident. The two-year comp, or however you want to look at it on a seasonally adjusted basis, looked to be holding very steady, despite a lot of effort to drive improvements in the operations and launch new advertising programs. So, I'm just wondering sort of what your thoughts are on why you haven't seen more improvement to date. Is there anything in your metrics that would suggest you're not making progress in certain areas in the operations? Or if there's something else going on that's preventing that sales recovery?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","David, nothing that stands out. We can definitely get better at operations. You've heard us say that we spent more time than we should have over the last few years with more of the feel and the culture in the restaurant and not enough in the rigor of great training and good, solid culinary skills and running a good operation such that the restaurants get a great experience every single time. And that's something that we're recommitted to.","Scott, as Steve mentioned, as you heard from Scott, is bringing a huge commitment to get those fundamentals back because that's something we're going to continue to work on. But we came to the conclusion recently that our sales did improve. We were down on a two-year basis at about 21% in January and as we closed last year, so we did pick up some momentum to get down to the 17.5%, but we came to the conclusion that we need new news and we think that queso, we think, is going to help us with that new news and we're excited about the tests to come. With that, Mark may have some comments as well about the customer and what it means as well.","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure, David, I can add a little bit to it. I mean, one of the things we've encountered, and this has been true really since throughout all of 2016, and we're actually seeing evidence of this in the middle \u2013 beginning in to the middle of 2015 is that our customers really do want to see something new from Chipotle and there's a lot of pent-up demand for this. And in the type of marketing that we do, it's incredibly effective to have something new and exciting for customers to come in and enjoy.","And so, we've been up against trying to claw back occasions that were lost to other competitors, of which there are very, very many, of course, now in this category. And as we studied our customers, they fall into several different categories, but within the lapsed categories we have people who are called lapsed defectors and then lapsed rejectors. And when you look at these different types of customers, the majority of these fall into lapsed defectors, so these are people who used to be regular Chipotle customers and now are very, very infrequent at the cadence of maybe once a year or they stopped coming altogether, and these customers, when we talk to them in research, have a couple of primary objectives which are interesting.","I mean, one is that we saw boredom as the number one. And second, as no queso. So, we're talking a lot about this one particular menu item, but I shouldn't underestimate how much potential it has, and then when you combine it with some of the other things that we're looking at doing, it really could add a lot of momentum to the marketing programs that we've had. So, I'm very encouraged by all this, so hopefully that gives you a little bit of perspective into why maybe some of our marketing hasn't driven as hard as we would like.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I guess and if I could just follow up on that, if I may. I guess on the whole notion that customers asking for something new, does this mark a change in the philosophy at Chipotle? Because, I guess, the business was built around sort of simple and focused execution, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Steve, and now we're talking about new products and putting advertising behind them, which sounds a lot more like a traditional approach in the restaurants category. So, I just wonder, I guess, if you could comment on whether you think there's a new reality at Chipotle where we're going to need to see new menu items to drive traffic on a longer-term basis.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Sure. Well, so these new menu items come out of a desire to look more strategically at what Chipotle might look like in the future, not only menu item-wise, but how we cook in the kitchen, how our restaurants are set up, how the digital experience might be part of it, all sorts of things. And the Next Kitchen has told us a lot about what the future might look like and it's very, very promising. You know, when I've said over the past many years that we have a desire to keep things simple so that we can execute at a high level and that our menu didn't grow, it was really a desire to make sure that we did execute at a very, very high level.","Let me give you an example of an innovation in the Next Kitchen that actually has created something that's much more appealing and much easier for the crews to execute and much faster, and that is margaritas. For years, we individually mixed margaritas and shook them per order, taking a couple of minutes per customer. We installed a frozen margarita machine where we still use fresh citrus and make the mix ourselves in the restaurant, but then dispense it out of a frozen margarita machine, so it's actually preferred by our customers and operationally it's much easier. And so, we really need to be open to exploring ways where we can do things differently.","You know, queso is an interesting one in that the main reason we rejected queso in the earlier days is because we couldn't come up with a recipe that didn't have a bunch of the kinds of ingredients that we don't want to serve, the kinds of ingredients that are really part of processed food. And so, we came up with a recipe that we like. It's a clean recipe and it's a delicious recipe, and operationally, queso is very, very easy for our teams and for our customers. So, we're going to put it in a couple of markets and test it, and I think we're going to be happy with the results. We're going to test other things, too, David, but we'll test these things in the Next Kitchen with an eye toward operational ease, to make sure that we can offer the very, very highest quality experience.","I will also add that our training in the past was not as perhaps \u2013 it wasn't specifically designed for new menu items, and since we've made advancements in our training technology, I think we're much more prepared to try new stuff. One of the tools that we have now available in our restaurant kitchens for training is a digital system and a tablet where we can play videos to show people new procedures, and that just wasn't available years ago. So, I think we're well-positioned to try new stuff that will be very efficient and delicious, too.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Wonder if you could give us a little more color on the update on where we are from a digital standpoint. You mentioned mobile order and pay and a new app launching soon. Can you talk about the stats around that, the growth that you're seeing there? And then also where we stand with loyalty, if there's any stats you're willing to give around that?","Curtis Evander Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question. Well, I said in the prepared remarks that we have seen the highest increase in our digital properties on our web ordering platform, which is the platform that has seen the most innovation. Earlier in the year, we moved to a responsive online ordering site that gave our customers a fresh, new experience with Chipotle when they ordered digitally. That responsive ordering site automatically optimizes itself based upon the device you're using, so, if you're using a phone, it portrays itself like an app. If you're using a tablet, it portrays itself like a tablet system, and likewise for a laptop or desktop. We're encouraged with that growth because we're now to the point where we're going to make a similar release of innovation in a dedicated ordering app. And as I said, we haven't made a change to that platform for several years and the folks that use that app tend to be our most regular customers because they've taken the step to download it and install it on their device.","Even without making those changes to date, and we expect the new app in the first part of the fourth quarter, we've seen a 38% increase in mobile ordering because of the efficiencies that we've been able to drive with meal customizations and also because of the emphasis that's been put into the restaurants operationally around staffing and running the dedicated second-make line that already exists in the majority of our restaurants. As it relates to our loyalty program, the new app will also offer digital offers for the first time, and we see that as the first step towards what a loyalty program would look like for Chipotle.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Got you. And if I could just do a quick follow-up on a comment you made earlier. Jack, you mentioned the core to-date comp, and I apologize for going back to this, so I wanted to make sure I was clear. So, you mentioned if you held the two-year through the quarter you'd be at, I think you said a 5.6%. Was that the trend the first couple of weeks on a one-year basis of 5.5%-ish or so? Or was it a little below that, depending on your comps?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","No, no, no. What I was trying to say is that the trend in the first two weeks was still at that two-year trend of like down 17.5%. If we were to hold a 17.5% two-year trend throughout the whole quarter, our comp for Q3 this year would be 5.6%.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Got you. So, we're somewhat below that the first couple of weeks.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, the comparison, like I said, especially in that second week were tougher, but we've seen consistently throughout the last two, three months that we've held that kind of two-year trend, and so when we've gone against tougher comparisons, easier comparisons, you'll see the current year comp bounce up and down, but the two-year has been pretty darn consistent throughout.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Got you. Thank you.","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, Will.","Operator","The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Just revisiting the two major drivers that I thought about from last quarter, which were the marketing and digital, and Mark, you were talking about the marketing and perhaps adjusting the creative. How much do you think is the creative versus not really having the news yet? Menu news or value news is traditionally what we see in restaurants. You're talking about queso, do you think the advertising and queso kind of need each other? And is that \u2013 how much of that do you think is the issue?","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, I mean I've said consistently for years that one of the reasons we haven't done television in the past was, well, one, early days we didn't have really enough restaurants to make it as efficient as it needed to be, but we passed that several years ago. More of the reasons I said we didn't do television was because we don't have the types of offerings that really lend themselves to these formats, and particularly now, the most pervasive TV format is a 15-second spot. So, the way you said it I think is exactly right. I mean, I think the advertising kind of needs queso. I mean we're in a really unique position right now in that we're restoring a brand that's lost a bunch of customers, and at the same time, trying to bring in new customers, and so, when you look at something like queso, it's a really interesting product because let's just compare it to, say, a dessert, for example.","Queso is something that could attract new customers, could attract lapsed customers, could increase frequency of existing customers, and then also have the ability to increase check average. It hits on all four, whereas, if you look at a dessert, it's unlikely that you're going to get somebody who's a competitor's customer to come to Chipotle because of that, whereas we know that it's one of the main reasons why people reject Chipotle that we don't have queso. So, that \u2013 it's one of the reasons why I'm excited about the potential to actually add it into the television campaign this fall.","So, I do think that the entry into television accomplished what I predicted it would when we did it last year and then in the spring, which was it delivered outsized reach that's very efficient, so it's a great way to reach a lot of people. But absent a compelling reason why people should get up and come in, it's going to be reduced in terms of its potential, and so we have that now. So, yeah, I mean, I do expect that given it's in television that this sort of thing is going to be pretty effective.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just one other follow-up, the digital front, it seems like similarly digital seems to need delivery to really be leveraged. You get an incremental user from remote order, if it's a high-volume store and they're trying to really avoid all that negative time of waiting in the line, but do you feel like delivery is the big unlock on that? And where are you on that?","Curtis Evander Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thank you, David. I agree that delivery is important and we integrated delivery into our second make line earlier in the year and have seen a substantial increase in the number of guests that are taking advantage of that functionality, talking specifically around web and app ordering. Our vision for the future is to integrate that experience more directly into the online and mobile sites, because now customers that are taking advantage of that service tend to go to the service provider site first and order from there, and we'd like to give them the option as they're checking out through Chipotle. So, that is certainly one of the areas that we're investigating and investing in as part of our digital roadmap.","We've also launched delivery for catering in about 1,000 restaurants in the quarter. But we've not advertised that yet, as we're getting our teams spooled up for what that order volume looks like, but have a plan to make that part of our digital advertising campaign in the fall as we get back to what is typically a heavy season for us in terms of catering.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The last question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. First, just on the food incident that happened a couple \u2013 a week ago, I guess. How \u2013 were comps declining or were they softening across the country? Was it just a geographic concentration and by the time you got to California consumers didn't really notice? How widespread or concentrated was the decline in comps relative to prior trend?","John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, John, as you can imagine, it's much more intense in that area. If you take the entire market, the dozens or the \u2013 30, 40, 50 stores around there, they were hit the most, but this did receive national news. And so, if you look at every single market, every market was impacted, but it was obviously much heavier in the mid-Atlantic region and the rest of the country, so pretty much every market did see some impact.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on store openings, how do you think about \u2013 what changes you view on how fast you want to grow in this environment given the competitive environment, still some operational challenges you need to overcome, some customer reacquisition? Is it \u2013 what metrics are you looking at to say, listen, maybe growing slow and focusing on the base is a better idea? And maybe, Jack, can you just talk about how the class of 2016 has performed a year out from when they initially opened to maybe how your class of 2017 is performing year-to-date?","Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","John, I'll go ahead and answer that. In early 2016, we reevaluated our approach to the restaurant portfolio. We focused, at that time, on proven markets, we reduced our development costs, they're now down at $760,000, and we began to support all openings with marketing. As a result, the new restaurant sales are actually improving at a faster rate than the rest of our restaurants. So, right now we recovered about a third of our sales volume from the pre-2015 incidents, whereas, for the restaurants in the company as a whole, we've recovered a little more than a sixth. So, right now when you look at these group of rookie restaurants, they are delivering us an ROI of 31%, which continues to be compelling to us, and that is up from 15% in 2016.","Of course, it's off of the 55% ROI we saw prior to the incident in 2015, but it's still very compelling. So, the triggers that would cause us to change our approach to development are essentially our ability to operate the restaurants at the level that we want to, and so we're constantly talking to our operations team and we've made some adjustments to the way we're opening the restaurants. We've pulled back in some markets, in the Northeast we've slowed, we've pushed openings. We've reduced the number of openings in new markets and in remote markets, which are particularly challenging for the ops team to support. But we're constantly having a dialogue, and we just had one again yesterday with Scott about his feeling about our ability to continue to support these openings, and at the moment, Scott asks us to pull back on these things for those reasons, we'll do it.","Having said that, you can appreciate that this portfolio or this pipeline is two years in the making, and so, changes to it takes some time. But that's the reason why we would pull back on these things, and yet we \u2013 and we'll be constantly re-evaluating that. Of course, the events of late could have some impact. It's way too early right now to tell what the ongoing impact of this is going to be. Yes, Steve, do you want to add?","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Yeah, John, the only thing I'd add is similar to prior years, the newest stores, so those opened in the last 12 months to 18 months, are the highest comping stores. So, they opened up at a respectable volume, they opened up at a respectful return, even at these lower volumes, and then they're the fastest growing. The only thing I would add is, while we're focusing on training, our most structured training right now happens in new stores. It's a new-store, dedicated team. It's not fragmented as you go from region to region to region, and so the training is more thorough than hiring new people in an existing store, new crew in an existing store. And it's more consistent. And so, we have some of our best welcoming of new people into our new restaurants just because we have this better training approach. Frankly, what we'd like to do is, Scott is looking into this, is take that same regimented, very thorough approach and make sure that we have a more thorough approach across the entire company. So, from a people standpoint and from an opening standpoint and then from a comp growth standpoint, it all suggests to us that we should keep going at this measured pace. It's lower than we were a few years ago, but we think we should be thoughtful about going at a measured pace.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Mark Alexee for closing remarks.","Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Great. Thanks, everyone for your time today. We really appreciate it. We look forward to sharing our third quarter results with you, which is planned again for October 24. Great, and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes tonight's conference call.
