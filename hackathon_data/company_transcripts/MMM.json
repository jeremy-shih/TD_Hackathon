As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 29, 2014.","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you and good morning everyone. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2013 performance along with the 2014 outlook. Inge and David will make some opening comments and we will leave plenty of time for your questions.","Let me mention a few upcoming dates and events. First, our 2014 earnings conference calls are set for April 24th, July 14th and October 23rd. Also, we\u2019ll host an investor meeting on the morning of Tuesday, December 16. I know that calendar is filled quickly, please hold these dates. More details will be available later this year.","Note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying the call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. ","Please turn to Slide 3 and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Matt and good morning everyone. I appreciate you joining us for the call today. For 3M, 2013 was a very successful year. Our team did an excellent job of bringing our vision and strategy to life and increasing 3M\u2019s relevance to customers around the world. ","We delivered a strong performance and importantly, we advanced the company through the three key strategic levels, portfolio management, investment in research and development and business transformation. Let me give you a bit more on each of these key levels. ","In 2013, portfolio management remained at the front of how we managed 3M. For example, we combined and scaled businesses in electronics and energy to better serve our customers, gain rapid cost synergies and address underperforming businesses. We took similar actions in Safety and Graphics to enhance our product offerings and improved our relevance to customers. And when it made sense, we exited as we did with the fly-fishing business within the consumer business group. ","We continued to build strength on strengths by investing in research and development, which is the heartbeat of our plan. Our increased investment is focused on long term disruptive technologies aimed at opportunities with significant growth potential. We made good progress with business transformation enabled by our global ERP implementation. We rolled out in several countries in 2013 as we moved forward into the deployment phase. This effort will help us to create a more efficient and productive 3M.","Our teams are building on the experiences from the initial rollouts in order to improve our capabilities to deploy going forward. Overall very good execution by our team in these strategic levels.","At our investor meeting in December, we announced plans to better optimize our capital structure. These plans will reduce our total cost of capital, allow us to further expand the company and enable even higher returns to our shareholders. Organic growth remains key to our plans, so we will continue to invest in CapEx and research development. And we are planning to invest $5 billion to $10 billion in acquisitions through 2017 with more possible given the right strategic opportunity. We also announced in December a 35% increase of our first quarter 2014 dividend along with a stronger commitment to share repurchases.","Over the 2013 to 2017 planning period, we expect per share repurchases of $17 billion to $22 billion this is a prior expected range of $7.5 billion to $15 billion. This more aggressive deployment of capital reflects the strength of our business model and our confidence in 3M\u2019s future.","Now I will review financial highlights from 2013. Please turn to slide four. For the year sales were nearly $31 billion, up 3.2% in dollar terms. Organic local currency growth was 3.4% led by Health Care and Industrial at 5% and Safety and Graphics at 4%.","Geographically, we posted positive organic growth in all regions. Latin America\/Canada led away with organic growth of 7%, Asia-Pacific growth 4%, United States was up 3% and Europe\/Middle East\/Africa was up 2%.","Currency impacts reduced worldwide sales by 1.6% and acquisitions added 1.4% to sales growth for the year. Operating margins remained strong at 21.6% or 21.9%, excluding acquisitions.","Four of our five business groups delivered margins above 21%, evidence of continued broad based effectiveness and efficiency. Earnings were $6.72 per share, up 6.3% year-over-year. We returned a record $6.9 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Finally, free cash flow conversion was 89% with return on invested capital at 20%. Overall, I'm very pleased with our 2013 results. We delivered good broad based performance while investing and building for long-term success.","Let me now review the outlook, please turn to slide five. We described our 2014 planning estimates in detail at our December Investor Meeting and we are maintaining those estimates today.","We expect 2014 earnings per share in the range of $7.30 to $7.55 and organic local currency growth of plus 3% to plus 6%. Foreign currency translation is expected to be neutral to minus 1% and we anticipate the tax rate of 28% to 29% with free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%.","I will now turn the call over to David Meline for the detail on the fourth quarter results. David?","David Meline","Thank you, Inge. I will begin by reviewing the fourth quarter sales growth. Please turn to slide #6. Organic local currency growth was 3.4% in the fourth quarter, including organic volume growth of 2% and selling price increases of 1.4%.","Price increases have been positive in 2013 for a couple of reasons. First, investment in research and development continues to support a strong price value equation in many of the markets that we serve. And second, we adjust selling prices to offset currency devaluations in certain developing countries, which has been the case in 2013.","Acquisitions added 0.7 points to sales growth in the quarter, all due to Ceradyne in our Industrial Business group. We acquired Ceradyne in late November of 2012, so we are now passed the one-year mark and beginning with December reporting, we no longer report Ceradyne sales as acquisitions.","Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.7 percentage points in the fourth quarter. Currency impacts were negative 6% in Latin America\/Canada and negative 5% in Asia-Pacific, while EMEA had a positive 3% currency impact year-on-year. On the total U.S. dollar basis, sales rose 2.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2012.","Looking geographically, local currency sales growth was 4.5% in the United States, the highest of any region during the quarter. All business groups grew organically in the U.S., with particular strength in Industrial and in Safety and Graphics.","Organic sales growth in EMEA was 3.4% in the fourth quarter, West Europe in particular grew by 3%, continuing the positive trends we have seen in recent quarters. In Germany the largest of our West Europe subsidiaries grew a solid 8% per organically. All businesses posted positive organic growth in the EMEA lead by Industrial. Asia Pacific grew 3.3% organically in the fourth quarter with consumer, Health Care and Safety and Graphics leading the way.","Industrial also posted positive organic growth in the fourth quarter within APAC and Electronics and Energy grew just slightly. Japan continued to grow nicely with 4% organic growth year on year. China, Hong Kong grew 1% organically versus a tough prior year comp off 16% plus in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Excluding electronics China, Hong Kong grew more than 6% organically in Q4. Organic local currency sales growth was 2.2% in Latin America, Canada during the fourth quarter which was below recent trend levels for a few reasons.","One, we saw some slowing in government tenders for infrastructure projects in certain countries which impacted sales in our Electronics and Energy business. Consumer was also soft in Q4 due to weak retail demand and challenging year-on-year accounts and lastly sales in Venezuela declined year-on-year due to economic and the political situation there.","Venezuela diluted fourth quarter organic growth in Latin America, Canada by 1.5 percentage points and we continue to work towards minimizing our (inaudible) exposure in any associated cost. Organic local currency growth was 4% across all developing markets and 3% in developed markets.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide number 7 for a discussion of the fourth quarter income statement. Sales for the fourth quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 2.4% in dollar terms. Gross profit rose 5.8% to $3.6 billion and gross margins rose by a solid 1.5 percentage point to 47.5%.","SG&A spending increased in line with sales growth and R&D as a percent of sales rose by 10 basis points to 5.8%.","Operating income increased nearly 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2012. GAAP operating margins were 20.9%, up 140 basis points year-on-year. Organic volume growth at 20 basis points margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contribute a positive 160 basis points year-on-year.","Fourth quarter margins improved year-on-year in a recently acquired Ceradyne business which added 30 basis points to total company operating margins in Q4. We expect further margin improvement in 2014 for this business. Strategic investments, reduced margins by 70 basis points year on year, this represents incremental investments in disruption R&D, ERP and various restructuring actions. Lower year-on-year pension and OPEB expenses boosted fourth quarter margins by 30 basis points while foreign exchange impacts reduced margins by 40 basis points.","Fourth quarter earnings increased 15% to $1.62 per share. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 3% year-on-year which added $0.05 to EPS and currency impacts hurt fourth quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.04. The fourth quarter concluded a good year for the company and the 3M team is energized and confident as we begin 2014. Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow.","Please turn to Slide number 8. We generated $2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, up $255 million versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Higher net income and lower pension contributions were the primary drivers of this improvement.","Capital expenditures were $543 million, an increase of $36 million. Looking ahead to 2014, we continue to expect full year CapEx will be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up $219 million year-on-year and we converted 131% of net income to cash versus 124% in last year's comparable quarter.","For the full year 2013, free cash flow was $4.2 billion and conversion was 89%. We paid $423 million in cash dividends during the quarter or $1.7 billion year-to-date. And as Inge mentioned, in December we announced a 35% increase in the first quarter 2014 dividend.","Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.2 billion for the full year. For 2014, we expect full year gross share repurchases will be in the range of $3 billion to $5 billion. In total, we returned $2.1 billion in cash to shareholders in the fourth quarter or $6.9 billion for the full year, both at all-time record levels for 3M.","Net debt at year end 2013 increased $900 million year-on-year and $300 million sequentially. As I mentioned at our December investor meeting, we expect to add leverage of $2 billion to $4 billion in 2014, as we continue to improve the efficiency of our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, 3M issued an 8th-year Eurobond yielding less than 2%. The face amount was \u20ac600 million or $815 million.","Let's now review our fourth quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide #9. Our Industrial business have another strong quarter with sales of $2.6 billion and 6% organic local currency growth.","Our advanced materials and automotive OEM businesses generated double-digit organic growth and we also posted good growth in 3M Purification, aerospace and automotive aftermarket. Organic local currency sales increased in all geographic regions led by the U.S. at 8%, EMEA grew 6% in Q4, including more than 10% in Germany. Organic growth was 3% in both Asia Pacific and in Latin American\/Canada.","The Ceradyne acquisition added 2% to Industrial growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter operating income was $553 million, up 14% year-on-year and operating margins increased 150 basis points to 21.5%. Volume leverage, positive selling prices and good productivity contributed to the improvement.","Our Industrial business had an outstanding year in 2013. Organic sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year versus the first and sales exceeded $10 billion for the first time ever. Nice performance by the Industrial team.","Please turn to Slide #10. Our Health Care business generated sales of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Sales rose 4% in organic local currency terms with the strongest growth in health information systems, food safety and critical and chronic care. Drug delivery systems declined in the quarter.","All geographic regions generated positive organic local currency sales growth with Asia Pacific up 6%, Latin America\/Canada up 5% and EMEA and the U.S. each up 3% in the quarter. In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically in the fourth quarter.","This has been an area of strategic investment priority for some time and we are encouraged to see consistently strong organic growth as a result. Fourth quarter operating income in Health Care was $425 million. Operating margins were 31.2%, which was very much in line with full year. Fourth quarter margins were down a point year-on-year against a strong comp in Q4 2012. The recently enacted U.S. medical device tax was a contributing factor.","Please go to Slide #11, Safety and Graphics had a solid fourth quarter with 5% organic local currency sales growth and 16% growth in operating income. Organic growth was broad based with nearly all businesses posting positive growth.","Personal safety by far, our largest business within Safety and Graphics generated high single-digit organic growth in Q4. We also posted good growth in roofing granules, commercial graphics and architectural markets. Sales in Safety and Graphics grew organically in all major geographic regions with Latin America\/Canada up 8%, Asia Pacific and the US up 6% and EMEA up 1%. Operating income increased 16% to $256 million and margins rose 2.2 percentage points to 19.1%. Profits benefited from volume leverage, price performance and solid productivity. ","Now let's look at Electronics and Energy found on Slide 12. Fourth quarter sales in this business were $1.3 billion, up 0.4% in organic local currency terms and operating income rose 1% to $221 million. Margins were 16.7% up 40 basis points versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter. I mentioned in our October earnings call that we expected sales and earnings for electronics and energy to be very close to last year\u2019s levels and in fact that is what happened. Electronics related sales declined 2% on an organic local currency basis with positive growth in optical films offset by declines in other businesses. In our energy related businesses, sales increased 2% organically, led by our electrical markets and renewable energy businesses. ","On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased 2% in EMEA and United States, Asia Pacific grew slightly and Latin America\/Canada was down year-on-year. Despite challenging end market conditions, the electronic and energy team executed very well in 2013. Second half organic growth rates were stronger than the first as were operating margins. It was a good result in the tough market. ","Finally, let's review the Consumer business found on Slide number 13. Sales on the consumer business group were $1.1 billion with organic local currency growth of 1.3%. Recall that in the fourth quarter of 2012 consumer generated 9% organic local currency growth, so the comp here was quite challenging. Organic sales growth was strongest in our consumer Health Care and home care businesses and we also had a positive organic growth in DIY. Sales declined slightly in stationary and office supplies impacted by continued consolidation trends in the office retail and also market. ","On the positive side, we recently launched a new line of command and ease of products for outdoor use which contributed nicely to fourth quarter growth. The US retail shopping season is an important factor for the consumer business and we would characterize this year\u2019s season is okay but not strong. Fewer shopping days due to the late Thanksgiving holiday were a factor for most major US retailers and for their suppliers. On a geographic basis, sales in organic local currencies increased 9% in Asia Pacific and rose slightly in both the US and EMEA, Latin America\/Canada declined 6% year-on-year. Operating income was $226 million with operating margins of 20.4%. ","That concludes my comments regarding 3M\u2019s fourth quarter business results. I\u2019ll turn now the call back to Inge.","Inge Thulin","","Thank you, David. To summarize, Q4 was a strong finish to a very successful year for 3M. In 2013 we received good growth and solid profitability while advancing our strategic initiatives in investments. Perhaps most importantly, we came out of 2013 stronger than we ever at with both sales and earnings growth accelerating in the second half of the year, this was the first. 2013 results provided further proof that our strategies are gaining traction and driving our performance to higher levels. I can think of numerous example that illustrate is but I will highlight just a couple. ","Let's start with our $1.4 billion automotive OEM business which in 2013 grew over 7% organically more than twice the rate of global auto production. We see this result through improved customer relevance, leveraging 3M\u2019s vast technology capability to solve problems for this important group of OEM customers. This business grew significantly in Q4 in developing markets like China, Mexico and Indonesia by offering relevant solutions to these rapidly growing markets.","Another example is our safety and graphic business group. We saw margins expand by more than two points in the fourth quarter. This improvement is due to cost through several recent portfolio actions, which have resulted in improved customer relevance, greater scale and reduce costs. We also saw improved profitability on recent acquisitions in this business. These are two powerful examples of many that illustrate how the strategies are pushing 3M\u2019s performance through new level.","In closing, I want to recognize the people of 3M for their many contributions that continued our success as a company. We have great confidence and good momentum as we enter 2014. Our teams are focused on executing our plan and creating even greater value for customers and our shareholders. Thank you for your attention this morning and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Thank you and good morning, everyone.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","So my first question is really on the organic growth trajectory. It seems like you are exiting the year pretty strongly in Industrial and in Safety and Graphics, but still some weakness there in electronics and energy. And so I was wondering if you could just provide some context and color, as it relates to the guidance that you have for 2014 because the ranges across your segments tend to be pretty consistent. And so whether you have more or less confidence in any of the segments as you're building into 2014?","Inge Thulin","Well, first of all, we hold our guidance of 3 to 6 for the year and you are right. We are coming out strong of the year, right. So if we look upon our performance in between Q3 and Q4 and add that together for the second part of the year, we had a very good second part of the year. So we feel good about that.","In terms of the businesses, you can see that we have had very good tick up in Industrial as of lately and we feel very confident of that business and that range, which is 3 to 6. The same for Health Care, Health Care is continuing to grow well for us and specifically as you\u2019ve have seen in developing economies. And again, we had in this quarter a 10% growth in that part of the world. And we have a very strong platform in the developed world, right.","So we feel confident around that. I will say the auto businesses are right in the middle of the range. We don\u2019t see any indication at this point in time of going outside the range. Again, as we know electronics and energy is very much based in the electronic space based on the market, right. And as you know that is what we are following. And if there is a little bit slower that will impact us, of course but it can turnaround relatively fast. So from that perspective, the 2 to 6 guidance we have, we feel confident with that, so no change at this point in time.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful color. And I guess my follow-up question is really -- ","Inge Thulin","The 2 to 6 range is for electronics and energy, it is 3 to 6.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s all right. That\u2019s right. I guess my follow-up question is really for David. I know that you haven\u2019t made any changes to guidance. Over at the Outlook Meeting, you provided us with a 2014 earnings bridge. I was wondering if there were any changes to any of the sub buckets and specifically perhaps you can provide some color on the pension number, which is a pretty wide range at $0.10 to $0.20?","David Meline","Sure. So if you look at our earnings bridge, the answer would be right now, we don\u2019t see any changes to the bridge of the elements. If you were to think about where we are monitoring at the top or the bottom in those ranges, first, on pension, we come in now with a confirmed year-over-year decrease in expense of $150 million for $0.15 a share. So right in the middle of that range we've provided. And what I would say right now is the other area that we\u2019re monitoring, we said zero to five on foreign exchange. And if there is anything that if I marked that market today, it would be certainly towards the lower end of that price and headwind versus the range right now versus as we saw a couple of months ago. So otherwise we think we\u2019re looking fine in terms of the other elements.","Inge Thulin","And just to clarify that the lower-end of the range do you think the FX headwind is going be close to zero?","David Meline","Closer to $0.05.","Inge Thulin","Closer to five, okay great I'll get back to you thanks guys.","David Meline","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Hi good morning guys.","David Meline","Good morning, Davis.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Congrats on a good 2013. Inge, you mentioned M&A in your prepared remarks and if you talk through, you put out a pretty big prefix number as a target of potential deals. I mean can you talk through your confidence and also maybe the timing, the types of things you're looking at, obviously you can\u2019t name names. But I think if I look back the years of 3M it's been hard there, really there hasn't been a lot of consistency to the three -- to the R&D effort. I\u2019m sorry to the M&A effort so it just gives a little sense of what's what you're looking out there.","Inge Thulin","First of all, as you know, we have been working for the last 18 months to clarify the position of our business relative to our portfolio. And I think that\u2019s an important starting point relative to understanding of where we try to go. So the thing about Heartland and push forward of course, places for us that are interesting in order to build up, not only in terms of research and development, but potential acquisitions. So I think if you think about it from that perceptive, we would like to look upon businesses that will either strengthen a very strong position for the Heartland divisions and\/or accelerate growth and push forward. So by definition, we\u2019re looking for many elements as you know relative to acquisition candidates but think about it in those categories.","Now that can always be an exception to the rule and if you have businesses where we really need to boost up our performance or build out and be more relevance we will do that as well. And I think if you go back and think about the efforts take that we did, we're seeing through the traffic safety system, but by definition not these either Heartland will push forward, but what's important for us to make that acquisition in order to build out a relevance in that market. ","And so that\u2019s the way you think about it in that way versus think about this business group right. We are -- we are interested everywhere, but I think it's from the market perspective in order to move the company forward. Now the pipeline is good for us, we have, as I said, we have laid on a little bit of, we\u2019ve always had a process of bottom-up. ","We have type of laid on a top down approach as well in order to make sure that we do not miss out on potentials that go across business groups in terms of potential. And where we talked about size of the potential acquisitions, I think there is a couple of things, we had build up now a very competent group relative to integration because one of the thing that is important for us is to integrate acquisitions as fast as possible and get the benefit for you and for us in terms of return of the investment.","And now we will not go crazy if it doesn\u2019t -- we have done acquisitions in the past has that been on very small or to mid-size and we will really evaluate huge, huge acquisitions in terms of strategic importance. So I think you will see acquisitions in mid-range as well as we go ahead here. In terms of timing as you know it's very difficult to comment on timing this is really in some cases will take some time and we are very careful as we do this as you know.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow up, obviously 3M is focused on R&D has been important and goes back a long ways, but something seems to have changed since you\u2019ve taken over Inge. It seems like the R&D focus may have made the yielding more results if you just look across where the growth rates have been higher, it's been generally the more, I would say R&D intensive businesses has been outgrowing in market the most? I mean, what have you specifically changed that yielded that acceleration in new products?","Inge Thulin","Well, first of all, this is not about me. This is about a very dedicated 3M team. So, its not about me, it\u2019s a credit should go to the business groups and the divisions and the subsidiaries. But I think that, what I am doing, I've encouraged them really to make sure that they understand the business model in terms of us be able to create more value for our customers, because that is to help it for us in terms of making sure that we maintain an eventually improved margins and the return on the business.","So, I think it\u2019s, that reduce up with, the whole way up to me relative to how we are doing and also try to encourage to help them if there is some project that is may be more difficult for them to pull off based on the current situation. So there is a little bit piece of running a business with glasses on with one microscope on one side and a telescope on the other side of the glasses, right, and I think that\u2019s important for us to do.","So, we feel good about it, we are very committed to research and development. It is by definition revalue create to 3M and if you think about it, we are in terms of the technologies, we are a creator and builder of technologies and we also user.","But in addition to that, other company can use the technologies. So that\u2019s the difference for us. We create and we develop the technologies and in many cases we are using it. But other companies, we can help them a lot for them to be more competitive by using our technologies and that is the strength of 3M.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. I did a lot of job asking the question. I think what I was meaning to say is, have you made any change it all from focusing the efforts on undisrupted technologies versus extensions?","Inge Thulin","Yes. We have and that additional, when we tried to go from historically 5.5 closer to 6 and you saw we made a small improvement on that, specifically this quarter we moved again, that additional investment is all into disrupted technologies for the future. So that\u2019s an important. Thank you for that question. It\u2019s a very important piece.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. Thank you, guys.","David Meline","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Good morning, guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning Andrew.","David Meline","Good morning.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Just to dig in a little bit into what's happening in the emerging markets that I guess specifically in South America, it would be -- went from being the fastest growth market to the lowest growth market? How much of a surprise was it what happened in that quarter and how are you sort of monitoring the developments there to make sure that its stays under control?","Inge Thulin","Let me start on the front end of the business. First of all, there was a slight slowdown in the economies down there and we saw that, as David said, in his speech here earlier was specifically around consumer confidence that impacted our consumer business. And that was very much on, I would say, government related businesses, specifically into utility businesses, where we have the strong precision.","So I think that and that was broad base for us, so the economy slowed and as you know there is big business around mining in that part of the world. So that impacted us and I would say, I don\u2019t know, you would be always be a little bit surprised when you are not growing as fast as in the past because you will do that. But, generally speaking, we had a good feeling of what is happening in that part of world. In terms of risk as we talked about in Venezuela, it\u2019s -- David will make some comments here relative how we are all manage and monitoring that.","David Meline","Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. So, I think, picking up on Inge\u2019s comment, if you think about the guidance we provided in December. We indicated we think that this year we will grow 8% to 11% in the region. So little bit off of where we have been in the last of couple of years but still elevated and I would say today as we look at that, probably we are thinking about it more along the lines of the low end of that range of 8% to 11%.","And specifically it relates to what Inge has said, we got some sectors which we saw some slowing, we don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s going to remain slow all through \u201914, but we have to take that into account. And then, I think, in particular, we saw what's going on now, a very fluid situation is developing, in particular in Venezuela, and at some level in Argentina as well. And so if you look at our business, we\u2019ve got about -- each of those countries, our business is a little less than $200 million of revenue in each of the two countries. We\u2019ve been in them for many decades so we have a very capable local management and we have a good position in those markets. But inevitably, it does create both some risks in terms of our revenue growth in \u201914 as well as financial risk. And that\u2019s something that we monitor very carefully and we manage carefully given the volatility that we have in those markets and in others.","So if you look for example, today in Venezuela which is what we\u2019ve called out as the most significant of the risks, we run the business on a local basis, the net monetary asset position of the balance sheet is basically flat. So that gives us a very good position in terms of addressing any risks that might occur. But we also have a $40 million receivable in sitting apparent from the subsidiary on imported goods and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re watching and managing quite carefully because we do recognize that there\u2019s risk there that we\u2019re going to have to manage through. So I would say nothing that\u2019s material for the corporation, but certainly something that we\u2019re very carefully monitoring and reacting to so that we can manage that risk. It\u2019s just really a conversion risk. And of course, you see in our results overall very strong pricing in the emerging markets which is the other component of how we manage the risk of these countries.","So we feel good about our ability to manage risk. But as I say, we\u2019re also very cognizant of the fact that we need to be proactive as well.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And the other side of the coin, the Health Care you get a high margin, high growth business in emerging markets part of the strategy. If wear well in terms of top line growth. Could you give us a sense of how connected is this business to effect fluctuations or is it fairly shielded just in terms of how the business works in emerging markets? How should we think about it?","Inge Thulin","Yeah, I know it\u2019s a good question. So I would say that you start in terms of FX risk, you have to think first about the overall risk profile that we have as a company and Health Care as part of that. So we hedge on a rolling basis 50% of our exposures which covers all of our business flows and our intercompany exchange fluctuations. So that applies to Health Care as with the other company, other sectors of the business. So that\u2019s an important element that enables us to manage the risk. And then the second piece is obviously through time, the best way to manage foreign exchange risk is to have a balanced footprint of exposure structurally, so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we continue to localize the production of our products into the countries where we sell which gives us a balanced foreign exchange risk profile and I think as you know, we\u2019ve been working hard to both grow Health Care and as part of that strategy to localize production which helps us to have a good profile to have local production, local R&D which is closer to customers, but it also gives us a better risk profile from a foreign exchange perspective. So I would say Health Care, I don\u2019t view as something with, if you will outside risk compared to the other sectors in our business.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess what I was trying to say, just like me -- just saying, is Health Care spending in emerging markets? Do you feel it\u2019s the care versus consumer spending? It was sort of simple question I think.","Inge Thulin","Okay. While, I think it\u2019s -- as I\u2019ve said early in order for you to build out your business in a way, you will be able to move Health Care products going their way than their consumer. And you\u2019re talking about developing economies due to the fact that these many drivers, in terms of key opinion leaders that try to get to a service level and outcome around health, that is very strong. This is, you think about consumer which is very much retail brand equity driven which take you a longer time in a way to change the mindset of people to go from one brand to the other. So again speaking, we say that in the model that I\u2019ve showed you multiple times now in terms of how developing economies are evolving from manufacturing to infrastructure to safety to retail consumer and Health Care. Often Health Care can come earlier due to that element and in Health Care, generally speaking in fact, dental and orthodontist is coming faster than the big Health Care business.","So for us it\u2019s a good model. We have still huge opportunities there. We\u2019re very pleased of the growth we see that this outcome is based on some strategic investment which they started a couple of years ago, actually in order to build up that business.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning David.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Inge, very good margin performance in Safety and Graphics, is this -- what type of operating leverage would you look for in safety in 2014 over course of the year?","Inge Thulin","Well, I would say first of all, thank you for the compliment relative to the improvements of the margins. And I think one of the reason there is that some consolidated -- consolidation that was done of the businesses. And so as we move ahead into next year, we\u2019re basically looking for the same leverage into 2014 specifically in that business. So I don't see as any new change for us. So I think we\u2019re on the level now that is in the end of it, very competitive for us.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Understood. And just a follow-up on Asia, line growth is low, was it all due to the tough comp (inaudible) was there some slowing in end market activity as well?","Inge Thulin","Generally the Asia performance was in line with where we\u2019ve seen it growing through the year. And as we called out, I\u2019d say couple areas that slowed, one was in China and that was most particularly related to the underlying electronics business. If you look at the base business excluding electronics grew at 6% in China. And then if you look at our performance in Japan which is the other most significant business we have in Asia. We grew quite strongly 4% overall but we were double-digit in the Industrial area. So I would say David, most specifically we see it linked to the electronics performance in Q4.","Inge Thulin","Very -- continue very strong growth in consumer and Health Care business.","David Meline","Yes.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Inge Thulin","Morning, Steve.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Could you just start with inventory impact in terms of distribution obviously important. Were you seeing any kind of stocking increases, decreases, how should we think about that?","Inge Thulin","Generally speaking this quarter, no change, right. We didn\u2019t see anything -- we didn\u2019t see anything of it on Industrial, general Industrial or specifically as we know, we could be more concerned around consumer electronics. We didn\u2019t see any change there and the other thing is around retail. I think retail was very stable as well. And as you know, they manage it very, very carefully. So I will say, we don\u2019t see anything there in terms of change and it\u2019s not a concern for us as we\u2019re sitting here now.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. So all that U.S. growth is sort of core customer growth on the manufacture side -- Industrial -- in Industrial?","Inge Thulin","Yeah, correct. We had very -- in U.S., we had a very strong growth in whole Industrial space right, which then had a very good impact for many of our businesses, generally speaking right in the Industrial space. So you\u2019ll have the whole Industrial business grew but you have also Safety and Graphics with all the personal safety business doing very well in environment like that. So that was good for us.","So Industrial in U.S. in the quarter, Industrial basically would have 8% growth and safety and graphic had 6% growth. And then it was a little bit slower in the consumer and the Health Care in United States at the end of this quarter.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And maybe just one more on pricing, so 1.4% again very strong making up as you mentioned for this combination of currency [devals] elsewhere as well as sort of just core R&D supporting margin. But maybe can you give us an idea again of that 3% to 6% growth in 2014, how much of that are you into, saying this volume versus price? And do you think that your ability to keep up with continued currency moves with price. Any issues on that front as you look forward or we couldn\u2019t just sort of count on those two offsetting each other?","Inge Thulin","","Yeah, no it's a good question. So if you look at the -- as we looked at it in the fourth quarter and set out the guidance our thinking has been that is primarily volume that will look for in 2014 on the top end on the revenue line but obviously so in other words we expect price to be declining through the calendar year as we step through the quarters. Now that would change and it goes back to the view to the extent we see weaker foreign exchange occur in certain of the countries where we operate certainly will have to look at the actions that we need to take to preserve our position in the market and our ability to remain competitive but certainly our experience most recently in 13 but you can look over a longer period of time as long as we continue to develop -- to offer a very strong price value equation to the customers we\u2019re able to address that through price as we need to. So I think we feel comfortable that we can do what's necessary to maintain that relationship.","Matt Ginter ","","Hey Steve, it's Matt, just to clarify one thing. Price issue will be positive in the year but the positive impact should moderate as the quarters go on.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research, please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","","First question for David on corporate expense, you would highlight that that would come in lower and it just come in lower and you said that there would some ERP expense and that would be shifted to the segments but it still came in lower than what we were looking for. So is there anything else going on in corporate and what should be the run rate of that in the course of 2014?","David Meline ","","Right, 14 yes, so the corporate expense line that came in a little bit lower in the fourth quarter and frankly there are ups and downs there based on closing out accruals on a quarterly basis or one off of them, so I would say nothing that I would point to that was of a particularly you know headline an unusual nature in Q4. If I look forward into 2014 we expect that the corporate expense line is going to come in for the year somewhere in the range of 200 to 250 versus I think it was 320 in 2013and the majority of that you can largely attribute that to the declining pension expense, so we\u2019ll pick up about two thirds of the $150 million pension expense decline I mentioned will show up I that corporate line hence a reduction year-over-year of that magnitude and again it bounced around quarter-to-quarter but generally speaking I think it can you know pencil that in throughout 2014.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","","Good, that\u2019s really helpful and then David I know you guys are not in the quarterly guidance business but for the first quarter would you want to call anything out that would be unique seasonally, (inaudible) for seasonal I mean both calendar and as well as whether that might be a factor that we should be considering anyone primers.","David Meline ","","Yeah, so if you look at the business through the year what I would say is that we consider most of the factors whether that be at the topline, whether it\u2019d be expense elements, we think that it\u2019ll be pretty steady through the year and follow more typical seasonal patterns. So I\u2019m obviously first and fourth quarter typically at the lowest revenue but you know that\u2019ll be the case as we see. The couple of exceptions I would offer, one is one we already talked about which is we do except through the year to see some declining contribution of price in raw materials as we move through the years, so positive but declining. Secondly, we had called out in December and that continues to be our intent which is build some of the incremental investment we\u2019re making in our European center of expertize on a year-over-year basis as well as some restructuring actions that we have them looking at primarily in Europe and the US that some of those would be about $20 million to $30 million of additional expenses which are comprehended. There is the strategic investment line, but you can see that it will be some what front-loaded for the year into Q1.","And then the final point I would make on, this is the one I talked about already, which is what\u2019s happening in the markets globally right now. We are monitoring carefully developments in some of the emerging markets with the specific focus on Venezuela because I think there is some discernible risk there, some event risk which looks like may materialize as soon as Q1.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Great. Thank you for the color.","Inge Thulin","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","Two quick ones. On your comment about the slightly weaker trend in infrastructure market, are you seeing any signs of that bottoming out? And secondly with respect to emerging market volatility or credit risk that maybe developing there, is that an opportunity for you to further gain share because of your relatively low cost of borrowing and excess to trade onto finance, or do you think that that will really have a material impact on your relative share position?","Inge Thulin","Let me -- on the first question, I think that in terms of the infrastructure specifically, for us was related specifically to utilities and government businesses in one part of the world and is also related to the mining industry there. We see that easing up as we go into 2014. So it's not overly concerned for us.","In terms of emerging market and so let me give a perspective on developing and emerging market. We have been in the developing world for many years. So the thing about 3M, we started to do business outside of the United States in the 20s and in fact, we have done business in BRIC. In Brazil, we went 1946.","So we've been for longtime in that part of the world. And the strings for 3M based on the history, is that we have learned a lot, so we know how to monitor situation like this. And in developing economies that will always be some type of bump in the road as you go. Now, we have a very good point to say that when that is happening and we have not only seen it, we have lived it many times over the year and not only to organization but me personally and David Meline as well, as we have lived in some of those countries.","So we have seen it and we have worked in those environments. The strings for 3M, when this is happening is we were never going back. We continue to stay but we are adjusting our organization. And we are in all cases I would say from an historical perspective, we are coming out stronger when it's done. And the reason for that is, we right sized the organization. We stay, continue our local connections and we help the customers that are still there because when it turns again because if will turn up, we are there with them.","So in all cases, what have happened for us is that in the case when you come in the turmoil like this, we are coming out stronger due to the fact that we stayed. And I think that's an important element to know. So we are very local in the countries, but we have very strong centralized team with experiences that can help out in terms of making sure that processes is right even on the financial side and David will make comments relative today.","David Meline","","Yeah.","Inge Thulin","But it\u2019s actually -- for us, it's not a good think generally speaking, but we are coming out stronger after a turbulence like that.","David Meline","And you are right, Laurence, we try to maintain a conservative posture from a risk management perspective. And we do enjoy the benefit as do other large well managed multinationals of having good access to credit, having the ability to assess credit risk and so exactly. While it can be bumpy to front end if you basically keep your head down and remain calm and have a playbook as we do, typically we can be advantaged as you see things start to turn around.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Inge Thulin","Good Morning, Ajay.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets","So maybe on Health Care margins you talked about the medical device that impact. Maybe, any comment on what you saw in drug delivery systems and the transfer and the impact on margins from the business and then also I know in the past they really have talked about flexibility in that business in terms of how you manage margins and spending relative to topline. So if you can comment on how we should think about margins in '14 for Health Care?","Inge Thulin","","Well, as you ask specifically about DDSD, that is very much a project base business. Right, so we are selling R&D to other companies and we are selling products. So that's a business that can move a little bit in terms of quarter-by-quarter. So there was nothing happened at these unusual meaning that we lost business or something like that. So it's a strong business for us. In fact we have extended some of the bigger contracts have now been extended. So as we look ahead for that business, it's a very solid, very good business for us and we are very pleased with that.","So looking from that as -- there is all ways to stop in the beginning to a quarter and these quarter based on the contracts and project, we're working with, this is how it came out. So that's, I wouldn't like it to be overly concerned that business. ","In terms of Health Care, (inaudible) speaking in terms of the margin that David will make some comment relative to that.","David Meline ","","Yeah. So if you look, Andre, if we look, I think its how it looks for us in 2014. I'd make a couple of comments and maybe just pick up a little bit of comments here on the overall trends. So Health Care we expect to run in the low 30s through 2014. The Industrial Safety and Graphics and consumer we expect to run around as its been the case around the company average. And if you look at electronics and energy this year, we ran in the high teens last year which is what we expected as started the year. ","This year we see that trending towards the high teens, towards 20%. So that's how we're looking at the overall view for the businesses and I think the final point I'd offer, I talked about the corporate line, there is about a 30 basis points year-over-year increase in the cost that will be seen in the businesses as it relates to our strategic initiatives around business transformation, the restructuring we've talked about and the innovation funding.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets","","Got it. That's very helpful. And then, maybe, some color around stock repurchase and the range you have 3 to 5 billion, maybe just conceptually, what would be the variables that drive that purchase near the high end versus the low end?","David Meline ","Sure. So, yeah, so if you look at that and just kind of frame the commentary. So as we announced in December, we made a decision as a company to adjust our capital structure to one that's more efficient. So by definition that means increasing from a de minimis level, the portion of our funding from borrowing, right, from bond issuances and borrowing. And it means that we also have to, as part of that reduce the portion of the structure that's coming from equity funding. So by definition that means we've reduced the equity funding, we're going to do buyback with set of 17 to 22 billion for the period. ","We then looked at the sources and uses to the best we're able to predict them in the year and we concluded that -- it looked us, starting the year three to five billion at the gross level looks like the right number for the company. And as I said in December the way I think about that is that, it's certainly something that's more discretionary than a number -- frankly many other of our variables we manage from a sources and uses perspective. ","But it's our best views, we start the year and what we'll do then is, we'll have a portion of that repurchase that we do on a steady basis through the year. We also look and pay attention to intrinsic value to the price in the market of all assets including the one we are repurchasing here. And that impacts how we deploy capital into that area.","So we'll adjust our share repurchase through the year based on the overall view of the business and sources and uses, and we'll also adjust the repurchase activity based on thinking about the core component, as well as how the share prices is looking as well.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets","Got it. Thank you very much.","Inge Thulin","Thanks, Ajay.","David Meline","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Good morning, guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Shannon.","David Meline","Good morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Hey. David, just maybe if we could size this Latin America last year you called out with Venezuela and Argentina, so you said they're both less than $200 million in revenue each?","David Meline","Yeah.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","So, I mean, at the corporate average margin, you're talking about sort of less than a dime of EPS. I mean, is that the scope of the risk you're talking about or is there more risk than that, I mean, because there'd be -- could things get worse than that in terms of losses or other impacts?","David Meline","Yeah. It's a good question, Shannon. So I don't see right now from what we can see and obviously it's pretty fluid, if I were to size that risk, I think there's event risk that could put the exposure from an earnings perspective into the $0.03 to $0.04 a share range.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay. Thanks that helps.","David Meline","Yeah.","","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","And then the strength in Europe, right, I mean, you talked about Germany being very strong, broadly I think but also in -- particularly in Industrial? I mean do you have a view in terms of how much of the strength you're seeing in Europe is intrinsic to Europe versus related to export?","Inge Thulin","Well, I think, it's a mix and I also think one other thing we have to think about here is, yes, there are comparisons, right. But, first of all, we see very good acceleration, specific on the Industrial side, I would say both in Germany and also even if the reporting issue nothing, we have talked about West Europe, we also see that in Poland actually.","So I think we see both West Europe been driven by manufacturing uptick, which I would say, it's a balance in between domestic production for Germany, but also export for them, of course, as you know it\u2019s big automotive industry in Germany that we're exporting quite a bit.","But, so I think we have still to be cautious about Europe, but it's a very positive trend and if we look upon it for our side, in West Europe, we had Q1 this year was a minus 3%, we're basically flat in Q2. We have the 3% growth in Q3 and another 3% in Q4.","But I will say when I look upon it when you get Germany from flat in the first half of the year to around 6% then it was 8% in the last quarter that's very encouraging for us and again, as I said, there are businesses there for us that had good growth versus -- Industrial had 6% growth in West Europe. So it's encouraging for us but we still have to be cautious as we go into the year and we are type of looking upon West Europe next year for flat to 3% growth, right.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay.

Morgan","Yeah. And then on the price cost side, I believed you mentioned, kind of the closing -- gradual closing that gap through the year, just when we think about the components of that, I know you have your sourcing programs, I know the raws have maybe picked up very slightly? But maybe just a little bit more color around kind of how to think about the different factors and how they progress?","Inge Thulin","Yeah. So if you look at the components of price and raw materials, so we talked about prices where we exited 2013 quite strong. We see that then moderating as we walk through the year, towards the de minimis level, right but still slightly positive.","And if you look at raw materials what we indicated our outlook for the year was another favorable $0.05 to $0.15 a share performance in 2014. We exited the year actually pretty stable with raw material performance. So we were down a couple of percentage points in \u201813 through the year including Q4 and we see that moderating somewhat as we move through the year but there will be some carryover impact certainly as we enter the first part of the year.","Drew Pierson - J.P.

Welcome to the 3M second-quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 23, 2015.","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2015 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we will take your questions. As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, October 22 and January 26. Also take note of our next investor meeting scheduled for December 15. More details will be available as we get closer to that date.","Today's earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our investor relations website at 3M.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two.","During today's conference call we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please turn to slide three and I will hand off to Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Overall this was a good quarter for 3M, marked by broad-based organic growth and margin expansion. We continue to operate in an uncertain global economic environment which softened growth. At the same time, we grew organically in all geographic areas, expanded margins a full percentage point and increased net income. Most importantly, we maintained our commitment to managing 3M for the long term with strong investments in our portfolio.","Let's go through a few of the second quarter's numbers. Earning per share rose to $2.02, a 5.8% increase year-over-year. Our team posted local currency sales growth of 2% company-wide. On an ex-electronic basis growth was 2.2%, the same as Q1, and I will talk more about our electronics business shortly.","Organic growth was positive in all geographic areas paced by the United States at 4%. Four of our five business groups grew organically, led by safety and graphics at 5%, followed by consumer and healthcare businesses at 3%. Growth in industrial slowed a bit to 1% as we experienced channel inventory adjustments in general in the industrial markets.","Electronics and energy declined 3% organically in the quarter. This business group faced a tough year-on-year comparison and we also saw somewhat softer consumer demand in the electronics markets. However, even in softer market condition we increased margins in electronics and energy to more than 21% for the second straight quarter.","As you recall, last year we consolidated a number of businesses within electronics and energy to better align to customers and generate efficiencies, and that portfolio work is paying off. I am pleased with the progress of this business and going forward, the team is focused on driving spec-in wins, increasing productivity and advancing our technology's capabilities.","In the second quarter we saw continued strength of the US dollar, which reduced company-wide sales by 7.3%. As a result, total sales declined 5.5% to $7.7 billion. We increased 3M's operating margins to 23.9%, up 1.1 percentage points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year margin expansion company-wide.","Our margins remain strong and broad-based as all business groups posted margins greater than 21%. This is a testament to the strength of our portfolio and business model, and our business teams around the world driving productivity each and every day. In the second quarter we also continued to actively deploy capital in order to improve the business and return cash to shareholders. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","And just last month we announced the acquisition of Capital Safety. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment and will bolster 3M's personal safety business, which is a strategic priority in our portfolio. This acquisition builds upon a number of other portfolio actions we have taken to strengthen our portfolio.","Please turn to slide number four. Portfolio management is one of our three strategic levers and is vital to our success. To succeed in the long term we must constantly evolve to meet the changing demand of our customers and the global economy. Back in 2012 we began a comprehensive review of 3M's portfolio and started to make changes to better align our portfolio to our long-term strategic objectives. This includes reallocation of resources to our best opportunities. It also means taking action to create greater value, such as combining businesses within our company to increase customer relevance, scale and productivity, acquiring businesses that align with 3M's fundamental strength and strategic objectives, and divesting businesses that no longer align with those strengths or objectives.","In the first half of 2015 we took action on all fronts. Earlier this month, for example, we combined two of our healthcare businesses. Our dental and orthodontic business, which are both recognized for their strong technology and brands, were merged to form a single Oral Care Solutions business. Now, through a seamless and single partnership, we can offer customers an entire suite of oral care innovations, thus increasing our relevance and generating efficiency. In fact, since 2012, we have consolidated businesses with each of our business groups. As a result, we have moved from six business groups to five and from 40 businesses to 26.","Next, our acquisitions. Earlier I talked about last month's announcement of Capital Safety. In February, we also announced $1 billion acquisition of Polypore's separations media business, which will enhance 3M's core filtration platform. And in March we acquired Ivera Medical, a strategic addition to our healthcare business group. At the same time in January, we sold our static control business after thorough strategic review.","Because of our team's work, 3M is now leaner, more focused and better positioned to win big opportunities and create greater value for customers and ultimately for our shareholders today, and even more so in the future.","Thank you, and now I will turn the call over to Nick for more details on the quarter. Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide five were I will describe the elements of second quarter sales growth. We generated organic local currency growth of 1.8%, with volumes contributing 0.8% to our growth and selling prices adding 1%. The sales impact from acquisitions, net of divestitures, was neutral in the quarter. Positive growth related to the Ivera Medical acquisition was offset by our divestiture of the static control business.","Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 7.3 percentage points in the second quarter. The most notable currencies impacting sales were the euro, yen and Brazilian real, which devalued versus the US dollar by 20%, 17%, and 28%, respectively. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 5.5% versus second quarter of 2014.","On a geographic basis, the United States led the way with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. US growth was broad based, led by safety and graphics and consumer at 6%, healthcare at 4% and industrial at 3%. Latin America\/Canada posted organic growth of 0.8% in the quarter. Growth was positive in our healthcare and industrial businesses, while safety and graphics and electronics and energy both declined organically.","Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 17% organic growth in the quarter, and Brazil turned positive with 1% growth. The impact of year-on-year sales declines in Venezuela reduced organic growth in Latin America\/Canada by 4 percentage points in the quarter. This headwind is behind us starting in Q3.","Organic local currency growth in Asia Pacific was 0.5% in the quarter, with healthcare and safety and graphics each growing 9% and consumer growing 3%. Electronics and energy declined 4% organically in Asia Pacific.","Organic growth was down 2% in China\/Hong Kong in the second quarter. Healthcare delivered strong growth which was offset by declines in safety and graphics, electronics and energy, and consumer. We continue to see the Chinese economy adjusting to new growth levels and we saw channel adjustments in some key end markets, which impacted our growth. For the full year 2015, we now expect organic growth in China\/Hong Kong to be in the mid single-digit range versus mid-to-high single-digits previously.","Japan delivered another good quarter with second quarter organic growth of 2%, or up 7% excluding electronics. Health care and safety and graphics posted strong organic growth followed by steady growth in our consumer and industrial businesses.","Turning to EMEA, organic growth was 0.4% in Q2, with West Europe declining 1%. Organic growth in Central East Europe increased high single-digits while Middle East\/Africa was down mid single-digits. Organic growth in EMEA was led by safety and graphics at 4%, health care was flat and industrial, consumer and electronics and energy each declined 1%.","Please turn to slide six for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion. Operating margins improved by 1.1 percentage points year-on-year to 23.9%. Strong gross margin improvements, along with productivity, drove the second quarter operating margin performance.","Let me cover the primary components of the change in margin. On the positive side, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 150 basis points of margin expansion. Pricing performance in the second quarter remained steady, driven by continued new product flow across our businesses and price increases in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations.","We continue to benefit from lower raw material costs and expect this trend to continue throughout the year. Commodity prices remain favorable and our global sourcing teams continue to generate additional cost reductions. Productivity remains strong in the second quarter, adding 50 basis points to margins, driven by Lean Six Sigma efforts, returns on past portfolio actions and continuing to prioritize investments.","Strategic investments reduced margins by 30 basis points. This includes our ERP and business transformation effort, increased R&D investments aimed at disruptive innovation, along with portfolio management actions. These investments will strengthen 3M for the future.","Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced second quarter operating margins by 60 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension expense increase is due to the adoption of new mortality tables along with a lower discount rate. For the full year we continue to expect operating margins to increase by approximately 1 percentage point.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide seven for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.02, a year-on-year increase of 5.8%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.12 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This result includes a negative $0.05 impact from higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by $110 million or the equivalent of $0.12 a share.","The second quarter tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in last year\u2019s comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.04 per share. The reduction in the tax rate versus last year\u2019s Q2 was driven by adjustments to tax reserves which were partially offset by geographic profit mix. Reserve adjustments were anticipated in our tax rate guidance. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 3% versus last year\u2019s second quarter, which added $0.07 to second quarter earnings per share.","Let\u2019s now review cash flow, please turn to slide number eight. Second quarter operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, down $300 million year-on-year. The majority of the year-on-year decline was due to higher cash taxes. We invested $370 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $29 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.","Second-quarter free cash flow was $1.0 billion and we converted 74% of net income to cash. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100%. Cash dividends paid were $646 million in the second quarter, up $90 million year-on-year. As a reminder, we increased the per share dividend by 20% this past February, which marks the 57th consecutive year of dividend increases.","Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, up $269 million compared to Q2 2014. Through the first half of 2015, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of our own shares. We now expect full-year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus a prior expectation of $3 billion to $5 billion.","Let\u2019s now review our second quarter performance on a business-by-business basis, starting with our industrial business. Please turn to slide number nine. Industrial posted sales of $2.6 billion in the quarter, with organic local currency growth of 1.4%. Industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by 3M Purification and aerospace and commercial transportation each generating double-digit growth in the quarter.","The automotive OEM business posted mid-single digit growth in the quarter versus a slight year-on-year decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to improve our market share in this large and important market. We also delivered positive organic growth in automotive aftermarket in Q2, while the industrial adhesives and tapes business was flat. On a geographic basis, the U.S. and Latin America\/Canada set the pace, with each posting organic growth of 3%. Asia Pacific was flat, while EMEA declined 1%.","The industrial business delivered operating income of $609 million in the second quarter. Operating margins were a strong 23.1%, up 120 basis points year-over-year, boosted by positive price\/raw materials.","Let\u2019s now turn to safety and graphics on slide ten. Second quarter sales in safety and graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4.9% organically. All businesses within the portfolio grew organically, led by the roofing granules business, which posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Personal safety, one of 3M\u2019s heartland businesses, grew mid-single digits in the quarter. This business is a strategic priority for 3M for several reasons, including our strong product portfolio, fast growing end markets and increasing regulatory standards across developed and developing markets. As Inge mentioned, the Capital Safety acquisition will strengthen this business even further.","Geographically, organic sales growth in safety and graphics was 9% in Asia Pacific, 6% in the U.S. and 4% in EMEA. Latin America\/Canada declined 2%. Operating income was $364 million and operating margins increased 1.8 percentage points to 25.4%. Margin improvements were driven by price\/raw material benefits, along with productivity and portfolio management actions.","Let\u2019s now turn to health care. Please turn to slide 11. Health care delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the second quarter, with organic growth of 3.4%. We continued to see broad-based organic growth across much of the health care portfolio, including food safety, health information systems, oral care, critical and chronic care, and infection prevention. Drug delivery systems, which is a project-based business, declined year-on-year.","The Ivera Medical acquisition added 70 basis points to health care sales growth in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth in health care was led by Asia Pacific at 9%, with strong contributions from both Japan and China\/Hong Kong. Latin America\/Canada grew 5%, the U.S. was up 4% and EMEA was flat.","Health care\u2019s operating income was $440 million and margins rose 160 basis points to 32.3%. Primary drivers of margin expansion included strong productivity and price\/raw material benefits.","Next we will look at Electronics and Energy on slide 12. In Electronics and Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter, down 3% in organic local currency. Operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.2% and operating income was $277 million in the quarter. Our portfolio management actions in this business continue to yield benefits for our customers and improve productivity, which is leading to strong operating margin performance.","Organic local currency sales declined 2% on the electronics side of the business. As Inge commented, we experienced softer conditions in the electronics market for the quarter. The business remains focused on continuing to drive successful spec-in wins with electronic OEMs. In our energy-related businesses, organic local-currency sales were down 3, consistent with first quarter growth patterns.","On a geographic basis, organic sales growth in Electronics and Energy increased 1% in the U.S., EMEA declined 1%, Asia Pacific was down 4% and Latin America\/Canada declined 7%. The divestiture of the Static Control business reduced sales by 70 basis points in the second quarter.","Please turn to slide 13. Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion, with organic growth of 3.4%. We grew organically across the portfolio, with particular strength in the do-it-yourself business, led by strong growth of Scotch Blue painter\u2019s tape. Our stationery and office supply, home care and consumer health care businesses also delivered positive organic growth in the quarter.","Second quarter is typically when we begin to see the impact of the back-to-school season. Growth has been encouraging to this point, most notably in our line of Scotch brand home and office tapes and Command solutions, which eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures, decorations or other items.","Looking at the Consumer business geographically, organic growth was led by the U.S. at 6% and Asia Pacific at 3%. Latin America\/Canada was flat and EMEA declined 1%. Operating income increased to $259 million and margins were 23.3%, up 2.2 percentage points year-over-year. Margins were boosted by lower raw material costs, portfolio prioritization, strong productivity and timing of promotional programs. ","That wraps up our review of the second quarter business results. I will turn it back over to Inge for an update on our 2015 planning estimates.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Nick. Overall, 3M delivered a good second quarter performance. Organic growth remained broad-based, and we continued to generate premium margins across the portfolio. Looking across 3M\u2019s entire team, I am very pleased with our execution and discipline in an uncertain economic environment, which is evident in our strong productivity.","Going forward, we expect that economic uncertainty to remain through the year. In fact, external growth forecasts have continued to moderate over the last several months. As a result, today we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4%, versus a prior expectation of 3% to 6%. With respect to earnings, we now anticipate EPS in the range of $7.80 to $8.00, versus a prior range of $7.80 to $8.10. The rest of the guidance remains in place.","As you can see, we still expect currency to reduce sales by 6% to 7%. Our tax rate guidance is unchanged to 28.5% to 29.5%. And we continue to expect a free cash flow conversion rate of 90% to 100%. Like always, our 3M teams are focused on executing our plan, making investment for the future and managing those things within our control, in other words, controlling the controllable.","As I described earlier, our portfolio is strong, and getting stronger as a result of our recent investments. Going forward, each of our businesses will continue to be bolstered by 3M\u2019s four fundamental strengths: technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand. Those strengths are leveraged across our Company, and will allow us to gain market share, maintain world-class margins and generate efficient growth into future.","Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you and good morning, everyone.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Inge, maybe just touching on organic growth for a second, you're tracking towards the lower end of the full-year guide so far year-to-date, and there still seems to be a lot of uncertainty in the environment. And so I'm just wondering, how are you thinking about your base case for the rest of the year just given what you are seeing geographically and across your product portfolio?","Inge Thulin","Well, as you recall, we saw -- all of us saw a slow economic environment coming early in the year. And after the first quarter we thought it was too early for us to change the guidance for the year. And I think it now as we moved in and saw the second quarter coming through here, I think it is the right thing to make sure that we adjust that guidance. And now you can see basically the Industrial Production Index came down even a couple of weeks ago from 2.6 to 2.1. So based on that and based on our portfolio, we think it\u2019s prudent for us to take it now to 2.5% to 4%. This is what we had earlier. ","I would say, if I just comment on the organic growth for the quarter, the thing that changed for us in the quarter was basically the electronics. Electronics was two things. One was a tougher comparison versus last year. We had 10% organic local currency growth a year ago, and then there became some softness in that segment. So when I look upon it, the second quarter is very similar to the first quarter in terms of growth, excluding that piece, right. And so I think that the 2.5% to 4%, I think that\u2019s a reasonable guidance for us, and we should be able to come somewhere in the middle of that.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, that's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up there on the electronics business. Typically there is -- you see some type of seasonal uptick in the second quarter, particularly from a margin standpoint. I think very few years have you seen a sequential decline in margins on electronics. And I'm just trying to get a better understanding on what's driving the weakness. How are utilization rates? How do you view the channel from an inventory standpoint? And then how should we think about that margin trajectory moving forward?","Nick Gangestad","Joe, this is Nick. The margin -- we expanded margin here 60 basis points year-on-year against a quarter that was fairly strong, second quarter of last year. What's been enhancing our margin and will continue to enhance our margin is some of the portfolio management actions that we've been taking in that business that increase our cost competitiveness. That's what's been driving it in the last few quarters and we continue to see that driving it in the next few quarters, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. And then I guess just a commentary on the end market from a utilization standpoint and from an inventory standpoint, what\u2019s your sense for what's happening in the channel today?","Inge Thulin","Well, I don\u2019t say \u2013 I think it\u2019s more -- as you know, we are spec-in on most of the devices in the industry and what is happening from time-to-time is maybe a little bit of a delay of the new product introduction, and that will of course then impact us immediately. So I think the way I look upon this is to say we are making the same progress now as in the past relative to our spec-in. And we didn't see any big change relative to inventory levels, which you maybe then also can see relative to purchasing. So if there was a little bit of a delay of some new product introductions and they didn\u2019t build inventory, they type of slowed it down and that is impacting us as well. ","I will make the comment, though, on that business, if we just put it in perspective and why I am pleased with the performance there. You recall that we started that business with margins around 15.7%, 15.8% or something, and now moved it up to 21%. And the question was always, is this volume driven? And my answer was always no. The action we have taken on the portfolio, in order to get more efficient organization, better lines to customers and have better asset utilization, meaning if we will have from a quarter that will happen in that business, a little bit slower growth, we will be able to hold margin at the high level. Meaning, it's not volume related. I think we proved that \u2013 in this quarter, we proved that model is correct. So Volume went down a little bit, and in fact we had margin expansion in that business. For that and on the work we have done on our portfolio, I'm personally very pleased with what that team had done relative to that portfolio work.","Joe Ritchie","That's a fair point. Thanks for that. Thanks, Inge and Nick. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe","Thanks and good morning, guys.","Inge Thulin","Hi, good morning Nigel.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning.","Nigel Coe","I think if we back out electronics and energy, which is a bit more \u2013 a little bit choppier around the quarters, I think the growth is the lowest we've seen since the recovery. So I'm just wondering, maybe just Inge, maybe just some commentary on the macro environment. Do you view this as a speed bump and can we get beyond this back into that 4% or 5% zone or do you think there's something a bit more awry here?","Inge Thulin","Well, first of all, I think let's hold it to the year, where we start talking to 2.5% to 4%, so we don't go ahead of on this ourselves relative to the future. But I think when I look upon it is to say first of all, United States is very solid. We had a 4% organic local currency growth. We grew in all businesses. It is very solid. And as you recall, hopefully recall, a quarter ago that growth was slightly lower and the question was then, are you concerned about the US? Our answer was no, not necessarily. And I think we had 4% growth here. That's good.","In Asia, or APAC, Japan did well. Japan had 2% growth, excluding electronics, which is the base business, 7% growth. China was slow. It slowed down. They're type of adjusting to a new growth level there and we are now talking about mid-to-single \u2013 mid-single digit for the year. And I think we have to wait a little bit to see what will happen there. It's a big economy as you know. We have a strong position, but I think that the growth need to pick up more, specifically in the domestic markets, and health care did well for us there. The other businesses went basically sideways.","West Europe, we all predicted that there will be a growth pick-up based on the euro situation. So far we have not seen that, and probably will come later in the year, but I think it will be very late in the year. ","Latin America is doing fine. And as you see again, Mexico had 17% growth. Now is the first quarter in many quarters that we saw a slight improvement in Brazil. And as Nick said, Venezuela is now behind us in terms of comparison where we will go into Q3. And so I think that's my view on it.","So I will say, I will not talk about higher figures than the 2.5% to 4%, at least as we go in for this year. Then we will have to see how Q3 and Q4 will work out here.","Nigel Coe","Okay, and perhaps -- Inge, thanks for that commentary. You mentioned let's see how 3Q looks. You gave some good color on the last call on 2Q trends to date, which turned out to be pretty prescient. ","Inge Thulin","Can you repeat that, which one?","Nigel Coe","I'm just wondering how is 3Q tracking?","Nick Gangestad","Nigel, we're not really seeing any change in trends from what we saw in Q2. We saw things pretty stable within Q2 and we're not seeing, so far in the third quarter, any change in that pattern.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that's very helpful. And just a quick one on health care. You mentioned drug delivery as being part of base and being weak, and that was a factor last quarter. If we back out the impacts of drug delivery, how does that look? How does health care look ex that?","Nick Gangestad","That business in total, Nigel, brought down the growth for health care by approximately 1 percentage point.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Jermaine Brown","Thank you, good morning.","Inge Thulin","Hi, David.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning.","Jermaine Brown","This is actually Jermaine Brown filling in for David.","Inge Thulin","Okay, well, good morning to you.","Jermaine Brown","Two questions. Good morning. Your gross margins in Q2 expanded only slightly more than Q1. For H2, should we expect a greater raw material benefit? Or is Q1 and Q2 a good guide for what we should expect for margins within the second half?","Nick Gangestad","We see the raw material benefits being pretty evenly spread between first half and second half. I would say the first half is a very good guide for the second half.","Jermaine Brown","Understood. And my second question is, your demand within Asia-Pacific, particularly China, decelerated. I'd imagine that some of that was due to lower electronics demand. But were there any other businesses or end markets that also contributed to that decline?","Nick Gangestad","Our declines there, we were up in our health care business. Electronics and energy was, yes of course, one of the declines. The others in China\/Hong Kong were a deceleration from the growth we saw in the first quarter.","Jermaine Brown","Okay. And then one month into Q3, what are you seeing demand-wise within Asia-Pacific?","Nick Gangestad","As I said earlier, what we're seeing in Q3, so far no change in trajectory from what we saw in the second quarter or for the first half.","Jermaine Brown","Understood. I will hop back in queue. That's all that I have. Thank you.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning, guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Steven.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning. ","Steven Winoker","Could you talk a little bit about -- I want to dive into Capital Safety a little bit since I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to do much of that. You talked about, in the release, 14 times EBITDA multiple, I think that included synergies. It's clearly a very -- at least I think it's a very attractive company and segment. But maybe talk through, number one, what was that multiple excluding that impact in that one-year timeframe? And how do you think about pricing in general, given that you're obviously allocating more funds to bigger M&A? I'm just trying to get a sense for how you thought about the return profile on that one and in general.","Inge Thulin","First of all, the Capital Safety is in our view, a perfect fit for 3M. Fall protection, which is the segment, is among the fastest-growing and most profitable segments in the PP industry. And Capital Safety is recognized as a leader in fall protection. So you take those things together, there is high complementary synergy to 3M's global business in personal safety, which is a heartland division. ","So Capital Safety, if think about it, it provides accretive growth to us and also margins, both for safety and graphics and for overall 3M. And you saw the start again for safety and graphics which is very, very good, and have as I said earlier, is the business group that I thought will have the real break-out as we go. So I think it is a very valued and good acquisition to us. ","The component annual sales growth had been over 10% for the four last years and EBITDA margins is approaching 40%. You have all those type of things that you lay them back to the portfolio work we did where you say, well you know \u2013 well, how can we build out our businesses and make sure that we get more relevance with our customers as we move ahead and drive synergies? ","So what I think about it in totality, and the figures you are quoting there is correct, is actually 12x based on five-year run rate synergies. But I think this is for us a terrific acquisition that is building out our position.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And so do you think about it in terms of return on capital over that timeframe as well?","Nick Gangestad","Certainly, Steve. We're looking at return on capital and looking at the time it takes us to bring this back to a return on capital. And for us that's in the fifth or sixth year that we see this meeting, on a cash basis, our return on capital -- our cost of capital. ","Steven Winoker","Okay, all right. And then just on the pricing versus raws, you already talked about the raws comment. Pricing was another 1% again this quarter, very strong, obviously dealing with FX and issues. Can we talk about the sustainability of pricing within that equation going forward?","Nick Gangestad","On the margin front, just to clarify, of that 150 basis points about 60 of those basis points are coming from our price growth, and 90 basis points from our raw material reductions. As far as the sustainability of price, we're at about 1% price -- we are at a 1% price increase on average through the first half of the year. We see that trend sustaining through the second half of the year.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And is that mostly just again, that's independent of new products. It's just pure price increases on the existing portfolio?","Nick Gangestad","On our existing portfolio. I would add the color that if you look at all of our price growth, the fact that we keep refreshing our product line with our investments that we're making in research and development, that does enable us through the value we are creating for our customers, to be able to sustain pricing growth.","But the other part of our price growth in the second quarter and for the year is also driven by movements related to FX. If I look at second-quarter standalone, of our total price growth, we estimate 25% of that total price growth is coming from pricing based on the value we are creating for our customers, and 75% based on movements we're taking directly or indirectly related to FX movements.","Steven Winoker","Okay, that's very helpful, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis","Good morning, guys. I was a little bit surprised in Capital Safety you said year five or six reach your cost to capital. And I'm assuming your -- I mean, I'll ask the question what you think your cost of capital is, but let's just say for the sake of argument it's somewhere in the 9% range. I would think when you're buying a business like this in an industry you know so well and so easily integratable, that you'd be able to earn a higher return on that. On the other side of it just indicates that maybe you overpaid. I hate to be skeptical on that stuff, but can you address it a bit?","Nick Gangestad","Part of our portfolio prioritization is we know the assets we want to buy. We know where we can drive the most value. As we look at this business integrated with our personal safety business, we do see cost synergies that we'll be deriving. We see sales synergies, both of those contributing to get that result. What you're seeing here, Scott, is a result of us having a clear vision of what we wanted to add to our portfolio, and also an asset that we could see bringing a good financial return to 3M.","Scott Davis","I think that partially answers it. Partially what I'm saying is, if you look at future acquisitions, is this going to be the type of hurdle rate you're looking for going forward? Because from my perspective, you would probably, is all you can do is earn 8% or 9% return five years out and there's risk, you could probably get that just buying your own stock.","Inge Thulin","The answer to that is, is not necessarily, Scott. I think you have to look upon this -- first look upon this acquisition first of all, clearly strategic in terms of the outcome of the portfolio work, right? So that's, I think that's an important element.","There are certain pieces of the business that can be integrated and where we can drive synergy, others cannot. The reason for that is that there's a high element of regulation and education in that fall protection. So we need to continue to invest in that and make sure that we do everything that is right.","So there is two elements into it, right. Some pieces from the commercialization perspective where we can drive a lot of synergy, and we will. And the other piece, I think we still need to figure out how we can accelerate that to get the return even faster.","It's a highly regulated business, as you know. And then by that, the advantage of that, the barrier to enter is very high. So you have to think about it, you get it integrated and as you move on it, you have to make sure that you can drive more synergy.","But the answer to your question, necessarily not. This was a specific case. This is a very important strategic move for us in order to build out our position here, and it's a high-class asset. It is a high-class asset that is very similar to 3M in terms of margins, returns and growth and so forth. So we can always --","Scott Davis","I agree. I think more specifically, just trying to get a sense of the future.","Inge Thulin","The other thing here, Scott, if you look upon the other acquisitions we have done from Sumitomo to Ceradyne, et cetera, we are not even close to this, right. I will say that, we can always argue day out and day in of the valuation. Did you pay too much or whatever? This is a strategic fantastic move for us with a world-class asset. So I'm pleased with that piece and now it is up to us to drive the return even faster back to us.","Scott Davis","Okay, that's a good answer. Just to be a little bit more, dig into a little bit more detail on that, you mentioned EBITDA margin of 40% on Capital Safety. Is that something -- can that be a 50% EBIDTA margin business or is it more a function you can bring Capital Safety in and the rest of your safety products businesses to co-opt? Or is it Capital Safety itself can see a margin lift?","Nick Gangestad","Scott, we see modest gross margin expansion opportunities there. We probably see more of our cost synergy benefits coming from the back office SG&A front than on the gross margin front.","Scott Davis","Okay, that's helpful. So thanks, guys, I will pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC, please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Thank you, good morning, everyone, and let me say congrats to Matt and Bruce on their new responsibilities. Sorry to pile on the Capital Safety deal, but this was the largest deal you have ever done. And if I'm not mistaken, this was not the first time you had the opportunity to buy this asset. Why did you pass on it before?","And then you are already in fall protection because I've been to trade shows where we've had demonstrations of fall protection. So how does Capital Safety expand your product line and where might there be overlaps?","Inge Thulin","You're right, Deane, that we had a small presence in that segment. We were very, very small. And one thing that I've learned over the years I've done business, if you do not have a reasonable good market share position, you will over time lose out.","I've been in businesses over time where you think that a couple of percentage market share will take you to a better position. Is a very, very tough, so you need to come into a leading position. So that was one. So yes, we were there. We were, in my view, not relevant enough for the industry. So very opportunistic.","Now let's go back to your comment relative to why now. I talked about it in my speech before, but I have to go back to it because I think this is an important element. If you don't have a clear picture of where you would like to go in the future with your portfolio, you could have a tendency to try to be part of auctions on most things that are becoming available.","If you are part of bidding on more things that are becoming available, you maybe don't really know if this is a real important strategic imperative for you, and you should go for it. I would say, I was not part of 2008 and 2010, whatever, when there was bid on that asset. But maybe at that point in time it was not clear enough relative to the portfolio where we should invest for the future. This time, it was very, very clear for me where we should go. That's the answer from me.","Deane Dray","Inge, thanks for that context. Just one follow-up on the Mexico organic revenue growth, 17% really jumps out. What was driving that and expectations for the balance of the year?","Inge Thulin","Mexico has now been growing for almost two years, right, doing very, very well. And its -- I would say a combination of both domestic market growing well there, but also the overall Mexican economy in terms of exports, specifically into the United States. And we have a very good portfolio balance in Mexico. As you know, we've been there for a long time and we're able to capitalize on that. So I don't know exactly if I can give you the --","No, no, but his question is about the outlook for the year in Mexico. I think our growth rate here today is around 15% and I don't expect for the rest of the year that would slow down. But all businesses doing well there and specifically industrial is growing very, very fast.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning guys. On this China expectation for the year up mid-single digits, China\/Hong Kong, it was up 7% in the first, down 2% in the second. What gets better from here to even get you to the mid-single digits? I mean, you talked about some inventory channel adjustments, maybe just any other color on what you expect to improve from the current rate?","Inge Thulin","I think that, first of all, I believe that health care will continue. He had a good quarter in health care. Health care will continue and consumer will improve specifically. I also think that the industrial business, that is a sizable business for us there will improve slightly as we go for the year. So when you think about our portfolio, we get industrial slightly better. We get consumer up a little bit, which we will. And then health care continuing. That will take us there.","I don't comment on electronics because, as you know, electronics is that kind of business that is on a regional base. Sometimes Japan is doing better than China and so forth, right. So, let's see how much that will be executed in China. But I think there's still a time here that we have to see the adjustment in the Chinese market. But those three businesses specifically will improve for us slightly as we go for the rest of the year.","Shannon O'Callaghan","And in terms of those improvements in industrial and consumer, is that based on just sort of timing or ending of channel reductions? Or is this improvement in the economy?","Inge Thulin","Yeah, yeah, now that is what we are counting on. We cannot count on anything else, right but that's what we are counting on.","Shannon O'Callaghan","The channel being kind of cleared out and getting back to more normal?","Inge Thulin","Yeah.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, and then within the industrial business, I mean, all the end markets you commented on sounded reasonably good, but the whole segment grew 1.4%. Was there anything within that segment that was dragging it down from the decent trends in auto and other stuff?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, our industrial adhesives and tape business within industrial, that's one of the businesses that was flat. And that contributed to bringing the total organic growth down. Abrasives is another business that was down.","Shannon O'Callaghan","And that was I mean going to a ton of different end markets [indiscernible] one thing, right?","Nick Gangestad","Exactly. Including, in the case of abrasives, there's some oil and gas exposure there.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin","Hey, guys, good morning. Just to clarify on the Safety acquisition, you said it's going to be dilutive in the first 12 months. When are we expecting to close it? In the third quarter, right? Is that dilution incorporated in the updated guidance?","Nick Gangestad","Andrew, yeah, we've said that for the first 12 months, we expect this to be dilutive to GAAP EPS by $0.04. We expect this to close in the third quarter, in the middle of the third quarter, and our guidance is not yet including the impact of either the Capital Safety or the completion of the Polypore acquisition.","Andrew Obin","And just to clarify, in terms of -- oil prices have been coming down quite a bit since the end of the quarter. And I know you've updated what you think the impact is going to be in terms of your inputs. But when did you update your outlook for oil prices? Is it updated for the decline that we've seen over the past several weeks?","Nick Gangestad","Yeah, it is updated. And similar to what I said in April where we see ourselves now at the high end of the range of $0.25 benefit on raw materials, benefits as well as the margin impact I talked about earlier, that's reflecting where we are the most recently with commodity prices. So yes, it is reflecting that, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","And just a broader question. All of a sudden North America, US is the fastest growing market, right, it has lower margins, emerging markets are slowing. Are you guys thinking about adjusting your longer-term plan, given where the macro is playing out? Or do you think the existing game plan is adaptable to what you're seeing?","Inge Thulin","Yeah, the existing game plan is adaptable to what we are seeing. There's no change from that thinking at that point in time. And as you know, if you think about the five-year plan, we are three years into it. And there's always some changes going in and out in the plan, right, in terms of all metrics. ","But at this point in time -- of course from an execution perspective on where you invest for manufacturing and so forth, there are some differences now versus when they were three years ago, or where will you invest in international, right, or will you do it in the United States. So I think that's a business call on a day-to-day business. But at this point in time, there's no change from the overall plan, and our play-book is working. Our play-book is working.","Andrew Obin","Terrific, thank you very much.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Tusa","Hey, good morning.","Nick Gangestad","Hey, good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","So I guess just back to Shannon's question, but at a little more of a broad sense. Can you give us a little color on what you would expect on a core basis for kind of how the third and the fourth quarter play out? I know that you have a little bit of an easier comp in the third, and then a tougher comp in the fourth. I'm just kind of curious to see, to his question, just more broadly, what gets better here from the 1.8% that you put up this quarter?","Nick Gangestad","Okay, Steve, just to clarify, you're talking total company?","Steve Tusa","Total-co or core. So the 1.8%, what does the 1.8%, kind of how does that trend in the third and the fourth quarter? Is it steady or is it a little bit better in the third? Worse in the fourth?","Nick Gangestad","In our 2.5% to 4%, I can't say we're seeing a noticeable difference between the third and fourth quarter, if you're looking for some color on that, Steve. On the low end of the range, it would be a continuation of the growth rate that we've seen in the first half, that continues into both the third and fourth quarter. If we're a shade towards the middle or the high end of the range, we would expect to start to see that occurring in the third quarter and not all in the fourth quarter.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And did things get -- how did things trend as you kind of went around the quarter? How was kind of April, May, June type of dynamics?","Nick Gangestad","When we look on this on a sales per billing day, we saw virtually no change in our trends between the three months of the second quarter.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one last question just on the pricing dynamics. I guess you said 70% or 75% of that are kind of forex related. So I mean as we kind of lap these for-ex comps I guess as we move into next year, I guess you're going to have a first-quarter comp. So does that mean that 1% is probably -- since your second half is probably going to be a little bit less than 7% year-over-year, I guess, on forex? Does that mean that 1% kind of starts to fade in total as we move forward?","Nick Gangestad","To the extent that there's a portion of that 1% related to FX, over time, I see that fading, but not in the second half of the year. If it does fade, it will be minimal. The logical extension is we see some fading of that in '16, not a material amount of fading in the second half of 2015.","Steve Tusa","And on the 0.2% in US, so is that a good kind of reflection on, I guess, the US is probably your most stable market. Is that a good reflection of kind of what you're seeing on the price inflation side? Presumably customers will come back seeing what you guys are doing on the raws side. I mean, is it a little bit tougher to get price these days because of what's going on with raw materials? This is more of a kind of macro question, I guess, as well.","Inge Thulin","Well, you would assume it would be, but I think one of the advantages for us is that often our product is adding some additional profitability and productivity to our customers. So I would say, yes, a little bit tougher. But as long as you are focused on new product that's adding value into the end market, you are able to demand a slightly higher price.","Steve Tusa","Right, great, thanks a lot. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","I just want to follow up on the industrial business. You talked about some inventory issues there in the second quarter. I just wondered how severe those were and if you thought that that inventory had largely been cleared out, so in the third quarter we should see a better industrial organic growth rate.","Inge Thulin","Yeah. I would say that I think it will be cleared out, early Q3 is my view. Right. And I think when you listen to the results for the industrial and many businesses did well. There's a capital business that I will describe more as they're not spec-in, right or designing, they're more in the consumable side like abrasives and tape and so forth. That's where we had a little bit of temper and I think that then holding to the channels. But I'm more optimistic as we move forward relative to that front for industrial.","The other businesses there, if you think about aerospace and commercial and transportation at another 10% growth, purification another 10%, automotive OEM, as Nick said, has 6%. So many businesses there are doing very well. There were two divisions that had an impact for the quarter and it was very much what I would describe as consumables into industrial tapes and adhesives and abrasives.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then my follow-up would just be on the free cash conversion. Is it just the tax normalization in the second half that pushes up the conversion? Or is there something else happening with working capital, for example?","Nick Gangestad","Julian, there's a few things at play here. First of all, when we pay our cash taxes, there is some timing, and second quarter happened to be heavier weighted. That will moderate for the total year. Second quarter was also a quarter of higher than normal amount of our total pension contribution occurring in the second quarter.","And then the last piece is we did see some increases in our working capital and we expect that also to moderate in the second half of the year, all of the three of those contributing to improvement in our working capital into the second half. Those are what I'd adjust for. We have normal adjustments where, for instance for compensation, that always has a noticeable improvement in our free cash flow conversion in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning, two quick ones. ","Inge Thulin","Hi, Laurence.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. As you look across your portfolio in terms of where you either have a stronger new product pipeline or a high degree of confidence about pent-up demand, do you see any line of sight for acceleration in 2016, 2017 in any of your larger product categories? And secondly, if this choppy, soft demand environment continues for a few more years, how does that effect, if at all, your balance sheet targets?","Inge Thulin","Well, Nick will give you some comment on the balance sheet. Let me just comment relative to the, let's say, business groups. First of all, there is a very robust pipeline of new products in each individual business groups. So I don't see, from that perspective, a difference in between them. But when I look upon it, we have some businesses here that is -- industrial is 33% of our portfolio, and very strong. And we are now adding, even, an acquisition into that moving forward. And I think that what I call a design or spec-in there is a very strong credible business. So I think it will be strong.","I think, as I said earlier, safety and graphics, I talked about that for over a year now, that I believe that safety and graphics is the next breakout business group for us, as electronics and energy came earlier. The margin has expanded quite a bit there and I predicted that safety and graphics will follow, and maybe do even better due to the fact of the portfolio there. And I'm confident that that will happen. And you see our health care business. Health care business is usually the fastest growing, highest margin for us. And 80% of that portfolio is in the developed world, meaning only 20% in the developing, and that way a lot of growth for us is coming.","And again, I would say, yes, when I look upon it and try to be objective, you see the performance of our consumer business. Again, with a very good growth I would say, and margin expansion and a very strong brand equity. So I would say for the future for what we're doing here, I'm optimistic. And it's been a lot of work on the portfolio side, get more efficiency and organization, try to reduce unnecessary barriers internally. And as we say here at 3M that the productivity is important and complexity is the biggest enemy of productivity. And the whole team is working on that big time. So I would not make a distinction in between there. We are in a good position everywhere.","Nick Gangestad","Laurence, just a follow-up close on the last piece, you were asking about the balance sheet. Our strategy with our balance sheet, as far as our capital structure and our allocation of capital, we see that our strategy there robust enough to encompass a number of business models, including a lower growth scenario. On the margin, what would change, and again, this would be volatile of exactly why we're seeing that more -- lower growth world. But for example, CapEx, our capital allocation strategy, I think it would be natural to assume there would be less of our capital going into our CapEx capacity building.","In terms of M&A, that would depend on our view of the valuation of the opportunities. It could have an impact where things become more attractive to us, but that's highly driven by the opportunities that we see presenting at that time.","Matt Ginter","Laurence, this is Matt. We wouldn't see anything changing in terms of organic growth being the primary way in which we grow. We obviously dial CapEx to whatever levels of growth we're seeing, but it doesn't fundamentally change the way we think about growth, acquisition versus M&A.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Nick Gangestad","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answers portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.","Matt Ginter","Well, thank you very much for participating this morning. We look forward to seeing you very soon. Good-bye.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 24, 2014.","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you, good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2014 business review. Inge and David will make some opening comments today and then we will take your questions.","Before we begin I've a few brief announcements. Our remaining 2014 earnings calls are scheduled for Thursday, July 24, Thursday, October 23 and Thursday, January 29. Also, please hold the morning of Tuesday, December 16 on your calendars for our next investor meeting, the details of which will be available later this year. ","Note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2.","During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please turn to Slide 3 and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Matt. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. The first quarter was strong for 3M; marked by organic growth in all business groups and across all geographic areas. We posted record sales in return record cash to shareholders, by also increasing investments in R&D and commercialization to reinforce our foundation for long-term success.","Let's look at the few highlights earnings per share rose to $1.79, an 11.2% increase year-over-year. Sales were $7.8 billion the highest first quarter total in 3M history. Organic growth was 4.6% paced by our health care business at 6%.","Industrial, Safety and Graphics each grew 5% organically. We saw organic growth in each geographic area led by Asia Pacific and Latin America\/Canada at 7% each. Europe, Middle East, Africa grew 4% followed by the United States at 3%. I'm very encouraged by our continued broad based organic growth, which is more evident that is our strategies are working.","Currency reduced sales by 2% in the quarter, which was about 1% points worse than our expectation entering the year. Operating margins were again strong at nearly 22% up 30 basis point from last year. Four of our five business groups reported margins greater than 21%.","It remains a good time to be a 3M shareholder. The company returned $2.3 billion to its shareholders to cash dividends and share repurchases. We increased our first quarter dividend by 35%, which marked 56 consecutive annual increase.","In summary, the first quarter was a solid start to 2014. This is only possible because of the hard work of our entire 3M team on a global basis because of the efforts, we continue to deliver consistent and strong results today, while at the same time investing and building for the future. Now please turn to Slide number 4.","With one quarter behind us, we are reaffirming our earnings and organic growth outlook for the full year. Earnings per share are expected in the range to $7.30 to $7.55 with organic local-currency sales growth in the 3% to 6% range. We now anticipate foreign currency translation to reduce full year sales by approximately 1%, a slightly bigger headwind than previous expectations.","Our tax rate estimate remains at 28% to 29% with cash flow conversion at 90% to 100%. David will now take you through the details of the first quarter. David?","David Meline","Thank you, Inge. I'll begin by reviewing first quarter sales growth. Please turn to Slide number 5. Worldwide organic local-currency grew was 4.6% in the first quarter with volumes up 3.4% and selling prices up 1.2%. We continue to experience positive selling price changes across our businesses. Boosted by world-class innovation and strong new production flow both of which are important elements of the 3M business model.","In addition, we've been raising prices in certain developing countries to help offset the impact of currency devaluations. Foreign exchange impacts reduced worldwide sales by 2% points in the first quarter and as Inge mentioned this was about 1% point worse than we expected at the beginning of the year.","The most significant currency headwinds were in Latin America\/Canada had negative 12% as several countries in the area experienced devaluations. Currency impacts were negative 4% in Asia Pacific and a positive 2% in EMEA. On the total US Dollar basis sales rose 2.6% versus the first quarter of 2013.","Looking by area, demand accelerated in Asia Pacific in the first quarter with organic local currency growth of 7%. Growth was led by strong double-digit performance in Japan where demand was elevated leading up to the April consumption tax increase.","China, Hong Kong grew 2% organically in Q1 or 8% excluding electronics. On a business basis, all five groups within Asia Pacific generated positive organic local currency growth in Q1 led by health care and safety and graphics. Latin America\/Canada also grew 7% organically, a nice acceleration versus the fourth quarter.","Growth was led by solid double-digit performances in Brazil and Mexico; our two largest Latin American subsidiaries in terms of sales. All five businesses posted positive organic growth in Latin America\/Canada during the quarter including double-digit growth in health care. Electronics and energy also posted solid organic, local-currency growth in the area.","In Venezuela, we continue to manage through the economic turbulence and position our business for future success. Sales and profits were down substantially in Venezuela during the quarter. We continue to manage our exposures carefully and we will stay on this path until the situation improves.","For some time now, we have been actively managing towards a neutral net monitory asset position in Venezuela and at this point, it appears that any major event risk is behind us. Organic sales growth in EMEA was 4% in the first quarter continuing the positive trends that we have seen over the past few quarters.","West Europe grew 3% with strong performances in Nordic, Alpine and Iberia regions. Middle East Africa also posted strong organic growth in the quarter. On a business basis, growth in EMEA was strongest in industrial and in safety and graphics.","In the United States organic local-currency growth was 3% in the quarter, which was a bit slower than the growth we saw in the second half of 2013. It does appear that weather negatively impacted certain channels that we serve in the US, particularly in road construction, retail and industrial distribution.","On the positive side, health care posted the strongest US growth amongst our five businesses. Organic local-currency growth was nearly 5% across all developing markets and 4.5% in developed markets and again as Inge mentioned organic growth was positive across all major geographic areas.","Let's turn to Slide number 6, for discussion of the first quarter income statement. Sales for the quarter were $7.8 billion up 2.6% in dollar terms. Gross profit rose 3.7% to $3.8 billion and gross margins increased 0.5% points to 48.5%. SG&A spending increased in line with sales growth and R&D as a percent of sales rose by 20 basis points to 5.8%.","Operating income increased by just over 4% versus the first quarter of 2013. GAAP operating margins were 21.9% up 30 basis points year-on-year. Organic volume growth added 30 basis points to margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed a positive 110 basis points year-on-year.","And inherent part of 3M's business model is to leverage productivity and other gains to fund strategic investments, while continuing to generate premium returns. This is seen again in our first quarter numbers. We invested the equivalent of 90 basis points of margin on incremental programs around disruptive R&D, business transformation, and ERP, and restructuring.","In particular, we invested $40 million on restructuring and other realignment efforts in Q1 across a number of business units. Lower year-on-year pension and OPEB expense boosted first quarter margins by 50 basis points, while foreign exchange impacts reduce margins by 50 basis points.","All in first quarter earnings increased 11% to $1.79 per share. Foreign currency impacts reduced first quarter earnings per share by $0.04 and the lower tax rate resulted in a $0.04 per share benefit.","As a result of our announced changes in capital structure strategy, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings per share.","In summary, the first quarter was a good start to the year in 2014. Organic sales growth was broadly positive across businesses and geographies. Margins were strong overall and we expect this performance to continue into the future.","Now let's turn to cash flow, turning to Slide number 7. As a reminder for those, who are new to 3M; we announced at our December 2013 Investor Meeting, our plans to manage towards a better optimized capital structure going forward, and to allocate capital accordingly.","The strength and stability of our business model and strong free cash flow capability, enables us to enact this changes while continuing to invest in our businesses. Organic growth remains our first priority, so we will continue to invest in CapEx, R&D and commercialization capability. ","In addition, we're already enabled to respond to strategic acquisition opportunities that can strengthen our portfolio, and at the same time our plan affords us the opportunity to return significant cash to shareholders. We communicated our intent to implement these changes to our capital structure overtime.","For the calendar year 2014 in particular, we expect to add leverage of $2 billion to $4 billion on the balance sheet. So now let's discuss our cash flow performance for the first quarter. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter up $98 million versus last year's first quarter.","Higher net income drove the line share of the increase. Capital expenditures were $293 million, a decrease of $31 million versus last year. We continue to expect full year CapEx will be in the range to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. First quarter free cash flow was $799 million, up $129 million year-on-year and we converted 66% of net income to cash versus 59% in last year's comparable quarter.","Note that, first quarter is typically our seasonal low with respect to free cash flow conversion. For the full year 2014, we expect to be in the range 90% to 100%.","We paid $566 million in cash dividends during the quarter up substantially over the $440 million paid in 2013. As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 35%.","Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the first quarter for 2014 we expect full year gross share repurchases will be in the range $4 billion to $5 billion. Let's now review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go the Slide number 8.","Our industrial business posted strong first quarter results with $2.8 billion in sales and 5% organic local currency growth. Leading the way this quarter was our 3M Purification business which drove strong double-digit organic growth. This business has gained significant traction around the globe, as we expand our technology capability and product offerings.","We also generated double-digit organic growth in automotive OEM, which was more than twice the rate of growth in global auto production. Our advanced materials and industrial abrasive businesses also posted nice first quarter organic growth.","Industrial sales grew broadly across all geographic areas during the quarter. Organic local currency sales growth was 6% in both EMEA and Latin America\/Canada. 5% in Asia Pacific and 3% in the US.","First quarter operating income was $618 million up 7% year-on-year. Operating margins increased 80 basis points to 22.3%. Margins were boosted by volume leverage, positive price raw's and good productivity, partially offset by restructuring cost.","We also improved margins year-on-year in Ceradyne, a business we acquired in late 2012 which added 30 basis points to industrial margins in Q1. Please turn to Slide 9. Safety and Graphic sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter with organic local currency sales growth of 5%.","Our largest business here is personal safety, which generated double-digit organic local-currency growth. We also grew in a roofing granules and commercial solutions businesses. Sales in traffic safety and security systems declined slightly on organic basis, impacted by slow start to the road construction season.","Safety and graphics grew organically in all major geographic areas with Asia Pacific up 9%, Latin America\/Canada and EMEA each up 5% and the US up 2%. Operating income was $318 million in the first quarter and operating margin were a solid 22.3%, although margins were down year-on-year versus a very strong comp.","Major factors impacting, this quarter's margins were higher ERP investment, restructuring and negative currency impacts. Please go to Slide 10. Our health care business once again delivered outstanding results. It was our fastest growing and highest margin business group in the first quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion and increased 6% in organic local currency terms.","All businesses contributed this growth in the first quarter led by health information systems, food safety and drug delivery systems. All geographic areas generated positive organic local-currency sales growth with Latin America\/Canada up 12%. Asia Pacific up 10%, the US up 7% and EMEA up 2% in the quarter.","In developing markets health care grew 10% organically in the first quarter, yet another in a long string of double-digit performances. First quarter operating income in health care was $427 million and operating margins increased 30 basis year-on-year to 31.1%. Now let's look at electronics and energy found on Slide 11.","First quarter sales in this business were $1.3 billion up 4% in organic local-currency terms. Electronics related sales increased 5% on an organic local-currency basis with positive growth in optical films partially offset by declines in other businesses. In our energy related business, sales increased 2% organically led by renewable energy in telecom.","On a geographic basis organic local-currency sales increased 9% in Latin America\/Canada and 7% in Asia Pacific. EMEA was down slightly and the United States declined 4% year-on-year. Operating income rose 16% to $227 million and operating margins were 17.3%. Margins in this business continue to track higher rising 2 points year-on-year and 60 basis points sequentially.","Volume leverage and improving productivity were both positive contributors to first quarter margins. Finally, let's review the consumer business found on Slide number 12. Sales in the consumer business grew $1.1 billion with organic local-currency growth of 3%.","Sales in our stationary and office supply business declined versus last year's first quarter. Store traffic in the US office retail channel was softer in the quarter, due in part to harsh winter weather conditions along with continued store consolidations.","Our construction and home improvement business which serves the DIY retail market space led consumer's growth this quarter with high single-digit organic local currency sales growth. Over the years, we have built strong market positions in categories such as Filtrete brand, home furnace filters, Scotch-Brite, painters tape and Command brand mounting and fastening products, which provide a strong foundation for consistent strong growth.","On a geographic basis, organic local-currency growth was 6% in Asia Pacific, 5% Latin America\/Canada and 1% each in the US and EMEA. Operating income was $228 million with operating margins of 21.2%, that concludes my first quarter related comments and I'll turn the call back over to Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you David. As you can see, the year is off to a good start. We continue to execute well against our long-term strategic levels, which I would like to update you on. Let's first start with portfolio management. In the first quarter, we realigned and combined certain businesses to increase customer relevance, build scale and generate cost efficiency.","In the Safety and Graphic business group, we merged commercial graphics and building and commercial services into newly formed commercial solutions division. This brings a comprehensive array of branding, design, protection and maintenance solutions under one division allowing us to present one strong voice to the commercial markets customers.","Earlier this month, we also further realigned our electronics related businesses to more effectively position them to accelerate growth. We are now organizer on two large divisions. One is display materials and systems, which consolidates all of 3M's capabilities in electronic displays.","[Batteries] electronics material solutions which aligns our offerings in semi-conductor electronic materials and components. This changes will better align our capabilities with customers needs and expand our leadership in this area.","Also in April, 3M acquired Treo Solutions, a leader in the health care, data analytics. This will bolster our health information system business by allowing it to supply customers with better solutions at lower cost.","Let's talk about the second lever, investing in innovation. Innovation is the heartbeat of 3M. It drives what we do every day and allow us to create even greater value for customers. Innovation generates new growth and is the key to our long track record of generating premium returns throughout the business.","In fact, one-third of our revenue in 2013 came from products created in the last five years and we are targeting 37% by 2017. And we expanding our innovation capabilities globally, we have now built 45 innovation centers around the world, where customer gain exposure to the breadth of our technology.","Our international labs are also typically staffed and led by local nationals and our commitment to innovation helps 3M recruit some of the best and brightest scientists from all over the globe. It's notable that 47% of our new products launched in 2013, were led by international labs up from 37% just a few years ago.","The results were strong with more opportunities still to come. Now let's talk about the third lever; business transformation. We continue to make progress on implementing our global ERP system, which will lead to more a ideal and efficient 3M.","To-date, we have gone live in five countries with more schedule for 2014. Most recently, we launched is it, that is in one of our European distribution center based in Dabrowa, Poland. We are learning more with each implementation on using that knowledge to guide and refined our future work.","There is one final point I'd like to make before taking your questions. When we last met in January, I talked a bit about our 3M manage to a volatility in developing markets. Given down certainties in some areas of the world today. I like to expand a bit upon that discussion.","We have a deep history in developing nations. 3M entered Brazil in 1946 and a year later, 1947 in Mexico. With that history comes wealth of experience and business teams that know how to be successful in those areas.","This is also the model; we are using in Central East Europe, Middle East, Africa and APAC. This is the 3M international model. We enter early, develop connections grow our customer base and steadily build capability.","We staff our management teams with local nationals, people who know the country, culture and customers and of course speak the language. As with any growth opportunity, there are going to be challenges along the way and developing markets are no exception, yet when these challenges arise we do not abandon our customers or the market.","Our leaders know how to manage through them, knowing from experience that 3M will emerge even stronger with a more established presence and more loyal customer base. Our approach continue to produce strong results including this year's first quarter. In Brazil, as one example we grew 11% organically and in Mexico 15% and we see developing countries coming back in terms of growth rate.","Developing markets in total represents 35% of 3M's sales today and we expect that number to keep climbing. Thank you for your attention and with that, we are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, just a broad question. As I look at 3M, you guys delivered another quarter of some of the best top line growth in the industry and if you look at the margin expansion. You're actually starting to get it, but then if you look at the operating line the leverage seems to be limited and I understand it's a functional some of it discretionary spending that you guys are doing.","So two questions; A, what is the level, what is run rate of discretionary spending that we should be expecting for the rest of the year? And second a broader question, sort of 3M seems to be a combo and industrial company and a consumer company, but your operating leverage now behaves a lot more like consumer company than an industrial company. Do we get sort of operating leverage on the industrial side by some point this year? Thank you.","David Meline","Yes, thanks Andrew. So in terms of the leverage we get from growth. We saw in the first quarter, I think very typical of what we've expect from the overall business which is somewhere 35% to 40% operating leverage on the growth that we got and what's true as you pointed out and as we had planned, we do plan to reinvest a significant portion of that in some of these key strategic investments through 2014.","So we have said in the beginning of the year that we expect to invest in these investments program somewhere between $0.10 to $0.20 during the year and we invested $0.07 a share in the first quarter. So we still expect to invest at that $0.10 to $0.20 range probably towards the high end, the way it looks right now, but what you can expect through the year is that you'll see some moderation of that spending.","So obviously, the business transformation and the R&D investment is pretty steady through the year. We also invested, we did some restructuring in the first quarter that we'll look at each quarter and determine, whether or not there are projects that we should undertake and also some of the spending was in this European supply chain center of excellence, which will lap that spending here as we move into the second quarter.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just on structural, I understand that you need to invest and it's part of the culture, but as I said should we see more operating more top line dropping to the bottom line in the second half of the year, is that a reasonable expectation given what you've stated?","David Meline","Yes, I mean if you look at the plan we laid out for the year. What you could foresee, is that we will some inept increase in our margins for the year, which we did see already here in the first quarter. So I think it's fair to assume that will continue as we look through the full year.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","The 50 basis point increase in gross margin and when I look at the gross margin overall. The highest, I think since that was 6 certainly for a long time and you peaked in that earlier time period over 50%. I know we are having sort of the discussion about investments below the gross margin line, but is most of that increase on the pricing versus raw material front and how do you think about this sustainability.","I mean clearly you have a lot of pricing power and you're making up for some inflationary issues, but when you sort of look at your material cost position, cost out and continue pricing efforts, are there other things going on there in the volume leverage etcetera and we can sort of see that number also continue to tick up for some time.","David Meline","You're right, Steve. We were encouraged this quarter by the improvement in our gross margin which seasonally for us, the first quarter is usually the lowest of the year. So that was encouraging, if we look year-over-year. What's true, it's a combination of several factors. Certainly productivity features in that and you've heard us really focus in these last couple of years around the rejuvenation and taking segment to the next level and, so we are seeing I think some of that coming through.","Certainly, we've been working the portfolio to focus resources where the best opportunities are and I think that's certainly contributing to the overall gross margin profitability of the company and then finally, there certainly as you know and as you pointed out. There is component of price in raw material that's supporting this.","On the pricing side, we had quite strong pricing in the first quarter down a little bit from the fourth quarter but nonetheless quite strong at 1.2% and if you'll look at about half of was that attributable to the freshness of the product portfolio and really the price value relationship that our customers described to those products and the other half, was largely attributable to offsetting the foreign exchange movements in particular in the emerging market.","So as a combination of several factors, but obviously it's something we continue to focus on and seek to improve.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That's great and Inge. You've talked less about it, yet another organizational set of changes internally that just sound like a continued large transformation going on. Are these latest ones that you talked about today? I mean, how much \u2013 it sounds like it\u2019s all channel driven but you're also going reap some cost synergy benefits from it? So there are other elements besides the channel and customer facing front here that will be, we can see the benefits from overtime?","Inge Thulin","First of all, if you go back when we lay out our six new strategies when I took office. A little bit more than two years ago, the first strategy is to calling out relevance to customers and this is the implementation of that. So when you have the strategy, you need to follow through in order to make sure that you on the way to obtain your overall or be active.","So some of this changes that we've done is clearly based on relevance to customers for us to be able to respond faster based on their needs, where you know as you know that our technology platforms are very important and we need to be able to respond fast back to them based on solutions, we are working with them.","In my mind, as we not have looked into the organization structure maybe for almost 10 years, there was some disconnect in between our internal organization in the market, so we are addressing that. And of course, so drive it first from relevance to customer, to market, but there is also cost benefits of course into organization structure, as you make those moves because you reduced specifically in the back office and in the middle management, where you can reduce cost and be more ideal and so forth.","So if you think about it from a speed perspective because we would like to accelerate speed in terms of responsiveness to customers. We have in some parts of the world, that we have not talked about now for long time also consolidate subsidiaries into region in the part of West Europe and we have done in Latin America, etc.","So if you think about that, well you now have connection points where we previously in some cases said three sizeable but not huge divisions that needed to interact. For instance, in Nordic with four different countries where we today have one-to-one. So you have one huge division totally focused in market space and you have one geographical area in Nordic that's incredible move and shift if you think about speed in order to execute, when you went from three Vice President's back in St. Paul and four Managing Director, Nordic.","Now you go one-for-one, I can tell you that has an incredible impact on the organization in terms of speed as we move ahead. So look upon it like increased relevance in the front end for the customers and for us also to be able to leverage cost in our structure both in international and in the center of the organization.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Inge and David, are you able to break out the weather impacts in Q1 and if so, how much of those are permanent and how much will be recaptured in future quarters?","Inge Thulin","Well first of all, it's difficult in a way to talk about it because we are global company. So some places around the world, the weather was okay. So I think and you think about it that was some impact in United States and United States is 35% of our business.","So it's difficult for us to quantify it, but of course we had some impact of it in United States specifically and it was related to as David said, was traffic in the stores was down which had an impact on our consumer business and that was also delayed in some of the construction and specific relative to traffic, safety and road safety.","If you take road safety and traffic safety. I think that will come back. It's a timing issue, so we will get that back as we go. If you go into the combination of the lower traffic in the stores the first quarter that's maybe gone but we will compensate that in a different way, but you know we don't talk much about weather to be honest, right it's -- we are global company and the sun is always shining somewhere and that is what we need to capitalize on.","David Meline","If I can, just add briefly David. So if you will look at the US from a trend growth perspective. We saw in the second half of last year, we grew around 4.5% during that period and we've got guidance in place for the year of 3% to 6% for the US and we grew 3% in the first quarter. So it feels to us, the guidance is still right and that we will some recovery, as we move through the year.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And just lastly, of the two segments posted year-over-year or any declines in safety and consumer. Do you think they can return to earnings growth in second quarter?","David Meline","Yes, we think that we've got and outlook for both of those businesses to grow again with the average of the company for the year in the 3% to 6% and we think that their margins will operate around the company average, so that would imply some improvement in consumer and probably in the safety and graphics.","If you look seasonally, they run a little bit lower in the first quarter typically anyway. ","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Bank","Do you guys, when you think about pricing. I think 3M has a history of being pretty good on price particularly the last five years or so, but is there a trade-off that you see, a clear trade-off between price and volume. Do you have a sense, that you're giving up volume and do you have so much pricing power in most of your businesses that it's fairly immaterial that, it's more of a next issues, it's just a better product.","Inge Thulin","Yes, we don't feel at this point in time that we are giving up volume. You have to think about it in terms of our position in the market and all the new products that we are introducing, as many of them are based [specking] on platforms etc. So I will not say that, we're at this point in time or giving up anything that we are aware of and as you know, our power in terms of pricing is pretty strong.","And it's all based on, of the value of the solution that we are providing. So I think that's important, so I don't think that's a issue. If we had been, we had not continued to execute based on our strategy in that area. I think it's more in terms of you talking about growth generally speaking, is maybe in some part of in the developing world that we will add different type of products and solutions that on meeting.","I will say that, their price points and affordability in that part of the world, but that's a different discussion because that's more around the product portfolio that you're introducing in developing economies and I think that, we still have huge opportunities and as you heard, I talked about now that we have build out our capabilities with 45 customer technical centers around the world, that's exactly what we can capitalize on.","So for us, it's important to make sure that we develop product that are adding value but also affordable for that market but we still have a very high expectation relative to our margins in the company and we are not giving up on that. So you should earn your right in order to introduce products with lower margin. You have to find a different way to produce them and make sure that you get the margins that we expect and that we can prospect you as a shareholder.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Bank","Okay, that's a good answer. It seemed in this presentation as I'm looking at Slide 7. There's new emphasis not a new I should say, but at least an increased emphasis on acquisitions. You cite that, there's a line here says, multibillion dollar deals possible. When I think of 3M and your margin profile and the technology you're having.","The stuff available out there realistically that you could buy without having to pay enormous multiples and I think 3M type of assets. The things have been bid up so highly 15 to 20 times EBITDA. I mean, it would be difficult to do this types of deals. I would image but, is it realistic to it to assume that you can find things that are interesting that have the margin structure and the growth structure that you're looking for?","Inge Thulin","Well again, it's coming but first of all you're right when you correct yourself. It's not the new emphasis. We've done acquisition, quite a number of acquisitions over the years, right? I think the new one and very good thing for all of us is that based on the portfolio management, we are putting place. We get a very good profile of where we should invest first, there's a second as we move ahead.","I think the biggest acquisition 3M had done over is a $1 billion or so and in some spaces in order for us to be more relevant. We maybe need to do slightly bigger than that, as we move ahead. As you saw, we didn't execute on acquisitions last year and the reason for that was that, we couldn't find any added value for all of us, but I can tell you our pipeline is strong.","We are working it for each business and let's see what is happening as we move ahead, but in order for us to build out relevance in some cases. We have to look up interesting spaces first.","David Meline","I guess, I would also add Scott that. I mean, it would be quite unusual as you observe that we would find companies that have the type of profitability in performance that 3M, but that's very typical. We'll look at targets will identify, how we can create value by bringing them into the portfolio and leverage either technologies or brands our global distribution and when we do those transactions litmus test for us, is to become convinced ourselves that we can take a business and turn it into a 3M like performing business, which we've done very successfully over the years in a number of different instances.","So that's either the challenge or the opportunity certainly.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Bank","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Just maybe a little bit more on some of the moving parts on managing currency in the quarter. I mean, first of all, to get to this neutral position in Venezuela, did you have to take a head to get your remaining receivable out of there and then the positive price in Asia Pac, which never happens, is that an FX dynamic?","David Meline","First on Venezuela, yes we actually as I mention in the commentary. We did see a slowdown in sales and income that we generated on the ground, in that the availability of currency of imports is been pretty non-existent since already the fourth quarter. So that caused to slowdown in the business, what's also true for us as we've been able to maintain as I mentioned here neutral monetary asset position and therefore as it relates to both the local balance sheet as well as the exposure we've got from offshore.","We were able to manage through that and we don't see that being risk as we sit here today and of course things can always change, but we feel much better today than we did last time we were on the call, there months ago.","And then in Asia Pacific, could you repeat the question?","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Well, I mean price was positive in Asia Pac, which is pretty unusual, I didn't know if that was in price increase related to offsetting some type of FX or that's unrelated.","David Meline","We have had some pricing pressure in some of the countries out of experienced evaluation over the last year. So that would be a portion and what's also true right now is in a number of our product areas. The price value relationship of some of the new product, we are launching is been very strong.","So we were encouraged by the performance there this quarter. ","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Just on kind of your current assessment of the global economy. Volumes in every region except the US improved this quarter. US sounded like it was mainly weather related, are you encouraged by that? I mean do you feel like improving momentum or is it more of a comp thing. Maybe just a little more color about what you're hearing from the businesses globally and how encouraged you might be or not be?","Inge Thulin","Well I think, first of all of course encouraged in the way that the growth is, it looked like steady for us. Now if you look upon our performance here the last couple of quarters, it have improved for us right and as you say, it's going up and down in some parts of the world. I will say that, APAC it came back slightly. So APAC is, I would say the same position as we've had before.","They had a good growth in the quarter for us slightly better than Q1 and how they ended a year. West Europe grew 3%, which is equal to how they ended back 2013, so that's a 3% and it looked like the combination in Europe, what we've talked about before about North and South is not very much equalized, right.","So looked like 3% is steady growth there. Central East Europe, Middle East. I was certain Middle East, Africa had a good growth for Central East Europe slightly lower in the quarter where you could see that some business or countries did well like Turkey had higher growth rate than you saw in Russia and Poland.","United States personally, I'm not overly concerned was 3% growth for the quarter. We start at slower and came back stronger in the quarter and that's related to what David talked about relative to traffics and stores and delay in construction. Specifically in the road side for us.","So I think its look like we are going sideways slightly, up but not much, right? So I think we need, neither one but two quarters here to see, if it's moving on a high run, but as we said we are firming our growth rate for the year. So we feel, yes there you have the answer. Encouraged and I look upon it, rather better than was.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","So on health care, you're continuing to see very nice growth here in developing markets and I know in the past, you've talked about new products and penetration and all that. So maybe just, help us with, where are you in terms of penetration. How much runway do still have there and the sense of sustainability of this double-digit growth rate that you're seeing here?","Inge Thulin","Well, as you saw health care grew 6%, right? And if you separate out developed was 5% and developing 10%. And you think about the mix for us, it's like developed is almost 80% and we are 20% in developing. So already there, you have the answer relative to big opportunity in the developing world, as we move ahead.","Now we have very sophisticated solutions in our business in health care, which is one of the reason why we are able to continue to grow in developed word and to very attractive margins and the pipeline of new products is very strong for us in health care, if that's in hospital consumables with fastening systems related to our dressing business or if it's in infection prevention, we're becoming new measurements tools start that will increase the time for measuring what they're doing in the infection area by 50%.","We have a very strong pipeline of product going on there. So I will say that, think about it like developed word, we are able to continue our growth and margins due to very good added value products, which is needed in an environment where there is pressure on cost and then in the developing word for us it to, start to implement the penetration plans that we now have been working on for quite some time and in addition developed products that will meet the needs from a price perspective in some of the countries there.","They never have a problem with a quality of products, as you assume. When you look upon our Tegaderm products, or Micropore tapes or [indiscernible] products. The problem is never quality, the problem is affordability and there is different ways for us to go around that.","So we are very, we see very positive on our health care business and as you see again this quarter very good result and it's not by accident. You know, as you said business we are build out for many, many years and there is lot to come relative to our future in health care.","David Meline","I'd just add, Ajay. I think another piece of evidence that supports that is not only the consistent high level of growth, but again for example this quarter double-digit growth in a number of different countries Brazil, Mexico. If you're looking Southeast Asia, if you're looking China.","So if you saw it in one place concentrated you might be less confident but as we see it individually across all of these markets. It's very encouraging as to the opportunity and sustainability of the growth.","Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","That's good. Maybe couple clarifications on restructuring you mentioned $40 million investment in the quarter. Is that included in the $0.07 growth related investment you mentioned and then if you can help us with a full year number, what should be modeling in for restructuring?","David Meline","Yes, so the answer first of all is yes inside of the $0.07 the share, we have $40 million. It was a combination of restructuring primarily in some of our operations in Europe as well as the cost year-over-year increase of this European supply chain which as I mentioned will lap that increase, now as we get into the second quarter.","So that's piece one. Piece two is; if you look at the total of the combination of the longer term investments in R&D and business transformation plus these items of restructuring and repositioning. We expect that, we had said $0.10 to $0.20 a share for the year and as I mentioned earlier, it looks now like will be towards the high end of that $0.20 range, with some front loading in the first quarter.","So you can think about it declining somewhat, as we move through the year.","Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just two quick cleanups for me. First on electronics, you noted China, Hong Kong was kind of strong ex-electronics but your electronics performance overall actually looked okay, pretty decent. Can you just kind of reconcile those dynamics and a little more color on what's going on in the electronics part of the business?","Inge Thulin","Look upon electronics specifically relative to APAC in total. So we had 5% growth there and that business is type of moving in between countries from time-to-time. So for China and Japan specifically was type of opposite perspective. They have [coms], that in one case was easy and the other case was tough.","So easier for Japan, tougher for China so that's the answer and then this quarter specifically much more business went into Japan in terms of our sales but later converting around Asia. So that's the answer to that question. So if you take China for us, best business there was 8% growth which is slightly better than fourth quarter for us and slightly better year-on-year.","So China was okay, when you look up the total electronic markets. When we look upon semi-conductor, data storage, smartphone, notebook, tablets, T.V., etc. The market generally speaking went sideways I think in terms of volume. That, you had of course tables going up and capitalize on notebooks in terms of the volume generally speaking.","So for us, we are in all those devices with different type of levels of penetration, but that business is improving generally speaking and I would say, if you take the whole business group of the electronic and energy. You saw they had growth and they have margin expansion of 200 basis points year-on-year.","So it's we are coming around and addressing a lot of issues in that business and I'm personally very encouraged and I think that management team guys doing a super job for us addressing some of issues we've had in the past. So I think, it's good we are addressing it and they're taking care of their own destiny and I'm very pleased to see that happening.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right and just a quick one for David then also. You've initially guided your tax rate, assuming the R&D tax extenders and everything came through, it looks like they won't but you've found a way to maintain the tax rate guidance. What is going on there, is it some of the restructuring Europe maybe just a comfort level also on that tax guidance at this point?","David Meline","Yes, so if you look at the guidance we maintained the 28% to 29% for the year and that does continue to presume that we see a renewal sometime before year end of the R&D tax credit, which is worth about 40 basis points to us. So both of those we continue to foresee and then we saw some, first quarter was a little bit better than the overall full year, which was related to, we completed some prior year audits and we ended up releasing some reserves that we'd established, so that's the answer to the question.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Just again cleanups I guess, so David you mentioned roughly half of the price increases is a function of the currency weakness particularly in Latin America. So one thing about the, 110 bips benefit from price roll seeing your margin build and 50 bips from FX pinch. Is it that a phase, the impact currency net-net is neutral to margins?","Inge Thulin","No actually. And then we try to call it out, we had a net impact of FX in the quarter of 50 basis points in that.","David Meline","Nigel, if you look on the income statement Slide with the margin block, you'll see it right on there.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right, but then 110 bips from price, in some ways a function of currency and then you got pricing.","Inge Thulin","Sorry, Nigel. So the 110 is both price and raw's. Right?","David Meline","Yes.","Inge Thulin","So raw material cost for us were down around 2% year-over-year, so that contributed to the 110 and then as you correctly pointed out, as I said the portion of price that remains of that 110. It's more or less 50\/50 this quarter. So there is certainly some offset, to be honest I don't have top of mind, is it precisely a full offset. I think it's a little less than that.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","No, that's really helpful and then the second part of my question was, you talked about raw materials were down 2%. You've got to say, opposite side different mix of raw material input and most of the things as we look at so, do you expect [indiscernible] generally speaking how that raw material in nexus tracking, particularly as we go into second quarter?","And as we set on track for the roughly $0.10 of benefits from roadmaps this year?","David Meline","Yes, so that's right. So starting out. We have guided $0.05 to $0.15 of raw material cost benefit for the year versus last year. Certainly in the first quarter, we were encouraged by the performance in that area and that's a combination of not only the trends on raw materials cost themselves, but also to the extent that are efforts to identify alternative formulations to lower our raw material cost and change the composition to the extent that.","We have efforts that would actually lower the amount of raw materials in a products. These types of things are included in that performance and the good news, as our sourcing organization continues to do a really job in that area. So we feel good about the guidance on raw materials for the year.","If anything, if I were to pick it the trend. It appears to be trending towards the high end of that range for the year. ","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the look forward into the second quarter. Maybe some commentary on how April has played out so far and David, are there any dynamics we should know about specially following up on Jeff's question on tax, a bit of a benefit this year with those releases. Anything unique about the tax or corporate expense for the second quarter?","David Meline","Okay, in terms of, first one was what again? So in terms of the trends on volume in revenue. If you look, if you look at the first quarter first of all, typically March is our strongest month in that quarter, which turned out to be the case for us again this year and maybe a little bit stronger, slightly stronger than typical intra-quarter pattern.","If we look at second quarter, we feel good about the overall view that will continue to operate. We said 3% to 6% for the year, which is a mid-point of 4.5%, which is exactly where we operated if you look at the second half of last year, we ran at 4.5% first quarter. We now ran at 4.5% and we feel good about second quarter continuing at that rate.","Pluses and minuses, we've kind of inferred that we some level of optimism about the US. They're also areas of uncertainty and certainly places like Japan which is a very significant business for 3M. We did see a pull forward, it was quite clear pull forward of sales into the first quarter result of the tax increase.","So I would say pluses and minuses. April started out fine so, we feel good about stable performance for the company. In terms of taxes, we had little over 27% rate in the first quarter, which was closing out some prior year audits and included in that there was a particular case, that we benefited from where, we were able to treat as deductible assets, some assets that had been previously disallowed.","So that was a one-time occurrence for us in the first quarter which given that rate in the first quarter solidifies the view that for the year, we can operate at 28% to 29% and I don't see any unusual patterns that we would foresee quarter-by-quarter through the balance of the year.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great, that's helpful. Thank you.","David Meline","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Two quick questions; first on pricing. The currency fluctuations is notwithstanding, it still seems like you're getting 50 to 60 basis points in price and David, if I'm correct with your raw mat guidance, you're now. Do you think it's probably going to be trending towards another 50 to 60 basis points in the raw mat benefit for the remainder of the year?","So is there any reason to believe, that you're not going to get at least price cost benefit of 1 point for the remaining three quarters?","David Meline","What we expect price cost for the balance of the year. What we have guided originally was on pricing that we thought, it will be very modest for the year. Obviously, with the stronger first quarter performance significantly supported by the fact that we were having to offset foreign exchange.","We expect that pricing performance to decline through the year, but nonetheless be positive and then on the raw material side, as I have already indicated I'm expecting if we look at that $0.05 to $0.15 range we set out for the year. I'm expecting that right now as we see it will trend towards the high end of that range.","I think from that, you can probably get to the specifics that you were just asking about.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay and just a follow-up on that a little bit. You [indiscernible] 60 basis points potentially extra currency this quarter. You're continuing to invest at a higher rate on R&D, so is there any reason to believe that pricing should step down for the rest of the year. On just not thinking that.","David Meline","Yes, it's a good question. I mean we have a number of actions that are calendar year based and so what we do expect is that, we will see some decline through the year, which I why we had originally guided that. It would be modest price impact on the core base.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just one question on the buyback, it looks like the gross buyback this quarter was around $1.7 billion. I think your guidance for the year was $3 billion to $5 billion. So perhaps, one if you can just comment on what the net buyback was for the quarter and then also what would get you to maybe flex the $3 billion to $5 billion higher in the coming quarters.","David Meline","Sure. So first of all the next buyback in the first quarter was $1.4 billion against the $1.7 billion gross. If you paid attention of the trends over the last couple of years, what's happened is, we've substantially seen a reduction of the outstanding on exercised option. So that's cut about an half over the last several years.","So that will cause our net to be much closer to gross than it has been in the past. So that's one of the reasons, why we see it much closer this quarter. Secondly, in terms of the overall gross for the year. Basically the way I think about this is, if we go back to the fact that what we said we would do now, is we would move our capital structure to be better optimized going forward.","And so we are starting to allocate the capital to put that in place and that started last year as we drew on cash. This year, we've said we would increase our leverage by $2 billion to $4 billion and if you look in the first quarter with the actions that we took, our leverage went up by about $1 billion against the $2 billion to $4 billion guidance for the year.","So it's right in line what we'd indicated we would be doing and we also did modify the outlook for the year on the gross buyback to $4 billion to $5 billion from $3 billion to $5 billion based on, the fact when we add up all the pluses and minuses. We concluded that would be the right level for us here in 2014.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thank you.","David Meline","Sure.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities","Since you're open to looking at multibillion dollar acquisitions. I don't think you've ever done a hostile, but we've had this due development of using activists to facilitate big acquisitions, is that something that would be too aggressive for someone like 3M to consider?","Inge Thulin","First of all, thank you for the question. I don't think that's the way you should move forward and when you look upon those type of things. We will like to do, strategically important acquisitions that would add value for everyone involved including 3M and our shareholders and the customers that was part of that.","So I think that should be done in very careful way as we move ahead.","David Meline","Yes, if I could add. Our experience \u2013 a couple of comments there; one is we did indicate at year end that as we looked at on our own capital deployment and looked at our capability both in terms of our performance on businesses we've been acquiring in recent years as well as the integration capability that we put in place to ensure that we will continue to have good performance going forward and given the size of the company and how we are deploying capital, our conclusion was it would be appropriate for us to no limit the scope of acquisitions to say $1 billion or less, which is been the history of the company.","So hence, we indicate that we would be open to doing things larger than a $1 billion because likewise we don't like to surprise people, as we take action. So that's one piece of our thinking. In terms of the subject of hostile versus non-hostile. What I would tell you is that, one of the advantages we have as a company is typically.","When we do approach companies with the possibility of acquiring, the reaction is typically very good because 3M is known be the kind of company that invests to build businesses and therefore, we found that generally speaking the reaction is good and that's our preference to take that type of approach frankly, if you think about the culture and a company that makes sense to us.","We are about building businesses here and that's we would continue to plan to do.","John Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities","As I look across the portfolio. It seemed to me, the electronic and energy area might be the one that could benefit most from a major acquisition. Maybe the scale might help with the margin improvement, you're trying to achieve there and valuations, I would suspect a more reasonable and that's based into lot of the other competitors that have had struggles in that area over the past couple years as well.","Inge Thulin","Well, I think all five business group can benefit from actions in this area and it's an ongoing portfolio management activities that we are working on. So I will not call out, one business group over another one relative to, how we can build strings on strings in those business groups because when you look upon our strength in each of the five business group, it is very strong.","So I think in each and individual business group that will add value by us working on the portfolio management as we are doing at the time.","John Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I'll now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.","David Meline","I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. Thanks for listening. Thanks for your attention to 3M. Have a great day. Good bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

(Operator Instructions)","It is recommended that you use a landline phone if you\u2019re going to register for a question. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 25, 2013.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you and good morning. With me here today are Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer. Welcome to our second quarter business review.","Note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention a few calendar items. We will announce our third quarter earnings on Thursday, October 24th and our fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, January 30th. In addition, we\u2019ll host an Investor Meeting on the afternoon of Tuesday, December 17th at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, in Midtown, Manhattan and for calendar purposes, please plan on 1 to 5 p.m. on that day.","If you turn to slide number two, please, during today's conference call we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results.","These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","So let\u2019s begin today\u2019s review and I\u2019ll turn the program over Inge. Please turn to slide number three.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for today\u2019s call. Second quarter was another good one for 3M. We continue to grow our sales, profits and free cash flow in the face of a continued slow growth economy and a strong U.S. dollar.","Sales grew 3% year-on-year to $7.8 billion, an all-time record for any quarter in 3M\u2019s history. Organic local currency growth was 2.3% in the quarter with Health Care leading the way at 6%. Industrial and consumer each grew 3%, and safety and graphics grew 2%. In electronics and energy, sales declined 2% on an organic local currency basis.","As I told you in each of the last two quarters, we expected a challenging consumer electronics market in the first half of 2013, and our prediction was correct. We continue to anticipate some recovery in the second half of 2013 in this business.","Geographically, Latin America, Canada led way with organic growth of 9%, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East, Africa each grew 2% and the United States was up 1%. Currency impacts reduced worldwide sales by 1.3%, impacted by the weak Japanese yen. Acquisitions added nearly 2 points to second quarter growth.","Second quarter operating margins was strong at 22% on a GAAP basis or 22.4% adjusted for recent acquisitions. Earnings was $1.71 per share up 3% versus second quarter of 2012. Free cash flow in the in the quarter was $1.3 billion a second quarter record for 3M and we converted 107% on net income to cash.","Finally, in the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders via dividends and repurchases, a step up versus recent quarters. David will have more to say on this in a moment. ","Entering 2013, we anticipated slow market growth in the first half of the year and that is how it played out. I\u2019m pleased with our performance especially given this backdrop. We also expected a second half recovery based on improving macroeconomic trends and recovery in the consumer electronics. This remains our view today.","Please turn to slide number four. Looking at full year guidance, we are maintaining our previous expected earnings range of $6.60 to $6.85 per share and organic local currency sales growth of 2% to 5%. We now expected currency impact will reduce sales for the year by 2% versus the prior expected reduction of 1.5%. Acquisition should add about 1.5% of sales per year. ","As for the 2013 tax rate, we now anticipate the range of 29% to 29.5% versus a previous range of 29.5% to 30%. And we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100% for 2013.","Now I turn the call over to David for details on the quarter .","David Meline","Thank you, Inge. Let\u2019s begin with slide number 5, where I will break down the second trend in sales. We generated organic local currency growth of 2.3% on midst of continuing challenging economy. Volumes contributed 1.7% for a growth and selling prices increased 1.6%. ","Acquisitions added 1.9 points to sales growth in the quarter, the majority of which came from Ceradyne which was acquired by our industrial business in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.3 percentage points in the second quarter, largely due to a 20% year-on-year decline in the Japanese Yen versus the U.S. dollar. In Dollar terms, worldwide sales grew 3% versus the second quarter of 2012. On a geographic basis, Latin America and Canada led the way again in this quarter with organic local currency growth of 8.5%.All five of our businesses posted positive growth in this region led by double digit results in Health Care. ","Organic local currency growth Asia-Pacific was 2.2% in the second quarter, with Health Care again up double digits. Safety and graphics also had a nice growth in the quarter, China, Hong Kong, grew 3.4% organically in Q2 and Japan declined 2.3% year-on-year.","In EMEA or the combined Europe Middle East and Africa, second quarter sales increased 1.9% on an organic local currency basis. Four or five businesses posted positive growth lead by Health Care and industrial on a sub-EMEA level we achieved double digit organic growth in middle-east Africa and single digit growth in central East Europe. And organic growth turned positive in West Europe in the second quarter, which was encouraging to see after several down the quarters. ","In United States, organic local currency growth was 0.8%, growth was positive on our Health Care, industrial and consumer businesses and declined in electronics and energy and in safety and graphics.","Let\u2019s move to the income statement, please turn to slide number six. Second quarter sales were 7.8 billion up 3% in dollar terms. Our growth profit percentage was 48.3% down 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2012. Investments in SG&A and R&D both increased 5% year-on-year, operating income was $1.7 billion down 1.5%. ","Operating margins were 22%, down 90 basis points versus last year\u2019s stronger Q2 results. Included in this quarter's results was a 40 basis points headwind from acquisition therefore underlying Q2 margins worth 22.4%. Profit leverage on organic volume growth added 20 basis points to second quarter operating margins and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 80 basis points.","In addition, lower year-on-year pension and OPEB expenses added 10 basis points to second quarter margins. Factory utilization reduced margins by 50 basis points, an improvement versus the first quarter and largely in line with our expectations. Strategic investments impacted margins by 40 basis points. This represents our ERP and business transformation effort along with more R&D aimed at disruptive innovation. Both will strengthen 3M for the future.","Finally, the combination of foreign exchange impacts, the recently enacted medical device tax in the U.S. and other factors reduced margins by 70 basis points year-on-year. Second quarter earnings were $1.71 per share, up 3% versus the second quarter of 2012. The second quarter tax rate improved to 27.4% versus 30.1% last year which added $0.06 to earnings and foreign exchange impacts reduced second quarter earnings by $0.02 per share.","Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow, turn to slide number seven. Second quarter operating cash flow rose by $290 million year-on-year or 21% to $1.7 billion. The increase was due primarily to lower pension and OPEB contributions along with improved working capital. We invested $394 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $36 million versus the second quarter of last year.","For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.6 to $1.8 billion. Free cash flow rose by $254 million or 25% to $1.3 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 107% in Q2, a 19 point improvement versus the second quarter of 2012 and we continued to expect conversion of 90% to 100% for the full year.","Cash dividends paid were $436 million in the second quarter, up $26 million year-on-year. As a reminder, we increased the per share dividend by 8% this past February. This marks 55 consecutive years of dividend increases and the company has now paid a cash dividend for 96 consecutive years.","Gross share repurchases were $1.2 billion in the quarter, up $551 million compared to Q2 of 2012. And as Inge mentioned a step-up versus recent quarters, we now anticipate a range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of gross repurchases for the full year 2013, versus a prior expectation of $2 billion to $3 billion.","We are increasing this range for a few reasons. One, our business is operating well and generating substantial free cash flow which we expect will continue. Two, rising interest rates are positively impacting our already well funded pension status. Three, we did not close any new acquisitions in the first half of 2013. And finally, our capital structure is already strong today and we do not intend to strengthen it further.","Let\u2019s review in more depth our second quarter performance on a business-by-business basis starting with industrial. Please go to slide number eight. Second quarter sales were $2.7 billion in industrial, up 3.3% on an organic local currency basis.","Growth was strongest in the aerospace and automotive aftermarket businesses followed by liquid filtration, industrial adhesives and tapes and automotive OEM. Sales in industrial grew organically in all major geographic regions with Latin America and Canada up 9%, the U.S. and EMEA up 3%, and APAC up 2%. In November of 2012, we acquired Ceradyne, Inc one of the leading ceramics companies in the world. Ceradyne\u2019s sales were $116 million in the second quarter which added 4.6% to industrial growth and the business was profitable on a GAAP basis. We are pleased thus far with the integration effort and look forward to continued success in this business. Second quarter operating income was $599 million and reported margins were 22.5%. Exact positions industrial operating margins were 23.2%.","Now let\u2019s move to safety and graphics, turn to slide nine. Second quarter sales were $1.5 billion up 2% on an organic local currency basis. We generated a positive organic growth in commercial graphics, personal safety products, architectural markets and building and commercial services. Sales declined organically in the roofing granules business and in traffic safety and security systems. On a geographic basis organic local currency sales rose 9% in Latin America, Canada, 7% in Asia Pacific and 1% EMEA. The US declined 3% in the quarter. The FSTech acquisition added 1.1% growth in the quarter and the business is on track to meet its top and bottom line targets in 2013. We\u2019re aggressively integrating this business to capture significant cost and sales synergies. FSTech increases our relevance in the large highway infrastructure market and is the natural growth (inaudible) for a reflected sheeting and pavement marking business. Operating income in safety and graphics was $333 million and operating margins were showing 22.9% against the very tough comp of 25.9% in the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, second quarter of 2000 operating margins were 23.8% and we\u2019re investing to accelerate growth in this business particularly in personal safety in our recently formed mining, oil and gas business. ","Next up is electronics and energy found on slide 10. In electronics and energy sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter down 2% in organic local currency terms. Operating income was $237 million and margins were 17.7%. As we anticipated margins were down year-on-year, but importantly showed nice improvement versus the 15.3% margin that we posted in the first quarter. Organic local currency sales declined slightly on the electronics side, consumer electronics and market demand has been fairly tepid throughout the first half of the year, but by and large the market seems to have stabilized and the third quarter sales should show recovery. End market inventories were heavy at year end and have improved as the first half has progressed with some modest [overwriting] still remaining in the hand held space. ","And energy sales declined 4% in the second quarter. Our heartland electrical markets business had positive organic growth and continued to perform very well in Q2. This growth was more than offset by declines in other energy related businesses. Renewable energy in particular posted a double digit sales decline in the quarter, this market continues to seek a bottom which is impacting our growth. While we do see sales stabilizing in the second half and the comps begin to ease. We\u2019ve been actively working to repurpose these assets for other 3M businesses where we anticipate growth. On a geographic basis organic local currency sales increased slightly in Latin America, Canada and declined in other regions. ","Please go to slide 11. Health Care had another excellent quarter posting the highest organic growth and the highest operating margins amongst our five business segments. Sales totaled $1.3 billion up 6% on organic local currency basis. We continue to see broad based growth across much of the Health Care portfolio including health information systems, food safety, critical and chronic care, oral care and infection prevention. Sales in Health Care grew organically in all geographic regions, led by double-digit performances in both Latin America\/Canada and Asia-Pacific.","Health Care second quarter organic sales growth was 15% in developing markets on top of 13% in the first quarter. These are highly promising growth sectors for 3M and we continue to funnel investment dollars towards them and we\u2019re encouraged to see the positive results. In developed markets Health Care grew 8% organically in Japan and 3% in both U.S. and Western Europe.","Operating income rose 1% to $417 million and margins were again strong at 31.2%. The recently enacted U.S. medical device tax was a 40 basis point drag on Q2 operating margins.","Finally, let's review the Consumer business found on slide number 12. Consumer also delivered a good second quarter, sales were $1.1 billion, up 3% on an organic local currency basis.","Profits rose 4% to $235 million and operating margins rose 40 basis points year-on-year to 21.4%. We grew organically across the Consumer portfolio most notably in Consumer Health Care where ACE and FUTURO brands showed particularly good growth in the second quarter.","We also posted positive organic local currency growth in our home care, stationery and office and do-it-yourself businesses. Q2 is when we begin to see the impact of a back-to-school season and growth thus far has been encouraging. We have good placement in promotional programs in place and we\u2019re seeing some sales lift from our newly introduced family of Scotch Expressions Tapes.","From a geographic perspective, organic sales growth was 7% in Latin America\/Canada, 4% in Asia-Pacific and 2% in the U.S. Growth was slightly positive in EMEA.","In developing markets, the Consumer business grew 7% in organic local currency in Q2. Like Health Care, Consumer is one of our most significant growth opportunities in developing markets, as retail sectors expand along with the growing middle class. Developed markets grew 2% organically.","That wraps up the detailed outlook of the second quarter. Now, I will turn the call back over to Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, David. Before we take your questions, I want to highlight our progress on several strategic fronts. Let\u2019s start first with a brief update on the integration of Ceradyne, which we acquired in November of 2012.","Sales and profit exceeded expectations for the quarter, very good results and strong evidence of our progress. You\u2019ll recall that earlier this year Ceradyne was awarded a $40 million plus order for protective armor plates. We saw some positive sales in fact from this win in the second quarter.","Let me also give some comments on our portfolio management efforts and our R&D investments. We are continuing to strengthen our portfolio through better product our decision and by addressing underperforming businesses.","For example, recently we announced a consolidation of our infrastructure protection division which or has been under strategic review into the electronic market division. We expect to gain rapid cost synergies as we increase the scale and efficiency on the newly combined entity. In addition, this division share common end markets such as construction, electrical utilities and electrical equipment manufacturing.","Back in May, we announced the sale of our fly fishing equipment business to Orvis. This is a good business and the market leader in its space, but it has no relevance to become important in the broader 3M portfolio.","We\u2019re also making good progress in identifying new and promising technology programs. As you may recall, we\u2019re planning to increase investments in longer term disruptive technologies, aimed at opportunities with significant growth potential. We formed a review team call the 3M Innovation Board, comprised by myself, David, our Chief Technology Officer and our Head of Corporate Strategy. The team meets quarterly to review milestone progresses and previously approved programs and to screen new investment ideas. I\u2019m very encouraged of what I have seen so far. ","Finally, we continue to move to move resources to our businesses with most promising growth opportunities. A great example is Health Care where the end markets continue to grow nicely and our technology and market positions gave us strong relevance with our customers.","Consumer is another example, where retail markets in developing economies are now beginning to develop. And we\u2019re actively prioritizing our (inaudible) to ensure that they have the resources they need to improve their already strong market positions.","In summary, first half conditions were challenging and 3M executed very well under the circumstances. We anticipate demand recovery in the second half of the year with some help from both the macro economy and the consumer electronics markets. And we remain focused on driving productivity and executing our plan with strong discipline.","Thank you for your attention. We will now take your questions and comments. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","","Thank you. Good morning every one. ","Inge Thulin","","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","","I\u2019d like to start off on geographies and maybe comment on the significance and we haven\u2019t seen this on a while, but central Europe are showing stronger growth than the U.S., it is just the easier comps, but maybe just give us a sense of what you are seeing in Europe now?","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Deane. You asked specific about central East Europe, where we have had a good base for quite some time as you know as we have built out our businesses then. We see continued good growth driven by specifically Russia, Turkey and Poland, but also a lot of that of smaller countries there are doing well. ","So I think its broad based for us and I\u2019m personally not surprised, I was (inaudible) visiting here, actually, this last quarter a couple of companies, including Russia. And it\u2019s very encouraging what we see in the marketplace then. Again, our portfolio have been build out with very much industrialist base, in that part of the world and now we see an increase in our businesses that\u2019s going into safety related businesses, but also health space taking off very well for us. ","So I will say that, it\u2019s not a surprise for us. It\u2019s in fact encouraging as we have moved out our portfolio. And we have also made some investments that actually the last ten years or so relative to local capabilities both in terms of converting and manufacturing and now research and development. So we have a big place over there in Poland, in Rock Club, where we utilize a lot of capacity in order to serve that part of the world and recently as you maybe recall on the last quarter, we talked about, we\u2019re are now open also central excellence for logistics in Turkey, that overtime will service a breaching between central East Europe and middle East Africa.","So it\u2019s very encouraging for us and we would like to be bigger there and as you are talking about central East Europe and middle East Africa, also middle East Africa had very good growth for us in the quarter. That\u2019s from a lower base, but basically all countries there grew, except, we have a little bit slower growth in South Africa, due un-stability in that country, so overall very good.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","The commentary, same commentary for Western Europe?","Inge Thulin","Western Europe, first of all, we saw very, very slight growth for the first time in eight quarters which was encouraging for us. And the way we look upon it, we try to separate the in-between north and south, and in north are growing slightly better than in south. And I would say in terms of when you look upon the countries, I would say Germany was basically going sideways on a lower level. And we had little bit better growth in U.K. up to 5% to 6% in that country.","And north for us will be identified as Nordic U.K., Germany, Benelux and also Alpine as the Alpine countries. So they depend on Germany. So it\u2019s on a lower level, going sideways but at least was encouraging to see that for the first time in eight quarter, so slight, slight growth on that part of the world. And as we have talked about earlier, we have really worked on the back -- back end of the organization in order to streamline that combined regions and try to manage their cost in the backend of the operation.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Thanks. And last one for me on safety and graphics, you have called out roofing granules and traffic safety and the slide also security but how would you split out the margin declined year-over-year across those three businesses?","Inge Thulin","I think there is three components there. You have, one-third is related to the FSTech acquisition. One-third is related to the decline in government-related project businesses and specifically into, say, road safety. And then finally, we are making some strategic investment in that business into mining oil and gas and to personal safety.","The personal safety is a Heartland division for us and heading the quarter 6% growth and we\u2019re continuing to invest there. So those are the three elements of that business. And if you take out FSTech that business had an operating income of almost 24% in the quarter, 23.8%. So very good in our view even if it was a decline versus last year but not any major concern.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Great. Thank you.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks and good morning all.","Inge Thulin","Good morning.","David Meline","Good morning.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","I just want to follow-up Deane\u2019s questions geographically on the U.S. specifically was 2.3% last quarter, 0.8% this quarter, 0.7% volume. Just give us a sense for that slowdown specifically, if you could?","Inge Thulin","Yeah. I think when we look upon where we had solid growth, was in Health Care, industrial and consumer. So I think it was more relative base comparison and very much into some specific businesses that is, was related to government businesses as I talked earlier about and from safety and graphics business, very much related to road safety. And then we had also the granule business that I would say was an inventory correction for the whole industry that happened for that business specifically.","We had a relatively good consumer business and a good back to school selling which I think was -- yeah that segment was up almost 10% as we roll into the quarter. Now, we have to look upon the sell out as we know as go into the rest of the year.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then, second question, when we look at pricing across the different geographies and you see Latin America 6.1% versus the volume of 2.4%. And I presume much of that as inflation driven. I mean, can you give us a sense for how much you think is inflation versus just other kind of pricing power. I mean, obviously you are exhibiting a lot of pricing power there. It would be helpful to understand this?","David Meline","Yeah. Interesting therefore I can comment. So if you look at and correctly a significant part of our reported price in the quarter was driven by Latin America, which is -- it was already up in the first quarter and we saw a little bit higher this quarter. And that\u2019s largely being driven by the fact that we have some of the currencies in several countries as well as inflation has been picking up, so what you see is the businesses are reacting to that to make sure we\u2019re preserving our profitability and it\u2019s in an environment where we\u2019re able to -- with the good brand positioning we have we\u2019re able to put through those prices and still deliver growth in the region. ","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay and sorry just one more. The 40 basis point to strategic investment margin headwind, I mean how long should we -- should we speak about building that into our forecast?","David Meline","Yeah, I would say that the strategic investments for doing those as I mentioned earlier specifically related to our ERP business transformation which will go on for several years. Now, on year-over-year basis we expect that the phenomena you see this year will continue certainly through the end of this year and in the case of the innovation spend we\u2019re starting to see that picking up somewhat as we get into these approved programs. So I think from a planning perspective at least through this year you should expect that kind of investment level on a year-over-year basis and then as we get into next year\u2019s planning we\u2019ll give you guys an update as to what to think about that.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Good morning, everyone.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Hey, David maybe -- can you just engage sort of an update on EPS contribution to now going forward from shares, tax, pension because you\u2019ve been buying back more shares, you\u2019ve got lower share calendar now that still goes lower and I imagine your pensions move ahead with interest rates. So maybe just engage what we should expect in terms of EPS (inaudible) from those?","David Meline","Yeah, so if you look at pensions what you would observed as we\u2019ve called out few of the impact on margin in the first half. If you look at first quarter, second quarter that\u2019s added about point -- 3 points to the margins in the first half and you should expect that to continue through the balance of the year. Obviously as you start then looking forward into the future if we stay in this kind of an interest rate environment you\u2019ll start to see our expense further decline as we talked about last November. If you look at share counts correctly we\u2019ve up the amount that we would intend to buyback this year and so I think you can calculate the figures. But we will see some reduction in share count impacting the second half, but as do the averaging level the increase that we see in the actual buyback in the second half will have a bigger impact next year than this. So we\u2019ll see some pickup in the second half.","Inge Thulin","One thing that I would add to that Shannon is foreign exchange was a headwind in the first half to the tune of about $0.3 a share and that will get a little bit separate in the second of the year, when it would be closer to about a nickel in the second half.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","And how should we interpret the share repurchase in terms of what drove your decision to increase it and this is reset to a higher range or is this just a one off?","David Meline","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question. So as I tried to call out for your -- in deciding how to proceed on that, we first and foremost look at how the business is running and certainly we\u2019re pleased with the performance of the business now and we think that we\u2019ll continue in the context of both the health of our business and the economy. Secondly the pension plans, we\u2019ve been -- obviously with the tick up in interest rates, if you look at our funding position -- funded position, at midyear we were about 94% funded globally in all of our plans versus 87% in year end. So (inaudible) that to continue that will be some easing on the demand for capital in that area which factors into our decision making and then as I also mentioned acquisitions we did not deploy in the first half. We continue to expect to and would guide to a billion to two this year, but inevitably timing is very difficult to call and certainly in this lower interest grade environment we\u2019re seeing that finding transactions where we can create value for 3M has been more difficult for us recently. So that will factor into our thinking on sources and uses of cash.","And then finally, as I mentioned, the capital structure of the company, we think is certainly very strong and is adequate, and we wouldn\u2019t foresee strengthening it further. So add those pieces up, look at how those evolve that will inform us as to what kind of planning will do in terms of our buyback activity going forward.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Just to clarify on the tax and pension, do you still, tax is coming in lower this year, do you still expect it to go lower in \u201914 and do you have a read on what pension payment would be at this point in \u201914?","David Meline","Yeah. Sure. So that\u2019s right. So we guided tax to 29% and 29.5%, which is more in line with the tax rates that we had last year. Everything we see and again we are just now in the update of our long-term plan, we just started that. But we would foresee, we had indicated last year that by the end of the year period we would expect our rate to be in the neighborhood of 27% and I don't have any reason right now to things that would change as to the year-by-year precise amounts that something we will have to refine here as we go through the balance of the year.","And in terms of pensions, yeah, I mean, as you know, it's a very significant consideration for 3M. We have very significant obligations and we\u2019ve absorbed over the last five years an increase in our annual pension expense cumulatively of $550 million.","This year our pension expense versus last year has declined by $100 million and given the very strong funded position we have which is improving, given the fact that we\u2019ve now transitioned our workforce globally such that we are moving increasingly into defined contribution type profiles, considering very good return on assets, we\u2019ve been generating over recent years. And then finally, rising interest rates would cause us to expect expenses to decline. So if you were to close the year today, what we would think is that we\u2019d have $100 million or more decline in an expense next year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Inge Thulin","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan","Hey. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning.","David Meline","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan","Can you maybe just talk about any update to the price cost forecast for the year, it\u2019s kind of in line with the first quarter, there is some obviously some inflation driven price your are getting in Latin America pricing was better. So just maybe talk about that for the second half?","David Meline","Sure. In terms of the price cost, we\u2019d indicated that, we expected some price improvement initially which were then decline as we walk through the year, and that continues to be our view on an overall basis. So we have some price performance in the first half here which was primarily driven by increases we took during the year last year, so naturally that would be declining as we move into the second half.","In terms of the other piece of price which is, is inflation in foreign exchange driven that we\u2019ll have to see how things develop. But I would say that you could expect that we would continue to have a positive contribution there which would then be enabling us to offset the negative impacts of exchange.","Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan","Okay. So the price cost spread which I think you said we are going to be kind of plus or minus this year for the year is now better than, it\u2019s now more favorable\u2026","David Meline","Yeah. I mean.","Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan","\u2026 (inaudible) so far.","David Meline","Yeah. Sure. Price cost we expect will continue to decline quarter-by-quarter but it would be more favorable then what we had initially indicated at beginning of the year.","Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan","Got you. And now you in-- are you in position to put through, this year with raw materials in the economy, are you in position to get more price this year like you have in previous years, like another unusual kind of step up like you had maybe year ago or is it more normal this year.","Inge Thulin","Right. Yeah. From a planning perspective we don\u2019t, other than specific situations where you got exchange or inflation driven price movements, we don\u2019t right now have particular plans to be driving price. Certainly, to the extent which is normally what we drive to where we have significant and fresh products and good brand positioning, we have these (inaudible) but in the current cost environment our thinking is, is that steady as you go is the right poster for the company.","Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan","","Got you. One last quick one, I think can you maybe comment on what you are seeing in Latin America, lot of cross occurrence in the economy there, maybe if you could just talk about how you see the second half playing out?","Inge Thulin","","Well, we are optimistic relative to the second half and has David has comments, relative to the relation of organic growth and price for the first and second quarter, we are on plan relative to execution, we see a slight uptick coming in Brazil first, which is good, it\u2019s the biggest subsidiary for us down there. ","And as you know what we have talked about before, we have a very broad based both portfolio and probably did best balance portfolio in only part of the world, in Latin America. And we have execution capabilities across world countries. So we see it a very positive for the rest of the year as well. And as I said, as we are being in that part of the world since 1946 and it\u2019s the -- I would say the role model relative to us, how to build out businesses in developing economies and I\u2019ve done very well, we feel good not only for the rest of this year, but for many years to come.","And as you know, that business for us is as sizable as China and it\u2019s growing faster and it\u2019s very, very profitable. So we are optimistic about Latin America as we go ahead as we go ahead. In fact, I think, there are some acceleration for us for the rest of the year and beyond. ","Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Great, thanks.","Inge Thulin","","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys, good morning. ","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Andrew.","David Meline","","Good morning.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Just a question on your Share buyback. Can you just tell us on net basis, should you increase the buyback, versus the previous expectations, right, because the stock has gone well, I\u2019m just wondering where did options go?","David Meline","Right. So if you look at the reissuances that we expect to occur during the year, I think, we had originally guided, $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And right now, it looks to us like it will be at or slightly above the high end of that range. So think about a billion and half, maybe slightly above that, depending on what happens from the balance of the year. So if you then think about net, the 3.5 to 4.5 would imply somewhere approaching $2 billion to $3 billion net versus the original guidance of $1 to $1.5 billion.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much. And second question on electronics and energy. If you look at sequential improvement, how sustainable it is going to the second half and what leverage do you still have left to first sort of to get this business improving in the absence of a recovery in electronic side. ","David Meline","","First of all, it\u2019s as you comment yourself, it\u2019s stabilized relative to first quarter. So we had -2 and -2, so basically you can say stabilized in terms of the growth on a lower level for us. You can see that we improved margins and that\u2019s the result went from 15.3 to 17.7 sequentially. And that\u2019s based on mixed improvement and better utilization. And you can also see the picking action here relative to our portfolio management, we have recently announced some combination of the couple of divisions where we then would drive cost and synergy in the backdrop is well, still capitalized on the front end. ","Now it\u2019s clear as we have said earlier that, we\u2019re counting on the pickup in consumer electronic in the second part of the year and we see small evidence of that as we move into Q3 here. And we based out of course on what we see our (inaudible) on platforms. So I will say that we are on plan relative to that business, we need to see a big pickup in consumer electronics. But the way we look at on that, we see what we\u2019re expecting, we see that that's coming in our order flow for Q3. And then what will drive that for the rest of the year is of course, end market demand, right, which is where we are sitting still a little bit of difficult for us to see but we -- that\u2019s how we are planning for now.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Can you continue to improve margin on the electronic side in the absence of growth?","David Meline","Yeah. We can.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Thanks, guys. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning.","David Meline","Good morning.","Scott Davis - Barclays","I know it maybe hard to answer this specifically, but when you think about, Inge, the investments that you\u2019ve made in R&D and also just in the core businesses and the changes you have made in, at what point do you see that inflection, do you think where you start to outgrow global GDP, even the last couple of years you have been growing pretty much in line with pretty sluggish global GDP. But I would imagine there has to be a point where you start to show some -- some real progress. Can you give us a sense of -- I just said 2014, can you -- can we see it this year, is it more like 2015, just give us a bit of sense of what you think?","Inge Thulin ","Well, first of all I would say that we have outperformed the IPI lately. Right, so you look upon last quarter, you see this quarter, we have outperformed IPI just to make that clear because I think you said that we had not, right, in line, I think we outperformed. So we are pleased with that and just to give in perspective, at least while I am sitting, I am pleased that we have shown three quarters in a row organic local currency growth, right.","So we had Q4 last year, Q1 and now Q2. So that\u2019s first the baseline that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking upon. So that\u2019s very encouraging. Now, when you make those shifts as we are doing, right, there is a couple of strategic shift in the company. Portfolio management is a level for us and is an important one. And as I talked about earlier we are -- we have put that in place. We are very serious about it. We are on that the whole time. That\u2019s an important level.","And the second one is our investment in research and development, which is very much at this point in time, relative to disruptive technologies that will have a longer term outcome. However, in that pipeline, there is some project that I believe that we will be able to commercialize in the middle of next year.","So I think the way the piece is moving for us, it is difficult to say exactly a time but you know I think that we should -- 12 to 18 months from now, we should start to see the traction of the moves that we are doing. And those elements here that are very important that all in order for us to strengthen the company as we go ahead. And I think as I said and David talked to earlier about our ERP initiative, as you think about the level for us is portfolio management, it is research and development, and then it is investment in ERP.","Those three put together will strengthen the company as we move forward. But you know we start to see -- I start to see good progress on the growth side, but I am still not happy. Let me say it I am still not happy but I can see that we start to take market share and we are doing very well specifically in the Heartland division start to really get some good traction and automotive aftermarket this quarter was very good. And that again is related to us to be able to take market share and penetrate better on the world.","The same I talked about personal safety, we had 6% growth in a big very profitable division for us that has the brand equity and the position around the world. So, I think that you see the focus we have got around the Heartland divisions has helped us in order to grow and is based on both taking market share and to improve penetration.","And then at we look upon the businesses that have underperformed, that will over time help us to accelerate growth in those, what we call push forward at our businesses that are very good, very strong for us using multiple technologies but have a relatively smaller size based on their market but those markets are growing faster. So, I don\u2019t know if it is helping you, but at least\u2026","Scott Davis - Barclays","I understand.","David Meline","It\u2019s not the direction where we\u2019re going.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Yeah, now I think the answer is actually very comprehensive in what you said about to be level in M&A is very relevant too. So as a follow up, you talked about M&A just because it is so important for a company that generates as much cash as you do to either have an outside buyback program or an outside M&A program. But what is your buy as is it relates to the type of things you want to buy? In your tenure we\u2019ve seen -- obviously if you buy Ceradyne, the (inaudible) fell through, these are fairly low growth assets, I mean is this -- are there emerging technologies that you\u2019re -- that you\u2019re looking at or is it more matured companies, I mean, just give us a sense of what we could expect out of M&A and the type of assets going forward?","David Meline","I think I\u2019ll go back and repeat what I\u2019ve said earlier relative to -- you should expect slightly bigger than you\u2019ve seen in the past for the last five to six years. We did a, 60 to 70 acquisitions the last six years or so, many of them were very small and in geographical areas that was way out and was maybe in some cases difficult for us to lever from a execution perspective on the global base. So I think you should see acquisitions that are slightly bigger than in the past and you should see acquisitions that we should be able to lever and scale on a global base ideally and for sure on the regional base. And if there is a technology as part of it that will be very, very interesting. ","And I think that was exactly what Ceradyne gave us. Ceradyne had a good solid front end in terms of business, but in addition there was a technology played at the very important for us that we can lever over many divisions in the company. So I think that\u2019s what you should think about. And that\u2019s also why the portfolio work that we\u2019re doing is so important, but across business as we go also be able for us to categorize the businesses and look upon opportunities as you go ahead. So we have a very active pipeline and as you know that we\u2019re looking upon them from different perspective and -- but I think you should think about it in the way of slightly big than the past, should be -- faster growing on average for the company will be ideally and then a technology piece of it will really be good because that\u2019s what we\u2019re all about, so we can leveraged around many, many divisions in the company due to the fantastic vertical integrated model we have both in research and development and manufacturing and the subsidiary strength.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","So as it relates to organic growth, you did maintain your organic growth guidance for the year, yet outside of industrial and facing graphics counts do get harder across your segments in the second half. And in the midpoint, your guidance essentially implies an acceleration beyond the easing count. So my first question is were there any changes to the segment level growth expectations based on what you reported today and maybe you can talk a little bit about your confidence on hitting that second half organic growth guidance?","David Meline","Sure, so if you looked at the guidance that we\u2019ve offered, which is maintaining the two to five for the year, which is what we\u2019ve had in place whole year. We had expected and that continues to be our view that we would see a second half that improves from the first, so no difference there. If you then look at the sector level, we gave guidance on the sectors at the beginning of the year for the whole year and generally we expect to be operating within those levels and those ranges. If there\u2019s any area where we have a -- the biggest question that specifically has been in years on electronics and energy, so if you think of our range for the year operating to the low end of that range would be in an environment where we wouldn\u2019t see any pick up in the economy, we wouldn\u2019t see any pick up in the electronics and energy space, which is not the environment that we\u2019re presently expecting. To operate towards the high end of that range for the year it would, as Inge was talking about, it would require not only the improvements that we\u2019re foreseeing in the third quarter in the electronics, consumer electronics space, but it would also foresee some additional economic pickup generally which is certainly not out of line with economic forecasts that are out there.","And secondly, it would require pretty robust end-market demand in areas like general consumer, so think about a good sale out for the holiday season and then specifically in the consumer electronics business.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful color David. And maybe one question for Inge on Ceradyne specifically. It seems like things went well in the second quarter, still behind plan for the first half of the year on the sales side, but doing better on EBITDA.","My question is really around the technology platform and the uses of that platform across your other divisions. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity there and whether you\u2019re starting to deploy it across to some of the other 3M divisions.","Inge Thulin","Yeah. We do and I think it\u2019s very much aligned relative to the synergies we see with different division. I think at this point in time 13 -- I think its 13 or 15 division that see that they can utilize the technologies that came in from Ceradyne. So we purchased the company and move it into one division and industrial. I think beyond that now there is a team in place that\u2019s looking upon the opportunities across businesses.","And I think it\u2019s from the business groups where basically three of the five are very much involved. And I think its 13, let say, its 13 division I think it maybe 13 to 15 that see the opportunities in their different spaces. So it\u2019s we\u2019re very, very encouraged actually what we see then and Fred Palensky, our CTO, is very encouraged what we\u2019ve seen and he was very pleased even before we did acquisition.","So I think we\u2019ll be able to talk about it more later when we see some specific programs coming out of the pipeline, but we\u2019re very pleased. And as I said, that acquisition maybe different in the way that was not only for us to purchase a position in the marketplace but also to get build out the technology platform that we had already in ceramics make it broader and deeper and then be able to kept for life which is what 3M is very good at.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you very much.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your question.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning.","David Meline","Good morning.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets","Maybe just on Health Care service, it\u2019s very nice to see your highest margin business also your fastest growing and we\u2019ve seen that for the last couple quarters now. So maybe talk about what you\u2019re seeing there, what\u2019s driving that growth? I know you\u2019re seeing very high growth rates in the developing market. So talk a little bit about sustainability, especially given what we\u2019re seeing on the macro side on the developing country. So one, what\u2019s your outlook is and then also implications for margins.","Inge Thulin","Yeah. First of all, when you think about that portfolio, 78% of that portfolio is today in developed economies. So you have 22% in the developing, if you look upon that portfolio from our perspective in Health Care. So that\u2019s indicating that we\u2019ve a very strong position in the developed world based on the value proposition coming out from those businesses through our base.","So that\u2019s a very strong position to be in and we are growing in the developed world as well. We\u2019ve 3% growth in the developed world. So think about that. That\u2019s just indicating that the value proposition that we\u2019re providing to our customers are very strong.","In the developing world, the growth was 15% in the quarter. And as we\u2019ve talked about earlier, we build out our businesses in the developing world, there is now the opportunity also for developed solutions in that part of the world.","And I think, hopefully, you remember the way that we described how we build out the business staring with infrastructure, manufacturing, safety, retail and the finally Health Care.","In many countries, we are now coming to that point in the end relative to Health Care and in fact, Health Care is going ahead of retail in many ways relative to the execution of our plan because there is a different type of network from key opinion leaders for Health Care versus in consumer, which is brand equity that is a key element here to be successful. So that -- I think, that\u2019s the reason for us that we have growth. We have growth both in developed and developing world, the value proposition is strong in both places. We have made investments for many years into the developing world in order to be ready for execution as that the programs are coming. ","And we are able to show here that it\u2019s sustainable relative to margins and maybe (inaudible) said earlier, we should run that business overtime in the high 20s, but we\u2019ll be running it above 30 and we\u2019re still running it above 30. So that\u2019s despite that we are building out of capabilities very much relative to the execution of the programs, which means coverage in the marketplace. ","And we are very efficient manufacturing a model there as well, where we\u2019re able to utilize both two huge centers around the world for manufacturing, but also many smaller converting facilities. So it\u2019s a very good business for us. We\u2019re doing very well and we are very pleased. And this is not -- it\u2019s not by accident helping planned for long time for the team here in order to come up to this position.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets","","Of course, it\u2019s a very nice business and it tells that it\u2019s also your highest margin business, so good work there, maybe one question for David on utilization. So it\u2019s still a headwind, how should we think about that for the rest of the year, does that headwind come down as you allocate those assets to other businesses or is that more related to volume coming back in electronics. ","David Meline","Yeah, so Ajay, I would say generally the trend we are working towards obviously is the fully utilized all of our assets. So we\u2019re driving to get better utilization and obviously as we always are. We see some good progress here. So as I talked about last quarter, a couple of sources of that underutilization related to some businesses and renewable energy and one of our automotive areas where we had some inventory overhang, so that largely been addressed. ","What\u2019s true for us is, is that the renewable space will continue to be an area that we\u2019re working through to identify exactly what are the prospects for the business going forward, how do we best participate there to offer technology solutions and also generate a return to the company. And that\u2019s probably going to take us into 2014 to come to some final solution. ","So we will have some issues that we\u2019ll continue to deal with for the foreseeable future, but I think as you\u2019ve already seen, we\u2019re starting to get our arms around it and certainly the trend should continue to be down.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","","This is very quick one. As I know we\u2019ve gone over. As you look at the ramp in your R&D investments in these new areas you are looking at investing in, is there an implication that in a few year result, there could be a step up in the CapEx cycle for the company for some reason or is it all going to be roughly the same capital intensity as the business with the business as you are already in?","David Meline","","Sure. Yeah. I would say Laurence, in terms of our outlook for capital, as you would know, where we do the play capital at a level which is typically higher than the average peer, which is an outgrowth of the very significant level of vertical integration that the company has, because a lot of our technology is proprietary and know how that we want to preserve and therefore to do that when it\u2019s in the manufacturing process area, we feel the best strategy is to do it ourselves. ","So we\u2019re quite vertically integrated and that will continue. In terms of does the step up in investment in R&D imply an increase in our CapEx? Right now we don\u2019t foresee that to be the case, but quite honestly we have to monitor how that progresses, because we -- there is a bunch of thing we\u2019re working on that we haven\u2019t fully developed yet. But I would say if I look over a longer period of time, I wouldn\u2019t expect that there is some implied step-up in our CapEx.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","Thank you.","Inge Thulin","Yeah.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in here. Again a couple of quick ones from me, just return to the margin which -- this is probably for David. The impact of FX, just one concern that\u2019s the transactional impact of U.S. export?","David Meline","That is a -- yeah, it is.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. And then, maybe just a quick updates on where we are on $2.5 billion of, I guess, restructuring portfolio. You\u2019ve made a couple of actions in terms of one business in the [E&E] and the 3D business back in earlier this year. Just wondering where we are in terms of progress on that $3.5 million?","David Meline","We have made some progress. And as I said, we have not put a timeline on it as that\u2019s difficult to do when you do business as you know in terms of what needs to be done. But we are focusing in on them and you have seen now probably three actions that have been taken relative to make sure that we improved in precision. We sold off one business and we have combined two and in fact, we\u2019re harvesting fourth one.","So that\u2019s an ongoing process and we take it very seriously. So there is not a timeline on it by definition but what I have said to you and I have said internally, you cannot stay in that category for long. And so we are working on it and we are also doing the right thing in order for us to evaluate the right precision for those businesses as we move ahead.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","And could you talk little about billion dollars of action is taken in those four businesses so far?","Inge Thulin","In terms of the portion of the businesses and the revenue impact?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yeah.","Inge Thulin","That\u2019s in the ballpark.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Great. Thanks guys.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.","Matt Ginter","This is Matt. I\u2019ll just say thanks to everybody for joining us for your questions.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Business Review. With me today are Inge Thulin, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, let me mention 3 upcoming investor events. First, as a reminder, we're hosting an investor meeting here in the Twin Cities on Thursday, November 8. If you plan to attend and have not yet responded, please RSVP right away. Second, on December 12, from 8:30 to 10:00 a.m. Central Time, we will host a conference call and webcast specifically addressing our 2013 financial outlook. Look for an invitation shortly. And third, our next Earnings Conference Call will take place on Thursday, January 24, of 2013.","One more item of note, we recently announced a realignment of our major business groups to better serve our global markets and customers. As we described in our October 3 press release, segment reporting for the new organization will begin in the first quarter of 2013. And lastly, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2.","During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","So with that, I will turn things over to Inge. And please turn to Slide #3.","Inge G. Thulin","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.","For us, the third quarter repeated a pattern we have seen throughout the year: solid earnings, strong margins and steady organic sales growth delivered against challenging macroeconomic conditions. Once again, 3M's operational excellence was an important factor in our quarter. Our Q3 GAAP earnings per share were $1.65, up 8.6% year-on-year. Operating margins were again strong at 22.4%. All 6 business segments delivered margins above 21%, a sign of continued broad-based effectiveness and efficiency. Sales in the quarter were $7.5 billion, basically flat when compared with last year. Currency was again a factor, a drag of 3.1%.","Organic local currency growth was up 2.2%, with increases in all of our segments, including Display and Graphics and Electro and Communications. Geographically, the Americas were again strong, including double-digit organic local currency growth in Latin America, the 11th consecutive quarter that we have achieved that level. The United States rose 2%; Europe, Middle East, Africa was up 1%; and APAC remained flat.","We returned about $0.75 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases.","So all in all, Q3 was another quarter marked by steady organic growth, operating discipline, efficiency and investment to improve our business. One example of investment is the acquisition of Ceradyne, which we announced October 1. This is an excellent match on many levels: the advanced ceramics technology platform, the global possibilities and, in combination with 3M's technology arsenal, the ability to bring new solutions to numerous industries such as automotive, oil and gas, industrial and electronics, just to name a few.","Now David will take you through the detail of the quarter. David?","David W. Meline","Thank you, Inge. Let's turn to Slide #4 for a discussion of the third quarter income statement.","We continue to operate well in the quarter with excellent factory efficiency and discretionary cost control, both of which were necessary given the continued soft economy. Sales for the quarter were $7.5 billion, down 0.4 percentage points year-on-year, including over 3 percentage points of currency headwinds. I will elaborate on the change in sales in just a moment.","Gross profit dollars increased by 1.7 percentage points year-on-year. SG&A spending declined by 3% while R&D investment spending rose nearly 2%. Total operating income increased 6.1% and operating margins were again strong at 22.4%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points versus last year's third quarter. The combination of raw material cost reductions and selling price increases contributed 1.6 percentage points to operating margins in the third quarter, while year-on-year increases in pension and OPEB expense reduced margins by 0.3%.","Third quarter earnings were $1.65 per diluted share, an increase of 8.6%. Average shares outstanding declined 1.7% year-on-year, which boosted earnings by $0.03 per share. The third quarter tax rate was 28.2%, down 40 basis points year-on-year, which increased earnings by $0.01 a share.","During the quarter, we incurred various restructuring charges totaling $0.01 per share, and insurance recoveries added $0.02 to earnings. As I mentioned before, operating margins improved by 1.4 percentage points to 22.4%, reflecting continued strong operational excellence across all of our businesses.","Please turn to Slide 5 for a more detailed look at our third quarter sales change.","Third quarter organic local currency growth was 2.2%, with equal contributions from both volumes and selling price increases. Acquisitions added 50 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 3.1 percentage points as the U.S. dollar remained strong versus the euro and a number of other currencies. Again, on a total dollar basis, sales declined 40 basis points versus last year's third quarter.","Looking across geographic regions. Latin America\/Canada led the way with strong organic local currency growth of 10.5% in the quarter. All 6 of our businesses contributed to this growth, with particular strength in Safety, Security and Protection Services, Electro and Communications and Display and Graphics. Health Care also posted double-digit organic local currency growth within the region.","On a country basis, Mexico in particular had another strong quarter, with 19% organic local currency growth. Our teams there have done a fantastic job building the business, with focused investments in a number of key areas. Those investments are paying off nicely.","In the United States, organic sales rose 2.3%, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of positive growth in the U.S. In EMEA or the combined Europe, Middle East and Africa, third quarter sales increased 0.8% on an organic local currency basis. We saw nice double-digit increases in the Middle East and Africa, along with positive growth in Central Eastern Europe. West Europe was down 1% in the quarter, an improvement versus the first half of the year and reflecting the economic growth challenges in that region.","Our West European teams remain focused on taking market share and driving productivity. I was encouraged to see that operating margins in the total EMEA region increased year-on-year by nearly 2 percentage points. So our teams there are executing extremely well in the face of challenging macro conditions. Across Asia Pacific, organic local currency sales were flat in the third quarter.","Growth was strongest in our Health Care and Consumer and Office businesses. Our businesses serving the consumer electronics industry continue to improve, but by no means have we seen a full recovery.","Focusing on the China-Hong Kong region. Organic local currency sales were flat in the third quarter. We saw positive growth in Health Care and Consumer and Office, both domestic-oriented businesses, and in Industrial and Transportation. This growth was offset by year-over-year declines in Renewable Energy and personal safety. Longer term, China remains a key growth engine for the future, and we will continue to invest. We regard any challenges there as temporary.","Let's now review our third quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide #6.","In the Industrial and Transportation business, sales rose 3% on an organic local currency basis to $2.6 billion. Automotive OEM led the way this quarter with 11% organic local currency growth. We also achieved good growth in aerospace, automotive aftermarket, 3M Purification and Industrial Adhesives and Tapes.","On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased 8% in the United States, 5% in Latin America\/Canada and 1% in EMEA. Asia Pacific sales were flat in organic local currency terms. This is our largest business by a wide margin so we were encouraged to see such broad-based growth with excellent profitability.","Operating income was $575 million, up 9% over last year's third quarter, and margins improved by 2 percentage points to 22.4%.","Now let's move to Health Care. Third quarter sales increased 4% on an organic local currency basis to $1.3 billion. Operating income grew 9% to $400 million, with strong operating margins of nearly 32%. We saw strength across the Health Care business, with the strongest organic local currency growth in food safety, health information systems and skin and wound care. Drug delivery was down low single digits in Q3.","Geographically, sales expanded in all regions and especially in Latin America and Asia Pacific where we have increased our investment levels over time.","Now let's look at the Consumer and Office business. Sales were $1.1 billion this quarter, up 1% on an organic local currency basis, and operating income was flat year-on-year at $244 million. Operating margins were 21.9% in the third quarter. Our strongest growers in Consumer and Office were DIY, consumer health care and home care, while stationery and office supplies saw modest declines on an organic local currency basis. Acquisitions added 2.5% to sales due entirely to GPI Group, a leading French producer of home improvement products. We purchased GPI on October 1 of last year, so next quarter, it will become part of our organic sales base.","On a geographic basis, organic local currency growth was 7% in Latin America\/Canada, 6% in Asia Pacific and flat in the U.S., while EMEA declined 3%.","One item of note, during the quarter, in light of objections from the Department of Justice, 3M and Avery Dennison terminated the agreement under which 3M would have purchased Avery's Office and Consumer Products business.","Let's take a look at our Display and Graphics segment. Organic local currency growth rose 1% in the quarter to $936 million. We were encouraged that sales increased $54 million or 6% on a sequential basis. Third quarter organic local currency sales rose in architectural markets, commercial graphics and traffic safety systems. Sales of optical films declined just slightly year-on-year but rose 15% sequentially.","On an organic local currency basis, sales grew by 16% in Latin America\/Canada and 3% in the United States but declined 1% in both EMEA and Asia Pacific.","Operating profits in Display and Graphics were $199 million, up a strong 11% year-on-year, and margins were 21.2% for the quarter.","Let's examine the Safety, Security and Protection Services business. Third quarter sales were $926 million, up 1% on an organic local currency basis. Growth was led by the infrastructure protection and personal safety businesses. This growth was largely offset by declines in roofing granules and security systems.","On a geographic basis, sales rose 20% in Latin America\/Canada and 2% in EMEA but declined 6% in the U.S. and 4% in Asia Pacific. Operating income in this business was $196 million, down 3% year-on-year, and margins were 21.1%.","Finally, let's review Electro and Communications. Third quarter sales in this business were $820 million, up 0.1% in organic local currency terms. Operating income increased 3% to $186 million, and margins were 22.7%.","Organic local currency sales increased in Electrical Markets and declined year-on-year in both telecom and consumer electronics-related businesses. On the electronics side, a number of industry product launches were delayed, contributing to lower-than-expected growth in our business. Overall, the industry is showing signs of recovery but at a much slower pace than expected earlier in the year.","In geographic terms, Latin America\/Canada rose 17%, the U.S. increased 4% and EMEA rose 1% while Asia Pacific declined 4% in the quarter. Both Electro and Communications and Display and Graphics posted positive organic local currency sales growth in the third quarter, the first after multiple quarters of decline. We expect similar momentum in the fourth quarter helped by favorable year-on-year comparisons.","That concludes my discussion of the business segment results. Please turn to Slide #7. Free cash flow for the quarter was $987 million, down $39 million year-on-year. This amount includes $246 million in pension and OPEB contributions, which was similar to the last year's third quarter. Year-to-date contributions totaled $918 million and we expect approximately $1 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures were $358 million, up $22 million versus third quarter of last year, and we expect to invest approximately $1.5 billion for 2012 in total.","Free cash flow conversion was 85% in the quarter versus 94% in last year's third quarter. We returned $735 million to shareholders in the third quarter, including $408 million in cash dividends and $327 million in gross share repurchases.","So that concludes my discussion of our third quarter financial results. Now Inge will address our forward outlook, beginning on Slide #8.","Inge G. Thulin","Thank you, David.","Earlier this year, we shared 3M's vision followed quickly by our strategies. Consistent with our strategy to build relevance and presence in the marketplace, we recently announced a realignment of our major business groups to better serve both global markets and customers.","As Matt said, we will begin reporting results under the new structure in the first quarter of 2013. Very simply, we moved from 6 businesses to 5 business groups: Consumer; Industrial; Health Care; and 2 newly formed business groups, Electronics & Energy and Safety & Graphics. The realignment is a natural outcome of our strategy to increase relevance to our customers and to broaden our presence in the markets we serve. By building scale more broadly across the company, it creates critical mass in each business group to take better advantage of innovation and commercialization opportunities.","The Electronics & Energy business groups illustrate this concept very well. We will bring together all of our capabilities in these markets to increase our impact and relevance with big, global OEM customers. At the same time, we enhance our ability to leverage key manufacturing and marketing assets. I'm personally very encouraged by early feedback from multiple customers who look forward to strengthen our partnership for mutual success.","Please turn to Slide 9. In the short term, however, we still face the challenge of sluggish economies in large developed regions like Western Europe and Japan. As David said, the teams there are working to take share and drive productivity, and I am very pleased with our progress. In China, the year clearly has not played out the way most anticipated. But as we have said many times, short-term challenges will not divert us from the future opportunity, so we will continue to invest and build our business and our capabilities locally for the long term.","Our China for China approach is the right approach as the Chinese economy evolves away from its dependence on exports and towards domestic consumer-oriented businesses. Of course, China is not the only location where we are investing to improve our business and strengthen trend [ph] innovation. In Q3, we announced plans to build a new state-of-the-art laboratory facility at our headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota. The new laboratory, scheduled to open in early 2015, will house some 700 scientists who currently work in other facilities here. With the latest in equipment, it will be an environment designed specifically for the development of innovative technologies and an important hub in 3M's global research network.","Let me now turn to the outlook. Please turn to Slide 10.","With one quarter left in the year and no indications that condition in the fourth quarter will be dramatically different from the third, we are adjusting the full year earnings outlook to a range of $6.27 to $6.35 per share. This range includes $0.03 per share of anticipated acquisition-related expenses, largely Ceradyne. On organic local currency growth, we now expect a range of 2% to 2.5%. We look for a currency penalty of approximately 2.5%, a little lower than it has been running. And we look for margins in the range of 21.5% to 22%.","In summary, Q3 market conditions were challenging and we expect this through the end of the year. We will continue to expand our business, drive productivity and execute our plan with strong discipline.","Thank you for the attention. We will now take your questions and comments.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford and Bernstein (sic) [Sanford Bernstein].","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right, can we just maybe start with pricing and inventory trends? On the pricing side, you got an -- healthy 1.1% again, which is great, and more value versus raw materials. But this is also down, I guess, on the pricing side from last quarter year-on-year. Maybe just talk about the trend and the sustainability, what your expectations are both into next quarter and as you see going forward. What's the ability of the organization to continue to get pricing in the near term?","David W. Meline","Right, Steve. So if you think about pricing in terms of what we've talked about this year, we indicated in the last call that we thought we would have about a 1% price performance for the calendar year. As we look now at Q3 and into Q4, I think it's going to be 1% plus, so maybe a little bit above that level. If I look more specifically at -- as we trend to the end of the year, I think we'll have positive price performance in Q4 but it'll be a little bit less than what we saw in Q3, and it's very consistent with the plan that we had in place which is where we took quite significant price adjustments here late last year and earlier this year. And in the current environment, we don't see -- both on the negative side, we're not seeing significant concerted price pressure on the business. So we're able to be in more of a holding pattern on the context of weaker raw materials. I would say the one exception there, which is probably no surprise, is we're seeing typical price dynamics in our electronics business, specifically in Optical Systems where we'll probably see double-digit price declines on the year, which is pretty typical and how we plan the business.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And on the inventory -- oh, sorry. Go ahead, Inge.","Inge G. Thulin","Yes, this is Inge. I'll make a comment on inventory. Now as we are 3 quarters into the year and we -- and all of our customers went into a year which we knew will be uncertain, I think everyone have really focused on the inventories and the turns, both ourself and our customers. So as we said on the last call, it's managed very well so we don't see it as an issue, by definition. I think the inventories, generally speaking, are very well in line with demand. I think we saw a little bit of uptick relative to TV sets, whereas, as you maybe recall, last quarter we said it was 7 weeks. It's slightly higher but not much. But I think that's the only thing we have seen. And then I will see -- in the retail side, they also manage it very tight. So when we look upon back to school this year, it was okay. It was not great, but that's indicating for us that -- they are managing the channel very well. So as we see today, broad-based everywhere, it looked like, maybe due to the fact that everyone went into this year with a view of uncertainty, is -- managed it very, very tightly. So we have not seen a change from last quarter, by definition.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And Inge, could you maybe comment? On the segment realignment, we haven't heard much in the way of cost repositioning as a result of the realignment. What is your view on the implication on the cost side?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, this was done in order to serve the customers better and make sure that we can accelerate growth. So I think that's the starting point, to make sure that is the prime objective. So all focus here was to make sure we get more aligned with our customers and the market; create, I would say, speed in between what we call customer-inspired innovation right back to our laboratories and back out again so we can commercialize faster. So I think that's the prime thing for us to be able to do, and that is where we focus. Now by definition, we should see, which is build into our overall aggressive model, some productivity improvement. But I hope that we should be able to reinvest that in order to get the growth rate up a little bit higher than we see today. So I will say that there will be an efficiency in the organization, hopefully with less internal meeting, more external meeting but use the resources in order to make sure we're aligned with customers so we can get these things going. And I -- as I said in my opening, I received multiple, very positive response from very big, global OEMs that really can see this as a benefit for them and us in the way we work. So that's how I will look upon it. And as you know, we are driving our model constantly in terms of improved productivity and efficiency. So the prime objective here was to be offensive and make sure we align better with the customers and the markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So maybe just continuing on that pricing question, sounds like it's still -- will be positive in 4Q. Could you maybe comment on raws? So it looks like that the pricing raw spread was a nice positive 3Q. How should we be thinking about that spread into the fourth quarter?","David W. Meline","Yes, right, Ajay. So if you look at raw material costs, you're right, we did see actually what we expect to be the best year-over-year comparison here in Q3 for the year, which was over a 2% decline in raw material costs. And right now, what I'm looking for, for the full year is around 2%, including continued positive performance in Q4. Although, we're starting to get into a period now, by Q4, where some of the trends in raw material price declines were already starting to be apparent last year. So we're starting to get into a year-over-year comp issue, but nonetheless we think that we'll continue to see good performance on that side.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. So then on your margin guide, the low end kind of implies 4Q margins would be flattish year-on-year. And you've being seeing nice improvement last couple of quarters. It sounds like you will continue to manage cost and pricing raw material will be a positive. So how should we think about that low end? Is that just being conservative, or is there any of the segments that we should be thinking about?","David W. Meline","Yes, good question. So if you look at the balance of the year and the guidance, basically, I think it would be fair to say you would align the low-end revenue guidance with the low-end margin. We don't see any particular notable change in terms of the trends of the business sectors, other than the fact that seasonally we always have slower sales in the fourth quarter, and lower margins. But no particular trend to note, other than the fact that we have seen what we believe will be the bottom in the electronics cycle, as we've been calling for through line [ph] and frankly through the last 5 quarters. And so we will see some continued positive trend on the electronics space, although that's frankly more of a comps issue right now than necessarily seeing the kind of strength that we had originally foreseen in that recovery.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sorry, just to go back to the price cost question, can you just -- the -- that bridge is very helpful in showing what impact is on margins. So I -- we can kind of put it together, doing the math, but I guess, just to get to the point: So the fourth quarter will be around what? It was 1.6 points this quarter. What do you guys expect for the fourth quarter?","David W. Meline","We think that the trend on price cost will continue in a similar fashion. So raw material cost trend, we don't see any inflection point further up or down as we move into the fourth quarter. And as I described, from a pricing perspective, we get into a tougher year-over-year comp as we had very strong price performance last year in the fourth quarter. So when you look at that price performance, we think it will be positive in the fourth quarter but less than what we saw in the third.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the -- I guess, just digging into the segments a little more. As -- the safety and security business had a pretty dramatic step-down in the margin. There may have been something in the second quarter I'm forgetting about. But was that a mix issue? Is that something that -- did the weakness kind of come at the end of the quarter there that kind of caught you off guard and, I guess, similarly for Consumer and Office. I mean, this business has been running at such a hot rate but the margin down year-over-year. Just on those 2 segments, what's going on with the margins and what would you expect in the fourth quarter?","David W. Meline","Yes. So if you look at -- well, first of all, Steve, as I just mentioned to Ajay, I wouldn't see -- other than normal seasonal factors, I would foresee that trends in all of the segments, including those 2, would be pretty similar in Q4 to Q3. If you go specifically first to safety and security business, what we saw this year was a couple of things happening: So first of all, if you look at the margin, 21% in the third quarter, which was very steady on a year-over-year basis. What's also true is that, if you look at, in particular, our OH&ES business, our personal safety business, it was up in the mid-single-digit range, which is quite good but it is slower than what we saw in the first half. So part of what you've seen is a general slowdown in the macroeconomy that did impact the personal safety business overall even though it's still printing mid-single-digit growth. The second thing sequentially which I think is important is we saw a pull-forward in demand in the roofing granule business, which was driven by the fact that we had very mild weather here in the U.S. in the springtime. And so there was a pull-forward, which really supported the first half, including the margin there. You saw a very unusually high margin than in the second quarter. And so now what's happening is demand in that segment is correcting that -- an exception to Inge's general comments on inventory, we are seeing an inventory reduction there, and that's coming through in the results here in the third quarter.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, I guess you guys had some discretionary cost takeout from last quarter. Any discretionary cost takeout in the second half here, in the third quarter?","David W. Meline","Yes, so in terms of restructuring, we've done now $80 million year-to-date, including about $0.01 a share, around $10 million here in the third quarter, which is again normal in our business in particular in a time like this. We've been working hard to look where there's opportunities to improve our efficiency and competitiveness so we did a little bit more here in Q3.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","For the $0.02 insurance recovery, is -- did that show up in SG&A? Was there anything else in SG&A that have brought that a little bit lower?","David W. Meline","Actually, that shows up in other expense line and so not in SG&A. SG&A really is a story around managing the business in a fairly tepid growth environment. So same kind of expense patterns that we've seen through the year. I think, importantly for us, what we're really trying to do in that area is make sure we're prioritizing to invest in that area, in the key growth areas. So if you look at some of the emerging market segments we've talked about before such as health care in emerging markets, we continue to add a structure and resources in that area around the world. And at the same time, we're looking as to how we can be most efficient, including in places like Western Europe where our overall margin year-on-year was up over 2 points, and that's -- not an insignificant piece of that is related to how we're really driving efficiency.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So that would be the -- should we use a run rate of third quarter for our fourth quarter estimates for SG&A?","David W. Meline","For SG&A? Yes. In terms of absolute terms, I would say yes. Obviously, there's a seasonal factor that's always impacting us in Q4.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me is on the acquisition of Ceradyne. Inge, I'd be interested in hearing the dynamics on how you can leverage all these different technologies of ceramics. You rattled off a number of them, auto and oil and industrial. But you've got a decline in body armor sales. That's been well known within Ceradyne, but if -- it looks like 3M would have an opportunity to really leverage some of the other material science opportunity. So can you just expand on that and maybe a time frame where we would start to see some penetration there?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. First of all, we are still in the process, as you know, in terms of completion here so some of the comments I will make here will be more generic. But if you look upon it from a technology perspective and when you add the -- what we have in term of chemistry and solutions coming to shapes, what will be added here is minerals and powders, meaning that we will have a much broader base in order to develop relevant solutions in the marketplace and so, I think, you look upon it from many platforms and many businesses. In fact, today, what we have in ceramics ourselves, it's around USD 3 billion in sales where there's touching, right? So touching, what, 18 divisions. And we've been able to build that out in many, many places. So we hope now to complete it here during this year. And then we would start the integration very fast, and we have an integration team in place. And then we hope we'd be able to talk more to you around specifics as we close it down and we'd be very excited to do it. What is really interesting for us here and different from the many other acquisitions we have done, this is broad-based for many businesses for us and it's a technology play where I think the combination of what we have today and what Ceradyne is adding to us from a technology perspective will be really, really powerful. So you're right in terms of your comments on short-term cycles in the business, but we look beyond that and believe we really can leverage these big time as we move ahead. So we believe this is a very good acquisition for us strategically long term but also with short-term revenue benefit added into next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to clarify something. One of your comments, you talked about broad macro. So as you go into the fourth quarter, are things getting worse globally, or they just remained sluggish but stable? Just to understand what the macro framework is here.","Inge G. Thulin","I think we will say stable as we go into the fourth quarter. We don't see any uptick, but we believe it's stable. So that's also the way we have looked upon the estimation for the rest of the year. So it's -- there's many uncertainties in the market, as we all know, but we all manage it well and have done so, so far this year. But we don't -- we see it stable for the rest of the year. We don't see any upticks, by definition. We will continue to drive our operational excellence in West Europe, that we have done successfully this year. And as David said, we are very pleased with the team there in terms of how they are able both to take share but drive productivity and improve margins. And as you saw, United States is moderating a little bit in growth for us, but again, we show local currency growth. And some of this businesses here, like industrial, had an effect, an 8% growth in United States in the quarter, which is very encouraging and very good. And then I -- when you look upon emerging market and so forth, I think one thing is, for the whole electronics part of the business, the recovery is slower than expected by the industry. So this is not 3M. This is slowed and expected by the industry, and sequentially, we improved. So I think that's good for us, as you saw both Display and Graphics and Electro and Communication show positive organic growth this quarter. So it's slower but it's improving.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could we just dig into a little bit more in China just couple of things? Could you talk more about some trends between industrial versus consumer trends? When do you guys -- what are you hearing on the ground about if and when growth will accelerate?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. Well, first of all, I think the way we look upon that, this is to say, first of all, our strategy that we have now executed for many years, that is around China for China, is now proven to really be the right one. China's economy has historically been very dependent on export. And I will not categorize it that they are moving from export to domestic. I would say export will continue to be important, but the, what I would call, domestic and consumable part of the China economy will be more important as we move ahead. That is why we are very well positioned. And we have invested now for many years in Health Care, that is coming back -- growing very, very well for us now, and the same in Consumer. So we have made investments here during the last 5 years or so in order to be prepared for this. In terms of the Industrial side, in fact, for us, if we take out the renewable business, in the quarter, the Industrial business grew by 9% plus in China. So we think it will come back here in terms of growth. And I think it's very much dependent on the uptick in West Europe for exports going over there and the United States.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And do you have any expectations of -- baked into your guidance as to when the Chinese decide to accelerate their economy? Or is it just steady as she goes?","David W. Meline","The way we built the guidance for the balance of the year, Andrew, is really steady into the fourth quarter. That would be in China as well as across the business generally.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a high-level question first and then maybe to follow up. Inge, just back to the reorg, can you give us a little more color on how it actually makes you better? And what I mean by that, when I think of customer intimacy, I think of smaller divisions and smaller P&Ls, not consolidating from 6 to 5. And I know there's a lot of businesses underneath the surface at 3M and it sounds like that's not changing. But it's unclear to me how the reorg actually makes you competitively better.","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. First of all, it -- as you see that a couple of businesses become -- more sizable, meaning that it will be easier for them to prioritize inside the businesses. So I think that's an advantage relative to making choices as we move ahead. And as you know, I'm a big believer in prioritization so I think that help you. The other thing is it will now become easier for us to utilize our capabilities both for manufacturing and research and development in direct to our customers. So if you think about Electronics & Energy, that's big markets and big customers. A total market space for us would be very, very sizable. And what we would be able to do here is to line up our resources, which will help us in terms of the speed for commercialization, which is again based on customer-inspired innovations. So I think that linkage is very important to us. So by definition, size and scale is important. And that we'll have some other alignment relative to smaller divisions below that, that will happen. But very much, when you think about the divisions that we have had maybe in 2 different business segments before, doing business with big, global OEMs is slowing us down relative to our interaction, response, et cetera. So I think that really will help us as we move ahead. And as I said earlier, I've got many positive comments relative to the improvement in alignment that this will help us with.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","That's helpful. And then just near-term trends, Inge, we heard a lot of companies suggest that July and August were just kind of basically in line with what they thought, and then they didn't get the normal seasonal bounce in September or September orders were disappointing. Do you see that anywhere in your business? How did you actually exit the quarter? And any early read as you look into October here?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. Well, when we looked upon billing per day, in fact, during the quarter we had a slight increase as the quarter went on. So I think that what you're referring to, what other people are saying to you, I'm not sure that's correct for us. David will comment here as well. But what we saw was that the invoicing per day, per billing day, had a slight increase as we went through the quarter. So that was a positive thing for us.","David W. Meline","Yes, I would just add. So in the context of our prior view of the year, obviously we brought down our revenue growth for the year to a lower range. So I think the way to think about it, as we do, is we had steady sales through the quarter. Obviously, September was a shorter month, so some people may be interpreting the overall sales impacted by the -- the less billing days. But our expectation had been actually a stronger rise specifically in the electronics segment, which didn't materialize, hence steady sales through the quarter, not rising as much as we'd foreseen and in one particular sector. And therefore, we've adjusted our outlook for the year accordingly.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Great. And then just finally, David, one quick one for you, if you could. If you'd just kind of snap the line today on pension, can you give us a sense of what the -- what the headwind would look like next year?","David W. Meline","Yes. If we were to look right now, and obviously we'll have a lot more detail in December in the call, and I also will talk in some depth in the November meeting, as we're going to look at the long term. But if I look at pension right now, despite the fact that we would expect to see a flat or modest decline in the discount rate next year, basically we've been amortizing deferred losses over time and that amortization is now declining. So we have a declining amortization of prior discount rate changes, we have quite good return on asset performance, I think, this year through September, in the U.S., it was somewhere over 10%. And therefore, I'm presently expecting that our pension expense next year will certainly not be a headwind and there's -- the more likely scenario is we'll get some modest tailwind next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So David, if I can just follow up on that last point there. Is the reason for the amortization falling is because you amortized the 5 years, is that correct?","David W. Meline","We have a 3-year amortization buildup and then we amortized the balance through over a 10-year period after that. So if you think about the trends, which is we've taken quite substantial reductions in the discount rate over the last couple of years, that's now being fully built into that schedule. And likewise, we've seen, as I mentioned, good return-on-asset characteristics as well, which gets amortized, so to the extent we perform better than assumptions, that likewise gets amortized. And so we're building out actually better layers of positive asset performance. So the combination of those 2 would lead to the outcome that I mentioned.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then just switching back to inventories. You're heading to 4Q with a bit of an -- a Q-o-Q increase in your inventories. I'm sure some of that is due to the weaker dollar. But are you planning to take any unusual reductions in inventory as we head into 4Q? And I know we normally do see entries coming down into 4Q, but anything unusual there?","David W. Meline","Yes, I would say not unusual. And yes, it wouldn't be surprising to see us bring down some inventory in the fourth quarter, which is typical of the seasonal pattern.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And does that have any measurable impact on margins in 4Q?","David W. Meline","Certainly, lower production levels have an unfavorable impact on margins, as is typically true. I mean, if you look at prior years, I think that would give you some guidance how to think about it.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, you've got some debt maturities coming up over the next 12 months. Obviously, it's a favorable time to go out and refinance debt. Any thoughts on maybe topping up the debt balance and taking advantage of the low interest rates environment?","David W. Meline","Yes, so we've been looking at -- we would agree, we've got a $500 million maturity here in the fourth quarter. As we looked out at the situation, we decided that it was a good time to do some prefunding. So we went in here and in June, July time frame and did a $1.25 billion issuance, which was intended to, in anticipation of both the rollovers as well as the fact that we viewed the market situation, to be quite favorable at the time. So yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So just when you think about operating income, it was up 6% in the quarter and really came from the price raws this quarter. Pension was a headwind, FX was a little headwind. So those sound like they'll get more favorable, and you just mentioned about pension. But price of raws is a big number. So can we sustain kind of the 6% op income growth if volumes stay soft? Is there another sort of driver to keep that going or maybe any other dynamics?","David W. Meline","Yes. So I think -- I guess my answer, Shannon, is that, as we look at running the business -- certainly as we came into this year, we were quite cautious in terms of the growth opportunities. And therefore, we postured ourselves to -- well, we had talked about a 1% year-over-year margin improvement in the company, which we're certainly on track to deliver for the year. As I look out forward, frankly, we haven't finalized the 2013 plan, if that's what you're referring to, but certainly we'll have to look at what's going on with growth in the economy, we think we'll be able to continue to grow our business at and above that trend based on the investments that we've been doing. And certainly, efficiency is part of the model that we'll need to make sure that we're balancing with also investing in the business. So we feel good about the business right now. We think the sustainability is very good in terms of our overall performance. And obviously, we'll have to be able to adjust to the extent we see movements up or down in the economy.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And would you -- and would you go out and get more price? Or would there be restructuring savings? Or what -- I guess, what would replace the current kind of price of raws lever?","David W. Meline","Yes, I mean, I would say we have to look at all of those factors in order to drive the business. But I -- bottom line, we think the equation is very sustainable. We have a number of levers that we can pull on. And we'll have to look at all of those pieces as we roll this out here for next year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And I just -- a little follow-up on electronics. So I mean you guys have been a little more encouraged coming out of 2Q, on a pickup in electronics. And now it didn't come through. Can you just give a little more color on sort of what you saw that had encouraged you and then what the setback was from that?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. First of all, the -- what happened in the marketplace was that there was a weakness in semiconductor and hard disk drives, so the outlook has weakened from Q2 for both those segments. So I think that was a clear change in the outlook, as we had it back in Q2. So for us, electronic-related businesses was down nearly 3%, with optical down 40 basis points. But optical was up almost 16% sequentially, with a profit of up 20% year-on-year and 40% sequentially. So that was interesting move for us and very good. So very profitable, and they did well. I think that we see a modest recovery in Q4. And what we see also is improvement in handheld and smartphone market where we have good penetration. So that's working in our favor. So I think that's what you have to see if you look upon weaknesses, it was semiconductor and hard disk drives and that's no surprise for you and -- or for us once we have seen what's happened in the market. And then we see improvement in handheld and smartphones, which is based on all solutions working in our favor. So...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Feldman of UBS.","Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Latin America and Canada, as a region seemed to have been particularly strong now for quite some time. It looks like it's beyond just end market growth but also including penetration. When you look at that, is it really just because you're coming from a lower base there? Or are there lessons or models kind of from that region that you can apply elsewhere?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, first of all, I -- when you look upon Latin America, we have a broad-based, very good performance. And as David said earlier, specifically, Mexico at this point in time is doing very well and that's due to that they have built out a very strong platform that we have had for many years in terms of our commercialization capabilities but now built out with more local manufacturing and with more research and development. So as you saw in the quarter here, it was 19% organic local currency growth, which was very good. Brazil is a big subsidiary for us and also doing very well. And again, the success there is that we have invested since many, many years. We have been in Brazil since 1946 so we have made investment not only for commercialization capabilities but manufacturing and research and development. Now the good thing in Latin America, it's all other countries are also doing very well and our portfolio is very balanced, generally speaking, in Latin America. So we are not so heavy in one of the bigger businesses, it's broad-based, with Health Care strong, Consumer and Office have a very good position with very good brand equity that they are leveraging. So I think it's -- the thing here for them is that they have gone very early on the localization strategy, and that's playing out very, very well for us. So good base, continue to grow and we are very happy with the performance there. It's also -- the team, I would say, when you go down to execution, that have this fantastic balance of both entrepreneurial in terms of finding new businesses but also driving operational excellence, very, very effective there.","David W. Meline","Maybe I'll just add one point, which is, if you look at Latin America and building on that theme, it's our most mature of those emerging market investment areas and you can see how well the model works. Over time, we're applying exactly that same model in places like Southeast Asia, like Central and Eastern Europe, like Middle East and Africa. And we think that, that portends well for the future.","Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, we're beginning to see kind of an increase in prevalence of touchscreens for monitors for traditional PCs in advance of Windows 8. Is that an opportunity for the optical films business? And when do you expect that to actually -- wind up being big enough to make a difference itself [ph]?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, I will position it slightly different. I would say that is an opportunity, broad-based, for 3M technologies. I will not hold that to optical film. That's one of the reason why we have realigned the organization, with an Electronics & Energy business. So coming back to the question before, what is the advantage? We have so many technologies that are going into the electronic industry and going into, specifically, handheld, that this will be the advantage. So the answer is yes. Please broaden out in terms of many other products and solution that we will provide. On the timing, we are working very close with our customers. And we cannot talk about that at this point in time in terms of when they will introduce the platforms. But the answer is yes, this is a good thing for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Lucy Watson, on for Laurence. On -- for your current order of visibility, I guess, how is your visibility on order trends in the industrial and auto markets in particular? And are any of your customers alluding to plans for longer year-end shutdowns this year?","David W. Meline","Yes, so I guess I'll just pick up on some of the earlier comments. If I look at specifically the auto OEM business, we saw double-digit growth again this quarter, which is roughly twice the rate of the build, so what we're -- it's quite clear to us that we're seeing very good market share pickup in that space, and we're pleased with that. What we also believe to be true is that, in the fourth quarter, we will see a decline in the sales in that space, which is consistent with what's going on with schedules, which is we do see the fourth quarter schedules for automotive build globally is down, I think -- as I recall, it's about a 3% year-over-year increase. So we see that coming down. Do we have specific additional insight beyond that? Quite honestly, frankly, as I stand here, I don't. So -- and then industrial, generally, the trends we have seen -- I mean, there's been -- if you look at the numbers, you see some softening in the industrial momentum, which is very consistent with what's going on in the macroeconomy. As Inge commented, as we look through the third quarter, on a daily sales basis, we were encouraged frankly to see that the sales were pretty steady. And to be honest, we're watching very carefully: We've taken a more conservative posture in terms of the outlook for growth for the full year. That reflects a more conservative view of the fourth quarter because we think there's a -- plenty of uncertainties out there. So while we've been encouraged with our ongoing performance, we're also, frankly, trying to be appropriately cautious right now.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call.

Please hold the dates, additional information will be provided closer to the event.","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll handoff to Inge. Inge?","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin my remarks with a recap of the fourth quarter and later in the call, I will provide some comments on our full-year performance. Our team had a good finish to 2016 as we delivered double-digits growth in earnings per share along with strong margins and a robust cash flow. We also continued to position 3M for the future through our three key levers while returning significant cash to our shareholders.","With respect to EPS, we posted earnings of $1.88 per share, an increase of more than 13% year-over-year. Total sales across our enterprise was $7.3 billion, up slightly versus last year's Q4. Organic growth companywide was 2% with three of our five business groups delivering positive organic growth.","As I indicated in our October earnings call, organic growth in Industrial turned positive in the fourth quarter. This business had a strong finish to the year with 5% organic growth, which was broad-based across the portfolio.","Safety and Graphics posted 2% organic growth with a good performance from personal safety, one of our Heartland businesses, as well as from roofing granules. As we expected, organic growth in Health Care was similar to the third quarter at 1.3%. We expect Health Care to regain its momentum as we move further into 2017 and as our additional growth investments begin to pay off.","Organic growth in Consumer was down 1%, while this business experienced positive point of sales across its retail customers, it was negatively impacted by inventory reductions throughout the retail industry. Electronics and Energy closed out the year with another quarter of sequential improvement posting organic growth that was down just slightly, while once again expanding its operating margins.","Looking at margins across our entire Company, we delivered another strong broad-based performance. Margins were up more than 200 basis points to nearly 23% ranging from 30% in Health Care to 21% in Safety and Graphics. At the same time, we generated healthy cash flow with the free cash flow conversion rate of 154%. Our strong and consistent cash flow enables us to invest in the business, while also return significant cash to our shareholders. And in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","In summary, we had a good finish to 2016 and I would now turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?","Nicholas Gangestad","Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with Slide 5, where I will breakdown the fourth quarter change in sales. Organic local currency sales grew 1.6% in the quarter with organic volume up 1.5% and selling prices up 0.1%. Divestitures reduced sales by 0.4 percentage points. This impact relates to the divestitures of non-strategic businesses further evidence of our ongoing portfolio prioritization and focus on our best opportunities.","Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.8 percentage points. Considering all factors, fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 0.4% versus last year. On a geographic basis, U.S. organic growth increased 1.2% led by a mid single-digit performance in Industrial. Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses also grew organically in Q4.","Turning to Asia-Pacific, organic growth was up 2.4% with Health Care and Consumer leading the way. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Electronics and Energy during the quarter. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth increased 6% in China\/Hong Kong and 3% in Japan. Excluding our Electronics businesses, China\/Hong Kong was up 11%, and Japan grew 2% organically.","EMEA organic growth declined 2.4%. West Europe was down 1% as growth in Safety and Graphics and Industrial was more than offset by declines in our other business groups. Central East Europe and Middle East Africa declined mid-single digits year-on-year, impacted by ongoing challenges in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which we expect to persist in the near-term.","Finally, Latin America\/Canada was our fastest growing area with organic local currency growth of 4.1%. We saw solid growth in four of our five businesses led by high single-digit growth in Health Care. At a country level, Mexico delivered strong double-digit growth, while Canada was up 3%, and Brazil increased 1%.","Please turn to Slide 6 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Companywide fourth quarter sales were $7.3 billion and we generated earnings of $1.88 per share, a Q4 record. GAAP operating margins were 22.7%, up 220 basis points year-on-year, which we delivered while making incremental strategic investments of $50 million to drive future sales and profit growth.","On the right hand side of this slide, you\u2019ll see the components of our margin performance. Starting with the benefits, price in raw materials combined increased margins 50 basis points versus Q4 of 2015. Market prices for many raw materials were once again favorable year-on-year and our global sourcing team continues to deliver savings above market. Core price growth was down slightly in the quarter as we took targeted actions to drive organic volume growth.","Moving to restructuring, you may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced a restructuring plan to enhance our competitiveness and productivity. The associated benefit from this action boosted fourth quarter 2016 operating margins by 40 basis points year-on-year in addition to the positive comp related to the Q4 2015 charge itself.","Pension and OPEB expense declined year-on-year, as has been the case throughout 2016. This increased Q4 margins by 90 basis points. Organic volume and utilization was neutral to margins in the quarter, a marked improvement versus the headwinds we experienced through the first three quarters of 2016. Improved organic volume growth was a factor in this improvement, particularly in our Industrial and Electronics and Energy businesses.","Turning now to headwinds, foreign currency impacts net of hedge gains decreased margins by 20 basis points in Q4. Legal and other reduced margins by 30 basis points in the quarter primarily due to higher year-on-year costs from legal settlement. Incremental strategic investments lowered margins by 70 basis points in the quarter.","As we indicated during our December outlook meeting, we are increasing investments in a number of core platforms to accelerate growth in 2017 and beyond. At the same time, we continue to take actions in Q4 to better optimize our global manufacturing footprint, improve service to our customers and drive ongoing productivity.","Finally, well, you don't see it on this chart. Q4 corporate and unallocated costs were higher than anticipated, largely due to the aforementioned legal costs. For the full-year 2017, we anticipate corporate and unallocated costs will be in the range of $225 million to $275 million.","Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings increased 13.3% to $1.88 per share. As you see a number of factors impacted our earnings, growth and margin expansion added $0.16 to per share earnings in the quarter.","Acquisitions and divestitures increased earnings by $0.04 per share, driven by gains on the divestiture of the Polymask business within Industrial, along with the sale of non-core intellectual property in Electronics and Energy. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by $18 million or the equivalent of $0.02 per share. Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year reducing per share earnings by $0.02.","Our fourth quarter and full-year tax rate came in lower than we had projected due to a combination of increased benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, along with improved geographic profit mix. The Fourth quarter tax rate was 28.2% versus 29% in last year's fourth quarter, which increased earnings by$0.02 per share. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% year-over-year, which added $0.04 to fourth quarter EPS.","Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $2.2 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 154% in Q4 and 104% for the full-year. For the third consecutive year, free cash flow conversion exceeded 100%. In the fourth quarter, we invested $436 million in CapEx, bringing our full-year investment to $1.4 billion. For 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.","Also in the fourth quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. For the full-year 2016, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders, including cash dividends of $2.7 billion and gross share repurchases of $3.7 billion. For 2017, we expect gross share repurchases in the range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion.","Let's now review our Business Group performance starting with Industrial on Slide 9. Industrial posted Q4 sales of $2.5 billion leading the Company with organic growth of 4.6%. Our automotive OEM business led Industrial delivering strong double-digit growth continuing its consistent track record of outpacing growth in global car and light truck builds.","Advanced Materials, Automotive Aftermarket and our Separation and Purification business all posted solid mid single-digit growth year-on-year. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was broad-based across all regions with mid single-digit growth in Latin America\/Canada, the U.S. and Asia Pacific while EMEA was up low single-digits.","The Industrial business delivered strong operating income of $553 million in the quarter with margins up 260 basis points to 21.9%. The margin improvement was driven by the gain on sale of Polymask, past restructuring actions and ongoing productivity improvements.","Please turn to Slide 10. Safety and Graphics delivered another good quarter with fourth quarter sales up 2.2% organically to $1.3 billion. Our Personal Safety business posted solid mid single-digit organic growth in Q4. This included double-digit growth in China\/Hong Kong, where we continue to experience strong end market demand for our personal safety solutions.","The Roofing Granules business delivered another solid quarter of high single-digit growth which capped off a consistently strong year. On a geographic basis Safety and Graphics growth was led by Asia-Pacific and Latin America\/Canada, which were up mid single-digits.","You may recall in December, we announced the sale of our Identity Management business. We continue to expect the divestiture will be completed sometime during the first half of 2017. Safety and Graphics operating income was $270 million in the quarter and operating margins decreased 100 basis points to 20.8%. Adjusting for the divestiture gains and restructuring charges that occurred in Q4 of 2015, operating margins increased 120 basis points year-on-year.","Please turn to Slide 11. Our Health Care business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.4 billion. Organic growth was up 1.3% in line with our expectations. Health Care growth was led by a double-digit increase in food safety, followed by solid growth in both drug delivery systems and medical consumables.","Organic growth in oral care was down slightly as the business continued to be impacted by soft and market conditions and channel inventory adjustments. Health information systems also declined organically year-on-year due to a slower rate of software installations in a tougher market over the past year, along with the challenging comp against last year's record Q4.","Looking ahead, our customer pipeline is strong. Therefore, we expect growth in health information systems to accelerate throughout 2017. On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered high single-digit growth in Asia-Pacific with particular strength in China\/Hong Kong, which was up double-digits. Latin America\/Canada and the U.S. also posted positive organic growth in the quarter.","Health Care\u2019s operating income was $410 million and margins remained strong at 29.8%. Importantly, we generated these returns while investing an additional $30 million to enhance growth in core platforms across the business.","Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 12. Fourth quarter sales for Electronics and Energy were $1.2 billion, down 0.6% organically. Organic sales growth was flat in our electronics related businesses an improvement over recent quarters as end market conditions and channel inventories became more stable. As we explained at our outlook meeting in December, we are gaining penetration with leading electronics OEMs in China and also investing to capitalize on the rapid growth in automotive electronics.","Our Energy related businesses declined 2% organically with growth in our telecom business more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. As a reminder, at the end of 2015, we exited our backsheet business in renewable energy, which reduced energy related organic sales by 3.5% in Q4 of 2016.","On a geographic basis, sales in Latin America\/Canada grew organically in the low single-digits, while Asia-Pacific and EMEA declined. Electronics and Energy delivered a strong operational quarter with operating income of $326 million and margins of 26.9%, up 10.3 percentage points year-on-year. The year-on-year improvement was driven by a few factors that impacted Q4 margins in both 2015 and 2016.","First in Q4 of 2015, we incurred charges related to portfolio and restructuring actions, which reduced fourth quarter 2015 margins by 340 basis points. Second, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the business realized a gain from divesting non-core intellectual property, which added 270 basis points to Q4 2016 margins. Adjusting for these items, Q4 margins increased year-on-year by approximately 400 basis points. Looking at the full-year operating margins were 22.3%, up 120 basis points year-on-year.","I'll finish with our Consumer business on Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion. And as Inge mentioned, growth was impacted by channel inventory reductions in the U.S. and to a lesser extent West Europe. So from a pure selling perspective, our fourth quarter organic growth was down 0.7%. On the other hand from a point of sale or sellout perspective, our Q4 growth was positive in the in line with our historical trends. So we expect consumers organic growth will be back to more normal historical levels during the first quarter.","Despite these channel adjustments, we posted positive worldwide organic growth in three of our four businesses, namely Home Improvement, Consumer, Health Care and Home Care. The Stationery and Office Supply business, which was most impacted by channel adjustments declined year-on-year.","Looking at Consumer geographically, growth was led by a mid single-digit increase in Asia-Pacific, while the U.S. was flat, and EMEA declined year-on-year. Consumers operating income was $228 million with operating margins of 20.9%. Margins were down year-on-year for two primary reasons. One, we rationalized one of our manufacturing sites during the quarter, and two, the business accelerated growth investments in the quarter.","We continue to see good opportunities to invest and drive growth within the portfolio. In fact, we increased investments in Q4 in our category-leading Command and Filtrete product lines. Both posted double-digit organic growth in the U.S. this past holiday season. That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results.","Please turn to Slide 14 and I'll hand it back over to Inge for some final comments before Q&A. Inge?","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter kept a successful year for our enterprise, as we executed a playbook and delivered a strong operational performance. We increased our earnings per share by 8%. Margins were up more than 100 basis points to 24% with four of our five business groups posting margin expansion.","In addition, we delivered free cash flow conversion of 104%, which is our third consecutive year above 100%. And for the fourth straight year, our return on invested capital was above 20% coming in at 23% this year and we achieved all of this in a year of flat growth.","As you can see, we are executing well and controlling what we can control. 2016 was also a notable year with respect to our dividend, as we marked 3M\u2019s 100 consecutive year or paying dividends to our shareholders. For the full-year, when we combine dividends and share repurchases, we returned a total of $6.4 billion to our shareholders. During financial results, we continue to build for the future through our three key levers, which are significant value creators for us.","Let me start with portfolio management and ongoing process that is all about strengthening and focusing our portfolio, which improves our competitiveness and make us more relevant to all customers. This includes consolidations within 3M, along with divestiture of non-core businesses, and we were active in both fronts in 2016.","Portfolio management is benefiting our customers and 3M as we now have greater scale and are able to better prioritize our resources. This includes growth investments and at our December outlook meeting, we highlighted incremental $100 million we are investing to accelerate growth in our core platforms.","We will now move on to the second lever, investing in innovation. In 2016, we invested $1.7 billion or nearly 6% of sales in Research and Development, which is the heartbeat of our Company. This supports both our short and long-term growth objectives and along with our premium margins a return on invested capital. Last year, we also celebrated opening of a new laboratory in St. Paul, while earning more than 3,000 patents around the world.","Business transformation is the third lever, which starts and ends with our customers. Last year, we will continue to make good progress with the rollout of our ERP system in West Europe, which is nearly complete. Within West Europe, we have now deployed in 11 countries our four largest distribution centers and our supply chain center of expertise. Globally, we now have a total of 16 countries live and a new ERP system and our three global service centers are also up and running.","We are already beginning to realize productivity gains from business transformation, which will increase in 2017 and beyond. By 2020, it will result in $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings and another $0.5 billion reduction in working capital.","Looking upon our performance in 2016, the 3M playbook is working. From an operational perspective, we are executing well and delivering premium returns. At the same time, we continue to make investment that would enable us to capitalize as growth conditions improve. As a result, we are positioned to build on our momentum and deliver another strong performance in 2017.","Please turn to Slide 15. Here you see our planning estimates for the year, which are unchanged from December outlook meeting. We estimate earnings per share in the range of $8.45 to $8.80 and increase of 4% to 8%. Organic growth is expected to be 1% to 3% and we anticipate another good cash flow performance with a conversion rate of 95% to 105%.","With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Scott.","Nicholas Gangestad","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","When I look at my list of companies at least, you guys tend to be, obviously, about as global as anybody gets and have a pretty broad supply chain. And my question is how do you plan spending on even 2017? I mean how do you plan spending when you don't have a real great sense of tariffs and trade and how all that could be disrupted in the next couple of years? Does that play into the planning at all or do you just continue on?","Inge Thulin","Hi, good morning by the way.","Scott Davis","Good morning.","Inge Thulin","As you know, we are laying out very much localization strategy in terms of our business well all subsidiaries around the world. So at this point in time, we continue to lay out the plan as we have talked about. We are making investment in what we see the most important businesses for us to grow both in the United States and overseas based on that strategy, right. So by definition, even if we have both the global customers and local customers, we need to make the investment based on what they are and what they are going.","And I would say that when I look upon this quarter specifically, there is some very interesting movements, I think coming back a little bit to historic performance relative to growth, which we had that 1% growth in developed markets, but we are 3% in developing markets. So there is type of a movement going also coming back in the developing economies, which is interesting.","And as you heard Nick said, if you take China, China was 6% organic local currency growth all in excluding electronics was 11 and when look upon our five businesses in China specifically it was fantastic growth all of them. We have Safety and Graphics grew almost 20%, Consumer 17%, Health Care 15% and Industrial 12%. So we need to continue to invest based on the growth in those segments.","So we don't make a change at this point in time relative to the planning for the year and as we said in December, we are adding another $100 million this year in order to accelerate commercialization of products. But I would say generally speaking, it's early in the year as we know, but I saw some trends here that our positive relative to growth coming.","You saw Industrial business group almost 5% growth and it was broad-based all over the world. They grew in every geographical area around the world. So very encouraging as I look upon it. For Germany, they have positive growth for the third consecutive quarter for us. So I feel more positive as we move into 2017 even if it's early.","Scott Davis","Just a quick follow-up when you guys think about - I\u2019ve never asked this question before, I don't know why I haven't, but is there such a thing is book-to-bill in Electronics and Energy or is it too short cycle for that?","Inge Thulin","Once again, can you repeat the question?","Scott Davis","Sure, is there such a thing is like a book-to-bill or something like that Electronics and Energy where you can get a sense of which quarter of this year coming up, you turn into positive territory? I don\u2019t know again why I\u2019ve never asked that question before, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever referenced it. Just trying to get a sense of which quarter you might see positive growth and that would\u2026?","Nicholas Gangestad","Scott, let me take that one. We don't have a formal metric that we're measuring on a book-to-bill ratio in our Electronics business. It is a fairly short cycle, we're working with all of our customers there to be projecting, what the demands are in the future, but unlike some other industries, this is not one where we have a book-to-bill ratio.","Scott Davis","Okay. That's what I thought, but I have to ask. Thank you guys, and good luck to you.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Nicholas Gangestad","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Just a question firstly on the Consumer business, I don't recall you talking about the slowdown much at the mid-December meeting. So I wondered if it was something, the inventory reduction was something that became apparent sort of very late on? Is there any color you could give around days or weeks of excess inventory in those channels today?","Inge Thulin","Julian as far as the consumer business in the trends we saw throughout the fourth quarter much of this differential we saw between sell in and sell out occurred in December and in particular in the last half of December. In regards to inventory, we don't really see the channel is having excess inventory now. We considered a fairly normal inventory channel level in our consumer channels.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then if we look at the margin bridge, it was curious a little bit that the utilization piece and organic volume was not a contributor. It was flat even though the sales growth performance was actually pretty good. Was there anything unusual in Q4 that weighed on that specific line in margins that meant the operating leverage was not as high as it could or should have been?","Inge Thulin","Yes, Julian that's and I'll just put it in perspective, we've had that particular item being noticeably negative on our margin for the first three quarters of this year and getting that to be neutral for us for the fourth quarter with our 1.5% volume that's the main thing that happened for us in the fourth quarter. There isn't some particular headwind buried in there, but it was for us a notable trend change from where we've been the first three quarters.","Julian Mitchell","And do you still feel good about $0.10 to $0.20 of EPS accretion in 2017 from utilization.","Inge Thulin","Yes, we do Julian. That component of our EPS lock as well as every other line, we're still feeling very confident in right now Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Andrew.","Nicholas Gangestad","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So just a follow-up on Industrial, we know you have significant short-cycle exposure within Industrial and you did have easier comparisons in the quarter. But I think that growth jumped pretty meaningfully. Maybe you could give us some more color on how much of the improvement was maybe the energy component within advanced materials looking less bad or we know you had the big defense contract ramping up within advanced materials versus the rest of the Industrial business improving. And then how do you feel about your 1% to 3% growth forecast now for 2017, given you put up over 4% in 4Q?","Inge Thulin","Well, first of all it was broad-based growth in Industrial, both in terms of the businesses and in terms of the geographical area. So that was not one specific business that type stood out of in terms of growth, even if you saw a Nick comment on - again the fantastic performance for the automotive OEM business, but it was broad-based and it's coming back, I would say a little bit as we have talked about earlier in terms of evolution of economies.","And I think you've seen now as becoming more output from manufacturing around the world, we are very early in that process. And if you look upon PMI, the United States had a PMI of 54.7% in the quarter, China 51.4%, and Germany 55.6%. If you think about that in terms of big economies that will help us as we move forward, and as I said, it was broad-based.","Now to your second question, how we feel about 1% to 3% for the year as we came out of 5%? Feel good, feel good. Too early to change that as we sit here today, but generally speaking, I would say, feel good about Industrial businesses. And if you think about in terms of size, this is one-third of 3M and when we start to get good momentum in that business, that's helping us, a lot, right.","You saw they had good growth and we talked about that on the last earnings call that they will grow in Q4 and they did and it's very good. But yes, I said that\u2019s too early to change anything as we move into the year, right, so let's see after first quarter how we position it.","Nicholas Gangestad","Hey, Andy just one more detail on that I'll share. We've been talking about this for a quarter or two that we have some defense contracts we were awarded and those shipments were going on in the fourth quarter. Our body armor shipments added about 150 basis points to the total Industrial organic growth in Q4, so stripping that out the core underline is right around 300 basis points of growth.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, Nick, that's helpful. And then, Nick, you've talked about 3M's ability to achieve 30 to 50 basis points [of pressures] across in 2017. You obviously did 50 basis points in 4Q. But pricing in the U.S. continues to look competitive. It was a bit worse in 4Q than it was in 3Q. You mentioned sort of going after some additional organic growth. Can you talk about 3M's ability to offset a pretty competitive U.S. pricing environment? With the better sourcing and with the help of business transformation that you talked about are you still confident in positive price versus cost contributing to that $0.20 to $0.50 of organic global currency growth that you have?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. Andy there is a lot of subjects you hit there in one question. As far as the underlying price growth in the U.S., what we see in our view is our fundamental pricing power is not changing. It's still very strong. We did in the case of the U.S. take some targeted actions to help drive organic volume growth for us.","Also for the total Company and this isn't going outside the U.S. This is a quarter where we saw less pricing actions related to FX movements and you see that with our - and that's down noticeably from where we've been in the first three quarters of this year. So all in for 2017, we're still expecting the positive core price growth in the U.S. and globally.","Now to the other parts of it, our ability to use sourcing to continue to add to our earnings into our margin. I laid out a month ago that we expect between $0.10 and $0.15 of EPS accretion through our sourcing effort and everything we're seeing now, we see that on track, much of that is being driven not by just pure market prices, but it's now being driven by our own efforts to be substituting raw materials and taking advantage of our negotiation power.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Nicholas Gangestad","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Congrats on the 100 years of paying a consecutive dividend; not a lot of companies can claim that. The first question I have is on Health Care. You talked a little bit about regaining momentum, and I recognize that you had some product introductions in the quarter, but you also still have some headwinds on Oral Care. And I'm just curious, given the headwinds also potentially from the ACA, I'm just wondering like what gives you kind of the confidence that you could really see the momentum pick up as we progress through 2017?","Inge Thulin","Well, first of all most of our businesses are doing very well, right. So food safety is still growing very well, drug delivery system did well as well and then consumables in medical space did well. So if you take that together, right, there is underlying momentum in the business. We have invested quite a bit in this business for some time and we stepped that up and they have had a big investment starting already second half of 2016 and that now we'll start to generate growth coming into Q2 and Q3 for the year.","And the pipeline as Nick comment on, the pipeline for health information system is very strong, so yes, it\u2019ll slow down a little bit in terms of execution and deployment of that software into the hospitals, but the pipeline is very, very strong. So I would say that when you think about it generally speaking, we know that with investment in the areas we invest in Health Care, which around coverage, is around health economics and that's about some research and development, specifically the coverage will pay off rather sooner or than later. And again we see that the developing economies are starting to pick up for us. So the confidence is high that we will see the growth coming as we move into 2017.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. And then maybe my follow-up question and getting back to price cost for a second. Nick, maybe talk a little bit about the fact - it looks like you got about 10 basis points or so on pricing this quarter. We're moving into more of a kind of a commodity reflating environment. So how is that dynamic going to work as we progress through 2017 on your ability to continue to get price?","Nicholas Gangestad","Joe the total posted 10 basis points if we strip out the FX portion of that and then we're looking at flat to down very slightly of core underlying there. As I look at how this progresses throughout the year, we actually have a pretty steady view throughout the year Joe, if it changing much of just much of just having our core underlying price growth often in that 30 basis points to 50 basis points. I think the wild card on there is FX, the dollar been moving a lot and that as far as what we post for price growth in the quarters will be volatile in the coming quarters with some volatility based on what happens with the U.S. dollar primarily in developing markets.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Got you. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning all.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Steve.","Nicholas Gangestad","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Winoker","Just back to the pricing questions, specifically, you mentioned targeted actions that you took in the U.S. to drive some volume? Can you give us a little more color on what segments you were talking about, what areas?","Inge Thulin","Yes, Steve, it\u2019s in particularly isolated places, there is some places in our consumer business, where we took actions like that also in our Industrial business. Those are the most common places where we took those types of targeted actions Steve.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And with the trigger for that kind of thing, competitive actions was it particular projects I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of the implications for the broader pricing power in those businesses?","Inge Thulin","Steve, we take those actions when we see an opportunity either in the competitive landscape to take share that we otherwise want to have or in some cases it's a reaction to where we see pricing pressure from competitors and we price accordingly to maintain some other shares, so it's some of those Steve.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And then just a more specific question on E&E. Can you just give a little more sense in display materials systems, how much was OLED impact to this quarter and what the other kind of impact besides OLED was?","Inge Thulin","The OLED impact or just to put it in perspective, last December when Jim Bauman was laying out the OLED impact that we felt that would have on 2017 sales, we put a range between $50 million and $150 million of impact. We saw a number impact for total year 2016 right in the middle of that range and for the fourth quarter I would call it very similar to that of $20 million to $30 million range of impact on our total revenue. Steve that's the OLED impact on what we're seeing in the Electronics and Energy business.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And any major offsets to that?","Inge Thulin","Yes. As I mentioned, we are targeting to be increasing our penetration in some of the OEMs in China, electronics OEMs in China and we're seeing some success there. We're also targeting growth in automotive electronics and we're also seeing some successes there as well.","Steven Winoker","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","John Inch","Thanks everyone. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Hey, John.","John Inch","Hey Nick, hi Inge. How did the Dental business do sequentially? I don't remember you talking about that when you were describing the puts and takes in the Health Care performance. And it was under pressure, right in the third quarter? Did you see a similar trend in the fourth quarter?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. John, we saw our Oral Care down slightly, partly from softening end user demand and also what we see is continue channel contractions in the Oral Care business.","John Inch","Do you have any sense of the underlying - it's one thing if it's one quarter, because sometimes dental, it seems is a little bit of a canary in the coal mine, right, for the economy. But now the economy, based on your own commentary and what other companies are saying, seem to be picking up. So what do you attribute then, I suppose the continuation of the soft dental? Is there a way you could frame what you've seen and maybe provide some historical context?","Inge Thulin","Yes. I think what you saw in the last quarter of the year, basically the two things is inventory reduction in the channel, because it's very much distribution-oriented and that's based on lower demand in the end market. And I think that was based-based relative to United States and West Europe. Now, if you think about both in consumer and you think about the business like Oral Care, the supply chain there is very sophisticated.","So what we have to look upon is sell-in and sell-out, and I think in those cases, what you will see as demand will by definition should go up and I think the facts are telling us that in that industry in Oral Care then they would build up inventory, again, as you go into the year. But for us, we look upon those businesses, they are very good partners of ours and they are very professional very, very professional in the supply chain, so they do the right thing in terms of adjusting their level of inventory if they see a softness. What they are telling us now is they see demand coming back as you roll into 2017.","If you move from Oral Care and go back and I was not sure that came across. If you take our consumer business that was down 1% in terms of sell-in from us, sell-out on our top customers in U.S. was 3%. So in 3% that's the historical base for consumer for the last couple of years.","So from that perspective, I think the retail channel stay, so maybe some softness for them, generally speaking in the end of the holiday season they did the right, they just managed through their inventory and for me that's a very professional way of doing business. Our sell-out was the same indicating for me as we move into 2017 that inventories will be filled back because the demand will steady in the end market, but I think they did the right thing in terms of the retail channels.","John Inch","Well, I certainly give away your products as Christmas gifts, so don\u2019t let me\u2026","Inge Thulin","We can do more.","John Inch","Yes, bigger gift bags. Just as a follow-up, you mentioned divesting non-core IP in the Electronics and Energy business. Nick or Inge, could you expand on this? What exactly is this and do you have like this reserve of IP that in theory, you could keep divesting to take gains? Or was this a one-off event or just a little more context on what ultimately happened in that segment please?","Nicholas Gangestad","John, I think this is much more of a one-off. There was a particular set of IP that we had developed and we're using years ago, we reached a point where we felt we no longer needed it for our own business and we were licensing that IP, we chose in the fourth quarter to sell that IP and our relationship with that that particular IP we had in Electronics and Energy. To your question, is it a broad thing that we have a stable of these we\u2019re ready to go with? The short answer is no.","John Inch","Okay. And then when you say it wasn't core, is there anything you'd say about the IP you sold? What was it for or is it pertaining to anything you downsized or something?","Nicholas Gangestad","No, it's something related to our electronic materials solutions division and that's about as deep as I'll go with that, but it really is not related to anything we divested.","John Inch","Got it. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone.","Inge Thulin","Good morning.","Robert McCarthy","I guess the first question is in terms of just thinking about your overall explicit exposure to energy and kind of the wider implications and [knock down] effects of your portfolio to energy, given what we've seen in the downturn, have you seen any encouraging trends across your businesses that you would cite to say with the stabilization in energy prices, you could start to see incremental growth in the back half of this year? Could you just comment about what you're seeing across your portfolio with respect to that?","Inge Thulin","Yes. I think first of all the answer is yes, we should see an uptick in the end of 2017 in the energy space and we have a very strong solid business in two utilities, right. That's a core 3M business and in fact this is a Heartland division. That division will do well.","What they have is they have an element of some project-based businesses and we had talked earlier about ACCR and there is some pipe coating as well that had a type of a negative effect in terms of comparison for 2016 and should benefit that business as you move into 2017.","The other business that we had a good quarter here is actually communication, what you will call telecommunication, but communication had a good quarter for us with 10% growth. It\u2019s a smaller business for us, but we did well. So I think the energy space for us should improve as we move into 2017.","Robert McCarthy","How do we think about the offsets in association with just kind of price cost and raws in the context of that though?","Nicholas Gangestad","Rob, as we contemplate where we see our raw material pricing going in 2017, we took a view of oil in the range of somewhere between $50 and $60 a barrel and that's why we're seeing diminished impact from market prices on our commodities benefiting us in 2017 versus what we've seen in 2015 and 2016.","So we\u2019re anticipating that in taking that into account. Most of our raw material or commodity benefits we\u2019re seeing are going to be the result of 3M efforts we're doing to take cost or substituting lower commodities. So there is an offset there and we think we\u2019ve pretty accurately taken the offset on both the revenue side and the cost side into account.","Robert McCarthy","One final one, obviously, I don't think you provide or disclose where your CapEx is spent explicitly, although, obviously, anecdotally you do. But just looking at kind of the typical Note 17 in your 10-Ks, you can kind of see a flavor of where your PP&E is. It's disproportionate in the U.S. unsurprisingly, and obviously, the PP&E has been growing reasonably well in the U.S. while it's been relatively flat, I would say, across the balance of the portfolio.","But could you comment on explicitly your CapEx kind of strategy for the U.S., any kind of metrics you could use? And really the spirit of the question is obviously with the prospect of a change in the tax law in association with the deduction of capital expenditures in the U.S. potentially, that's the nature of what I'm asking about.","Nicholas Gangestad","Rob, as you look at our total CapEx, we spent $1.4 billion on CapEx in 2016, a little more than half of that was spent in the United States, and it goes into a number of things, Rob. It goes into some of our business transformation investments; it goes into maintaining our capital base. Of all the areas of the world, the U.S. we have a very well developed capital base of manufacturing sites and investing in CapEx to maintain that, also some expansion in the United States that we've been investing in, so a little over half of it.","It's around the world though Rob, we are investing in capital as Inge as started out this morning and talking about we're investing in capital to align with where our customers are and aligning demand. So where we've been in the last few years, we've seen a little less international demand and a little higher U.S. demand and that has impacted our capital allocation. And going forward, we still anticipate a significant amount of our capital, for the next year or two; I won\u2019t be surprised that it's going to maintain being over 50% in the U.S.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yes. Just of the investment spending picked up this quarter relative to 3Q, so just wondering if you can be a bit more granular in terms of where you're spending. And in particular, you referred to some price actions to drive volumes particularly in the U.S. Would that fall under investment spending?","Nicholas Gangestad","I'll take the last part of that first Nigel that the changes in pricing that I talked about that would not be part of investment spending. What is included in our strategic investment spending that we called out that's impacting our margin by 70 basis points this quarter, theirs is two components. One is us taking actions on addressing our manufacturing supply chain footprint that we laid out last March at our five-year outlook meeting.","We\u2019ve been taking actions and that is part of what occurred in the fourth quarter, but also what's in that is investments we're making in growth in core platforms within 3M and that was part of what we\u2019ll also laid out in December. In 2017, we are accelerating our investments of approximately $100 million in these core growth platforms. We started that investment in the fourth quarter of 2016 and that makes up a little over half of the total of that strategic investment that we laid out for fourth quarter in our margin.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks Nick. And then a follow-on question on FX. We have seen a fair amount of divergence in the [indiscernible], RMB weaker, the real stronger. How is that impacting the translation impact? How is that impacting your margins? And the spirit of the question is, my understanding is that your EMs are generally higher margin than DMs. Is that still the case and is there any significant margin impact from translation of the currency movements?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. Nigel, what I've seen over time and what I'm seeing this quarter and into the futures it's less impacted by that particular mix, how it impacts our margin more dramatically is actually our hedging and sometimes it becomes counter intuitive Nigel that when the dollar - when we start to have the dollar stronger and negative impacts on our earnings per share from a stronger dollar. We can add for a period of time to see higher margins as our hedging gains step in and boost that margin. We have lower sales dollars from the translation, but higher margins. That's been a more impactful factor on overall margins we post and the mix of where the currencies are strengthening or weakening against the U.S. dollar.","Nigel Coe","Right. Okay, I'll follow up offline. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey. So at 1.6% I mean you're already kind of getting close to the mid-point of the organic guide for the year and you've got Health Care clearly way below what you would normally expect to be at and Consumer is negative. It seems like you feel pretty good about Industrial continuing to be strong. So are there any other offsets here? Because it would seem that you'd be tracking closer to the higher end of that organic guide, all else equal, unless there's something you expect to slow.","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. For 2017 Shannon, the 1% to 3% we\u2019re still right there. Yes, we like the fact where we ended in Q4 from an organic growth. But it's also in line with what we were anticipating in total, and it's in line with where we felt we needed to be for the 1% to 3% that we guided for 2017.","Inge Thulin","We would like to go ahead of our self right. So I think it's important just to make important as we roll into the year and see more evidence of the positive movement, we saw here in the end. But as you said, investment we are doing the initiative we have around growth right because you look upon 3M as you see it now the efficiency in this organization is incredible and you see what we do in terms of EPS growth, free cash flow conversion, return on invested capital. We can get growth up even more that will get very good return for all of us. So that\u2019s why we focus in and make sure that we will execute on that, but we will not over promise anything to you at this point in time.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Thanks. And then just on Mexico, I mean you talked about - I think you said double-digit growth there again this quarter. 3M has always been good at monitoring and managing through different global risk areas. I mean what's your current view there? Are you seeing any change in activity and do you do any kind of scenario planning around your position there in particular?","Inge Thulin","No, we don't, we have had very have strong growth in Mexico for quite sometime and it is an important local market for us, right. We have been there for many, many years. In Latin America, we have a very good growth rate for this quarter and we have been in that part of the world with our domestic business since 1946, right that we start operation in Brazil 1946. We have huge operations and it's very much locally driven and that is our strategy.","So 10% growth in Mexico growth in the quarter is a good result, Brazil had 1%, so look like they're coming back a little bit, but we are not changing anything as I said - as I start the call here. Our strategies around localization and if you go back to what we have talk about, we never left United States. We expanded international based on the local market opportunity, right. So I think that's how you should view 3M in the business model that we are using?","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Thanks.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just a couple things, a lot of ground covered here. First, Nick, I was just wondering, back on the December guide, although the broad strokes have not changed, are you within the range of all those individual kind of bucket items that you gave us, [down through] pension, tax, et cetera, et cetera?","Inge Thulin","Jeff, yes. The short answer is, yes. A couple I\u2019ll just put on the - I'll explain. Pension I'd originally guided $0.00 to $0.10 headwind now that we have that all locked in that will be an 8% headwind for the year. And then tax rate since it ended a little lower, we\u2019re still seeing at a 28% to 29% tax rate in 2017. Back in December, I was saying I expected to be a little bit of a tailwind probably would be more neutral on for us for 2017 right now.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay, and also this is for Nick, could you just update us on your stranded cash, probably all your cash is outside the U.S. or some 90%. But do you cap the break near-term on share repurchase? Waiting to see if we get some kind of repatriation or something, or do you kind of proceed as normal on the borrowing and repurchase tempo you've been on??","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, our total cash Jeff is we have just a little over $2 billion of cash outside the United States. It's not a large number. I'm sure you're aware of this Jeff. We've been going to a number of efforts to be optimizing our global optimizing our global cash position and we've been managing that global cash balance down especially our international cash balance down. So our current capital allocation plan, we can execute that without any kind of tax reform or any kind of action.","And it's really too early for me to comment on if something were to happen of what we do. We're obviously prepping and preparing and will act accordingly to take advantage of whatever kind of legislation occurs, but I think it's too early for me to comment on how that would change our capital allocation right now.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thanks, and just finally, if you wouldn't mind, any color that you could share on January? Has there been any kind of change in behavior as we slip into the New Year, particularly in shorter cycle Industrial markets in particular would be of interest?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, just as far as the year is starting, we're not seen any kind of change in the trajectory that we were anticipating. It's consistent with what we were expecting when we guided 1% to 3% and nothing really changing out of the norm for us, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning.","Nicholas Gangestad","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","I will ask Jeff's question in a slightly different way about what you're seeing. Inge, I think you said that there are reasons to get excited, and I was wondering if you could share any anecdotes, obviously, without changing the guidance, that makes you more excited.","Inge Thulin","Yes. As I said earlier, when you look upon it in terms of our performance for this quarter and the momentum you have seen after some time where there has been slower growth right, but if you start to look upon elements that look positive for you. For me that will be like we had a good quarter in United States, right. United States grew 5% in the quarter.","Japan grew 2% and China grew 11% excluding electronic. Electronic was 6% and we have had three consecutive quarters in Germany with growth. If I look upon that and I think about big economies in the world United States, Germany, Japan and China on a positive movement forward I feel better about it.","I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overly excited because overall you also have some tempering in Central East Europe and Middle East\/Africa and that will hold for some time. But I would say that that's what I see. I saw our Industrial business have a good growth and then I take those geographical pieces together.","Safety and Graphics continue to have a solid performance. Health Care, I'm convinced it will come back for us. And then as I said earlier Consumer when you look upon sale in and sail out, it's not the concern. But I think if you take for all of us, the bigger picture of growth coming in the two biggest economies in the world and then you add Germany and Japan to that, if you are 3M, which is about technology conversion and demographic shift. They look slightly better today than it is six to nine months ago.","Andrew Obin","Let me just ask a follow-up question. One of your competitors highlighted that they're seeing a meaningful, positive impact from the change in one child policy in China. What are you guys seeing in Health Care and Consumer in China? Can you identify it and does it provide any potential upside to your thinking for the second half of the year?","Inge Thulin","It should by definition and if you look upon those two businesses for us in China specifically, we had 17% growth for Consumer in the quarter; we have 15% growth in Health Care for the quarter and that's a positive outcome and those business even if they are small for us, if you look upon our portfolio in China, the two biggest in size for us is Electronics and Energy, and Industrial right because of the evolution of that economy.","But what will come is Consumer and Health Care. So when you\u2019re running them at 15% to 17% that's a good signal for us. We have a huge penetration opportunity there and they are both local domestic markets right, so no export by definition.","Andrew Obin","And you have the capacity to meet this demand?","Inge Thulin","Absolutely.","Andrew Obin","Thank you very much.","Nicholas Gangestad","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Tusa","Hi guys, thanks for going over the hour to fit some of us in. I appreciate it.","Inge Thulin","Hi, good morning, Steve.","Stephen Tusa","Lots of questions asked just on the forward look here into the early part of the year. The Street has you guys APS kind of flat year-over-year, but normal seasonality from the fourth quarter, if we adjust some of these gains et cetera out, gets you to something that's a little bit higher than that in the 210-ish range.","Is there anything unusual about the year-over-year comp that we should be keeping in mind for the first quarter? Maybe just a little bit of color, I know that the Street basically has you guys flat, but they have you growing for the year. So do the trends out of the fourth quarter change that view to make you feel a little bit better about being able to grow earnings here in the first quarter?","Inge Thulin","Steve for the quarters of 2017, I would call this remarkably stable year of nothing particular to call out quarter-by-quarter to be thinking about the only thing on the margin - on the hedge that I'd say is strategic investments that I talked about earlier that we started in Q4. Those will be more heavily weighted in the first part of the year. In fact I expect strategic investments in first quarter to be very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Stephen Tusa","Okay, so you expect to grow earnings in every quarter essentially?","Inge Thulin","I think Steve you're trying to turn me into a quarterly guided here, for the year we\u2019re\u2026","Stephen Tusa","It\u2019s pretty vague question.","Inge Thulin","Yes, I'll just leave it. We don't see a lot differentiation of the core underline business quarter-to-quarter.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. So when you guys talk about strategic investment that's I would assume outside of R&D because R&D as a percentage of sales was I think down a little bit in the quarter that stuff that is not considered just R&D I would assume?","Inge Thulin","A very little of our strategic investments if any is R&D. This is really about commercialized for the growth side of it. It's really about investments we're making and commercializing what we already have.","Stephen Tusa","Okay, super. Thanks a lot.","Inge Thulin","And Steve, just one more point, I\u2019m going to repeat a point from December. Growth we expect to be largely aligned for the year across most of our business the one exception is Health Care. I just want to remind you, we expect Health Care growth to accelerate growth to accelerate as the year goes on.","Stephen Tusa","Great, thank you.","Inge Thulin","Okay. Thanks Steve,","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over Inge Thulin for some closing comments.","Inge Thulin","Thank you. To wrap up, the fourth quarter completed a successful year for our enterprise. In 2016 we executed our playbook and post strong financial results in terms of EPS and margins along with free cash flow and return on invested capital. At the same, we continue to simplify organization and improve our cost structure while making investments for the future. As a result, we are positioned for a strong 2017 and we'll capitalize as growth conditions improve.

Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, January 25, 2018.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President, and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our 2018 investor events. Please turn to Slide 2. This year's earnings conference calls will be held on April 24, July 24 and October 23.","Please take a moment to read our forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Finally, please that throughout today's presentation we'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures, including measures which exclude the impact of the tax cuts and Jobs Act. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation and press release.","Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll hand it off to Inge. Inge?","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Bruce and good morning, everyone. I will open with some comments on the fourth quarter and later in the call I will recap our full year performance.","3M had a strong finish to 2017 delivering robust organic growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. We posted record sales and expanded our profitability while continuing to invest in the business. Looking at the numbers, we increased to $2.10 per share, up 12% year-on-year. Note, that this excludes the impact of tax reform recently enacted in the United States which Nick will discuss in detail. Our team delivered total sales of $8 billion, an all-time high for the fourth quarter.","Organic growth company-wide was a strong 6% as our fundamental strength are enabling us to capitalize on an improving global economy. This includes very good performance from Electronics & Energy and Safety & Graphics, both of which grew 11% organically. Organic growth in our consumer business accelerated to 5%, its third consecutive quarter of positive growth. Industrial grew 4% organically and healthcare grew 3%. Organic growth was also broad-based across geographic areas led by Asia-Pacific at 12% and Europe, Middle East, Africa at 7%. The United States and Latin America, Canada each grew 3% organically.","Turning to margins; our team executed well and expended margins to a healthy 23% with four of our five business groups above 22%. We also continue to invest in the business including research and development in CapEx while returning significant cash to our shareholders. In the quarter we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","That concludes my opening remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick?","Nicholas Gangestad","Thank you, Inge. Let me begin with a topic that is top of mind this earning season; the tax cuts and Jobs Act, and its impact on our fourth quarter results and beyond.","Please turn to Slide 5; following the passage of the new tax legislation we recorded a net tax expense in Q4 of $762 million or $1.25 per share resulting in fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share. This net tax expense includes the onetime transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as true-ups of tax deferred assets and liabilities. Excluding this impact fourth quarter earnings were $2.10 per share, an increase of 12% year-on-year. In addition, as a result of tax reform we now expect our 2018 tax rate to be between 20% and 22% versus the prior range of 26% to 27%. Inge will provide more details on our updated 2018 guidance later in the call. Please note, that the balance of my prepared remarks today will exclude the impact of U.S. tax reform on 2017 earnings.","Please turn to Slide 6 to review fourth quarter sales. Sales growth remained strong in Q4, up 6% organically as we continue to outperform the markets we serve. Selling prices continue to improve throughout the year with fourth quarter up 20 basis points. Excluding our electronics businesses, selling prices were up 40 basis points; our strongest quarterly pricing performance in 2017. The combination of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 30 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. This impact relates to the fourth quarter acquisition of Scott Safety, net of the divestiture of non-strategic businesses over the last 12 months. In addition, foreign currency translation increased sales by 2.7 percentage points. All in, fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 9% versus last year.","In the U.S. organic growth increased 3% with all business groups delivering positive growth. Growth was led by high single digit increases in both, Safety & Graphics and Electronics & Energy followed by consumer of mid-single digits. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 12% in Q4. All business groups within Asia-Pacific posted strong growth in the quarter led by double-digit increases in Safety & Graphics, Electronics & Energy and healthcare. Organic growth was 18% in China\/Hong Kong, and 7% in Japan. Excluding Electronics, China\/Hong Kong grew 19% and Japan was up 5%.","Moving to EMEA; organic growth was 7% in Q4 with West Europe up 5%. All business groups grew in the quarter with Safety & Graphics and Consumer leading growth in the area. Finally, Q4 organic growth in Latin America\/Canada was 3% led by a mid-single digit growth in consumer, industrial and healthcare. At a country level, Canada delivered strong organic growth of 8% while Mexico and Brazil were both up 3%.","Please turn to Slide 7 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Companywide fourth quarter sales were $8 billion with operating income of $1.8 billion, up 9.4%. On a GAAP basis fourth quarter operating margins were 22.8% or 23.8% adjusting for year-on-year impacts from M&A, strategic investments and divestiture gains.","Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter. Leverage on organic volume growth and productivity contributed 150 basis points to operating margins. Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by a net 60 basis points, this result includes a 90 basis point impact related to the Scott Safety acquisition which closed in early Q4. The combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 40 basis points to operating margins. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 60 basis points and higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 20 basis points.","Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.10 per share, up 12% year-over-year. The benefits from organic growth and productivity were the predominant driver of earnings growth, contributing $0.33 to per share earnings in the quarter. On our October earnings call we described four items that would impact the fourth quarter, each of them came in as expected with per share earnings headwind of $0.07 from the acquisition of Scott Safety, $0.06 from incremental strategic investments and $0.11 from our high coupon debt tender while we recorded a benefit of $0.12 from the divestiture of the electronic monitoring business.","In addition, there are two other items that I would like to comment on that impacted fourth quarter earnings. First, we updated our reserves for future potential respirator mask claims that we estimate could occur over the next several decades which resulted in a $0.07 year-on-year earnings headwind. Secondly, our Q4 tax rate was 23% versus 28.2% in the prior year which increased earnings by $0.13 per share. The lower tax rate was driven by increasing benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, geographic profit mix and equity-based compensation.","Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.4 billion with free cash flow conversion of 268%. Included in these results is the impact of the tax cuts and Jobs Act along with a U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that we made following the signing of tax reform. The net impact of these two items benefited Q4 free cash flow conversion by 112 percentage points. For the full year free cash flow conversion was 100% with a 3 percentage point benefit from tax reform, net of our $600 million pension contribution.","Turning to CapEx; fourth quarter capital expenditures were $459 million with the full year totaling $1.4 billion. Also in the fourth quarter we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. For the full year 2017 we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders including cash dividends of $2.8 billion and gross share repurchases of $2.1 billion.","Looking ahead to 2018 we remain encouraged by the numerous opportunities to invest in the business to improve both, growth and productivity while continuing to return significant cash to our shareholders. Thus in light of these opportunities coupled with tax reform we are increasing the top end of our 2018 CapEx expectation $100 million to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. In addition, we now expect gross share repurchases in the range of $2 billion to $5 billion versus $2 billion to $4 billion previously.","Let's now review our business group performance starting with industrial on Slide 10. The industrial business group posted organic growth of 3.9% in Q4 and 4.9% for the year. Our heartland businesses within industrial had a good finish to the year with abrasives up high single digits. Industrial adhesives and tapes and automotive aftermarket both grew mid-single digits in the quarter. Our automotive OEM business was up 5% continuing its consistent track record of outpacing growth in global car and light truck builds. Finally, the separation and purification business grew low single digits while advanced materials declined year-on-year against last year's strong comp. On a geographic basis industrials organic growth was led by a high single digit increase in Asia-Pacific followed by mid-single digit growth in both, EMEA and Latin America\/Canada.","Industrial delivered fourth quarter operating income of $527 million with an operating margin of 19.4%. Underlying margins were up 50 basis points year-over-year adjusting for incremental strategic investments and a Q4 2016 gain on divestiture.","Please turn to Slide 11; fourth quarter Safety & Graphic sales grew 10.7% organically with double digit increases across both, developed and developing markets. Our personal safety business posted double digit organic growth in Q4 with broad-based growth across all geographies. The roofing granules business had a strong finish to the year as a result of the rebuilding efforts following last fall's hurricanes. Transportation Safety was up mid-single digits with particular strength in reflective sheeting for roadway infrastructure. This business continues to transform its portfolio to focus on the connected roadways of the future. Geographically, Safety & Graphics grew organically across all areas led by an 18% increase in Asia-Pacific, 12% increase in EMEA and a 9% increase in the U.S. Operating income was $406 million and underlying operating margins were up 370 basis points year-on-year adjusting for the Scott Safety acquisition, divestiture impacts and incremental strategic investments.","Please turn to Slide 12; healthcare increased 3.1% organically in the fourth quarter. For the full year healthcare grew nearly 4% with second half organic growth of 5%. In Q4 our medical consumables business which includes advanced wound management and infection prevention solutions posted mid-single digit organic growth. Oral care delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter as we continue to post strong international growth, particularly in developing markets. Fourth quarter organic growth was led by high single digit increases in both Food Safety and Health Information Systems which posted its strongest growth quarter of the year. On a geographic basis healthcare grew across all geographies with continued strength in developing markets which were up 15% in the quarter. Healthcare's fourth quarter operating income was $464 million and operating margins were 31.5%.","Next let's cover Electronics & Energy on Slide 13. Electronics & Energy organic sales growth was 11% for the fourth quarter and the full year. The electronic side of the business grew 14% organically as our team continued to increase penetration on many OEM platforms globally including semiconductor manufacturing, electronic assembly, displays, data centers and automotive electrification. Our energy related businesses were up 4% organically with electrical markets up high single digits, partially offset by a decline in telecom. We continue to actively manage our Electronics & Energy portfolio in the quarter with the announced divestiture of the communications markets business. On a geographic basis organic growth was led by a 15% increase in Asia-Pacific although U.S. was up high single digits and EMEA up mid-single digits.","Fourth quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $334 million with operating margin of 25.2%. Underlying margins were up 80 basis points year-on-year adjusting for incremental strategic investments and the gain on sale of non-core intellectual property in Q4 2016.","Please turn to Slide 14; consumer continued to deliver improved organic growth in the fourth quarter, up 5.4%, its strongest quarterly organic growth since Q4 2014. Consumer posted organic growth across all businesses and geographic areas in the fourth quarter. Our home improvement business grew double digits organically continuing its track record of strong performance throughout 2017. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands such as Command, ScotchBlue, Infiltrate [ph]. We also saw good growth in consumer healthcare with notable strength in our next care branded bandages. Looking at consumer geographically growth was led by high single digit increases in both, EMEA and Asia-Pacific although U.S. and Latin America\/Canada increased mid-single digits.","Finally, operating income increased 18% to $269 million with an operating margin of 22.9%. That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 15 and I'll hand it back over to Inge. Inge?","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2017 we executed a 3M playbook and deliver on each of our four long-term financial metrics which we laid out at our Investor Day in March 2016. We posted earnings of $9.17 per share, a 12% increase year-on-year. Organic growth was a robust 5% with positive growth across all business groups and geographic areas. We posted free cash flow conversion of 100% along with a return on invested capital of 21%, and for the fourth consecutive year we expanded margins companywide coming in at 25% in 2017.","Beyond these financial results we continued to make good progress on our three key levers which are significant value creators. The first lever is portfolio management. In October we finalized the acquisition of Scott Safety as we continue to build strings-on-strings in our personal safety portfolio. At the same time we divested four businesses that no longer align with our strategic objectives. Portfolio management is strengthening our competitiveness and making us even more relevant to our customers and the marketplace.","I will move onto investing and innovation which is the second lever. 3M's primary growth metric is organic local currency sales growth as we invent unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers. That is why research and development is the heartbeat of 3M; and in 2017 we invested $1.9 billion in R&D or 6% of sales. And as you can see in our results, these investments are paying off in terms of organic growth and also our premium margins and return on invested capital.","Business transformation is the third lever which starts and ends with our customers. The rollout of ERP system in West Europe is nearly complete and we have started initial deployments in the United States. I'm pleased with how our teams around the world are executing business transformation which is already benefiting our customers and 3M.","In summary, 2017 was a strong year for our enterprise and we are positioned to build on our momentum and deliver another successful performance in 2018.","Please turn to Slide 16; here you see our updated planning estimates for 2018. We now anticipate earnings of $10.20 to $10.70 per share, up from the previous range of $9.60 to $10. Our tax rate is expected to be 20% to 22% versus the prior range of 26% to 27%. The remainder of our guidance is unchanged. Organic growth is expected in the range of 3% to 5% and we continue to anticipate strong performance in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion.","Please turn to Slide 17; for more than a century the strings of 3M business model has enabled us to invest in the business while also returning cash to our shareholders; this has included a strong steady and rising dividend which is a hallmark of our enterprise. Over the last five years we have doubled 3M's special dividend and today we are announcing a 16% increase in our first quarter dividend for 2018 to $1.36 per share. This marks 60 consecutive years of dividend increases and reflects confidence in our ability to continue generating premium returns in 2018 and beyond.","With that I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","My first question is on Electronics & Energy; clearly you guys are exiting especially in the electronics segment, exiting the year very strongly yet a couple of companies in the supply chain reported yesterday very good results, yet the organic growth profile is still expected at 1% to 4% for 2018. Is that just conservatism or are there other puts and takes that we need to be aware of for this year?","Inge Thulin","First of all, we are very pleased with the momentum we see in that business and you see those multiple things that is moving us forward and it's all coming back to the way we have repositioned the portfolio in the past. We are coming off stronger in the end of the year than we went into the year for 2017. As Nick said in his remarks, we continue to be expecting on multiple platforms and that should of course reflect more growth as we go. It's too early for us however as we asked into the third week of January to exchange the guidance that we have for the total enterprise and all that business. But I would say that the momentum is there and we see this as a very positive business for us as we move ahead but it's too early for me and for us to change the guidance but I wouldn't be overly concerned at all about that business.","Joe Ritchie","Maybe shifting gears a little bit; Nick, just focused on capital allocation for a second saw that growth repurchase number went up, it seems like you've got a little bit around $4 billion or so on your balance sheet. Do -- should we be thinking about the pace of capital deployment being a little bit faster now that you have access to your international cash as well?","Nicholas Gangestad","The big longer term picture of our capital allocation plan that's not really changing, the way we're investing first in the business, supplementing that with acquisitions that we think makes sense and fit well with our business and then also returning cash to shareholders, that whole capital allocation strategy is unchanged, tax reform and the ability to access international cash a little easier does give us added flexibility. And in the short-term you're seeing a few things change, slightly raising the high-end of our CapEx range, also on our share buybacks and our 16% dividend increase. Those are the things in the short-term they are immediately changing, I will also point out that late in the year we did add an extra $600 million to our U.S. pension immediately following the U.S. signing of this into law. So in the short-term those are the things we're doing but the long-term, our overall strategy isn't changing.","Joe Ritchie","And if you don't mind me just sneaking in one more; I just wanted to ask you about FX, I saw that you guys didn't change your guidance for FX but the dollar has weekend since you originally gave guidance. So two part question; shouldn't you have a better benefit from FX or is your hedging policy not going to allow you to have an increased benefit? And then secondly, typically you're able to pass-through greater price when the dollar weakens and so if you can comment on that that would be helpful.","Nicholas Gangestad","To the first point even as recent as last week when we look at our exchange rates and the impact on our earnings, $0.10 that we guided in December that's a very good estimate for the total year. If that changes we'll start to modify that but I think that's still a very solid number to go with. To the second part of your question, I think you may have it reversed when the dollar strengthens against developing markets in developing market economies that's where we see some upward price actions that we take; it's usually not in the reverse.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Inge, can you talk about the 11% growth that you saw in Safety & Graphics in Q4? We obviously remember you saying that Safety & Graphics is the next potential big breakout candidate; do you think that the big difference now in Safety & Graphics is commodity based growth within personal safety and really starting to come back and this uplift actually looks sustainable in '18 given the higher commodity prices and maybe it's all the work you've done in portfolio management but how does that make the 4% to 6% organic growth guidance for '18 look? Could it actually end up being conservative?","Inge Thulin","Well, first of all your memory is good. I said that that is our next breakout business and it is the breakout business as we speak, right. And if you think about the portfolio there, we also in that business as we did in EEBG took some very heavy lifting relative to the portfolio, it took us more than three years, one was four years to complete, right; so you think about that portfolio how we have let some businesses get new onus where we didn't see that we could accelerate and develop those businesses to a level that we in 3M expect us to deliver, and then we build out specifically in personal safety to today be a world-class leader in the whole personal safety area. That is continuing, that's a fantastic business for us, [indiscernible] speak when you look upon the portfolio, that is -- in some cases regulated businesses and in some cases is more consumables that we capitalize on.","So in my view the other thing that is working as a positive for us is, we have now sought out also our portfolio in traffic safety. Traffic safety today is back to the core, is back to what we know how to do and where strings are; and as you know, we are also linking that business now together with automotive electrification where we now have automotive, we have EEBG and we have Safety & Graphics working on initiatives around that whole space. So I would say that again, it's a little bit early but the momentum is very good in that business, generally speaking, and it's not only personal safety. We saw now for the first time a shift to us in traffic safety that will actually be positive for us as we move ahead. Again, it's too early, I would like to make changes if you can or you're very confident to the growth rate for the year but as you know, I'm also a little bit conservative so I will wait with that, do we have at least one or two quarters behind us so we with confidence can give you different figure. But again, this is a fantastic business and I'm as proud of what they have done a some in EEBG in terms of really direct those businesses to much more relevant place for us where we can grow in a very profitable way?","Nicholas Gangestad","It looks like you're stationary in office business with consumer goods sit first time in several quarter and you mentioned in the presentation itself the e-commerce. Do do you think the channel environment issues that you've facing in that segment are behind you or is it that you've just getting penetration into those feel even three things in math fragmenting out behind you or is it that you're just getting better penetration into the van market three commissariat off the channel inventory issues. I think is both, you know we have talked about that business for some quarter in terms of the inventory position for them right and we have -- I think in every quarter have had better sales out than sales in right; so they have adjusted their position in that space. So I think it's both, you coming to a point where your comparison is easier but also inventory levels is on a better level. So we don't see at this point in time an issue with inventories in that space for the consumer business. So this is in fact the third consecutive quarter that our consumer business group is growing, this time by 5% and in fact also to a price which is very good.","On a companywide as you touch on online sales, for us in the quarter our online sales as an enterprise was up 21% and for the year was 13%; so it's moving in the right direction for the consumer business so we're very pleased with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis","The sky assets you bought, it's an interesting business; if there is one reason another title is never really able to grow it -- I think it was kind of 1% grow forever. What can you guys do differently with this thing? Is it more function of -- taking the brand more globally? Is there other things that you can do to get it upto really a 3M average growth type business?","Inge Thulin","I think first of all for us that brings synergy, it brings scale and efficiency into the SCBA priority categories, right. So I think from that perspective we can add it in and become much more relevant to the customers on the market. And so the presence in gas detection is becoming much much more relevant for us and it enhanced our ability to deliver on customer solutions; so if you think about that whole personnel safety space if you like, we have now build that out from initially started to be world leader in respiratory products and then we purchased some years back, maybe 5 to 8 years back we purchased cornels [ph] welding business and then here in the later years we purchased capital safety which is full protection and now Scott Safety that is building us out in that whole space.","So by definition we will be able to drive the synergy in scale in that business and be more relevant to big customers around the world, right. They are looking for as few supplier as possible but this is a regulated business, they also would like to work with companies that have a high reputation around quality and safety and that's what we stand for. So there is a lot of leverage there for us and that business is doing very well for us. We met the expectation in the quarter, the team is very energized, both our core team and the Scott Safety group that came into us. And you'll be able to now to manufacture and innovate safe products based on our technology. So we can add more on the technology side and I think we will be very effective into commercialization part of that business.","Scott Davis","Obviously, it's a great brand and anything called Scott has to be pretty good. Getting exciting I asked you a question that's kind of a little bit off the path here and I haven't asked this to any companies yet; I mean this Tax Act thing is really interesting and I haven't heard anybody comment whether this is something that can help you cut your tax -- your corporate G&A tax cost and supply chain. And what I mean by that is, I know that some companies didn't necessarily have the most optimized supply chain set up but inter-company, things moving around essentially just to avoid taxes -- I'm not accusing you guys of avoiding taxes, just saying there is some structures that were created maybe that weren't efficient overtime. Is there anything there and as far as actual costs that come down from this Tax Act is it just the fact you're just paying lower taxes or is this real -- is there something else there too?","Nicholas Gangestad","Scott, there is a couple of things I'll go into on this. One is, we've been on a journey for several years to be really optimizing our supply chain and how to operate that as efficiently and effectively as possible and part of that has been our centers of expertise that we've set up in different parts of the world to drive operationally efficiency; that also has some tax benefits to us and the strategies that we've put in place to optimize our supply chain that were relevant before, continue to be relevant for us and driving benefits for us going forward, in fact we're going to continue that type of effort and expand that.","Underlying of the impact of the tax reform; there are different pieces of that, some impacting different companies differently, obviously just lowering the tax rate to -- in the U.S. to 21% is a benefit to a company like 3M. But in addition, the U.S. Tax Code, the new U.S. tax law does give some favorable handling to companies that are net exporters out of the U.S. and part of the benefit that you're seeing 3M as we guide 20% to 22% is that we're a net exporter of approximately $3.5 billion out of the U.S. of what we manufacture, that's also part of that benefit that you're seeing for our company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","John Inch","Nick, why did U.S. pricing -- I apologize if you said this before; it looks like it got worst sequentially but you had very easy comparisons from last year. I'm surprised the U.S. went from minus 2 to minus 7 but your price in the U.S. goes from minus 2 to minus 3; what -- 0.3 obviously; what's going on?","Nicholas Gangestad","John, throughout all of 2017 -- I'll frame it just a little bit longer where -- if I go back to '15 and '16, less growth in the U.S., part of our focus in 2017 is ensuring that our U.S. operations are growing and productive and that's what we've seen so for instance in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter growing 3% organically. Now throughout the four quarters of 2017 in our U.S. we've been hovering around 20 or 30 basis points of price decline, the single biggest thing driving that John has not changed throughout the entire year and that's that as we now be -- now moving to growth in the U.S. we do have rebate incentive plans with our most loyal customers and our best performing customers that's been part of our business model and part of that model is, they get some price break via rebates and that's by far the single biggest thing impacting price that we're posting in the U.S. in 2017; really unchanged from the other three quarters of 2017.","John Inch","[Indiscernible] is not showing up within your segments because U.S. industrial core growth was up only 1% this quarter and it was up 5% last quarter but -- so I'm assuming that's not an industrially weighted rebate program, is that kind of on the consumer side, is that why consumer did a little better or\u2026","Nicholas Gangestad","John, there are some aspects of that in all of our businesses but the U.S. and Safety & Graphics I would say are more heavily weighted to having those types of pricing plans.","John Inch","So was there something about U.S. industrial as to why it seemed like its core growth slowed considering we're sort of living in what appears to be an accelerating industrial economy, certainly in the fourth quarter. Was there timing issues or mix issues or what was going on there?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, if you're looking at our growth in the U.S. in industrial, the one big thing I'll point out is fourth quarter of last year of 2016; we had approximately a $40 million defense contract that we won and sold that -- that quarter -- that is -- that's the single biggest thing, if we pulled that out we have had very nice accelerating growth in our industrial business.","John Inch","Kind of at what level though? So if you were to apples-to-apples, that defense business where is the U.S.? I'm just trying to get a sense of how your U.S. business is cadencing; is that kind of a low single digit, mid-single digit, what's the trend?","Nicholas Gangestad","Pulling that out we would have been in the mid-single digit range, John.","John Inch","Okay, so that makes sense. And then, just -- back to the pricing lastly; it's sort of obvious that there is inflation in the economy, I mean how far the inflation -- I mean U.S. economy, how far it carries is another matter but maybe Inge, what are your thoughts or neck it toward being able to recapture your own input cost pressures whether they'd be healthcare, rising wage pressures, other sort of things and being able to kind of pass that through and you sort of juxtapose that against what you've just described as a price down program to try and stimulate some U.S. volumes. So I guess this is rising in U.S. inflation and possibly a bit of a headwind incrementally for margins or how can you manage it?","Nicholas Gangestad","John, over a period of time we've been able to get 30 to 50 basis points of price growth. Now in 2017 we were approximately flat on price growth, we're highly confident in 2018 that we'll be back into the range of 30 to 50 basis points of price growth over \u2013 throughout 2018.","Inge Thulin","John, let me also correct you on one thing. You say the price down [ph] initiative is not the price down initiative; it is what Nick said you know, what is happening -- there is an increase in the incentive program rebates to the loyal customers and channel partners, that's what it is. So it doesn't start with a price down initiative and I'd like to correct you on that, it's not the price down; so what you see on that line with Nick clearly said to you and to us is to say it's about the incentive programs and we have set up now for two quarters in a row.","John Inch","Yes, I'm sorry; the volume rebates, the more you buy\u2026","Nicholas Gangestad","I thought you said price down and that's not correct.","John Inch","No, I think I misspoke. I do know what you mean and taking into -- I'm didn't mean to provide a cutting price, you're giving incentives for people to buy more.","Nicholas Gangestad","Exactly.","John Inch","So my last question that is the 30 to 50 given the pressures in the economy is that going to be enough Nick? Like, I don't have visibility into how much the emerging inflation in The United States is actually going to potentially pressure your operations; I mean historically you've got very strong margins so I don't expect substantial margin pressure, I just want to think -- understand how you're thinking about managing this.","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, in terms of how we're thinking about and managing 30 to 50 I feel highly confident on. Directionally, I feel there is more upside on that than downside, partially for what -- exactly what you're talking about John that inflationary environment and increasing raw material prices; if there is a bias towards that it's towards the high-end or above and not to the low end or below.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Couple of questions on the slide deck Page 8 on GAAP adjustments; and for Nick just starting on the tax rate, the benefit this quarter you called out supply chains but it lacks excellence and geographic profit mix. At $0.13 that's not related to tax reform, is that correct? And is this more -- is this a sustainable benefit or how would you characterize it?","Nicholas Gangestad","Deane, you are first of all correct, that has nothing to do with tax reform that we've isolated separately. And the three things I talked about, let me give you a little more depth of that -- of what's driving that. Year-on-year we are seen, our centers of expertise and their efficiency and the profitability in those grow and that's certainly a part of our strategy and sustainable that we expect and also captured in our 20% to 22% guidance for 2018. The geographic profit mix which is the smallest of the three is where do we actually earn that profit, how much is being earned in our highest tax jurisdictions versus the lowest and that will vary from year to year. And then the last is stock-based compensation, and we get a tax benefit as we have more of our employees exercising stock options; that one will be the most variable and as our stock price has gone up and we have employees exercising stock options we're getting a larger benefit from that than we've had a year ago.","Deane Dray","And then just as a follow-up; we're going through the segment color, auto came up a couple of different times, once in the electronic side on auto electrification and then it's always been in industrial. I'm just -- would like to hear from Inge on how you coordinate when a business or an end market crosses segments, the go-to-market strategy and -- are there additional kind of coordination efforts that need to make sure it goes smoothly?","Inge Thulin","Yes, there is. So first of all, we have appointed a Vice President to lead a portion inside of automotive that we call automotive electrification, and it's he that is coordinating the activities going on in the company relative to the face into the automotive business. We also monitor and manage the result out of that enterprise, so we look upon what we have called -- still call automotive business, OEM business and then we have a line out that we call automotive electrification underperformance of that; and we see that we are improving our performance in automotive electrification. So that piece of the business we had 15% growth in Q4 and in total of automotive we have done very, very well as well. So that piece is growing overtime and as we have said earlier, that's a $6 billion addressable market opportunity growing maybe 6% to 8%; and so that's big opportunity for us when we add those two together.","But it's working very well for us and -- then I said earlier; I think in addition for us from a competitive perspective is that we are both very engaged with the automotive OEM customer but also with the highway transportation authorities across the world in order to build out something that I think can be remarkable as you look down the road so to speak relative to that opportunity for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin","I just wanted to clarify on John's question regarding rebates in North America. Am I correct in thinking that you sort of have a growth rate in view and then you said rebates relative to this growth rate; so if people exceed them they get better rebates. So if you set the growth rate higher next year, rebates would kick in at a higher growth rate; is that a fair way of looking at it?","Nicholas Gangestad","Andrew, I'd say that's a very fair way of looking at it. We started with a growth expectation and 2017 is a year where many of our customers exceeded that growth expectation, getting higher rebates; that becomes part of the base as we reset those targets for the coming year. And in comparison in '15 and '16, we had below average rebate payments; so we're seeing it from '16 to '17 swing from below to above in '17. I think '18 will be more of a normalized year.","Andrew Obin","And just to go back on automotive electrification; I think Inge was quoted in The Wall Street Journal before the New Year sort of saying that you guys could have billions of opportunity from EV and I just can't resist but I ask -- but to ask at the Analyst Day, I think you sort of thought it was a great opportunity; Inge was quoted saying it was billions. If you could just sort of talk a little bit about sort of underlying assumptions about what the market looks like by the time you have those billions from EV and its billions -- $2 billion, $10 billion, anything will be appreciated. Thank you.","Inge Thulin","Well, as I said addressable market is $6 billion. And if you think about the whole area for us where we can make a difference in that whole industry and then put on the electrification to the cause, so we have some of management, we have light weightening, we have sensors were displaced, we have [indiscernible] and vertical signings and payment markings; so that's -- think about that in the whole area. If you look upon automotive electrification at this point in time, for us that's around $200,000 million in size and growing very fast. So the first billion should be in reach rather sooner than later but we'll take a couple of years. But for me and the team here, this is a unique opportunity for 3M to capitalize on our technologies and the connection we have in the industry because the industry here if you think about it, if you think very narrow then you think automotive and automotive electrification, this is bigger than that; this coming into the whole highway transportation area and I thought it's relative to regulations around it and we had been in Traffic Safety for over 80 years, we have the connection, we work with them daily; so when you put this all together we would be in a very, very good position to move forward.","So you know, we're very, very encouraged to what we see and the momentum and already early spec ins on the automotive -- on platforms that will not come immediately but is coming maybe 18 to 24 months out as those platforms go into production.","Andrew Obin","And when you say $6 billion of market opportunity, should we expect 3M to capture a 3M like market share within that market?","Inge Thulin","Why not? We don't commit in order to go in and do something less than that. So that is what you should expect and that's what we expect here, we expect that from ourselves, right; so that's -- when we commit to do it we will do it the right way and we will be focused on it. So we will take market share as we move ahead and I believe when we look upon these three to five years from now, I think we will -- maybe done it right, we will all say that was a masterstroke.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Tusa","Just on kind of next year, now that you have a betted [ph] more of a turn of the car drove to December -- how do you see kind of seasonality playing out; anything in the comparisons here in electronics or anything else that we should expect when thinking about quarterly growth progression as it move through the year or is it pretty steady all around the three to five?","Nicholas Gangestad","Steve, our view is it's a pretty steady throughout the year, we're not seen any big outliers one direction or the other, it's as pretty as close to down the middle of the road as we could be.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. And then this -- the CapEx; is that a minor step-up, is that sustainable longer term or is that just hey we're going to invest a little bit here with the new tax regime and it will begin to migrate back down over the long-term?","Nicholas Gangestad","Our longer term guidance Steve of 4.5% to 5% I still see that as the right long-term view but in light of what we see in the economy; in light of tax reform, in light of investment opportunities around disruptive technologies that can help us -- make us more efficient, all that in combination is causing us to up our planned spend slightly this year but 4.5% to 5% is still the right range in the longer term.","Stephen Tusa","And then one more; just when you look at the earnings bridge that you guys gave in December, any tweak to that? I guess strategic investments this year came in a little bit lower but there were some other moving parts like the legal settlement etcetera; so any anything in that bridge that moves around that you wanted to highlight, the earnings bridge?","Nicholas Gangestad","No, it is January; so other than the update in tax we're not changing anything. As things start to play out after a quarter or two, there might be some tweaks like we're clearly watching FX and what that's doing; raw materials that continues to be a moving target for us. And then share repurchase is another one that I say we continue to watch of what it's impact going to be on EPS.","Stephen Tusa","The gain in the safety business; did that run just to profit not the revenue, correct? Just to be clear.","Nicholas Gangestad","Correct, that was all through operating income, no revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker","Now that we're seeing Scott Safety be integrated capital; the last big one, before that I guess it was Polly [ph], so something like $5.5 billion been on the transactions and your result so far even if there was criticism about initial price paid on the street resulting to be pretty impressive as far as growth etcetera and I assume you're heading towards your return on capital targets. Are you thinking again in terms of the profile for 3M, the ability to kind of find and digest M&A becoming an even more accelerated part of the growth story at a nearer term or is it still just steady as she goes?","Inge Thulin","Well, as you know primary objective and strategy is organic local currency growth, right, and that's also why we invest in research and development with around 6%, right; last year that's like $1.9 billion, and that is the heartbeat of 3M, that is what is providing us with premium solutions for customers and premium returns for shareholders; I think that's an important element. Now we have shift activities in the portfolio in order to build out relevance with our customers and markets, and we will continue to do that in order to compliment as we move ahead in areas that we are interested to do and our pipeline is good, we have many alternatives to look upon and I think as we go you will see probably the same steady path as we had in the past.","So I don't think that has changed on that as we move ahead; as long as we get the growth on the investment we do in research and development and we do as we speak and we have also as you see stepped up to growth where we had complemented with good solid acquisitions that we've integrated to the company and I don't know if you recognize that but we have also worked with -- we buy world-class asset, we don't buy something that we need to fix and try to move in; and the reason for that is there should be good processes in place from the company we buy, there should be world-class management that can come into 3M and with this -- the four fundamental strings we have we can create value as fast as possible for our shareholders.","Steven Winoker","Nick, maybe you could put a fire point on the commodity side; I mean I know when a lot of the factories on that -- heist [ph] is another -- you guys appear certainly more vertically integrated than a lot of other multi-industrial model for a lot of reason but maybe just refresh us in terms of what the commodity exposure is these days and how you're thinking about just that side of the framework?","Nicholas Gangestad","Steven, in total we've spend between $7.5 billion and $8 billion a year on raw materials, commodities and some purchase finished goods to go into our cost of goods sold; it's approaching half of our total cost of goods sold. And it is spread out over a lot of different commodity basis but to put a bit of a finer point and this may or may not be what you're asking; we are seeing underlying commodity prices that were paying, we're seeing them go up and yet we are still reporting all in that we're getting some of the benefit. So in the fourth quarter it's a bit of a transition quarter for us that we are seeing slightly higher market prices we're paying for our commodities which currently are being more than offset by our own sourcing initiatives to bring down the cost of the materials and that can be revamping our products to use a lower raw material, can be changing the source of supply, can be some negotiations that we go through; that's still resulting in a net benefit for us year-on-year but the underlying commodity prices we are now seeing a year-on-year increase in those prices.","Steven Winoker","And can you size that all that the increase itself?","Nicholas Gangestad","1% or slightly less than 1%; it's still a pretty muted number for us.","Steven Winoker","And if you were advising investors to look at a few specific commodities for that 1% which one should we look at?","Nicholas Gangestad","There is about one-eighth of our entire commodity base that is petroleum based and when we first set our guidance we had an expectation of oil prices in the $50 to $60 a barrel, that's gone up; so there is some sensitivity there for oil derivative products that go into some of our tapes and adhesives and films.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line to Rob McCarthy of Stifel, Nicholas & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Robert McCarthy","On Steve's question about commodities, in particular oil; I mean in the past you have given a little bit more granular sensitivity, particularly in the retrenchment that occurred in 2014 through mid-2016 timeframe. Could you just kind of level set expectations on the upside with respect to that given the fact that oil started to move up pretty materially here and we could see even a potential oil shock if there is a geopolitical hiccup of some sort. And then, just -- if you could talk about maybe the embedded energy exposure of the portfolio overall because we probably learned a lot from the downturn about businesses that were tied into energy and affected the interim [ph] organic growth and how do you think about that sensitivity if we start to move our way up with the whole petrochem complex?","Nicholas Gangestad","Rob I think there's a couple different dimensions; I'll talk to the raw material side and then I'll talk to the market dimension side. What I've said in the past is a $10 move in oil manifest for us in about a $0.02 to $0.03 annual raw material headwind for us or $0.02 to $0.03 whatever direction oil is moving, it's going up, it's a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind for us and that comes from things like -- some of the resins we buy that have a crude oil derivative that goes into that. So that's on the commodity side but I think you also might be talking about the market itself; so when we saw oil prices drop late '14 into '15 our overall market exposure, we still see about 3% of our total revenue that's tied to the oil and gas industry. So if there is -- as we've seen that stabilize that's been a help to us and if there is an uptick that's certainly a positive for us on the revenue perspective.","Robert McCarthy","In the context of these continued progress on these European investments could you just kind of level set what your expectations for asking to be a longer term for SKU rationalization of the company? And what that could mean from benefits not only to operating margin through simplification and then working capital benefits, just risk -- you're carrying probably less inventory and less complex inventory; could you just talk about that?","Nicholas Gangestad","What we've laid out is that by 2020 we expect $500 million and $700 million of operating income benefit through what we're doing through our business transformation, as well as $0.5 billion of working capital coming out of our supply chain as a result of that; that remains unchanged. And in December I think if you were listening to what we are saying, we also are starting to see benefits beyond that that it's not a just a plateau of that and it's a steady state, we see that continuing to grow. Now topics like SKU rationalization, that is one component; we don't have it carved out of this is exactly what SKU rationalization is of that total piece but what we do see is looking at our portfolio, the SKUs we have which ones make sense which ones don't, that is part of what we're doing as we transform our business and our business processes. So it's a component, what I can't tell you is how much of a component that is of that total $500 million to $700 million that we're projecting.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff [ph] of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Nick, I've seen a few multinationals unable to bring down tax rate as much maybe all of us would have thought on some of the simple spreadsheet map, obviously that's about the case here for you. Some company is mentioning this so-called guilty tax as minimum tax issue, does that not apply to you? Does the export situation negate that? Can you give us -- if it's possible to give us a nutshell answer to that.","Nicholas Gangestad","The acronym guilty and the acronym beat those components that I know are negatively impacting some other companies are having a negligible or non-existent impact on 3M.","Unidentified Analyst","And then I was also just wondering back to the discussion around equity compensation on tax rate; any change on how we should think about the flipside of that equation, in other words the differences between gross repo and net repo as you deal with the dilution on the shareholder -- I'm sorry, on the employee side?","Nicholas Gangestad","In the past we've said that we need about $1 billion of share growth -- share repurchase just to offset that dilution; that's come down slightly, I believe it's right now around $800 million. That's not changing materially and we're thinking the $700 million to $800 million is a more longer term steady state of what we need just to offset dilution.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just finally, I heard what was said on the bridge; one that just jumps up for me a little bit though is pension. If I think about all those 2018 bridge items with the contribution here and I think a decent bump on the long. Is that dime [ph] a pension headwind fully baked in the cake or is that possibly moving around a little bit?","Nicholas Gangestad","That is the final number, so as the pension contribution helped it the lowering of interest rates and therefore our discount rates in the last few weeks of December more or less offset that; so it's call those a push and where I still write at the dime that we said.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","How should we think about incremental margins over the year that is -- should wage and input cost pressure increase in the second half?","Nicholas Gangestad","In the second half of 2018?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes.","Nicholas Gangestad","No. As far as wages what we're expecting for wage costs increases in 2018; it remains very similar to what we've seen in the last couple of years, really no change on our ability to generate incremental leverage. So we are not seeing a shift up or down in the pace of wage increases that we've seen historically.","Unidentified Analyst","And the second question; how long can you sustain the current pace of growth in Asia before you need to accelerate investment in new capacity?","Nicholas Gangestad","So we have been consistently investing in our capacity in Asia, working to increase our regional self-sufficiency of more and more that we are selling in the Asia Pacific is being manufactured in Asia Pacific. Right now we still have capacity and we will continue to sustain it, I don't see it a dramatic change in direction of the amount of CapEx going in, it's been at about the right pace and we think it's a pretty sustainable pace we're at; so I don't see a big direction change on that.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.","Inge Thulin","Thank you. To wrap up, the fourth quarter capped a strong year for us here at 3M; and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 3M team for their contributions to a successful 2017 and for moving us closer to our vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life. We are positioned well going into 2018 and we will deliver another successful year.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2015 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions.","As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, July 23, October 22 and January 26. Also take note of our next Investor Meeting, which is scheduled for December 15. More details will be available as we get closer to that date.","Today's earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2.","During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please turn to Slide 3, and I will hand out to Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. 3M executed well and delivered another solid quarter of operational performance. We once again posted broad-based organic sales growth and continued to improve profitability. Importantly, we achieved these against a more challenging first quarter economic backdrop.","The rising U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenues and profits, offset in part by hedging gains. In addition, global economic growth slowed, which we saw a bit in our growth figures. As 3M always does, we continue to manage two things within our control; execute our plan and build for the future.","I'll take you through the first quarter highlights. Earnings were $1.85 per share, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were $7.6 billion in the quarter, down 3% versus last year. Organic local currency growth was 3.3%.","For the seventh consecutive quarter, 3M posted organic growth in every business group as well as across all geographic areas. As I mentioned, the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly against a number of currencies, reducing sales by 6.5%.","We expanded company-wide margins to 23%, up nearly a full percentage point from last year, and all business groups delivered margins greater than 21%. Rising margins and broad-based organic growth are more evidence that our portfolio actions over the last three years are paying off. This quarter 3M took a number of additional steps to strengthening our portfolio.","We announce plans to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion, which will enhance our core filtration platform. Last month, we completed acquisition of Ivera Medical, a good addition to our Health Care business; and at the same time, we completed the sales of our Static Control business in January.","Also in the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, we increased the first quarter dividend by 20% on top of 35% increase last year.","Nick will now go through the details of the quarter. Nick?","Nicholas Gangestad","Thanks, Inge, and good mornings, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4, where I'll review the components of our first quarter sales change.","As Inge mentioned, in the quarter we delivered positive organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 3.3% with volumes up 2.3% and selling prices up 1%.","Two Health Care related acquisitions, namely, Treo Solutions and Ivera Medical, added 10 basis points to growth. This impact was offset by the divestiture of the Static Control business, which reduced sales by 10 basis points. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced sales by 6.5%. In U.S. dollars total sales declined 3.2% versus the first quarter of 2014.","The U.S. dollar strengthened significantly versus several foreign currencies during the first quarter, continuing the trend that began in 2014. In particular, the average euro rate declined 18% versus the U.S. dollar year-on-year. The yen declined 14% and the Brazilian real 19%.","Looking more closely at organic local currency growth, Asia-Pacific led the way at 5.6%. Safety and Graphics again posted the strongest growth in APAC at 9%, followed by Health Care at 8% and Electronics and Energy at 7%.","Organic growth was 7% in China\/Hong Kong or 8%, excluding electronics, similar to recent quarters. Japan was up against a challenging comp. Recall that Japan's organic growth was 20% in the first quarter of last year, leading up to the April 1, 2014, consumption tax increase.","EMEA organic growth was slightly positive in the first quarter, with West Europe flat, Central East Europe up mid-single digits and Middle East\/Africa down slightly. Organic growth in EMEA was led by Electronics and Energy and Safety and Graphics at 4% and 1%, respectively.","We posted 4% organic growth in Latin America\/Canada, where Industrial, Safety and Graphics and Health Care, all grew 5%. Mexico delivered another outstanding result with 15% organic growth in the quarter and Brazil was down 2%. The United States grew 3.1% organically with Industrial, Health Care and Consumer, each growing 4%; Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy, each grew 3%.","Please turn to Slide 5 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.6 billion, down 3.2%. Operating income on the other hand increased nearly 1% to $1.7 billion, and earnings rose over 3% to $1.85 per share.","Early in the year, it became apparent that business conditions would be more uncertain, particularly given that the U.S. dollar was moving higher. As always, we had contingency plans in place and we executed those plans as Q1 played out.","Gross margin improvements and strong SG&A productivity, allowed us to increase first quarter operating margins by 90 basis points year-on-year to 22.8%. For the full year, we expect operating margins to increase by a minimum of 1 percentage point.","Let's take a closer look at this quarter's margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 20 basis points to operating margins, and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion.","We continued to generate positive selling prices changes across our businesses, boosted by 3M's world-class material science and strong new product flow, both of which are important elements of our business model. In addition, we have been raising prices in select countries to help mitigate the impact of currency devaluations.","On the raw material front, we are benefiting from both lower commodity prices and from our sourcing team's ongoing negotiation efforts. We expect raw material benefits to gain momentum, as the year progresses. Productivity added 30 basis points to margins, as spending remains under good control in the quarter, and foreign currency impacts, net of hedge gains, were neutral to margins.","First year acquisitions were 10 basis points dilutive to our operating margin in the quarter. In addition, we continue to make other strategic investments, including disruptive R&D programs, along with business transformation and ERP. These investments reduced operating margins by 20 basis points year-on-year.","Finally, higher pension and OPEB expense reduced first quarter operating margins by 50 basis points. As a reminder, this year's pension increase is a result of the adoption of new mortality tables along with a lower discount rate.","Summarizing the first quarter P&L, our teams executed well in the face of currency headwinds and a more mixed economic backdrop. EPS expanded year-on-year and margins increased by nearly 1 percentage point.","Now, let's turn to Slide 6 for a closer look at earnings per share. Earnings for the first quarter were $1.85 per share, an increase of 3.4%. Organic growth and margin expansion contributed $0.14 to the EPS increase in the quarter. This included a $0.04 headwind from higher pension and OPEB expense.","Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $90 million or the equivalents of $0.10 a share. The first quarter tax rate was 29.5% versus 27.4% in the comparable quarter, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05.","The increase was due to geographic mix, which was influenced by the strong U.S. dollar. In addition, Q1 2014 included a one-time benefit that did not repeat. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings per share.","Now, let's review cash flow performance on Slide number 7. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, in line with Q1 2014. Capital expenditures were $291 million consistent with last year's first quarter. Our full year expected CapEx range is $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, down $100 million versus prior estimates, all due to the stronger U.S. dollar.","First quarter free cash flow was $789 million, and we converted 66% of net income to cash, in line with last year's first quarter. Note that the first quarter is typically our seasonal low. For the full year, we continue to expect to be in the rage of 90% to 100%.","As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 20%. We paid out $652 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Gross share repurchases were $886 million in the first quarter, and we continue to plan $3 billion to $5 billion for the full year.","Now, let's review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide number 8. Industrial with sales of $2.7 billion delivered organic local currency growth of 3% in the quarter. Our aerospace and commercial transportation, automotive OEM and 3M Purification businesses, all generated high single-digit growth. We also posted positive organic growth in advanced materials and industrial adhesives and tapes.","On a geographic basis, Latin America\/Canada set the pace, with organic growth of 5%. The U.S. was up 4%; Asia Pacific increased 3%; and EMEA was flat. We continue to invest for the future within Industrial.","During the quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Polypore's Separations Media business for $1 billion. This business is a leading provider of microporous membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments. The acquisition will enhance 3M's core filtration platform and help generate new growth opportunities across the company.","Wrapping up on Industrial's first quarter performance, operating income was $598 million and operating margins were 22.5%, up 20 basis points versus last year's Q1.","Now, let's turn to Safety and Graphics on Slide 9. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, increasing 4% organically. Personal safety grew high single-digits in the quarter. Workers safety remains a high priority for manufacturers globally, and we're gaining share.","In addition, our respiratory products are continuing to sell well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern. Commercial solutions and traffic safety and security, each posted positive organic growth, while roofing granules declined year-on-year.","Asia-Pacific delivered 9% organic growth, Latin America\/Canada increased 5%, the U.S. was up 3% and EMEA increased 1%. Operating income was $335 million and operating margins increased 2.1 percentage points to 24.4%. Margins in this business continue to be boosted by strong productivity and a keen focus on prioritization and portfolio management.","Let's now turn to Health Care on Slide 10. Health Care delivered sales of $1.3 billion and organic growth of 3%. Growth was strongest in food safety, critical in chronic care and health information systems. Our infection prevention and oral care businesses also posted positive growth in the quarter. The drug delivery systems business declined year-over-year.","Geographically, organic growth in Asia-Pacific was 8%, while Latin America\/Canada and the U.S. each grew 4%, EMEA declined 1%. In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically, marking the 13 consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high-priority investment area of ours for some time, as healthcare markets rapidly evolve in developing countries.","In March, we successfully closed the acquisition of Ivera Medical Corporation. This business will enhance 3M's vascular access products offerings to healthcare facilities. Integration is going smoothly and we look forward to expanding this business globally.","Health Care's operating income was $408 million and margins remain strong at 30.7%. Note that first quarter margins absorbed 40 basis points of dilution from the Ivera and Treo acquisitions. Therefore, underlying margins were 31.1%.","Next, we will look at Electronics and Energy on Slide 11. Electronics and Energy delivered 6% organic local currency growth in the first quarter, with sales of $1.3 billion. Organic local currency sales grew 12% in our electronics related businesses, as we continue to see strong consumer demand enhanced by spec-in wins at several OEMs.","In our energy related businesses, organic local currency sales declined 3%. The electrical markets business was flat, while telecom and renewable energy both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 7% in Asia-Pacific, 4% in EMEA and 3% in both U.S. and Latin America\/Canada.","The divestiture of the Static Control Business, which closed on January 2, 2015, reduced sales by 90 basis points in the first quarter. As a reminder, sales for this business were $46 million in 2014.","Operating income for Electronics and Energy was $283 million and margins increased 4.1 percentage points year-over-year to 21.4%. Recent portfolio management actions are improving our relevance with customers, enhancing our growth capabilities and contributing to higher productivity and margins.","Please turn to Slide 12. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1 billion, with organic growth of 2%. All four businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by Do-It-Yourself and Home Care, each growing mid-single digit.","Looking by geography, the U.S. grew 4% and Asia-Pacific increased 2%. EMEA and Latin America\/Canada declined slightly year-on-year.","Operating income increased to $240 million and margins were 22.9%. Margins rose 1.7 percentage points year-over-year. The business continues to drive efficiencies through investment prioritization and executing on productivity programs.","Before turning to our 2015 outlook, let me comment on corporate and unallocated. Net expense was $100 million in the first quarter versus $72 million in Q1 of 2014, with U.S. and pension postretirement expenses being the primary reason for the increase. For the full year, we estimate corporate and unallocated net expense to be approximately $400 million.","That wraps up our first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 13, where I will address our full year planning estimates.On organic growth, we expect 3% to 6% for the year, so no change versus prior thinking. Foreign currency translation is forecasted to reduce 2015 U.S. dollar sales by 6% to 7%, up from a previous range of 4% to 5%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect FX to reduce sales by 8%.","With respect to earnings, we now anticipate full year EPS of $7.80 to $8.10 per share versus a previous estimate of $8 to $8.30 per share. In our fourth quarter business review on January 27, recall that we estimated our foreign currency impacts would reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.20 per share. Of course, since then the dollar has strengthened further.","Today we estimate that foreign currency impacts will reduce 2015 full year earnings by $0.35 to $0.40 per share, or an incremental headwind of $0.15 to $0.20 per share versus our January estimates. These figures are net of hedging. For Q2 in particular, we anticipate that foreign currency impacts will reduce earnings by $0.13 per share.","For the tax rate, we anticipate a range of 28.5% to 29.5% versus 28% to 29% prior. The stronger U.S. dollar is impacting our profit mix by country, which is leading to a higher effective tax rate. Finally, no change as it relates to free cash flow conversion. We continue to expect a range of 90% to 100% for the year.","I will now turn the call back to Inge for a few final comments.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Nick. I am pleased with the performance of our team in the first quarter. We executed our playbook and delivered solid results in a tougher external environment. Now, more than ever, our teams remain keenly focus on efficient growth, focused both on organic growth, and of course, productivity.","As Nick described, we also took a number of additional steps to carefully manage first quarter expenses in anticipation of a difficult economic environment, clearly necessary given external realities.","As we navigate short term challenges we also continue to invest for long-term success. This includes portfolio investments, as I mentioned earlier, as well as our ongoing commitment to building our core strengths. I have talked to you before about 3M's four fundamental strengths, which are leveraged across our enterprise: technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and our brand.","On technology, for example, we increased R&D investment in the quarter while at the same time managing our SG&A investments very carefully. We expanded 3M's global capabilities including breaking ground on the new customer innovation center in Chengdu in West China.","As you heard from Nick, our 3M China team continues to execute well delivering 7% organic growth. We remain very optimistic about 3M's future in China. And our new innovation center in West China will allow us to collaborate even more closely both, the local and global customers and help us take advantage of growing opportunities in that region in China.","In March, we also refreshed our brand platform, which includes our new tagline: 3M Science Applied to Life. Through our brand work, we will enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to solve problems and improve lives.","So in summary, it was a solid first quarter for 3M. Our team performed well against tough economical headwinds, and we continue to make investments for the future. And by that we are now open to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Inge, perhaps maybe just focusing on organic growth for a second, the 3%-plus that you did this quarter was towards the lower end of your full year range, and yet as you progressed through the year your comps are going to get a little bit more difficult, so maybe you can just talk about the portfolio and the confidence and perhaps seeing some organic growth acceleration as the year progresses.","Inge Thulin","Yes, you're right. It was little bit slower than we have seen in the past. The way I looked upon it is specifically as you came off Q4, it was around 6%, but I think overall when you look upon the economy around the world, the fourth quarter was much stronger than what we saw in the first quarter on a global basis. So I think first of all, our performance relative to IPI is in the level as we have seen in the past.","I think when you look upon our performance, as you see there, you see a little bit of lower growth in Health Care, which is related to basically one thing, but you can add them together. One, it's relative to West Europe and it's relative to our Drug Delivery Systems, that is I would say, a project-based business. So you will have some businesses going in and out of that business based on yearend or quarter. So when I look at on Health Care, that's basically where you can see. And our core business in Health Care did very well again, and as you see we maintain very high margin, et cetera.","And when I look upon Industrial, we had 4% growth in United States for Industrial in the quarter, which is acceptable, and I think that was related very much to and became maybe some uncertainty generally speaking around what will happen to export due to the dollar strengthening and also what you saw in oil.","I think people, specifically not so much what is designed in and spec-in, but maybe on the consumables, just became a little bit cautious as you went into the quarter. So I don't see that as an issue either. And as you know that's a big business for us, and we continue to invest in IBG. When I say big, it's our biggest. It's 33% of our portfolio.","So again Electronic and Energy did very well. After the reorganization and realignment of that business now over two years ago, we really get good traction based on our relevance to customers and speed to market, et cetera.","And Safety and Graphics had also a good quarter, and specifically in personal safety that is going into respiratory business, we are doing very well on a global basis, even it was maybe a little bit slow in West Europe in the quarter, but very well in Asia again and whole of APAC doing very, very well.","And then finally, Consumer, that you saw had a 2% growth; 4% was in U.S. which is our bigger business. And I will say that the slowness was in West Europe, and Latin America was slow for them.","So as we all know, a quarter stops and ends there is always something going in and out of the quarter. I look very carefully on six months comparisons going back over two years, and when we look upon that over two years with six months comparisons, because you don't know always if new story is coming in Q1 or Q2, et cetera.","We have for the last two years on that comparison been in the range of 4% to 6%, always in 4% to 5% during that period. So this was on the low end, but still in the 3% to 6% that we have set for the year and when we look upon and talk to the businesses what we see going out for the year, we say that maybe Q2 would be very similar to Q1, maybe slight improvement, but we do not count too much on that. And then you will see for the rest of the year that more growth will come.","Joe Ritchie","And maybe my one follow-up question for Nick. Can you decompose the price cost for the quarter? You had 120 basis points in benefit, what portion of it was related to FX? And can you elaborate a little bit on the raw material piece gaining momentum as the year progresses?","Nicholas Gangestad","Sure, Joe, happy to break that down. As I said earlier in total those components price in raw materials added a 120 basis points. You can split that right down the middle. Half of that is coming from selling price increases, and half of that is coming from lower raw material commodity prices that we're paying. And then in total what we recorded for 1% price growth for the first quarter, Joe, about two-thirds of that is directly or indirectly driven by FX movements, and about one-third of that is driven by 3M innovation and the new product flow we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott Davis","A little bit of strange question for you, Inge, but when you think about China, up 7% is a very, very respectable number, but Consumer is up kind of 2-ish, and you seem to be doing really well in China in Auto and Industrial, but Consumer always seems to be a little bit of a challenge.","Can you help us understand, is it a function of price points of brand, or focus is there -- when we think about the Consumer build out in China, there seems to be an opportunity for you guys, but I'm not sure your business is really that big in the grand scheme of things over there and doesn't seem to be growing up fast?","Inge Thulin","First of all, yes, we do well in China. We have good traction. And again, this quarter we had 7% growth, n fact 8% in the core business if you take out electronics. As I talked earlier, the way the evolution of businesses are going is stopping with Industrial, followed by Electronic and Energy, then Safety, then Consumer, finally Health Care. So Consumer part is a smaller portion in China, and so is actually Health Care as well.","I think the answer to your question is that it's very much around brand awareness. And brand is in our mind, it's where we all grew up what we are used to, et cetera. So it takes longer time in order for you to build the awareness in those businesses. So we still see growth opportunities in China for Consumer, but in that specific market I would turn Health Care and Consumer around, and say, Health Care would get faster traction for us than Consumer.","So I will say, I agree with you. I hope we will be bigger at this point in time. I hope we're being able to grow faster, that we will over time. So we have some very strong brands. It's just that it take time for us to get awareness and build out in the category, and we also very careful who we deal with in China relative to the channel partners.","So I think, over the time it will be big. We'll grow faster. And we have to make sure that we get with that business good profitability for us as well, right. So we are not giving away things, and it's not only about market share, we need to make sure that we are investing in businesses where we get the good return.","And there is some very good businesses for us in China to speak, as you know, both in specifically in Industrial -- specifically Industrial. One I can't talk about purification, it is growing fantastically. We've continued to invest in that. So I hope that will gave you a little bit of flavor why it's small.","Scott Davis","And then as a follow-up to that, I mean when you think about pricing going on getting 1% price in this type of a lower raw material environment and challenging macro in general, what is the interplay between price and volumes? I mean, did you give up some volume this quarter to get that price?","It's hard to say with some of your markets you create the categories, so it seems like you should be able to get pretty good pricing power. But clearly, with the currency moves, I would imagine if you have some local competitors that might able to keep price a little bit lower for a while and take some share, what do you think about that?","Nicholas Gangestad","Scott, we don't see that we're giving up volumes in exchange for price. And it really comes back to 3M's business model of investing in innovation, having that strong new product flow. It gives us the ability to reflect the value that we're creating in the markets and for our customers. So it's something we're conscious of, we monitor. But right now, Scott, we're not seeing our stance on pricing, in light of the current cost raw materials as impacting our volumes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","On the topic of FX, Nick, maybe if you could help critique the effectiveness of the new hedging program, you extended the duration from 12 to 24 months, but how is that program working versus your expectations?","Nicholas Gangestad","For those that may not know what Deane is talking about, in the middle of 2014 we extended the tenure in our hedging programs to go out from our past policy of going out and hedging 12 months out to now hedge in addition to that 24 and 36 months out. And to answer your question it's going quite well, Deane. The true impacts of going out with the tenure in 24 and 36 months, that will manifest in 2016. And if you look at the amount of deferred gains that we have in our hedging program, that's reflective of that change in our hedging program.","Deane Dray","And then a follow-up would be for Inge on the Polypore acquisition. And maybe if you could just take us through, and maybe this has a little bit of the boost that Ceradyne gave you, was where else will you apply ultrafiltration across 3M's businesses? And then within your answer, maybe what does ultrafiltration give you that CUNO did not?","Inge Thulin","First of all, as we not have closed on Polypore, I would not like to talk about that specifically, right. So we have to respect the regulatory approvals that we are waiting for. So I will not talk about that.","But if you think about it broader relative to our filtration business, that is a huge opportunity for us. And I will look upon that and I will combine it, if you like to think about it in terms of our non-woven technologies combined with what we have in our purification business, and then some additional technologies that will be added later on.","So if you think about a global mega trend that are related to both air pollution and clean water, that is where we will play big time with the platform, as we go ahead. So I will say that I am very encouraged actually relative to our current performance, both in purification and in personal safety that is around respiratory products. And we will build out those businesses as we go.","So think about it as a good way of us to extend our technology capabilities in order to create more value in those spaces, which is both global mega trend, but also local mega trends. And as Scott and I talked about it earlier, relative to China, this is a huge opportunity, as we all know and everyone know that. But we need to be able to capitalize on it with technologies, because at the end of the day this is very much a regulatory business, and we need to make sure we have product that meet the standards.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Did you all see any volume de-stocking across your distribution in any of the business units? We've been hearing some short-term trends in some other companies on that front.","Inge Thulin","De-stocking or?","Steven Winoker","De-stocking, yes?","Inge Thulin","I think that when you look upon it, I will not say, yes, bit time. But I suspect that all of us leading businesses, like we do at 3M and our customers, as some uncertainty came in Q1, as I said earlier, both relative to exports from U.S. based on the strength of the dollar and oil price. I think that most companies, generally speaking were very careful of how you build and manage your inventory in Q1.","So I think I will be surprised, even if I don't have any facts in front of me, to say that people manage the inventory very tightly and as tight as they could in Q1, and so did we, by the way, right. So I think that's the answer.","Matt Ginter","Maybe one comment in the Consumer business, which you'll see in one of the slides, our point of sale growth was good and it was higher than our actual growth. So there may have been a little bit of inventory takeout at the retail channel.","Steven Winoker","And then, Matt, on the Consumer side, I think that was still the lowest growth since, like what, maybe the fourth quarter of '13. Was that related in any way?","Matt Ginter","Yes. That was the point. The outdoor sales were actually better than that. So there is some adjustment there in the channel.","Steven Winoker","And then just a follow-up question on pricing. You mentioned earlier that two-thirds of the 1% pricing increase was FX related and a-third roughly it was new product development and et cetera. So I'm just trying to get a sense, are you seeing pressure on pricing in that you think is currency driven in other markets from an export prospect from your competition. Is this something where people are trying to take advantage of it?","Nicholas Gangestad","Steve, that's something we're constantly on the lookout for as in the time volatile FX. So this is changing the competitive landscape for us. And at this point we are not seeing evidence of it changing our competitive landscape or our ability to price in manner similar than how we priced in the past in multiple geographies, including the United States.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS.","Shannon OCallaghan","Maybe just a follow-up on the tightly managing business in the first quarter, as you mentioned you're kind of doing that with inventories and others are as well with FX and oil uncertainty. Is that uncertainty now viewed is or do you view it as having lessened, given some stabilization I guess in the prices of oil and the currencies or such that you would manage those things less tightly in 2Q or how do you view that where we stand today?","Nicholas Gangestad","In terms of managing our spending tightly, I don't see that changing as the year goes on, particularly in markets like West Europe and United States, some of our developed markets, where we're managing our spending pretty carefully right now.","Inge Thulin","Yes, I would say that there will not be any change, as we move into Q2 relative to operation. The team here is on this big time. So there would no change short-term relative to what we need to do. And we had an aggressive plan for the year and we will do everything we can in order to make sure we deliver on that one.","Shannon OCallaghan","And then just in terms of how the first quarter progressed, we're getting sort of different stories from different companies about how the year kind of started and exited 1Q. Did you see any variation across the months of the quarter, either a slow start that improved or vice versa?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, that's something we're always looking at as if there is a change in trend. And as we look, as our revenue progressed through the quarter, we really did not see a meaningful trend one direction or the other throughout the quarter. They have one-off things occurring like when Chinese New Year is and when Easter is, when we adjust for those things, we really see no meaningful trend through the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","So, Nick, just wanted to go back to the raw material commentary. I think you guided for $0.15, $0.25 benefit for the full year, back in December. And it looks like you have a $0.05 of benefit this quarter. So are we now looking at a situation where the raw material benefits are now above the $0.25, given your commentary that its more backend loaded in your plan?","Nicholas Gangestad","So in December we laid out a range of $0.15 to $0.25 that we were expecting for raw material commodity price benefits. On January 27 in our fourth quarter earnings call, we updated that, say, we now see ourselves at the high-end at $0.25.","And Nigel, what we have been seeing is this is playing out almost exactly as we've expected. From a commodity pricing, we see it fairly balanced throughout the year. The only nuance on that is that there is some inventory channel work through of using slightly more expensive inventory to our channel, which is what makes it just a little bit less in the first quarter. But that's all progressing right to our $0.25 that I stated back in January.","Nigel Coe","And my math on benefits, on the 50 bps of benefits above $0.05, is that about right for the quarter?","Nicholas Gangestad","50 bps would be about approaching -- ","Matt Ginter","I think it's about $0.04, Nigel. We'll get back to you.","Nigel Coe","And then secondly on the margin bridge, I just want to understand the mutual impact of FX, because we've seen that the hedge gains would have been a net benefit to margins. So I just want to understand why that's flat? And if possible, if you could call out, how much of the gain came through in 1Q?","Nicholas Gangestad","There is a couple of different forces their Nigel that in this quarter netted out to no change to the margin. There was the hedging gain, which is an absolute upside benefit to the margin. But that's offset by a differential to the margin, where we source things to the extent to which our international companies source product from a U.S. dollar currency. That has a negative impact on margins. Those two things offset each other in the first quarter of 2015.","As we look out over the remaining three quarters of the year that will likely become slightly accretive to our margin. Very similar to what we saw in second quarter and then a little more accretive in third and fourth quarter.","Nigel Coe","Any ways you could quantify that mix?","Nicholas Gangestad","Excuse me, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Any way you can quantify that benefit?","Nicholas Gangestad","When I'm saying -- I am talking small, like 10 basis points, 20 basis points, 30 basis points. Just to put out a range on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Just one quick question on, just any update on what you're seeing with ERP and the traction in terms of your investments?","Inge Thulin","It's going well. As you know, we are sort of updated you in December and even after that. We are rolling out as we speak now in Europe, in West Europe specifically, and the next place to go live is in Nordic. And we are rolling that out according to plan.","And as you know, we went from go, when we tested it country-by-country, now to go regional and we go in West Europe first. And I think it's the first week of the -- or we go in July, second week in July, is when we will roll out in Nordic next. So everything is on plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","On the hedging dynamics, I guess you can kind of do the math on that, I'm not sure whether it's in the 10-K or not or the 10-Q. But are you looking at for '16, if you know the euro stays where it is today. Is there an impact there or do you go all the way out through '16?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, Steve, we are hedged out through '16 and in fact a little into '17. And just to put the numbers on it for 2015 versus 2016, we're estimating approximately $175 million of hedged gains to our P&L in 2015. And if everything stayed right where it is, that would be followed by $110 million of hedge gains in 2016.","Steve Tusa","Has anything changed with regards to how the four-Xs dropping through, exclusive of the hedges? I think Danaher today talked about a higher margin on there drop through.","Matt Ginter","I guess what I'd say, Steve, is back to the couple of questions ago, the one we're hedging and the dollar is strong, net-net it should be slightly positive to margins, as Nick just alluded to, and that is our expectation for the year. So when we calculate that, when we calculate the impact, we take our numbers and pull out the sales impact from FX and the bottomline impact from FX, recount the margin; and if you're hedging, by definition, your margin should go up slightly.","Steve Tusa","So one last question just on, so basically similar growth in the second quarter to the first quarter. Should we be, say -- I mean can growth get to in this kind of economy, this kind of outlook. Can growth get to like above 6% in the second half? I mean is that should we thinking about high end of the range type of growth in the second half of the year, I mean can it accelerate that much?","Inge Thulin","Well, we do not change our guidance for the year at this point in time. So you have 3% to 6%. So I think you're describing correct. As I said earlier, think about it very similar to Q2 as Q1, and then we will see an acceleration in the last part of the year, second half. And then I would not predict at this point in time how high it will go, all right, because we are not immune to the economical environment and how that will accelerate. But our performance of 1.5x to 1.7x IPI is steady, as I said historically, when I look at on those six months periods, as you and I have talked about earlier, so I'm optimistic 3% to 6% for the year.","Steve Tusa","And then just one last question. Are you guys seeing any impact from competitors, global competitors, given the foreign exchange movements? I think of your products is pretty defendable with good modes, but anybody getting regressive out there on price?","Inge Thulin","Well, we have all type of competitors, right. We have global competitors. We have regional competitors. We have local competitors. So we are working with this the whole time. And I would say, as Nick said earlier, up to this point in time we have not seen any change in the behaviors versus what we see the whole time when we do business on the day-to-day basis, so answer to that no. But of course, we have competitors, right. And they are everywhere and they are very attractive, of course, to come into spaces where we are, because nice growth and nice good margin, but we have not seen any change in their behaviors up to this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague","Just a couple, really quick one. Just back on FX, I would imagine those hedges are in a handful of major currencies. My question is if you -- maybe that's right or wrong, but the larger question is if you think about that $110 million hedge gain that you have for 2016, does that fully cover kind of the topline driven FX headwind you would expect in '16, if we just run through at these rates for the rest of this year and into next year.","Nicholas Gangestad","Jeff, couple of questions there to go through. One is it's largely in developed markets and those currencies that we're able to cost effectively hedge. So currencies like the euro, the Canadian dollar, the yen, the Australian dollar, those are examples where we do the majority of our hedging.","Other currencies such as Brazilian real, that's less cost effective for us to hedge in and in markets and currencies like that, our approach is to rely more on natural hedges, meaning how much do we source locally, our ability price to offset some of the FX movement, our ability to manage our cost structure in those places. Those are part of 3M's playbook on managing FX in more developing markets.","To your question on does this fully cover the currency exposure going into 2016, no it doesn't. It's never our intense with our hedging strategy, our financial hedging strategy to offset all of the risk. We offset a portion of it to help minimize reduce volatility and we also do it to buy time for us to adjust our business models accordingly. So it doesn't negate all of the risk in 2016, but it buys us more time and take some of the volatility off the table.","Jeff Sprague","And I'm just wondering on strategic investments, is there any change in tempo over the course of the remainder of the year?","Inge Thulin","No, there's not. I mean, we are working our plan and we're couple our years into it, as you know. So there's no change in the tempo relative to our ERP program or investment in recession development and what we call I3 or any small restructure as we do in here or there when we have the opportunity to do it. So the plan from that perspective is working and it's working well for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Two quick ones. Can you characterize how you see the setup for the year in European auto? Some companies have talked about that as being most likely area for Korean [ph] chute in terms of domestic activity. And secondly are there any regions or end-markets where as you look at the sequential trends into March and April, the deceleration was sharply worse than you expected?","Inge Thulin","Well, on the European front, first of all, our automotive business globally is doing very well. I mean we have 9% growth in the quarter versus 1% growth in the auto build. So again, we are doing very, very well. And that's a global business, so we do well with all the global players.","Relative to Europe, we have good penetration on design and spec-in there, as all other places. And you could assume that, who knows that in the later part of the year the export generally speaking for West Europe will improve, due to the dollar versus euro and other currency. And by then by definition automotive will capitalized from that as well. So assuming that that is correct, as everyone talk about, then there will be a improved export from Europe generally speaking.","Automotive by definition is a big engine for growth in West Europe as we all know. Now, many of the automotive makers here designing and spec-in on certain places and they could use it to other parts of the world. But many of them in Europe are exporting quite a bit outside of West Europe in terms of the manufacturing.","To your second quarter, no, I will not say there was any change with more than, which is a small piece is Middle East\/Africa. Middle East\/Africa, as we all know and understand due to geopolitical issues face challenges, so I would say that was not in March. I think that was for the whole first quarter was total different environment to do business. And so I think that's the only place that we could see any change in trends, right. So that's understandable in way and you we have to manage it through the situation.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.","End of Q&A","Matt Ginter","This is Matt. It's obviously a very busy earnings day, so we really do appreciate you spending the hour with us. Thank you very much. We look forward to speaking to you very soon. Bye, bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 26, 2012.","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter Business Review. With me today are Inge Thulin, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to mention just a few calendar items. We will announce our third quarter earnings on Tuesday, October 23, and our fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, January 24. And as I mentioned back on our April call, we're planning to host our next Investor Day here in the Twin Cities on Thursday, November 8, so please hold this date on your calendars.","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","So let's begin today's review, and I'll turn the program over to Inge. Please turn to Slide #3.","Inge G. Thulin","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today.","As you have seen, Q2 was very similar to our first quarter. We again saw superb operational execution by our team. We continued to grow our earnings, and I'm pleased with our broad-based margins performance. Second quarter EPS was a record $1.66, up nearly 4% year-on-year. We grew operating income nearly 4.5% to $1.7 billion with operating margins of 22.9%, up 1.3% year-on-year. All 6 of our businesses posted margins above 20%, reflecting strong execution across-the-board.","The revenue side was also similar to the first quarter. Sales were $7.5 billion, down 1.9%, including a negative currency impact of more than 4%. Against a continued uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, organic local currency growth was up about 2%, with increases in all of our businesses except those affected by weakness in consumer electronics.","Geographically, the Americas once again led the way, while Asia Pacific was down slightly. Our teams in Western Europe operated with very good discipline in that very challenging environment. In fact, operating margins improved almost 2 points there.","Overall, Q2 demonstrated 3M's ability to deliver against weak segments and regions. But to me, the real story goes well beyond our second quarter performance. We approach 2012 with caution and a conservative plan, a plan we continue to execute with discipline and diligence. Clearly, it was the right plan, and we got a quick start on it. Our plan called for tight control over discretionary spending, and we certainly did so in the first half of the year. Needless to say, that level of cost control will continue for the foreseeable future.","Last but certainly not least, we returned over $1 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter.","Now David will take you through the detail of the quarter. David?","David W. Meline","Thank you, Inge. Let's begin by reviewing the income statement. Please turn to Slide #4.","As Inge said, our business operated well in the second quarter as we delivered outstanding profitability in a continued soft economy. We drove excellent factory performance, and costs remained under very good control. Sales declined 1.9% year-on-year, impacted by weak overall economic conditions and also by the stronger U.S. dollar. I will elaborate on sales in just a bit.","Conversely, gross profit dollars increased by 0.7% versus last year's second quarter. SG&A costs declined 3.3% year-on-year, reflecting prudent caution on discretionary spending, and R&D investments increased 1.1%. We continued to invest to support future innovation and technology development.","In total, operating income grew by 4.4%, and operating margins were a solid 22.9%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points year-on-year. Major components of the change in operating margin are detailed on the right side of this chart. Selling prices increased, net of raw material price changes, adding 1.6 percentage points to operating margin. And foreign exchange impacts, net of hedge, added 0.3%. Higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense hurt operating margins by 0.3%.","Earnings for the quarter were $1.66 per share, an increase of 3.8%. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 3.3% year-on-year to 702.6 million, resulting in a $0.05 positive impact to earnings per share.","The second quarter 2012 tax rate was 30.1%, up 3 percentage points year-on-year, which hurt earnings by $0.07 per share. As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2011 we realized a onetime tax benefit from reorganizing one of our international subsidiaries, a benefit which did not repeat this quarter. During the quarter, we recognized insurance recoveries related to last year's earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which added $0.02 to earnings per share. And finally we absorbed $0.03 of costs in the second quarter related to relocating a portion of our manufacturing operations from Western to Eastern Europe, along with consolidating certain manufacturing and supply chain support activities within Western Europe.","Once again, operating margins improved by 1.3 percent points to 22.9% as our teams are executing very well. Please turn to Slide #5 for a more detailed look at our sales change for the quarter.","Sales for the second quarter were $7.5 billion. Organic local currency growth was 1.9%, driven by higher year-on-year selling prices, and volumes were flat versus last year's second quarter. Acquisitions added 0.5% to sales in the quarter. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 4.3 percentage points as the U.S. dollar strengthened considerably against the euro and other currencies. On a total dollar basis, sales declined by 1.9% year-on-year.","Organic local currency growth in Latin America\/Canada was 11.4%, another strong showing by our teams in that part of the world. All 6 of our businesses contributed to the increase, with 3 businesses growing double digits, namely Electro and Communications, Health Care and Safety, Security and Protection Services. Organic sales growth in the United States was 3.6%.","Organic local currency sales declined slightly in Asia Pacific as strong sales in both Health Care and Industrial and Transportation were offset by slower year-on-year demand in the consumer electronics industry. Japan declined 2%, and China was up slightly year-on-year. We expect to see improving growth rates in China in the second half of the year. On an x electronics basis, organic local currency sales growth was 6% in Asia Pacific. We anticipate that our growth rates in consumer electronics will begin to improve in the third quarter and continue into the fourth. This improvement is due in part to easier comparisons as our sales to this market slowed in the second half of 2011. But of course, there are other factors in play such as the timing of customer new product launches.","In EMEA or the combined Europe, Middle East and Africa, second quarter sales declined 1.9% on an organic local currency basis. Regardless, challenges remain in Western Europe as these countries work through their economic and fiscal issues. We remain focused on what we can control such as driving for additional market share and maintaining firm cost discipline.","So now let's dig into our 6 business segments. Please turn to Slide #6.","Industrial and Transportation generated sales of $2.6 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 4% on an organic local currency basis. The growth was very broad-based, led by double-digit increases in both Automotive OEM and aerospace. We also posted good growth in industrial abrasives and in our energy and advanced materials businesses.","On a geographic basis, organic sales in local currencies increased 8% in Latin America\/Canada, 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in the United States, while EMEA declined just slightly in the quarter. Operating income was $614 million, a year-over-year increase of 13%, and margins in the business improved by 2.8 percentage points to a solid 23.4%.","Industrial and Transportation is the largest of our 6 segments and continues to generate significant productivity and profitability.","Now let's move to Health Care. Once again, our Health Care team delivered superb results. Sales were $1.3 billion, and operating income grew 13% to $414 million. Operating margins exceeded 32%. Sales in the second quarter increased more than 5% on an organic local currency basis. All businesses and geographic areas contributed to this growth with particular strength in food safety and Health Information Systems or HIS. Both HIS and food safety are priority investment areas for us, and we were pleased to see another quarter of high growth in these spaces.","HIS also closed the acquisition of CodeRyte in the second quarter. CodeRyte is a leader in clinical natural language processing technology and computer-assisted coding solutions for outpatient providers. It is a great business and an important technology area and a natural adjacency to our core coding and classification technology base. There are early signs of strong synergy between our businesses which will enable further growth for HIS.","Looking geographically, we are pleased with our progress in the emerging markets. These countries naturally seek higher-quality health care, and our investment in these areas are beginning to pay off. In the first half of 2012, organic local currency growth in emerging markets was more than 14% for Health Care led by our skin and wound care and infection prevention businesses. Of particular note this quarter were China and Mexico, each of which exceeded 20% organic growth in local currencies. In developed markets, we posted positive organic local currency growth despite weakness in Europe. This is a testament to the strength of our Health Care portfolio and the quality of our teams.","Profit margins in Health Care were a strong 32.3% in the second quarter. Our factories continue to run very efficiently, discretionary spending is under firm control and the portfolio mix was excellent.","Now let's look at Consumer and Office business. Sales were $1.1 billion this quarter, up 3% on an organic local currency basis, and operating income rose more than 10% to $222 million. Operating margins rose 1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 21%. From an end-market perspective, top line growth was quite good across the mass retail, DIY, grocery and drug channels. This growth more than offset continued weakness in office wholesale and retail which continues to be impacted by high unemployment levels. Acquisitions added nearly 3% to second quarter sales, largely related to the October 2011 purchase of GPI Group. GPI is a French producer of tapes, hooks, insulation and floor protection products for the home improvement channel. Integration is moving along well and the business is on track towards its financial objectives.","On a geographic basis, organic local currency growth was 9% in Latin America\/Canada, 5% in Asia Pacific and 4% in the U.S., while EMEA declined 6% during the quarter.","The Safety, Security and Protection Services business also had a good quarter. Sales were just shy of $1 billion in the second quarter and operating income grew 6% year-on-year to $258 million. Operating margins rose 2 full percentage points to 26%.","A number of factors drove the margin improvement, including a net positive impact from price and raw materials, improved factory utilization levels and positive mix. Total organic local currency sales growth for the business was 3%, with significant contributions from the infrastructure protection, personal safety and building and commercial services businesses. Second quarter sales declined year-on-year in the security systems business.","Looking geographically, sales rose more than 20% in Latin America\/Canada and 2% in both Asia Pacific and the U.S. Sales declined 4% in EMEA.","Let's take a look at our Display and Graphics segment. Sales in the second quarter were $882 million, down 7% in organic local currency terms. Optical Systems sales fell 20% versus last year's second quarter, largely driven by LCD TV. On a sequential basis, sales improved by 8%. We continued to see good growth in 3M films for battery-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets where 3M's value proposition remains very strong. Also in D&G, architectural markets and commercial graphics continue to grow nicely. Sales in Traffic Safety Systems declined slightly in the quarter on an organic local currency basis.","On an organic local currency basis, sales grew by 9% in the United States and 8% in Latin America\/Canada. Sales declined 14% in Asia Pacific, largely electronics related, and 6% in EMEA.","Operating profits in Display and Graphics were $179 million, and margins were 20.3% for the quarter.","Lastly, let's review Electro and Communications. Second quarter sales in this business were $824 million, operating income was $195 million and operating margins increased 60 basis points to an impressive 23.7%. Sales were down year-on-year in our consumer electronics-related businesses. Our 2012 plans in this space called for a challenging first half, which has been the case. We continue to believe that growth will improve in the second half of 2012 due to a combination of improved industry demand and easier year-on-year comps. Organic local currency sales increased in our Electrical Markets business, while telecom supplies business declined a bit.","In geographic terms, Latin America\/Canada rose 13% and the U.S. increased 6%, while Asia Pacific and EMEA declined 5% and 8%, respectively.","That concludes my discussion of the business segment results. Please turn to Slide #7.","Free cash flow for the quarter was just over $1 billion, down $125 million year-on-year. This amount includes a voluntary $250 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit plan. We made a similar-sized voluntary contribution in the first quarter of this year, putting total year-to-date discretionary cash contributions at $500 million. This amount is consistent with our plan for the year. In total, second quarter pension and OPEB contributions totaled $335 million, which was $271 million higher than Q2 of last year. For the full year, we anticipate total contributions of about $1 billion to our pension and OPEB plans, and we remain very well-funded at the moment.","On the positive side, free cash flow benefited from lower working capital investment and higher levels of net income. Capital expenditures were $358 million, up $63 million versus the second quarter of last year, and we remain on track to invest $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion for 2012 in total. Free cash flow conversion was 88% in the quarter versus 100% in last year's second quarter. Adjusting for pension and OPEB contributions, conversion was 117% this quarter versus 105% in Q2 of 2011.","We returned over $1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter including $410 million in cash dividends and $639 million in gross share repurchases. On a final note, during the second quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of long-term debt spread over 5- and 10-year terms at record-low corporate fields.","So that concludes my discussion of our second quarter financial results. Now, Inge will address our forward outlook.","Inge G. Thulin","Thanks, David.","During uncertain times like this, I'm especially appreciative of 3M's business model, a model flexible enough to allow investments to improve the business and yet disciplined enough to deliver earnings and superior margins when economic growth is challenging. We are well known for our culture of innovation, but just as real is our culture of continuous improvements. For example, in the first half of this year, we absorbed restructuring cost of $0.07 per share. Given that most knowledgeable observers see slow or stalled global growth in the second half of the year, we will continue the approach that served us very well in the first half: strong execution and productivity, good cost discipline and continued investments and actions to improve and build our businesses around the world.","We are, in fact, increasing our momentum to move 3M forward. For example, in the quarter we announced the acquisition of Federal Signal Technologies Group. FSTech is focused on electronic toll collection, parking management hardware and software services, key adjacencies to our Traffic Safety Systems business.","On last quarter's call, we talked about the investments in aerospace and in a newly formed business, mining, oil and gas solutions. They both progressed very well this quarter. Aerospace grew 24% and mining, oil and gas at 20%, significantly faster than the market. I look for great things from these businesses as they both operate at the crossroads of advanced technology and megatrends.","As you know, 3M is a true pioneer of international business. Many of our international companies have existed for decades. For example, 3M Brasil dates back to 1946. Over the years, we have developed global capabilities that are second to none. Our newest frontier is sub-Saharan Africa where we just launched an initiative to broaden our presence in this emerging market. In Q2, we announced the formation of a new subsidiary in Nigeria and reactivated our operations in Kenya. We believe sub-Saharan Africa holds long-term opportunity for 3M of more than $0.5 billion. Also in the second quarter, we took steps to establish a stand-alone subsidiary in Saudi Arabia. 3M already does sizable business there, and with a wholly owned subsidiary, we can make a step-change in our growth there. We expect 3M Saudi Arabia to be in full operations on September 1. Here again we see long-term opportunities in the $500 million range.","We took actions this quarter to fully realize opportunities like Africa and Saudi Arabia by increasing the effectiveness of the way we go to market and serve customers. In addition, we just appointed a new vice president for global sales operations to increase sales skills, competence and productivity around the world. The new VP for global sales is an experienced sales professional, a proven leader who has led 3M businesses in Europe and North America with great success. Also, with the increasing importance of digital platforms in the marketplace, we have elevated eTransformation with the appointment of a vice president for this function. The new leader has both the understanding and experience to lead our company-wide efforts, as he has led similar efforts at a number of companies before joining 3M. The objective is to build and scale our e-platform to realize rewards in increased sales, brand presence and productivity.","These 2 appointments, along with a previous appointment of a vice president of global marketing excellence, will significantly increase our sales and marketing horsepower at the center of the company and improve our capability to drive growth and penetration everywhere.","That is a quick summary of some of the ways we are moving the company forward. I now turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. Please turn to Slide 8.","First, my confidence in the company's ongoing performance lead us to a firmer EPS outlook in the range of $6.35 to $6.50 for the year. We do so with full consideration of additional headwinds from currency in the second half. Looking upon sales, we expect organic local currency growth of 2% to 5% for all of 2012. We trimmed the high end of the range by a point based on the first half and our views about global economic activity, going forward. Strong pricing should offset slightly lower volumes, and comps become easier as the year goes on. After the good margin performance in the first half, we are raising the bottom end of the margin range from 21% to 21.5%. And the tax rate remains unchanged.","To me, the second quarter demonstrates that 3M continues to operate very well with alignment, discipline and always with an eye toward opportunity.","Thank you for your attention. We will now take your questions and comments.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So you\u2019re getting really impressive pricing here of up nearly 2% in the quarter. So maybe if you can talk about the outlook for the rest of the year, how should we be thinking about pricing? And then also, raw materials, as they moderate, is that a benefit to the spread and margins?","David W. Meline","Sure, Ajay. So what I would say, first on pricing. As you probably recall, we had indicated we'd get somewhere between 0 and 1% on the year, and what we expected given the way prices developed last year is we would see some level of decline as we move through the year. So if you look at the first half, we've been pretty solid and stable there. We did 1.7 in the first quarter and now 1.9 in the second. But again as you look at the trend through the year, we'll see that moderate somewhat. On the other hand, we had said 0 to 1%, and it looks now like we'll probably come closer to 1% for the year than flat. In terms of raw materials, what we're seeing -- like everyone else, we are seeing that the raw materials are certainly softer than they -- we might have expected at this stage. So we had raw material price inflation of 2% in the first quarter. We had indicated we thought we'd come in at 1% to 2% for the year. The second quarter actually now declined, so at -- from that 2% level, we were around flat in the second quarter on raw materials, and we think for the year in total it's most likely we'll be closer to flat than those higher levels. So yes, it's contributing certainly to our margins presently and that we expect to continue at some level through the balance of the year.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then on the discretionary spending, Inge, maybe talk a little bit about the initiatives you have put in place. And then you're obviously seeing the benefit on the SG&A rate there. Could you maybe talk about what's the opportunity you see on cost tightening?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, we continue the rest of the year as we started the year, which as I said earlier, we went into the year with a plan that was conservative, and we've been very cautious. So -- and we have some parts of the world, like Western Europe, at the moment where there is challenges relative to economic outlook. So we are managing that very, very tightly. At the same time, when we see opportunities for growth, we invest, and we talked at the last call, specifically around Health Care which is everywhere around the world. And we see very good traction. We also invest in personal safety. We have those 2 new units that we talked about last time in terms of mining, oil and gas and aerospace where we continue to invest when we see the opportunities. But we are, yes, cautious as we go, and specifically, I think big credit should be given to our West European team that are on that the whole time, day by day. So I -- we hope at the time that we can let up, but the important thing here is we have the plan which we now look upon to say it was a good, solid plan we roll into the year on, and we are very pleased on how the team are executing it. And as you saw also in terms of research and development, went up 1.1%, meaning that we are committed to growth for the future in terms of investments. So I think it's a good balance here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I actually want to ask you to dig into a little more detail on the pricing question. So Latin America, it looks like it was up 440 basis points on pricing; the U.S, 290; EMEA, 270. This kind of pricing power is -- continues to be extraordinary. And the question I have is, can you give us a better sense for the kind of actual actions you're taking on pricing? Is this -- whether it's material contract, escalators, what are the -- what things are you doing? It's not mix, I know, so what are you doing that's allowing you to get that kind of pricing quarter in, quarter out lately?","David W. Meline","Sure. So Steve, basically, as you know, we've talked about a number of times over the last now a couple of years that the company really started gearing up to make sure that we were adequately recovering our material costs as we moved through last year. And that continued into the first and second quarters here. So 1.7 in the first quarter overall, 1.9 in the second would indicate that we've taken some fairly limited additional increases here in Q2. And not surprisingly, for us at least, we have very good price retention. The products that we offer in these markets around the world, we work very hard to keep them differentiated and fresh, which enables us to maintain our prices and offer things that are attractive to the market. So I wouldn't view it as something different today than we've been experiencing in recent times. Perhaps, just the comps are showing up a little bit more strongly right now.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Does that explain Latin America particularly?","David W. Meline","Latin America, a certain portion of those products we price in dollars terms. So when you look at a depreciating currency environment, such as Brazil has a 20% decline in currency year-over-year, we do pick up some price on a portion of the products as they're pegged to the dollar.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, so that's separate from all the currency impacts you call out and you -- okay, got it. And then secondly, when you talk about that second half top line guidance baking in a more conservative view of the economy, it still looks like there is something, like, somewhere around at least low-single-digit and potentially mid- to high-single-digit growth baked in on the organic side. Is that -- I mean, how are you thinking about that for the second half? And because it sounds like you're still -- there's still acceleration here. And you mentioned comps, is it all comps based? Or what are you planning on?","David W. Meline","They certainly -- yes, it's a good question. So if you look at the range for the year, we've got a range of now 2% to 5% for the year in total. We did 2% in the first half. So obviously the scenario in which we'd be at that low end would be such that we would continue on the same path. And the high end, of course, does indicate that we'd have some pick-up. Where do we see that pick-up coming from? Several factors. One, certainly, that's been impacting us, as you know, is the electronics sector which we do see the recovery developing in the second half exactly as we've previously indicated in our planning, so that's contributing to our second half outlook. And then certainly, there's a component of it, which is the comps, which again last year in the second half we had a deterioration. So even with stable revenue, we would see some level of pick-up there.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","The electronics, what gives you confidence that, that could materialize?","David W. Meline","We were seeing -- as we exited the quarter, we're starting to see that turnaround develop in terms of the volume. So it starts with looking at indicators of forward demand, including areas like semiconductor fab and our consumer electronics outlook that we observe and then observing what is in our forward orders. And we see importantly the inflection developing now, as we've exited the second quarter. And again, there's a comp issue that helps that as well.","Matt Ginter","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A quick question on pensions. Based on some of the recent pension funding policy changes, I guess, would you opt for some of the funding relief options? And how should we think about your funding requirements looking to 2013?","David W. Meline","Sure. So in terms of our overall pension -- funded position and how we think about pensions, we have a view that the right approach to this is to be targeting a range of funded status, which is a -- quite a healthy one, so somewhere bracketing the 100% funded position. We were in the mid-80% funded status as we ended last year due to declining interest rates. And so we made a decision this year to do this extraordinary additional funding to make sure that we don't vary from our longer-term goals, so hence the additional funding that we've put in this year, which we expect to be $500 million. So point there is to keep the pension fund well-funded. Secondly, as to the change in the funding requirements, that doesn't impact us because that would give relief to companies that are facing mandatory contributions. And of course, based on the way we manage pension funding, we don't face that kind of a situation, so it doesn't have any impact on 3M. If I look into 2013, last year about this time we were expecting to see pension expense requirements actually decline in 2012 and thus not have the additional requirements for also additional funding, but the reality was -- is we saw interest rates decline as we went through the year, so we actually had a pension increase in our expense last year and also our funded status decline which we've been addressing this year. So as I look into next year, what's true is that we would expect from an expense perspective to be stable or see some additional decline. But quite honestly, I'm a little cautious to make a call at this stage, given our experience recently and where interest rates seem to be wanting to go.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then a quick follow-up question on the electronics side of the business. Could you talk a little bit about some of the share gains that you're seeing in the semi market and some of the drivers behind this and if there are any regional factors behind the business wins?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. We are broad based, as you know, in consumer electronic, everything from semiconductor to data storage to smartphones to notebooks to tablets and touch panel. We attempt on moving with the market. And when we looked upon the outlook a quarter ago and then refirm [ph] it -- look upon it now again, they -- basically we can confirm the movements in the market. There's a slight uptick on tablets versus notebooks, but overall, the growth is coming as we're expecting as for the rest of the year. The other thing we see on semiconductors, which is an early indicator: we see that, in fact, continue to improve, which is good. And the other thing is also, if you go back a year ago in comparison, the Thailand flooding is now -- restructuring there is done, meaning we see a positive comparison for us as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Guys, do you have a sense of what your customers are doing with their inventories right now, whether we have kind of passed the de-stock or whether there's another round of de-stock just ahead of us?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, as you can imagine, we are following that very closely. And when we are scanning our many businesses and end markets, it looked like, overall, there is a very good line in between demand and inventories. And so we don't see an issue there. And in fact, I think, since the last recession, almost all company are now managing inventories very, very carefully. So there is not an issue there, as we see it. So inventory versus demand is well under control. So that's our view at this point in time.","David W. Meline","Yes. If I could, the one exception would be we did see that LCD panel inventories have risen to a pretty high level. Not a big factor in the business any longer, Scott. Last quarter, Optical Systems represented now 4% of our total revenue as a company so -- and of course, only about 1\/3 of that is in the LCD business. But nonetheless, that's the one area that we observe a build-up of inventory.","Inge G. Thulin","I think that was the only place we saw a small tick-up on the running rate, which is close to 7 weeks, I think.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up on -- I know there's been a lot of questions on margins. But in Europe specifically where it's pretty hard for us to imagine how you could take margins up by a couple of hundred basis points in such a tough environment, I mean, how much of that is a benefit of kind of past restructuring? You talked about discretionary cost and things that are under control, but is there some permanent step-up in that margin rate that we can expect going forward just from past works that you've done there in Europe?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes, well, first of all, let's talk about Western Europe in terms of perspective. We have been on Western Europe for quite some years. And you maybe recall that we made a restructuring probably 2.5 years ago when we made very clear that there is a difference in between Western Europe, Central\/East Europe and Middle East\/Africa, so we started that very early. And at that time, we also regionalized Western Europe. So I think, first of all, we have to say this is nothing that is coming here as a surprise for us. We were very early into the game in order to make sure we prepared ourself. There is a combination, of course, of benefit of restructuring in terms of when we did a regionalization where we reduced the layers of management and made sure that we continue to have local execution in terms of sales and marketing. But as much as we could, in terms of management and back-office type of consolidating that on a regional base, meaning Nordic, Alpine, Benelux, Iberia, et cetera. So I think that is one of the thing that is now paying off for us. So we're very pleased we were early on that game. Secondly, of course they are now holding very tightly the spending in that part of the world and have a hiring freeze and, in fact, also reduced I think over 300 people here during this year. So it's the combination of all of it. And at the same time, Patrick Deconinck that is leading our West European organization as his team is focusing as much as he can to gain market share in the market and elevate the elements relative to customer interaction. So it's -- I wouldn't like to -- us to look upon Western Europe now like this is one quarter that, yes, everything came through. This has been a longer period of time that we were working a very diligent plan. Yes?","David W. Meline","I would just add, Scott, what's also true is there is a mix effect. If you look at -- one area of the business that grew in the second quarter was Health Care in Europe and that certainly helps our mix.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Was hoping to start first on the FXTech (sic) [FSTech] acquisition and road-tolling. It seems like this would be a good fit for 3M. Could you just discuss the competitive landscape? You do have some entrenched competitors there. And maybe reflect a bit on what the mix might be in terms of systems and consumables in this business.","Inge G. Thulin","Yes, first of all, this is very much a business into United States, right? So it's United States and U.K. a little bit. And that is, if you look upon the mix for it, it's -- I would say it's 25% of each relative to parking, toll software, cameras and the hardware in terms of tolling, so 25%, 25%, 25%. That is a competitive landscape that we are now taking on, but this is a great move for us because this is an adjacency that is going into TSS for us where we have a global leading position on signing. So it's absolutely perfect for us in terms of making sure that we build out more relevance in that market space for us. And I think, all those components, that we would be ready to integrate them and execute very well. And we will focus in on the pieces that we have the business today, which is United States, to the most portion, and then a smaller piece in U.K. And soon as we've gone on the integration and build it in after that, we will see how we can expand it on a global base. But we have very good base, and that's where we will start. We'll also make sure we integrate it to a very strong division we have in traffic safety system solutions.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then over on the optical film side. A lot of discussion about the next iPhone and the implications of this new, what they call, in-cell technology where they're going to eliminate the touchscreen layer. What are the implications on -- for the optical film content where you -- if you remove that layer, it sounds like they're already getting better display graphics on this. But is there a difference in content potential for 3M?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, as you can imagine, we are working very close with all the companies in these areas, right? And whatever new technology that is coming, we're in the middle of that in order to help and support with solutions. So I would say that we have seen a still big opportunity for us specifically in handheld and smartphones as we move ahead. So I can make sure for you that we're in the middle of it and that probably will be more of upsides for us than anything else broad based in what I call tablet and handhelds.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. Just last one for me, on the consumer side. Back to school, third quarter, what are you baking in, in terms of assumptions year-over-year? And any comment on the Avery Dennison consumer performance this quarter?","David W. Meline","Yes, in terms of the Consumer and Office business overall, we continue to expect -- we'd set out a range of growth for the year for that business and we don't see any reason why that won't come to pass. Certainly, the retail consumer, as we commented, has been -- it's been relatively tepid, the demand in the space. Our performance, we saw improve from first to second quarter, so we're pleased with that. And certainly, there's indications that some level of improvement in that particular area is going to continue now into the back-to-school period. So don't really know the answer, but I would say, on an overall trend basis, we're confident and feel good with the outlook for the business for the year.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And the pending Avery Dennison acquisition?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, nothing new. We still expect to close that in the second half of the year here, and we are still under negotiations. So nothing new. We look upon it positively and we hope that we would be closing it here before the year is over.","Matt Ginter","Thank you, Deane.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","I was wondering if you could share with us, is there anything to kind of glean from the progression of organic sales over the course of the quarter? And there's been some talk of potentially kind of a CapEx strike in the U.S. kind of grinding into year end and all the expected political and fiscal drama. Have you seen any discernible change in trend particularly in the June, July time frame?","David W. Meline","No, actually. If I -- well, first of all, on the second quarter, it was pretty stable through the quarter so we didn't see -- and obviously, we're looking very carefully. We didn't see any indications of a change in trends, and that's true through July now. So some, obviously, individual sectors, individual geographies, one month versus another you can have some ups and downs in an economy like this, but net-net we don't have anything that would cause us to say there's a material change in the outlook, which is how we characterize the second half now. So -- and then in terms of CapEx, not sure -- if you talk about -- as that drives our own demand, we haven't seen again any discernible change. If we look at our own deployment, which is at some level an indicator of longer-term requirements, we continue to get a bottom-up view that says we have demands for capital based on the view of the business that we need to continue to support growth and there's no reason to vary from that. So -- and if you see some sectors like -- our traffic safety had a very good second quarter, which is partly related, if it were, to government funding in that particular case.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And I was wondering, just as a second question, could you elaborate a little bit more on China? The better performance that you're expecting, is it just this ramp in the electronic supply chain that you've already discussed so far here this morning? Or are there other things going on there that are giving you a little bit more confidence into the back half?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes, well, let's first look upon the facts for us. First of all, revenue in the quarter was stable versus Q1, so we had very similar growth rate for the second quarter versus the first quarter. Health Care is growing very fast for us, 20%-plus, and we also saw I&TB show improvement versus Q1, which is a good sign. So when you take out electronics from China, we grew in the quarter 10% organic locally versus 8% in Q1, so we make a step-change relative to growth, generally speaking. And when we look on the rest of the year, we look upon it to be, from a dollar perspective, similar to the first half of the year, but due to the comparison, we see a growth rate accelerating. And as we talked about last time, there's a couple of things that have impacted China for us, which is of course, export specifically to Europe, electronics and then local consumption. And we will look upon it as we move ahead. Electronics will improve and also local consumption. We don't see any improvements relative to the export to Europe. So I think you can look upon it -- that will be similar in terms of overall dollar sales, but improvement relative to percent is due to the comps in electronic. And we also see Health Care improving quite a bit. We are very happy with our Health Care business in China as we speak, growing very, very fast.","Matt Ginter","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Feldman of UBS.","Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Some very nice margin improvement. When you're talking about discretionary cost controls and specifically discretionary component, should this kind of SG&A level be something we should think of as a sustainable run rate? Or is it really just at this level given the uncertainty and some of those cost controls are going to be lifted when hopefully things improve?","David W. Meline","Sure. Yes, I mean, as you know, Jason, we're always trying to balance cost control with investment in the business and growth. Certainly, as we looked at this year coming into '12, we didn't see the opportunity materializing for the kind of growth that we foresee on a long-term basis for the company, and therefore, we set for ourselves a much more conservative plan in terms of our discretionary spending. And as you know, that's what we've been actually marching to. At the same time, that plan, we continue to invest in the business. That investment both in SG&A and R&D is very steady, so it's not as if we're carving out and starving investment in the business over time. So is that sustainable? Is that SG&A margin -- or expense sustainable? I would say I don't view it as extraordinarily constrained right now, to be honest. I mean, we're always working on becoming more efficient. We're always trying to leverage the business as being a larger business on an efficient back office, et cetera. So to me there's nothing that jumps out in terms of that performance in the context of the current economic environment.","Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I mean, I guess another way of -- I guess I was thinking about it is it -- I mean, you distinguish, I think, very appropriately between the growth investments that you haven't cut back on. In fact, I think, last quarter you talked about accelerating them I think it was $30 million to $50 million for the year, as distinct from these discretionary cost controls. And so I guess the other way is, assuming that you continue to invest in growth whether times are good or times are bad, is there additional kind of non-growth areas where there's still opportunities for kind of incremental cost cuts?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, as I said earlier, we are well known for innovation but we're equally good at continuous improvement and make sure that we constantly look for operational excellence and functional excellence. And I think that\u2019s what is driving us the whole time. So I think it's an important element to make sure that we and you know that we are driving productivity in all functions, specifically in the back office. So that's an opportunity for us. We are not backing off relative to investment for growth in the front and I think that's a very, very important distinction to make. And again, it's not the same cut for every business. It's based on some opportunities where you can see that it's a short-term, mid-term growth opportunity for some businesses, like in this time for Health Care and Consumer and Office. We let them go and in a different level than some other businesses that have a tougher economical environment at the moment, like electronics.","David W. Meline","Well, if -- and if I could just add one other perspective on that. We talked -- Inge talked now about, I think, $60 million, $70 million that we've directed towards some form of consolidation and restructuring through the first half, which is quite honestly very typical of the business which we're constantly working on productivity, we're constantly looking at how we can improve and be competitive. And eventually, hopefully sooner than later, the benefits of, if you will, those investments in terms of getting the business rightsized or in the right kind of posture reaps rewards for the company. And that's something that we've been doing, continuing basis. So I think it's all within the same theme. Obviously, in times like these, you have an extra-sharp focus on the area, but it's something that the company is always doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","Ramanan  Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is actually Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. A quick question on Health Care. Obviously, very strong results here. In terms of margins, what's fair to assume in the back half? It looks like it was a record margin performance on an EBIT basis.","David W. Meline","Sure. So yes, so obviously we're very pleased with the way the business is running. If you look at the quarter, it's a continuation of a story that we've seen for some time now, which is not only very strong margin performance but also, if you look at the growth of the business, quite solid and very broad based. So we're pleased with the way Health Care is running right now. Why is that the case? Well, we're seeing growth in all of our divisions. The factories are running as well as we've ever seen them run. Health Care, like our other businesses, obviously have a close eye on cost. And so in terms of the margins, as I look out, I think it's realistic to expect that we'll probably run it in the 30-plus range here for a period of time into the future, certainly through -- if I look at 2012 in total. And also, we expect to see that in combination with some continuing, steady growth.","Inge G. Thulin","Let me make an additional comment here. First of all, we have a very strong and diverse Health Care portfolio. And if you look upon the growth rate, the emerging market now grew 16% as of late. And the investment we have done there start to pay off due to the fact that the portfolio there is becoming more relevant for those countries. So I think it's important that we are targeting good growth and strong margins in this business, and they are delivering. And as David said, there's many elements there in terms of mix of portfolio, the efficiency in manufacturing, the go-to-market capabilities, but we are still doing those investments, as we have talked about on the other calls. But based on the business model there, I think, for the foreseeable future we should see low 30s as more likely the margins for us, which is very good.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sorry, was that last question about the Health Care margin?","David W. Meline","That was on Health Care margin, yes.","Inge G. Thulin","Yes, it was the Health Care, yes.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. I won\u2019t -- I'll just go back to the transcript. I'm sorry. I missed it. The price cost -- so on the pricing side, just quarter-by-quarter, does that step down gradually over the next couple of quarters to go on, like, basically flat in the fourth quarter? Or how is that -- price is up 2% in the fourth quarter, kind of stepped up a little bit. So is that how we should think about it? Will it be another big quarter in the third quarter and then step down? Maybe you could just give us some visibility around the comps.","David W. Meline","Sure. Yes, Steve. So we're looking for around 1% for the year. And it does imply a step-down. I would treat it as -- we think it'll be a step-by-step move.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the raws, will they be negative in the second half or similarly?","David W. Meline","Yes, so we ran about flat in the first -- in the second quarter, which was certainly an improvement from the first. We think we'll be flat for the year, so that would imply slightly negative in the second half.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And then just one last question. I mean, we're looking at it year-over-year, obviously very strong improvement. But I guess, sequentially as well, your profit was up $95 million. Your revenue was up, I guess, $50 million sequentially. Was there something that kind of dropped out of the first quarter into the second quarter? Was that ForEx? Maybe you could just give a little bit of color around the sequential bridge.","David W. Meline","Steve, one thing that changes Q2 versus Q1 is we front-end load our stock options expense. We grant options in the first quarter of the year so our stock -- our options expense is the highest in Q1, and that's typically about a $50 million sequential change Q2 versus Q1.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And that's happened in prior years? Because last year, I mean, you had...","David W. Meline","Yes, it did. Yes, it has.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Because in the last 2 years, you've had a -- more like a 50% incremental instead of a 200% incremental.","David W. Meline","Right. Yes, I was just going to say, I mean, on your revenue question, we -- if you look back at the way we set out the year, we expected the first half to be as it's been, which is basically pretty flat to the second half of last year. It's turned out to be the case. Certainly, second quarter was negatively impacted on a revenue basis by exchange more than the first quarter, but it's very much in line with the first half-second half type of a situation where the first half would be most modest and some level of recovery in the second half but obviously still something that's quite contained.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So how much more positive was price cost in the second quarter versus the first quarter?","Matt Ginter","I'll have to follow up, Steve, on that. I'm not sure off the top of my head.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just want to pick up on the price cost. Sorry to keep on beating this thing to death. But -- so you've got 50 bps good news on price versus your prior subtation [ph]. You've got, it sounds like, about at least 0.5 point on inflation. I'm just wondering, why is the 50 bps low ends raised to the margin levels? It seems that you should be -- I mean, are you sort of more biased to the high end of your 1.5 points -- 50 bps to 1.5 points margin targets? It just seems that if you just put those through the model, 0.5 point seems very achievable.","David W. Meline","Yes, so if you look at the margin plan that we've got in place, what we set out for ourselves this year was to achieve a 1% year-over-year margin increase, which we ran at just slightly short of 21% last year. The midpoint now of the margin guidance for the year is 22%, so I think it reflects correctly our continuing level of confidence that we had that we'd deliver on that plan. If you also consider, I mean, other factors that would be impacting margins in the second half, you certainly have things like the Avery acquisition, which is not yet in there, so that would have some possible impact. And then secondly, we still have a range of growth that varies several points, and that could impact margins. So we think it's a reasonable outlook. What's also true for us is first half and second half, your margin trend, you normally have a weaker second half in margin specifically in the fourth quarter, which is also being reflected in the way we're guiding right now.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if I can just ask it a slightly different way: If sales come in towards the lower end of your range, which seems at this point to be more likely, can you still make the high end of your margin range given the price and more material good news, x Avery Dennison?","David W. Meline","Yes, that's a hard one, Nigel, to exactly connect those dots as to what the other elements of the equation will give us in terms of things like raw material cost and how it flows through. So I would tell you, I couldn't give you a straight answer on that.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just follow up the -- it looks like you've seen about a point out of your volume expectations for the full year. How does that look by segments?","David W. Meline","Repeat that, please?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. So the 1 point of lower volume for the full year, I mean, how does that look by segment? So are we losing to -- yes.","David W. Meline","Yes, got it. What I'd say is, if you look at -- and again, if -- we gave some full year segment guidance in December and also full year guidance in terms of the regional split for the growth. The way it looks right now is that we're still foreseeing us being very much in those ranges by 6 business sector for the year. The fact is, is by trimming the top end, it's more likely you'll have more of them sort of in the middle than perhaps some being at the top of their range, which was a scenario that we had as we entered into the year. So I think, from a planning perspective, you should think about those ranges still being good on a business sector basis. And then quite honestly, on a geographic basis, the scenario in which the top of that original guidance would have occurred for 3M, would have involved, quite honestly, a stronger Asian performance, which is not materializing. So if you wanted to articulate those ranges by region, we still don't see the ranges being -- we still see them as being good geographically, but that's the -- if you want to identify the differentiating factor, that's what I would say.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Inge, I'm wondering if you might shed a little more light on how your thinking on capital allocation is evolving and maybe describe a little bit how the M&A pipeline looks at this point.","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. I mean, we just have started to work on the plan for next year, so we are just in the middle of that, right? And as you know, I think capital allocation is an important element for us in order to make sure we prioritize the right businesses as we move ahead. And so we are just in the middle of that, and I hope we can share more with you in November as we meet again. In terms of the pipeline for merger and acquisitions, it's solid. It's -- I would say, as we have a bottom-up process there, we have a still, business by business, very solid pipeline. And we take a look upon them one by one as they are moving forward.  We -- as you saw, we announced one this last quarter. We have made a commitment to one earlier in the year. So it's still robust and it's part of our growth strategy as a tactic as we move ahead. So first of all, organic growth for us complemented with acquisitions. But the pipeline is healthy and improving and we are now prioritizing it day by day, I would say, in order really to understand how it will fit in strategically for the company as we move ahead. And the target we have given out earlier in terms of spending, we're standing behind that.","David W. Meline","Yes, if I could add on capital allocation, at least as it relates to the current year, again, go back to the fact that we're tracking very much to the plan we laid out for the year from an operating perspective. If you look at kind of the big goal post that we've got on how we allocate capital in the year, we said $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion on CapEx. We still think that's a good range. We said $2 billion to $2.5 billion on buyback, gross. I think we've done here in the first half about 1\/2 of that. So I don't see any reason right now to say that there's a dramatic change in our view there, but obviously, we need to be cognizant of intrinsic value of our shares in the market. And then we prefunded -- as I mentioned, we prefunded some debt maturities that are coming up later this year and into 2013, so that was an action we took. And we've got the M&A guidance out there of $1 billion to $2 billion. The announced transactions would indicate deployment of slightly less than the bottom end of the range in the first half, but I think $1 billion to $2 billion is still, from a planning perspective, a good range, recognizing there's -- we can never precisely plan size and timing of those things.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And appreciating that the update in November is forthcoming, I'm wondering, though, if you can, Inge, just put any light on what's any of the -- sort of debate that you're having with regards to how the plan going forward could shift at all relative to where it's been in the past and, perhaps specifically within the M&A realm, whether larger acquisitions is something that you're considering in that mix.","Inge G. Thulin","Well, as we have talked earlier, I don't think it's larger by definition. I think it's the prioritization where we have to make sure that we connect them strategically into some of the very important businesses that is coming out from the prioritization process. And then we are in fact making a step-up relative to integration and make sure that we can do that faster and more professionally as we move ahead. It's an ongoing process, as you know, when you look upon your business and evaluate the opportunity based on your base, and that is what -- we are in the middle of talking about this as we speak.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, David, wonder on the raw material -- the improved outlook on raw materials. Other than steel and copper, which are obviously pretty visible to most of us out here or all of us out here, what other key raw materials are driving that lower inflation outlook? And to what degree are some of those raw materials derivatives of U.S. natural gas? And perhaps your -- you've got a longer tail to the benefit of that reduced inflation as we think about again this ongoing question of sustainability of margins into 2013.","David W. Meline","Sure. Yes, I mean, if you look at our key raw material inputs, there's certainly a portion of those that are pegged to the price of oil and natural gas now. You get into this issue of the amount of these derivatives that are coming out of cracking slates, whether they'd be oil versus natural gas. But the answer is -- polypropylene, for -- propylene-based products, which feature in a number -- as inputs to a number of our products, we're seeing softer pricing there at the moment. Certainly, we've seen price trends improve on things like paperboard, which is an important input to our products. And in some of those areas, we also see capacities reacting to put a floor on pricing. Certainly, our experience has been, as demand improves and as the outlook for economic activity improves, we'd be na\u00efve if we thought that prices would stay down. So I think it's going to continue to trend up and down as the market outlook changes.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call.

As you all are aware, Q2 was my last quarter as the CEO and I have now moved on to my new role as Executive Chairman of the 3M Board. Mike Roman is our new CEO and I am pleased with the orderly transition between me and Mike, which we have worked on for the last year. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Mike and our CFO, Nick Gangestad, and you will see that once again we had a very strong quarter with robust organic growth, margin expansion, EPS growth, and good cash flow.","But before doing that, I would like to make a few comments. First, I would like to recognize all of you who have covered, analyzed, and invested in 3M. I have enjoyed our many interactions and I have always appreciated your input along with your integrity and professionalism. I would also like to thank all of our 91,000 3Mers around the world for your contributions and support. Working together, I am pleased at what we have accomplished over the last six years. We enhanced and focused our portfolio and as a result, today, we are far more relevant to our customers and the marketplace. We have strengthed our innovation engine and improved our cost structure and began to transform 3M for the future.","We have reached for our vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home, and improving every life. All of this is reflected in our financial results and in the premium value we have created for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders. At the same time, I am equally confident in our future. The Board of Directors and I have no doubt that Mike is the right person to lead our Company as CEO and continue building strengths on strengths. As I look across our enterprise, it\u2019s clear that we have the leadership, market position, and capabilities to continue to build on the fundamental strength of 3M.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for summary of our second quarter. Mike?","Mike Roman","Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am honored to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of this incredible enterprise and lead our team into the future. I would like to express my gratitude to Inge for his vision, leadership, and ongoing partnership in his new role as Executive Chairman. Over the last six years, we\u2019ve made great progress in building out the 3M playbook, which has created a tremendous foundation for us. Moving ahead, we are focused on continuing our momentum, generating extraordinary value for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders.","Now let\u2019s review our second quarter results, starting on Slide 5. We had a strong quarter, highlighted by broad-based organic growth and a double-digit increase in earnings per share, along with record sales and rising margins. Looking at the numbers, total sales were $8.4 billion, an all time high for 3M. We delivered strong organic growth of 6% with positive growth across all business groups and all geographic areas.","Please note that we have an upcoming ERP roll out in the United States, and in anticipation of that deployment, some of our customers decided to accelerate their purchases. We estimate that this added approximately 50 to 100 basis points of growth in the second quarter, all of it in the U.S. results.","Moving on to earnings, we posted GAAP earnings of $3.07 per share, up 19% year-on-year. Adjusted earnings were $2.59 per share compared to $2.25 a year ago. This demonstrates that our teams around the world continue to execute well. Underlying margins were strong at 24% with all business groups above 21%. Beyond financial results, we are committed to building 3M for the long run, while returning cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested $468 million in research and development and another $365 million in CapEx. We also returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including both dividends and share repurchases.","Please turn to Slide 6. There is a lot to like this quarter across our entire portfolio. Our Industrial team posted good organic growth of 6%, a nice pick up from the first quarter. Growth was broad-based with particular strength in our filtration platform where we are leveraging our Membrana acquisition to accelerate penetration in biopharma and life sciences. Safety and Graphics delivered another outstanding quarter of 9% organic growth, along with robust margins. For the fourth consecutive quarter, our personal safety business grew double-digits, as we continue to build and extend our industry-leading portfolio in this market.","In Health Care, we continued to expand worldwide with organic growth of 4%, led by our medical solutions business with mid-single-digit growth. Health Care also posted double-digit growth in developing markets, as investments in those areas are paying off. This is a great business for 3M and we will continue to invest to strengthen it for the future.","Organic growth in Electronics and Energy was 5% on top of 10% growth in last year\u2019s second quarter. Within this business group, we have done a lot of portfolio work over the last several years to improve our relevance to customers in the marketplace. This has led to improved growth and a sustained improvement in margins. Last month, we continued to build on this portfolio work with the sale of our communication markets business. After a thorough review, we decided that selling this business will result in the greatest value creation for 3M and our shareholders. This is a good example of how we are actively managing our portfolio to best utilize the 3M model.","Going forward, we will continue to prioritize high growth opportunities in Electronics and Energy, such as automotive electrification, data centers, and semiconductor fabrication. Finally, organic growth in Consumer was 4%, which included good performances across our leading brands. We saw continued strength in home improvement, along with a strong start to the back-to-school season.","In summary, I am pleased with our performance in the second quarter and I thank our teams to their many contributions. Our playbook is working and we are just getting started. We are well positioned to grow into an even stronger and more successful company. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our portfolio, strengthen our innovation, and accelerate our transformation while developing our people.","Nick will now take you through the details of the quarter. Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 7. Sales grew 5.6% organically in the second quarter. Increases in selling prices contributed 110 basis points to sales growth in the quarter, and were positive across all geographic areas.","The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 80 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign currency translation increased sales by one percentage point. All-in second quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 7.4% versus last year. In the U.S., organic growth was 5.6%, led by electronics and energy, safety and graphics and consumer. EMEA increased 5.8% in Q2, driven by strong growth in West Europe that was led by Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Safety and Graphics.","Asia Pacific delivered 5.5% organic growth, led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. Organic growth was 12% in both China, Hong Kong, and India, while Japan was down 2%. Finally, Q2 organic growth in Latin America and Canada was 6%, led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. At a country level, Canada was up high single digits while Mexico and Brazil both delivered mid-single-digit organic growth.","Please turn to Slide 8 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, second quarter sales were $8.4 billion. Operating income in the second quarter was $2.4 billion, which included $400 million benefit from the communication markets divestiture gain net of related actions. Second quarter underlying operating margins were 24% excluding the net benefit from the communication markets divestitures. Let's take a closer look at the components of our margin performance in the second quarter. Leverage on organic growth improved productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions contributed a combined 290 basis points to margins.","Selling price benefits more than offset raw material inflation, adding 30 basis points to operating margins. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 20 basis points. Lastly, during the second quarter, we settled several respiratory and oral care related lawsuits, which decreased margins by 70 basis points.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 9 for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter GAAP earnings were $3.07 per share, up 19% year-over-year. Underlying earnings were $2.59 per share when adjusting for the communication markets divestiture gain net of related actions. Let me now discuss the primary drivers of the year-on-year increase in Q2 earnings per share. The benefits of organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions, added a combined $0.47 to per share earnings in the quarter.","The previously mentioned legal settlements reduced Q2 earnings by $0.7 per share. Higher year-on-year net interest expense and retirement benefit expense decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Our underlying Q2 tax rate was 19.8%, which increased earnings by $0.16 per share. The lower tax rate was driven primarily by U.S. tax reform and the continued benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise. Lastly, lower shares outstanding added $0.04 to per share earnings.","Please turn to Slide 10 for a look at our cash flow performance. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 14.5% year-on-year. Free cash flow conversion was 83% in the quarter. This includes 16 percentage point headwind divestiture gain of the communication markets business and related actions. Second quarter capital expenditures were $365 million, up $63 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.","During the quarter, we paid $802 million in cash dividends to shareholders and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Through the first half of the year, we repurchased $2.5 billion of stock and now expect full year repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion versus $3 billion to $5 billion previously.","Let's now review our business group performance, starting with industrial on Slide 11. The Industrial business group delivered second quarter sales of $3.1 billion, up 5.7% organically. Industrial's growth was broad-based across all geographic areas and businesses. Our advanced materials, abrasives, and separation and purification business led the way with high single digit growth in the quarter. Looking at the rest of the Industrial portfolio, our industrial adhesives and tapes, auto and aerospace and automotive aftermarket businesses, all delivered mid-single-digit growth in the quarter.","On a geographic basis, Industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 7% increase in EMEA, followed by mid-single-digit growth in each of the other areas. Industrial delivered second quarter operating income of $724 million. Operating margins were 23% with underlying margins up 180 basis points, excluding the impact of last year's second quarter portfolio and footprint actions.","Please turn to Slide 12. Second quarter safety and graphics sales were $1.8 billion, up 8.5% organically with strong growth across all businesses and geographies. As Mike mentioned, our personal safety business continued to post excellent growth, up double digits in the quarter. The integration of our Scott Safety business is performing well and we are pleased with the performance of the business. Commercial solutions was up high single digits while the transportation safety and roofing granules businesses, were both up mid-single digits.","Geographically, organic growth was led by 10% growth in EMEA with high single digit increases in both the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. Latin America and Canada grew 6% organically in the quarter. Operating income was $480 million with operating margins up 26.4%.","Please turn to Slide 13. Our Health Care business generated second quarter sales of $1.5 billion, up 3.8% organically. Our medical solutions business, which is our largest segment in Health Care, grew mid-single digits in Q2. Oral care was up 3% with continued good growth internationally, particularly in developing markets. Food safety grew high single digits, while health information systems grew mid-single digits. Finally, our project-based drug delivery business declined low single digits year-over-year.","On a geographic basis, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and Canada lead the way, both up high single digits. EMEA grew 5% followed by 1% in the U.S. We saw continued strength in developing markets, up double digits led by China, Hong Kong growing in the high teens. Health Care's second quarter operating income increased 7% to $435 million. And underlying operating margins were just over 30%, adjusting for the impact of the legal settlement and the commercialization investments for our new Clarity aligners.","Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 14. Electronics and Energy organic sales growth was 5.2% in the second quarter. Sales were $1.3 billion. The electronics side of the business grew 4% organically, led by mid-single-digit growth in electronics materials solutions. Our energy related businesses were up 9% organically led by electrical markets up double digits. As mentioned, we closed on the sale of substantially all of the communication markets business in the quarter and expect to close the remaining portion by the end of the year.","On a geographic basis, the U.S led with high single-digit organic growth, followed by mid-single-digit growth in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada was up low single digits. Second quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $865 million with underlying operating margins of nearly 28%.","Please turn to Slide 15. Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.2 billion and organic growth was 4.3% year-on-year. Our home improvement business grew double digits organically, continuing its track record of strong performance. Our leading brands continue to win in the marketplace, particularly Command and Filtrete, both up double digits. The home care business and stationery and office supply business each delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter. While consumer health care declined.","Looking at Consumer, geographically, growth was led by 7% increase in the U.S. followed by mid-single-digit growth in Latin America, Canada. In the second quarter, we continue to see strong consumer demand for our products in the U.S., particularly in the e-commerce channel. Finally, operating income was $261 million with operating margins of 21.4%. That wraps up our review of the second quarter results.","Please turn to Slide 16, and I'll cover our updated 2018 guidance. Our full year organic growth expectations remain unchanged in the range of 3% to 4%. With respect to earnings, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10.20 to $10.45 versus a prior range of $10.20 to $10.55. The update to the range reflects the impact of the divested income associated with the communication markets business. Finally, please note that we now expect that foreign currency translation will add approximately 1% to full year sales growth versus the prior expectation of 2%.","With that, we thank you for your attention and we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis","Inge, you will be missed. You did a fantastic job as you know, and Mike, big shoes to fill, but I'm sure you'll do great as well. There\u2019s one thing that caught my eye just in the prepared remarks was your ERP rollout comments. Can you tell us, is that in every segment? Is that -- how big of a deal is this and what\u2019s your confidence level that the pull forward was just 50 to 100 and not something greater than that? Is it possible to have that kind of precision?","Inge Thulin","Scott, we\u2019ve been working on deploying our business transformation, our ERP rollout globally, for a number of years, and we have largely completed our deployment in Europe, West Europe, in particular. And now, as we came into 2018, we are focused on the U.S. And so it's a very well laid out plan of deployments by region, by business, by supply chain operations; and so we are over the next 18 months now deploying in the U.S., so we\u2019ve a very specific deployment by business. We did deploy our Health Care business at the end of last year. And so we have experience with that business in the deployment already complete, and now we\u2019re deploying the rest of the businesses in the U.S. as we go through the next 18 months. So we have a pretty clear view on which customers are impacted with the deployment at which periods of time, and so we have very good -- I think, pretty clear view of how much of the accelerated sales are in line with the deployment now that\u2019s taking place in the U.S.","Scott Davis","And then as a follow-up, I mean we've seen some pretty big moves in EM currency over the last quarter. What can you guys -- what's the playbook? Do you have to go in there and raise prices? Do you realign some supply chains? I mean, what\u2019s the playbook to manage that volatility?","Nick Gangestad","Scott, the playbook on there really isn't changing. We seek to have natural hedges against currency risk and how we set up the supply chain, and then we layer on top of that some financial hedges. And those financial hedges don't ultimately change the underlying financials over a longer period of time, but we have hedges that we enter into going out one, two, three years, to buy time for us to adjust our cost structure, our supply chain in order to end up with the competitive supply chain in a revised FX environment.","So in the short term what we often do especially in emerging markets, we will adjust prices to partially offset the FX impact. And then we will adjust our supply chain adjusting where we\u2019re manufacturing based on FX movements. That tends to take a little longer time though, Scott. And not in a short-term, but we often have to change and re-qualify sources of supply to make that happen. For the year, Scott, I will say, we started the year guiding that FX with rates as they stood at the end of the year we thought that they would positively impact our earnings by about $0.10.","Through the first few months of the year, the dollar weakened more and that pushed our EPS benefit that we were expecting slightly above that $0.10. In the last few months, we\u2019ve seen the dollar strengthen, and we now see ourselves slightly below that $0.10. And through the first half of the year, we have seen $0.06 EPS benefit from FX. And if we see meaningful changes to that $0.10 we originally guided, we\u2019ll provide updates on that accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin","Inge, congratulations. Thanks, Mike. Look forward to working with you and the team. Just a question on guidance, if I look at income before taxes that you guys have on Slide 22, basically, I think prior outlook was 7.7 to 8.2, and now it\u2019s 7.8 to 7.9. And I think the press release indicates that most of it is just adjusting for missing revenue and earnings from the divestiture, but the composition sort of doesn\u2019t make sense. Can you tell us what the big moving pieces are as we move from 7.7, 8.2 range to 7.8 to 7.9.","Nick Gangestad","Andrew, there\u2019s a few moving pieces there. First of all, as you noted, now that we have divested of our communications markets division, there is some income that that would have been generating in the last seven months of the year that that will no longer be generating, and that\u2019s what's encompassed in our adjustment to our EPS guidance for the year. In particular, what you're talking about there, there is also an impact from net interest expense. So in terms of our earnings bridge that we laid out at the beginning of the year, there is a couple of moving parts in addition to this communication markets adjustment that we announced today.","First is, we are buying back more shares, and we originally guided that that would be $0.10 to $0.15 of benefit. We now see ourselves at the high end of that range, so that\u2019s on the positive. We also are borrowing more money, so our net interest expense is going up. So we started the year guiding that net interest expense would be a benefit to our EPS of $0.05 to $0.10. We now think that will be approximately flat for the year.","Andrew Obin","So these are the two moving pieces, and just a question going back to the ERP question. I assume your guidance is sort of incorporated. Did you guys anticipate this pre-buy in the second quarter? And the second, just how do you guys think about managing disruptions from ERP implementations in North America because Western Europe, and I do appreciate that Western Europe was a much more significant undertake in terms of shutting down facilities, moving stuff around, but you did have negative top line comps there for a while. So going to the second half, as you have to manage ERP disruptions in North America, what gives you confidence that there will not be hits to organic growth? How you guys are going to manage it?","Mike Roman","I would maybe start with, as we\u2019ve talked a lot about with the business transformation, it really starts and ends with the customer for us. So we are -- in our deployments, that's where we start. We focus on how to do the best for our customers, minimize impact and provide benefits with where we\u2019re going with business transformation. And I would say, as we deployed in Europe that was true. You are asking the customers to significantly change how they interact with us. But on the other side of that, change process is a lot of benefit for how we work together. And so I think we saw that in Europe.","And we had the deployment and some of the same things we\u2019re seeing now in the U.S. where we had some repurchases. I don't think we would characterize it the way you did that we saw growth impacted by that business transformation. That was other dynamics in the marketplace and even some of things that we\u2019re doing around portfolio. So -- and maybe to a degree some of the things we\u2019re doing about some of the strategic investments there. But the layout with a focus on customers and how we manage that, that's part of what we're doing in the U.S. now. We\u2019re engaging day-in and day-out, communicating with them earlier about how this is progressing, working with them very closely about managing through any disruption as we scale down the legacy systems and scale up the new ERP and surrounding capabilities.","And so that process, we are managing supply all the way through the calendar of those steps and this accelerated by -- we expected some accelerated by, we\u2019re working with our customers as we got closer, how much interruption would they see, how much accelerated buy made sense if -- and its really up to them. Ultimately, they\u2019re making the decision on what they buy based on the information we\u2019re communicating with them. I would say, it\u2019s in line with what we\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve deployed through West Europe and I think it's projecting that. We\u2019re doing good job, the deployments are on track and progressing well.","Andrew Obin","So from your perspective, there is high degree of visibility on organic growth in second half?","Mike Roman","Yes, related to the ERP deployment, absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So there\u2019s obviously been a little more noise here with the ERP rollout. But can you give us a little more color and how should we think about your organic sales growth guidance by segment. If we look at your annual guidance and you guys talked about Health Care, at 4 to 6, maybe you\u2019re trending a little below there, but Safety and Graphics is trending way above. So is there a bit of trade-off there? And then the other segments generally in line for the year. Is that how we should think about it?","Nick Gangestad","Just a few things, as far as the impact of this ERP go-live impact and the way its impacting different segments in the U.S. We see these impacts primarily in our Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy business groups. It\u2019s not really having a material impact on consumer and really no impact on our healthcare business. So in terms of how you think about that impact in the second quarter and the third quarter, and fourth quarter it's really those three businesses that were impacted.","Now in terms of our guidance for the year, we continue to see industrial globally -- we had originally guided 3% to 5%, we see that most likely in the bottom half of that range. And that aligns with the updated total company guidance that we providing in April. We do see Health Care probably closer to the 4% growth for the total year and safety and graphics, which we\u2019d originally guided at 4% to 6%, we see at the high end or possibly higher than the high end of our original guidance. The others are Consumer and Electronics and Energy, we see those solidly in the ranges that we that we first put out.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And maybe I could ask you about pricing, obviously, very strong pricing in the quarter. When you look at price versus raws, it actually accelerated or was better in Q2 than Q1. I know you said it was going to be an elevated year for pricing. But are there any particular end markets where pricing is particularly strong? And then do you think the headwind on price versus raw material cost could be less than the $0.05 to $0.10 for the year that you updated this time last quarter?","Nick Gangestad","The $0.05 to $0.10, Andy, just to be clear, that\u2019s just the raw material headwind, that we updated that. And as far as price growth, it\u2019s actually, Andy, quite broad. I won\u2019t point out one business, or one geography, as really driving these results it's really quite broad and deep where the price growth is. In terms of impact on margin, I think I said earlier that we continue to see that positive for the year and halfway through the year. We continue to see that highly confident that our price increases will more than offset whatever we see for raw material headwinds for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell","In terms of -- maybe first question on the top of the end market. Any updated thoughts on the automotive outlook, particularly in your Industrial business? And also within Electronics and Energy, there had been this bifurcation earlier in the year where device sell-through was soft but the CapEx or electronics materials business was very strong. Just wondered how you\u2019ve seen that playing out more recently. And are you worried about the CapEx portion or EMS decelerating given what's happening with the device sell-through?","Mike Roman","So starting with the automotive, we continued, as year-to-date through the first half, we continue to see strong growth relative to the build rates globally. So remember we\u2019re managing a global automotive business, focus around key account relationships with the OEMs globally. And we\u2019re seeing continued good performance on our spec-ins and penetration into the marketplace and so good growth, year-to-date relative to the build rates. Some improvement in the build rates in second quarter still looking at IHS projections, up over 4%, slightly over 4% second quarter; again, total year still in line with that, 2.2% number; and always watching quarter-to-quarter the ups and downs there; but are performing well; and when you bring together our automotive electrification capabilities and what we're doing in our technology and applications around that, we continue to see a very robust outlook for outgrowing the build rates.","If you turn to Electronics and Energy, we continue to see, I would say, strong growth in what we've been talking about as high growth electronic segments, around automotive electrification, around data centers, semiconductor fabrication, that continues to move forward; and semiconductor fabrication behind, as part of your question there where CapEx is being spent, still seeing significant growth opportunities for us. The rest of the electronics, I would say, electronics in general is playing out in line with the way we laid it out at the beginning of the year that was the more, I would say, modest growth in the consumer electronics part of our portfolio and stronger growth in those higher growth segments. There is some, I would say, some shifts here or there in the quarter but pretty much playing out as we expected in our Electronics and Energy business, pretty much right down the middle of the range that we laid out at the beginning of the year as well.","Julian Mitchell","And then my second question would just be around, if you look back your EPS road map from Slide 8, way back at the December outlook meeting from Nick\u2019s presentation. I think you\u2019ve given the very thorough update on two of the laying chunks in that, so maybe any thought on the productivity piece. How that's trending in terms of footprint optimization, business transformation and the manufacturing productivity? In terms of -- I guess, what are the savings -- how the savings from those various programs tracking in the first half versus what you would expected? And any gyrations in the sales line causing you to accelerate some of the productivity plans?","Nick Gangestad","Julian, in terms of the 2018 roadmap that I provided last December and then we updated it in January after tax reform, the other components are staying where we expected. But let me give a little color on it. Even organic growth, with the roll-down that we had in our total year organic growth expectation for the year, we see more of our growth coming from price, which is accretive to EPS. So our organic growth impact on earnings remains unchanged; footprint optimization, much of that, Julian, was just not repeating the charges that we took in 2017.","There\u2019s some incremental charges and some benefit, those largely washed in 2018. We\u2019re expecting the majority of true benefit to be coming in 2019 and 2020. So that is progressing exactly as we expected. Raw materials, as I noted, we adjusted that down from that original guidance. Business transformation and productivity, both of those are tracking to the range that we put in that they\u2019re performing exactly as we expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","I\u2019d like to follow up on some of the business line specific questions that Julian started there. And Mike, can you address how auto aftermarket did in the quarter versus some of the follow up we saw in the first quarter? And then in oral care, we saw the total growth. How did the U.S. market do specifically, has the distribution channel calm down and maybe talk a bit more about this launch. It looks that like Clarity will compete directly with Invisalign. And is that -- what are the competitive dynamics there?","Mike Roman","So starting with the industrial, automotive aftermarket question, Industrial, we saw broad-based growth across all geographic areas of all businesses. We highlighted some of the leading growth there. We saw mid-single-digit growth in our automotive aftermarket business in Q2. Coming out of Q1, we\u2019re really looking hard at the market. We saw end demand soften as we came out of Q1, but the total year was projecting nominal growth for that marketplace. And we expected to improve as we went through the year, and we saw that starts in Q2. We saw the demand pick up. We saw our opportunity to marketplace pick up across developed economies, in particular, in the U.S. leading that. So we saw the improvement we expected with automotive aftermarket, and we\u2019re projecting the total year in line with where we started at the beginning.","Turning to oral care, oral care is an important business for us. We\u2019re recognized as a leader in number of positions, leveraging our material science. And we continue to innovate and look to invest and grow this business as we move ahead. It really does leverage our strengths. If you look at the overall growth in second quarter; 3% for worldwide growth, down slightly in the U.S.; improving over Q1 and again, what we're expecting is to see some improvement globally; and led again by developing markets, but improving as we go through the year; still some room to go in improvement in the U.S. as we move ahead.","We did announced and introduced our Clarity aligners at the American Association Orthodontist Show in May. And we believe that this now positions us to have the broadest set of solutions across orthodontic platforms, and we\u2019re actively onboarding orthodontist right now. So it\u2019s really a play for us to help -- have a broad-based suite of solutions for the orthodontists in the global market. We\u2019re getting -- so far getting very good and positive feedback.","Deane Dray","And just as a follow up on tariffs, and maybe Nick can clarify the points that expect to be positive in price cost. Does that include the tariffs that have been announced and enacted? And what\u2019s the look forward on potential risk as this may get escalated?","Nick Gangestad","The guidance that I said is inclusive of tariffs that have been enacted. So when we\u2019re talking tariffs there\u2019s a number of tariffs, first, the steel and aluminum under the national security act. And that impact as well as the Section 301 list 1, those two that have already been enacted, we see having a fairly immaterial impact on us. So we estimate that to be approximately $10 million, or a penny of share on an annualized basis, the direct and indirect impact of those tariffs.","We are actively monitoring and assessing the potential impact from Section 301 list 2 and 3, if those were implemented and any potential retaliation that could occur with those. And we\u2019re prepared to act with sourcing changes, supply changes and pricing changes if enacted. So my initial statement stands that we think pricing will offset raw material impacts there and if tariffs expand we continue to see that happening. We\u2019re not quantifying the impact of those latter two since they haven\u2019t been enacted yet, but we are prepared with actions to minimize the impact of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander","Two quick ones, first, on the price versus raws dynamic. If raw material pressures peak out, do you think you can maintain the same pace of price, or is there certain amount of the price mix just the raw material offsets. And secondly on Asia, specifically in China, can you parse out a little bit the trends driving the pick-up in Chinese growth -- the acceleration from Q1 to Q2? Is that just Consumer and Health or is there something else going on there?","Nick Gangestad","Laurence, on the price raw materials, we are likely seeing that our commodity prices and the increases we\u2019re seeing there likely at a peak level. And our pricing projections, our selling price projections are consistent with that and that\u2019s part of our anticipation that in a more stable world going forward with commodities, we\u2019ll continue to have our prices -- our selling price increases more than offset what we\u2019re estimating now for commodity price increases. And we really don't see that changing. And if the commodity prices start to change again, we will be prepared to act.","Mike Roman","And Laurence, just taking a look at China, we had strong growth in second quarter. Electronics performed very well as we continue to, I would say, win business with companies based there, including the China OEMs. We also saw strong growth in our domestic facing businesses, the domestic economy facing businesses. We\u2019ve had a strategy to prioritize growth here in line with what China is doing to develop their economy. And so as you noted, Health Care is a strong leader of that growth in the first half of the year, big part of our consumer business performing very well.","Safety and Graphics also, really with the domestic facing portfolio, doing well. And even if you look at our Industrial business, we have platform businesses -- our Industrial business group that are performing well too and that would be a good example our industrial adhesives and tapes business doing very well in China. So it's broader than just Health Care and Consumer, really centered around where the growth is occurring in the broader China market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Nigel Coe","The $0.15 probably mix of restructuring associated with the gain on the comms business. Is that just to the E&E comm segments or is this broader, and maybe just some color in terms of what actions you\u2019re taking with the $0.15?","Nick Gangestad","Nigel, the actions that we\u2019re taking are to address stranded costs that are left after the divestiture of our CMD business. So there\u2019re addressing structural costs that this divestiture is leaving. We started those actions in Q2 and we expect to take more in the second half of the year to offset what could have been a negative impact if we had left those stranded costs in the company going forward.","Nigel Coe","And would that be a payback, relatively quick payback, 12 month payback or little bit longer?","Nick Gangestad","We expect that that will be paying back for us next year. Some of those actions will trail into next year in terms of when the cost saving start to happen. But we\u2019ll be starting to see that benefit in 2019. And Nigel, one other thing I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re asking this earlier, this charge is almost entirely been taken at a corporate level and not in our Electronics and Energy business.","Nigel Coe","And then just a follow on question, on the guidance, the way the guidance set up at the second half. Are we getting questions in terms of still somewhat backend loaded, particularly when we think about the way the FX is coming through the P&L and if those comms comes at first half and second half. What\u2019s better in the second half versus the first half to get us to the midpoint of the guidance range>","Nick Gangestad","For the second half of the year, we do expect that we\u2019ll be seeing more benefit from share repurchases than we saw in the first half. We do think productivity will be better in the second half than what we saw in the first half. And then in terms of commodity prices from a year-on-year basis, we expect that that will be fairly neutral between the first half and the second half. Pricing will likely be better in the second half than in the first half.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Sprague","Just a quick clean up from me on healthcare and then maybe a bigger picture question for Mike. Health Care U.S. growth has been a little on the soft side year-to-date and in the quarter, perhaps it's dental. But are we observing some hangover from pull forward on sales there from ERP last year in the healthcare business?","Mike Roman","Jeff, healthcare in the U.S. where you\u2019re seeing the impact, broadly, we had strong growth and our medical solutions business is leading the way there. So maybe just a note about that too, we've been talking about this as our medical consumables business in the past, but it really is focused on value-based care and health economics. And it's a much -- in more integrated portfolio around that. So I\u2019m going to be talking about as medical solutions, so leading the way. We saw good growth in the U.S., also in food safety and health information. Oral care was down slightly. The bigger drag in second quarter was our drug delivery business. Again, we talked about project based business. We saw a decline in Q2 from that business and that was the bigger impact, so broad-based stronger growth that will position us well in the U.S. and as we move ahead. And then you asked\u2026","Jeff Sprague","And then, Mike, on the portfolio. Obviously, you\u2019ve been working closely with Inge all along. And I guess things will always be under review. But was CMD out of the way here now, do you view the portfolio as relatively stable, or there is more that you're working on internally and want to reevaluate?","Mike Roman","If you look at where we are focused as we move ahead, our playbook is working. Our playbook is working, but there are opportunities that each of those three levers, including portfolio management. We are now an active portfolio manager and we do have a robust pipeline of how we look at our portfolio. And we\u2019ll be working to best utilize the 3M model and optimize the portfolio around our model for value creation. So we\u2019re going to continue to be an active portfolio manager as we move ahead. It's about prioritizing resources. It's about targeting where we go with M&A. And it's also about reviewing our businesses as we go. So I see that as very much part of our future value creation opportunity. And it's a priority for me as I step into the role.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker","I just want to dig a little bit more into that important price point, the 1.1% in the quarter. You mentioned it was quite broad. But you usually also talk about splitting out currency impacts and other impacts versus underlying business year-on-year relative to taking pricing on existing items and new product, some time driving a big part of it. I am just trying to get a sense for the operating robustness of that number and the repeatability of it as we\u2019re looking through not only if implying the rest of the year, but later into next year too?","Nick Gangestad","Steven, as I said, it\u2019s broad based; 100 basis points up in the U.S.; EMEA was up 180 basis points; Latin America and Canada 210 basis points; and A-Pac up 40 basis points. And that 110 basis points is inclusive of our electronics business, which is normally a price down model. If we pull electronics out, our underlying price growth was up 130 basis points. And as far as geographies and what we see as potential there, we continue to see -- we don\u2019t see that going down.","Part of your question, Steve, was also on FX impact. Right now, we estimate there was only about 20 of that 110 or 130, depending on how you look at, price growth that was coming from FX. The vast majority of it is coming from core underlying price growth. And it's really a reflection of the value we create for our customers. And this is the new point I\u2019m making here. It\u2019s partially being driven by improvements in our global price management that our business transformation initiative is enabling. The ability to have better governance and better control over that pricing, we are starting to see that benefit and that\u2019s part of what you\u2019re seeing change here.","Steven Winoker","And Mike, Jeff just referred to it on the divestiture side and the portfolio change side. But looking at acquisition, Scott Safety was a great strategic play for you guys. What are you seeing in terms of think of the pipeline right now? Should we be expecting anything in the bigger size range soon, or are things on hold at all as you\u2019re going through the transition. What should the expectations be on the acquisitions?","Mike Roman","For ne coming in, as always, organic growth remains our first priority. And so we\u2019re going to continue to prioritize investments in R&D, CapEx and product commercialization. With that in mind though in managing our portfolio, we\u2019re looking at M&A as an opportunity to create value, we\u2019re going to maintain the flexibility to pursue additional strategic acquisition opportunities like Scott Safety. And we have been, I think, very clearly focused on strategies that leverage our fundamental strengths unique value creators to 3M. Our ability to integrate successfully these acquisitions and to create market leadership positions like we've been doing in personal safety. So we are active.","Our top priorities, as I look ahead our Health Care and Industrial, Safety and Graphics continues to be a priority, those are very much focused on integrating Scott Safety at this time. With that said, all five businesses are active. And we have strong overall pipelines for us to work with. And so for me it's about really moving ahead and identifying those opportunities that are clearly linked to those strategies where we can create differentiated value.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Tusa","So just better understanding some of the moving parts here, back to Nigel's question on the seasonality. You pulled forward a bit of sales here in the second quarter. You got pretty though comp in the third quarter. Anything on that comp that we should be aware of, is it like second half looks like first half whereas first quarter was lower than second quarter, a 3% range. Is that how we\u2019re thinking about the second half split between 3Q and Q4 on organic? And then also just on EPS, you had a low tax rate, tax rate low end of the range this quarter, maybe that steps up a little bit in the third quarter. Will you grow earnings here sequentially in the third quarter?","Nick Gangestad","Steve, in terms of growth, let me give some guidance on how we're seeing growth between the third and fourth quarter. Mike talked earlier about the impact of our U.S. go-live with our ERP system and the amount of the revenue. So that impact as we expect that to be -- us to be giving back some of the sales in the second half of the year, we expect that to disproportionately impact the third quarter. And as you noted between the two quarters, Q3 is the tougher of the two comps between the third and the fourth quarter.","That all-in, we are looking at the third quarter being lower growth than the fourth quarter, both of them aligned with our expectation of 3 to 4 for the total year. But I'm not going to be surprised if we have a lower number in third quarter, given what we're seeing so far for the year, and it\u2019s in line with our 3% to 4% guidance. And then in terms of EPS for each quarter, I\u2019ll try to avoid giving EPS guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we continue to see ourselves very firmly delivering in that 10 on an adjusted basis to 10.20 to the 10.45 for the total year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Aguilar of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Aguilar","So drug delivery down low single digits year-over-year, and I think last quarter was the same case of tough comps. Obviously, this is more project-based businesses as you guys said. And I remember in your Investor Day in 2016 you were talking about some of the advantages from drug delivery, like analytics and patient compliance. More long term, are you guys still optimistic about the future trends there generally with drug delivery? And can you give us an update about what you're excited about?","Mike Roman","Josh, you\u2019re referring to some of the opportunities that we see for growth in that business. And we see opportunities to take that business to a positive growth business as we move ahead. It will continue to be a project-based business. So quarter-to-quarter, it can be lumpy and up and down but we do see opportunities. We have some unique capabilities and technology there that we imply as we move ahead.","Operator","That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.","Mike Roman","To wrap up, we had a strong performance in the second quarter, led by broad-based organic growth, expanded margins and a double-digit increase in earnings per share. We are executing our playbook and are positioned to deliver successful 2018. Thank you again for joining us this morning, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentleman, that does conclude the conference call for today, we thank you for your participation. And ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"697":["3M Company (NYSE:MMM) Q1 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call April 25, 2019  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Bruce Jermeland - Vice President, Investor Relations","Michael Roman - Chief Executive Officer","Nicholas Gangestad - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi","John Inch - Gordon Haskett","Julian Mitchell - Barclays","Josh Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets","Scott Davis - Melius Research","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 25, 2019.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. ","Bruce Jermeland","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2.","Before we begin, let me remind you to mark your calendars for upcoming earnings calls on July 25, and October 24. ","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1a of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Finally, please note that throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular measures which exclude the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and significant litigation-related charges. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release.","Please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike?","Michael Roman","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. The first quarter was a disappointing start to the year for 3M. We continued to face slowing in several key end markets, which impacted both growth and margins, and our operational execution fell short of the expectations we have for ourselves.","Today I will lay out a number of aggressive actions we are taking to drive productivity, reduce costs and improve cash flow, as we manage through challenges in some of our end markets.","In addition, I will provide an update on two litigation issues that affect affected our results. And provide updated guidance for the full year. I will also discuss the realignment of our business groups that we announced last month which will enable even greater growth and operational efficiency.","Please turn to slide 5 for a summary of our first quarter numbers. Organic growth company-wide was minus 1%, lower than we anticipated. We saw end market softness in China, Automotive and Electronics, which we have discussed throughout the quarter.","We also faced channel inventory adjustments, which negatively impacted several of our businesses. With respect to EPS, we posted adjusted earnings of $2.23 per share down 11% year-over-year. This excludes significant litigation charges related to the PFAS and respirators, which I will discuss later in my remarks.","Underlying margins were 21% in the quarter, down 160 basis points with adjusted income of $1.7 billion. Our earnings and margin shortfall was due to a combination of two things.","First negative organic growth in the quarter and the second weak productivity, especially in our Industrial related businesses within Asia Pacific and the United States. As the actions we took were not sufficient to offset the broad-based softening we faced in those markets as the quarter progressed.","Please turn to slide 6. We are moving quickly to strengthen our performance and address the challenges we face and the actions on this slide are underway. First, we are reducing approximately 2,000 positions, through both voluntary and involuntary actions. Reductions will span all business groups, functions and geographies with emphasis on corporate structure and underperforming areas of the portfolio.","On a pre-tax basis we will take a charge of approximately $150 million in 2019, and we expect annual savings of approximately $225 million to $250 million, with $100 million this year.","Job reductions are never easy, but they are necessary to make us stronger and a more competitive enterprise as we move forward.","Beyond restructuring, we are also driving cash flow by reducing inventory levels and accelerating actions on indirect costs. Importantly, while we take these actions we remain focused on our customers and balancing short term pressures with the long-term success of 3M.","That is why we will continue our investments in growth, which includes research and development and our priority growth programs. This is a playbook we know how to execute and we are confident it will enable us to maximize value for shareholders as we work through the market slowdowns and our related actions, positioning us for strong growth as our markets recover.","Please turn to slide 7. As I mentioned earlier, two significant litigation matters related to PFAS and respirators impacted our quarter and resulted in a total charge of $548 million or $0.72 per share. We increased our respiratory reserve by $313 million to address the costs of resolving all current and expected: coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West Virginia.","We also established a PFAS reserve of $235 million to cover certain environmental matters and litigation related to the manufacture and disposal of PFAS at five 3M facilities, including three in the United States and two in Europe. This reserve does not include any product claims related to PFAS.","We continue to work closely with the EPA and other regulatory bodies to support science-based regulations of these chemistries. We also continue to work with the communities we serve to ensure they can have confidence in the quality of their drinking water, additional details will be available in our upcoming 10-Q filing.","Please turn to slide 8 for an update on our 2019 guidance. While we remain positive on the global macroeconomic environment, growth conditions in certain markets have been slower than anticipated going into the year. As a result, today we are updating our range for organic growth to minus one to the top plus 2%, against the prior range of one 1% to 4%.","In addition, we anticipate adjusted earnings of $9.25 to $9.75 per share which includes the restructuring impact versus the previous range of $10.45 to $10.90. We now expect a return on invested capital of 20% to 22% against the prior range of 22$ to 25%.","We continue to anticipate a free cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 105%. I'll come back to make some comments on our new business group alignment after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick","Nicholas Gangestad","Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 9. Organic sales declined 1.1% in the first quarter, with volumes down 200 basis points and selling prices up 90 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced sales by 50 basis points. While foreign currency translation was an additional 3.4 percentage point headwind to sales.","All-in, first quarter sales in U.S. dollars decreased 5% versus last year. Geographically the U.S. declined 40 basis points organically, Consumer and Electronics and Energy grew low-single digits, while Industrial, Safety and Graphics and Health Care declined.","Asia Pacific was down 3.6% organically in Q1, impacted by the slowdown in China, Automotive and Electronics markets. Health Care delivered positive high single-digit organic growth in the quarter, while Industrial, Consumer and Electronics and Energy declined.","Organic growth was down 4% in China\/Hong Kong against an 11% comparison a year ago. Japan organic growth declined 7%, or excluding Electronics increased 2%. Latin America\/Canada and EMEA each grew 1% organically in the quarter.","Please turn to slide 10 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide first quarter sales were $7.9 billion, with adjusted operating income of $1.7 billion and adjusted operating margins of 21.4%.","On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see the components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Declines in organic volume and weak productivity reduced margins 180 basis points year-on-year.","Productivity challenges were most pronounced in our Industrial related businesses within Asia Pacific and the United States. Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by 40 basis points, primarily driven by our acquisition of M*Modal which closed in February.","Higher selling prices continued to more than offset raw material inflation contributing 30 basis points to first quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by an additional 30 basis points.","Let's now turn to slide 11 for a closer look at earnings per share. First quarter adjusted earnings were $2.23 per share, down 11% year-over-year. As you see, a number of factors impacted first quarter earnings. Most significantly, negative organic growth and weak productivity reduced per share earnings by $0.19 in the quarter. This was notably different from our outlook in January. The rest of our EPS factors are in line with our original expectations.","Acquisitions and divestitures combined reduced first quarter earnings by $0.07 per share versus last year. Foreign currency net of hedging was an additional $0.05 per share headwind in the quarter. As expected, our underlying tax rate increased year-on-year, which reduced Q1 earnings $by $0.05. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding 4% versus Q1 last year, adding $0.09 to per share earnings.","Please turn to slide 12 for a look at our cash flow performance. First quarter free cash flow was $657 million, with a free cash flow conversion rate of 74%, which includes a 24 percentage point benefit from the litigation-related charges.","First quarter capital expenditures were $391 million, up $87 million year-on-year. For the full year, we now anticipate CapEx investments in the range of 1.6 billion to $1.7 billion versus a prior range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.","We increased our first quarter per share dividend by 6%, resulting in $830 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter. Gross share repurchases were $701 million in the quarter, and we continue to expect full year repurchases in the range of $2 billion to $4 billion.","Please turn to slide 13, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q1. Please note additional business group performance details can be found in the appendix of this presentation.","As mentioned earlier, throughout the quarter we continued to see soft end market trends in China, Automotive and Electronics, along with channel inventory adjustments. These trends primarily impacted our Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy businesses.","Our Industrial business saw a broad-based slowdown across most of its portfolio, posting an organic sales decline of 2.8% to start the year. This slow organic growth within Industrial was most pronounced in our automotive business.","Our automotive OEM business was down 9% year-on-year, impacted by a 6% decline in first quarter global car and light truck builds, along with channel inventory reductions, particularly in China.","A positive note, advanced materials continued to deliver strong organic growth in the quarter, up high single digits. ","On a geographic basis Industrial's organic growth was led by 1% increases in both Latin America\/Canada and EMEA, while the U.S. declined 2% and Asia Pacific declined 8%. Industrial's first quarter operating margins were 20%, down 280 basis points, impacted by sales declines and weak productivity.","Moving to Safety and Graphics, first quarter sales were flat organically against last year's 7% comparison. Personal Safety continued to deliver solid results in Q1, up 3% organically, while each of the other three businesses declined. Geographically, organic growth was led by Latin America\/Canada and EMEA, each up 2%. Asia Pacific was flat, while the U.S. was down 3%.","Safety and Graphics first quarter operating margins were 23.2%, down 380 basis points. The year-on-year operating margin decline included a negative 110 basis point impact from a gain on a divestiture last year, along with slow growth and weak productivity.","Next our Health Care business was up 1% organically in the first quarter. Holding back growth in Health Care was the continued softness in our drug delivery business, down nearly 20% organically in the first quarter, which negatively impacted overall Health Care organic growth by nearly 2 percentage points.","Organic growth was led by food safety, up high single digits followed by health information systems up mid-single digits, while medical solutions and oral care were each up low-single digits organically.","On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific led the way up 7%, with EMEA up 3%. The U.S. declined 3% impacted by drug delivery. Health Care's first quarter operating margins were 28.1% which included a negative 230 basis point impact from the Q1 acquisition of M*Modal.","Shifting to the Electronics and Energy business, organic sales declined 3% in the first quarter. The Energy side of the business grew 5%, while the Electronics related businesses were down 6%, with declines in both display material systems and Electronics material solutions.","Electronics related growth was impacted by soft end market demand in Consumer Electronics and factory automation, along with channel inventory adjustments. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 2% increase in the U.S., while Asia Pacific declined 5%. First quarter operating margins were 23.8%, down 110 basis points year-over-year.","Lastly, first quarter organic growth for the Consumer business was 1%. Sales grew in our home improvement business, up 3% organically, while home care and consumer health care declined.","Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 3% increase in the U.S., with particular strength in our Filtrete and command brands. EMEA declined 1% as we continued to adjust our portfolio in this region and Asia Pacific declined 3% impacted by lower Consumer demand for respiratory solutions. Consumer's operating margins were 19.5% in the first quarter.","That wraps up our review of first quarter results. Please turn to slide 14, and I'll hand it back over to Mike to discuss the business group realignment. Mike?","Michael Roman","Thank you, Nick. Earlier I laid out actions we are taking to address our near-term challenges. At the same time we are continuing to build 3M for the long run. Effective April 1, we moved from five to four business groups in order to better serve our customers and better align our businesses to their markets.","The new business groups are organized around customers and go-to-market models and include Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer.","This realignment will enable us to accelerate growth, maximize value across the portfolio, and take greater advantage of our transformation progress. It will also further streamline the organization and help us achieve the 200 to 300 basis points of margin expansion that we laid out last November as part of our five-year plan. We will start reporting results under this structure in the second quarter.","Please turn to slide 15, and I will take you through our 2019 guidance for the new business groups. We expect organic growth to be led by Health Care with a range of 2% to 4%, followed by Consumer at 1% to 3%. Organic growth in Safety & Industrial is expected in the range of minus 1% to plus 2%, with Transportation & Electronics at minus 3% to flat. That wraps up our prepared remarks.","In summary, while our recent performance is disappointing, our business model remains strong and we are making the necessary changes to accelerate 3M into a stronger future. Thank you. And we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin","Good morning, guys.","Michael Roman","Morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on margins. I think the last time you had this kind of revenue decline, as I look at my model was sort of 4Q \u201815 and 1Q \u201816 and sort of the operating leverage impact was a lot less I think in 1Q \u201816 margins actually went up. So I'm just trying to understand what happened with the margin decline in the quarter and specifically also, as I look at the gross margin, what surprised me once again looking at my model, the last time you had gross margins that low I think was 4Q \u201908 or 1Q \u201809, so that\u2019s very odd? Thank you.","Michael Roman","Thank you, Andrew. Maybe I\u2019ll l start and I'll ask Nick to give some more detailed comments. The two drivers of that, one is the organic growth and the organic growth as we talked about was led by China, Automotive and Electronics, which are strong gross margin businesses for us globally. So that was one of the contributing factors.","And then the adjustments that came in the channel, along with that slowing growth in those markets, that drove challenges for us in productivity in the plants. And we took actions to adjust our production levels and our costs there, but we didn't get ahead of it. So those were a couple of the big contributor really driven off of that slowing the majority of that slowing from those end markets","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. Andrew, a couple things to add in there. As we were going through the quarter and seeing lower volumes and we of course adjusted the output coming out of our factories. So for the first quarter, compared to the first quarter last year, we were seeing the output in our factories down between 4% and 5%.","Unfortunately we did not pull spending down proportionately. Our spending was down about 1% in our factories during that time. And that had a negative impact on our margin.","Also on the - in there was the impact of a bit of a geographic mix, if you look at where we make higher margins and lower margins, the declines that we saw in Asia Pacific had an outsized impact on our margin this quarter.","Michael Roman","Andrew, I would also add, we - as I said in my speech, we didn't respond aggressively enough to what we were seeing. And so we\u2019re behind the curve as we came through the quarter. That's why we're stepping in aggressively with the actions that we are\u2026","Andrew Obin","Let me ask the question maybe another way. We were surprised I think the Asia top line growth was fairly well telegraphed, maybe Japan surprised a little bit, but it's North American decline that also surprised me. And you continued sort of - you did note weak productivity in North America multiple times.","And I was just wondering, how much - and I know we sort of finished the customer-facing ERP rollout. Can you just give us an update? Are you rolling out on the factories your key factories in North America, are you rolling ERP on the manufacturing floor, and is that disruptive? Thank you.","Michael Roman","Andrew, just to update on the ERP, we've actually been very pleased with the success that we've had in the deployment in the U.S., and it has been around the businesses and not deployed to the factory level at this point. It's improving every month in our performance and what we can deliver to our customers. So that's been something that's been going well for us.","When you look at the U.S., the growth, - organic growth in the U.S. was led by Industrial business, and really the automotive OEM and aftermarket businesses. There are some pockets in Safety & Graphics. And so the same kind of comments I had is as we saw slowing growth and some of the channel reactions, our production levels and our productivity didn't get ahead of it, and that was an important part of what we saw in the U.S.","There are some other pockets. There are some pockets in Health Care with drug delivery in the U.S. that also contributed to that. But that gives you the background in the U.S.","Andrew Obin","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Michael Roman","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So I'm just thinking about the organic growth guide for the year of minus one to plus two, obviously slower start towards the low end to start the year. I guess, I'm just \u2013 as I'm thinking about, how you guys actually get towards that higher end of the range as we progress through the year. I'm just curious like did trends get any better as we exited the quarter? I know comps get tougher as we progress through the year. I'm just trying to like put some context around that guidance for the year?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. So Joe maybe I'll start. The \u2013 it was led by the markets that we called out and the channel reaction to some of that. That doesn't end up being an all year action. That is something that happens pretty quickly. So we don't see that necessarily be a contributor as we go through the year. And some \u2013 we do see some outlook for improvements in those markets.","Health Care we have talked about challenge, we see with drug delivery being a headwind for us in the first half of the year and that gets better as we go through the year. Consumers basically at the bottom end of their range and the sellout remain strong. And in Safety and Graphics, we have a couple of pockets there. Our personnel safety business is off to a strong start to the year. And so up mid-single digits or low- to mid-single digits and we expect that to continue. The other pockets are more project delays in particular businesses and we expect those to improve as we go through the year. So it's really taking a look at each of those businesses and the guidance that we gave to those fits with Q1 and then where we see the rest of the year.","Michael Roman","And Joe on the comp issue consistent with what we've been saying we see second quarter as our toughest comp and third quarter as our easiest comp and that's primarily driven by the what we had talked about a year ago as far as the timing of revenue related to our U.S. ERP go live.","So we saw almost 6% organic growth in second quarter last year followed by 1.3% in the third quarter. So those are the two where we see the comps differentiating. All-in we saw the \u2013 we saw and we continue to see the first half as a slightly tougher comp for us than in the second half of the year.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just follow up just on the margins for a second. So taking a look at your gross margins for the quarter. It's hard for me to go back into history and see a time where gross margins were down as much year-over-year.","And Nick you referred to it a little bit when you responded to the lower growth environment in your response from a cost-out perspective at the factory level. I just want to understand that a little bit better because it's just historically this hasn't part of the hallmark of how you guys have executed.","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes Joe. Just one thing I think I need to make sure is clear with you and with everyone. In the gross margin on a GAAP basis is $235 million charge related to PFAS. So in the numbers that you're seeing there on our GAAP results, not all of that hit SG& A other 235 of that is recorded in gross margin. And Andrew that may go back to your earlier question too.","So that's maybe when you're looking at our GAAP results the one thing you're seeing. That said, we still saw declines in our gross margin percentage, primarily driven by what I just talked about at the lower volumes not offset with commensurate declines in spending. Pulling out the PFAS charge we saw are underlying gross margin decline about 100 basis points.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Thanks for that clarification.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys.","Michael Roman","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Nick, you mentioned productivity is the issue, a big issue in Industrial in North America and Asia Pacific. If we go back over time industrial has been a segment where 3M has consistently struggled to grow margin and obviously productivity we talked about was worse in Q1. So could you talk about the transformation helping North America?","I know you mentioned it's helping, but it's hard to see. I mean can you talk about your confidence that you can improve productivity in the quarters, especially in North America and Europe where you've talked about an expectation of big margin improvement going forward.","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. So Andy, when you look at Industrial there's a couple of things around productivity that we're focused on. And the first one is it is getting in line with the growth that we see in the business. And automotive OEM, automotive aftermarket those are challenged end markets that we're especially aggressive getting on top of and in terms of our productivity. But it's more broad than that because -- especially in the U.S. we are a net exporter out of the U.S. and we do support business around the world and in particular in Asia. And so we're impacted by a broader softness in those markets as well.","So it's a bigger productivity challenge in particular in the U.S. but in Industrial more broadly. And so the actions that we're focused on they're targeting that, getting ahead of the curve so to speak. And then it's taking advantage of all the other things that we've talked about the levers for creating greater value. And Business Transformation is a big one of those. Now we haven't deployed that in the U.S. into the plants. But we've made good progress with the go live, since the go live of last year and we continue to see good benefits and value coming out of the ERP deployment in Canada and EMEA.","And our margins more broadly including industrial has been improving there and in part because of what we're doing in Business Transformation. So that's going to be an important lever as we move ahead. But the near term is getting ahead of the impact of the slowing end markets and the channel and getting our productivity in line.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay Mike. And maybe shifting gears. Can you talk about the cadence of your business performance through the quarter and what you've seen to the extent that you can talked about in April. Theoretically, there's been more enthusiasm in places like China given an increase in our tax cuts that could help markets like China auto or electronics. So have you seen any improvements in any of your short cycle businesses over the last few weeks or a month or two?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, Andy, certainly as we went through first quarter we talked a bit about the slowing that we saw as it went through the quarter and that continued right through the end of the quarter. And really, led by those markets, China automotive, electronics. So those are all the ones we've been talking about.","There is \u2013 I think the outlook is, that gets better. When you listen to the projections and the economic projections in those areas, we haven't seen that. Our April is basically on track with what we're laying out for our total year guidance. But seeing a market improvement in those markets, I think, we'll see \u2013 we'll get an answer as we move further into the quarter, into the second quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks, guys.","Nicholas Gangestad","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.","John Inch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Michael Roman","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Good morning, guys. Mike, you opened the call talking about you, sort of, were positive \u2013 remain positive on a global macro. But I'm trying to understand, maybe, back to Andy's question, there are a degree of evidence, right, that electronics markets in Asia, maybe even China and China auto and so forth, are bottoming.","Why you would you take the 2,000 hedge action now? I mean, are you implicitly signaling that you actually don't think that there is going to be much of an improvement in the foreseeable future? Or is this kind of a catch-up from something you should have been doing before and you were just hopeful things were not going to kind of fall apart to the degree they have?","Michael Roman","Yes. John, so your point about the global macro is right. There is an expectation that there will be a broader growth in the global macro and maybe a bit slower as we come through the year in terms of global industrial production in particular.","In the markets that we're talking about, they certainly have been slowed. But people have a view that it gets better as we get into the second half. I think, to a degree it's realigning ourselves. The actions we're taking is realigning ourselves with what we see in the market and what we've been working through as we come through for sure, kind of, the end of Q4 or end of Q1.","If the markets recover, we \u2013 this is our playbook. When we see a slowdown, we realign our costs, we realign our operations, we take some targeted restructuring action and then we're in a good position to lead out.","So I think this aligns us with what we today, really what we need to do in order to deliver on our commitments and then positions us to lead out of it. And so, if we do see that improvement in the second half, we'll be well positioned to lead out, even with these actions that we're taking.","John Inch","In other words, you don't have to hire people back if things turn? Is that what you...","Michael Roman","No, I think, we're aligning ourselves as we go forward, taking advantage of some of the things that we're doing to \u2013 with business transformation to leverage that. So this is \u2013 it's never easy to do this. And it is \u2013 you're asking question around something that we think very hard about.","And I really am taking on very personally, we've got to think about what do we need to do near term and position ourselves for the long term. And we're going to continue to invest in growth into R&D and R&D growth programs and priority growth opportunities more broadly.","So we're making sure to make this restructuring and realignment targeted to what we what we have to manage through. And so, will we need to hire people in the future? Yes, of course. As we go forward we will, where we see the opportunities and we'll invest. But in the near term, we've got to realign ourselves to be ready to deliver on those statements.","John Inch","Got it. I want to shift gears to PFAS. If you go by the K, the litigation over the past couple of years definitely seems to be rising. There's a lot of reasons that people have potentially thrown out. First, I want to confirm that you do not have insurance in any context to pay for any of these litigation costs. I think the 850 to Minnesota was paid out of cash, right?","And then the second thing is could you guys just give us a sense of what exactly is your playbook for dealing with this? Are you just going to litigate concurrently? Or are you going to try and bundle this and deal with it? I just -- it's hard to know from where we stand right why this isn't potentially an asbestos round two that unfortunately ended up bankrupting dozens of U.S. companies. And I don't think you're in that situation but anything you could say to that will be helpful.","Nicholas Gangestad","Hey, John I'll just start talking about insurance and then I'll pass it over to Mike for your broader question. In regards to insurance and coverage for that for environmental claim such as PFAS, we do have places where we think we have insurance coverage and we are in discussions with insurance carriers regarding those matters. But that's going to take time for that to play out, John. That's -- don't look for that in the short-term for something to happen on that front.","Michael Roman","Yes. And John just regarding the litigation activity. I mean, we are actively depending ourselves in all of this litigation. And it's difficult to know the timing and outcome of any particular litigation. And what we were able to do with the reserve this quarter is to really establish reserves that help us resolve the litigation that is related to environmental matters. And I would say litigation were a direct defendant around our manufacturing disposal.","As I said in my comments, it is not covering any other product related PFAS litigation. And when you have the manufacturing in view where it's probable and estimable, the product litigation at this point that were defending ourselves against is not probable an estimable. And so we will update as appropriate and as we get some clarity on that. So it's really -- there are two different aspects of it there that we're managing.","John Inch","Would it be fair to say this is going on for years. I don't see any a milestone event that potentially stops there. Is that a fair thing? It looks like the EPA is going to potentially come out with even more articulate regulations or guidelines or something like that.","Michael Roman","Yes, and we continue to work with the EPA and other regulatory bodies on the foundation for the regulations that are being talked about and what will come. EPA, of course, announced a management plan for this and we're working with them to support where we go forward there. We actually are supportive of a federal approach here so we don't end up with a state-by-state approach that's different or patch work kind of approach. But it is something that is evolving and we'll continue to help be part of that with the EPA. And like I said, we'll update you on our litigation matters as appropriate.","John Inch","Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning.","Michael Roman","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Morning. Maybe a first question for Mike. So just trying to think about the last few months at 3M. You had the outlook meeting in November with some medium-term goals. Then you had a sort of re-segmentation more recently, and then today restructuring alongside another guidance reduction.","So I understand that the restructuring and the guidance reduction, obviously, very closely linked. But I'm trying to understand what else has changed since that November meeting where it sounded like a case of steady-state high CapEx, high R&D the same segments.","Then we heard the segments being changed. Now, the CapEx commitment seems to be wavering per the CapEx cut this morning. So, maybe just talk us through more broadly how your own thoughts about running and organizing and managing 3M have changed in the past few months.","Michael Roman","Sure. And I'll go back to that in November Investor Day. I would say first of all, the realignment of the business group us was part of our thinking at that point. We weren't ready to announce it and implement it. There were things that we have to do to get ready for that. But it was part of -- even as I talked about, it's part of our expectations that will drive improvements of 200 to 300 basis points in our margin. And it really is set up to help us leverage best our business transformation and end-to-end streamline our connection to customers. So, it's part of the longer term strategy.","As we came into the year, as we walk through the quarter -- even as we came in, we certainly acknowledge that we're seeing slowing in some of those key end markets. It got more severe as we go to our earnings call -- in the Q4 earnings call in January. As we went through February, we saw additional slowing and we're talking about it.","And we were taking actions all along the way. We were doing things. We've been doing things along the way to adjust and address that slowing we are seeing, but we didn't get ahead of the curve. And so the restructuring and the other actions we're taking is to really do that now.","So, it is -- I would say it's still rooted in that five-year plan and our commitment to investments and growth in R&D and the strategies that we talked about there is still very much part of it. The 3M model is strong. We've got to near-term execute and get in line with what we're seeing in these end markets.","And that became kind of the new, I would say, set of actions that we had to step into and we're doing that. But again we know how to execute this playbook. We'll be rallying the team around us as we go through the next couple of days and I'm confident that we will step into it as we go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","That's helpful. And then my second question maybe around any updated thoughts on the portfolio. Should we view the re-segmentation as opening the door to any divestments? Does the guidance reduction make you think that maybe more portfolio pruning is needed?","And on the other side of the ledger, should we expect more acquisitions now that M*Modal has closed? Or is it more of a case of there are some internal things to fix, let's fix those first and think about M&A maybe next year?","Michael Roman","Julian I'll start here as I always do. Organic growth is our first priority. So, we're going to continue to focus investments there as I said even as we go through this restructuring. But we still maintain flexibility to invest in the long-term value of the enterprise. And so acquisitions we have built strong capabilities to make acquisitions that fit with our fundamental strengths that fit in our most attractive markets.","And we've been executing that. We still see that as a value driver for us in the future. And so we continue to stay active looking at acquisitions. We're going to continue to step into compelling acquisitions that leverage that strategy and capabilities that we have to create value.","On the divestiture side, we've been actively managing a portfolio since 2012. And over the last three years, we've strengthened parts of our portfolio. It was a case we're always looking at how do we maximize the portfolio. And we're looking at businesses regardless of size on how we do we do that and how do we maximize value for the company and it's really around the fit with our fundamental strengths and we'll continue to actively manage it as we go forward. It's an ongoing process and we'll be focused on creating value with that as well.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Michael Roman","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just on the comment on inventory destocking, Mike and Nick, do you have a sense for what that might have cost you in the quarter?","Nicholas Gangestad","Josh, so for the quarter we still built inventory.","Josh Pokrzywinski","I mean, your customer's destocking. I'm sorry. ","Nicholas Gangestad","I'm sorry. I think it very easily could have impacted our total revenue by 100 basis points.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful.","Michael Roman","Josh just to give you a little color too. The automotive slowdown in China was one particular case where we saw significant impact in our growth from channel. And so where you see a slowdown in a particular market, like electronics or automotive it's accompanied with a change in inventory, everything from finished goods back through the value chain. And so that is a \u2013 that's clearly visible in those cases.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. And then just pivoting back to an earlier question on some of the PFAS litigation, as a non-attorney this is maybe more obvious to other folks than myself. But given that you already have kind of one fight example in Minnesota with an 850 settlement. Is there a reason why adding the other four in there might not just be 850 times four. Is it kind of a easily digestible answer? Or is it a lot of hey it depends and there's a lot of differences?","Michael Roman","Well, our manufacture footprint is different in every one of those sites and so that's part of it. But it really \u2013 I guess, if you can take from this is, it's not simply that \u2013 not simple math of multiplying times five. We've \u2013 we now define probable and estimable for the litigation that we face in those five sites as \u2013 with this reserve. So that is our \u2013 the way we have had determine what is estimable across that.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. Thanks for that. And then just one last one on some of the re-segmentation. I understand this is not the quite the same thing as ERP was last year. But could we expect some sort of disruption to the customer side with some of the restructuring and re-segmentation being implemented? Thanks.","Michael Roman","The realignment of the businesses is really \u2013 really the key focus for us was the customer and really aligning to them aligning to the customer segments and the type of customer and the go-to-market model. So we are actually \u2013 we've been moving towards this with some of the go-to-market model, capabilities that we've been putting in place and the way we leverage Business Transformation. This actually steps it forward even more. So I think this is not only focused on the customer I think the customers will see this as a positive step forward. And we'll see it as better aligned to them as we globally as we move ahead.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Okay. Thanks Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Michael Roman","Hey, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, I missed the very beginning intro comments. And we've touched on this channel inventory adjustment topic a couple of different times, with Josh's question just then. But can you just clarify how much was any kind of 4Q pull-in getting ahead of tariffs, getting ahead of price increases? And maybe you also had some of this ERP pull-in as well. How much of a factor is that in terms of this inventory adjustment?","Michael Roman","Yes Deane we talked about a bit on our Q4 call. We saw the channel as well as balanced as we came into the year. We didn't see a pull-ahead in Q1 into Q4. The ERP impacts were largely Q2\/Q3; we saw some tail of that into Q4. And it's hard to tell there may be a small tail as we come into this year as well which would be more playing out of some inventory. But that's a U.S. kind of view.","The -- when I look at it, even as we went through the quarter, I would say Health Care channels are well balanced. We certainly saw our balance between sell-in, sell-out, and consumer. It was the Electronics and Automotive driven changes that really led to the channel impact. And maybe a few pockets in Safety and Graphics in areas like transportation where we had some project delays. But the bigger was in the Industrial and Electronics areas. So, that developed as the quarter went along and the response was very, very direct and we saw that in Q1.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then on -- to go back to your comments about the lag in realigning your cost with the lower demand through the quarter. It would be interesting hearing from you about what was different about your response time. Is this -- just -- is this inherent to the 3M short cycle business? You just don't have that visibility; so therefore, you can't ramp down the cost structure that quickly. Does that put you at a disadvantage here in terms of the responsiveness? When you I look at decrimentals, companies that can ramp down costs quickly, typically will see a 25% decremental and you're well lower than that. So, it look like it did get away from you, but some color there will be helpful.","Michael Roman","Yes. Deane we did take actions as we saw slowing growth. We're reducing production plants, we're adjusting demand plan. And we're trying to look ahead as much as we can into our customers get a clear view. And I would say in the direct businesses, we got a pretty clear view. It was a matter of how fast can we react. And we took actions in the end our volume that we produced went down in line obviously with our organic growth, but our costs didn't. And that was one of the challenges. And some of that is fixed cost some of that is variable costs and we need to do something on both of those.","And so that's where the restructuring is targeting that. And that's not unusual in these situations in the industrial slowdown in 2015-2016; I face the same thing in leading that business and even in 2009. We have to take restructuring actions to really step into a bigger slowdown and in most particular markets that's what is taking here. And so the steps we took now we'll get ahead of the curve.","Deane Dray","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning guys.","Michael Roman","Hey Scott.","Scott Davis","Hi. I want to change gears a little bit because I think the -- I think most people at this point kind of get the issues. But I want to talk a little bit about R&D productivity and payback because just back the envelope, I don't think 3M historically has outgrown the Industrial group, in fact, it seemed to have undergrown some of the higher end peers out there and certainly spent a lot of money on R&D. Obviously there's a higher margin structure that is supported by that. But how do you fix that? How do you get the growth rate to really accelerate from these levels, which are really, basically just GDP type levels over time over really almost any time period you look at?","Michael Roman","Yes, Scott, so you're right. Our investment in R&D and I would say innovation more broadly is fundamental to what we promised our investors and that is strong growth. Growth that outgrows the macro over our business cycles and deliver premium margins, deliver premium ROIC. And innovation is fundamental to that. In fact, it's the differentiator in our ability to do that. And I think in a quarter like this and even the cycle that we've been going through it's right to challenge our growth aspect of that. And what we are doing is really focused on that as well.","And I would say this our capacity and our demonstrateability outgrow the macro over time has come from two important factors. One is our investment in innovation. Our ability to deliver new penetration opportunities with our innovation, new priority growth platforms as we talk about. And so those are very much a focus for us. It's also important that we do that in markets that are accretive to the macro that we're choosing. And that's our portfolio management. Make sure we're prioritizing in the most attractive market spaces.","And so that is -- we often talked about the priorities organic growth in our capital allocation approximately 6% to sales and R&D and 4%, 5% to 5.5% in CapEx. But we prioritize that. It is really important that we prioritizing that and that's what we do to get that growth where we needed to be. And we did it in markets in that are most attractive. That's the focus. That\u2019s when I talk about continuing to invest in growth that's what I'm talking about.","Scott Davis","Fair enough Mike. And when every add, I mean, you've been on board now you're not brand-new, but you're relatively new I think in comparison to many CEOs. And do you think you need to change the compensation scheme at all? Or is there something that as far as getting incentives more aligned with faster execution, because and I don't mean this to be mean. But if you go back really think about the 20 years or so I've covered your stock. 3M always seems to be a little bit behind on the restructuring curve almost never ahead. And even if you get this one right you're still behind. So do you need to change anything around the incentives or compensation scheme to get some of your leaders to move a little faster?","Michael Roman","I think compensation is an important part of this. And we've updated and modified our compensation over time to do just what you're talking about to really align our leaders with what we need to deliver. And in particular, our promise to our investors, our organic growth, our EPS growth, our ROIC, our free cash flow. That is how they're aligned. They are aligned to the four promises. And were we -- should we take another look at that? I would say that's our normal course for us. We're going to take stock of what we're doing, how we're doing it and compensation is an important piece and we look at that as well.","Scott Davis","Okay. Good luck guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. So, just wanted to touch on two things. First, is there -- as you think about the -- when I think about the call -- you talked about the -- this kind of sequencing, it's usually a multi quarter episode, I mean I'm thinking about like the way you slice it down [indiscernible] a few years ago. Can you just be clear, have you seen any actual churn in your order patents? Or is it just affects of sequential stabilization?","Michael Roman","Lawrence, I mean you broke up a bit, so I'm not sure I got a question. But I think you're asking about the softening and the slowdowns that we're seeing. They can sometimes last longer. Do we see any indication that those are turning or not expected last long, is that the kind of\u2026","Laurence Alexander","Right. Did you see \u2013 have you seen any actual turns in order patterns? Or is it really just more -- everybody's forecasting the back half therefore?","Michael Roman","Well, I would say we haven't seen a sharp turn in softening markets. We're in line as we go into April with our expectations. I would say maybe we see that the inventory adjustments slowing down. I mean, those don\u2019t tend to be fourth quarter unless there's another macro event that drives it. Those will adopt pretty quickly. That -- and we're seeing maybe some signs of that as we go forward. But we certainly don't see what these particular markets automotive electronics. They're forecasting, a stronger second half and we don't see the early indication of that yet. I think it makes sense to a degree what they're talking about, but not early days of April have we seen that.","Laurence Alexander","And then just secondly on the litigation side. How much have you -- have you done a full scrub of the exposures? I mean, when you have a scientific -- culture scientific debate sometimes the debates look different after the fact. So have you gone through and just scrubbed the way the debates were handled within the firms so that there's no surprises as the litigation proceeds?","Michael Roman","Lawrence, I would say this is a top priority, an issue for us as an enterprise and we are taking it with that in mind. And we have -- we formed a corporate affairs organization as part of our business realignment. Really it brought together a lot of the people that are working on this among other issues because there's broader brand and reputation strategy that they are focused on. But we have -- we've invested in I think a bigger capability around how do we look at it, how do we manage it, and how do we -- how we really take our brand reputation and take that forward as a company. So the answer is we are stepping up to it. It is emerging issue that has certainly gotten bigger as we went through the last year. And I would say we're stepping into it with every capability and with a lot of good counsel as well.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Tusa","Hey, good morning.","Michael Roman","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","So when I look at the annual bridge on EPS, I think you guys this year were planning on about $0.30 to $0.40 from transformation productivity and pension tailwind. Are you -- are those still isolated items? Are those still on track? ","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. Steve, the pension impact, the underlying business transformation productivity, the footprint action savings, those are all on track. But with the lower growth, the two things changing lower growth and all other productivity, those are the two components that are bringing that that part down, as well as the charge that we're anticipating in Q2 for the restructuring actions.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Yes. And that entire charge is coming in Q2. You're going to take that or run that through EPS?","Nicholas Gangestad","We think the majority of that \u2013 it could be all of it, but we think the majority that will be in there.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Can you just give us a little bit of color on what you kind of expect now for margins? Whether it's second quarter, the year, I mean, the more detail the better it is, so we call all kind of calibrate and reset ourselves from this level, operating margins.","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. Steve, when we take into account our recent acquisition of M*Modal, when we take into account this restructuring charge, we are seeing margins down likely 100 basis points for the year, with those two items contributing just over half of that total decline in the margins.","And that's different, where, from a three months ago, saying we were expecting margins to be up. The core underlying productivity, even with these actions we don't think it's going to be accretive to our margins yet this year. We think that will come later.","Steve Tusa","Right. And one last quick one. So you mentioned Minnesota on the PFAS stuff. I thought you guys already took a charge for Minnesota. Was that \u2013 are you saying, we already took that charge, so we're just reminding you of it? Or was there an incremental charge in Minnesota?","Michael Roman","Yes. Steve, it was -- I would say, a bit of a reminder. But it was \u2013 just to let you know, this encompasses those facilities. There is \u2013 there was a small part of it that just \u2013 is part of Minnesota as we look ahead. But it was \u2013 the 850 was the majority \u2013 the vast majority of what we faced in Minnesota.","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. That charge -- the 850 is the last year, Steve. ","Michael Roman","Yes.","Steve Tusa","Yes. No, no. I was just \u2013 I'm trying to, kind of, like, I just \u2013 I don't know whether the \u2013 I thought the 850 kind of ring-fenced it, for a lack of a better term. So the fact that there's kind of another charge in Minnesota, I'm just trying to kind of \u2013 I definitely haven't done \u2013 I'm not a lawyer, I don't know how to work on this. So I thought kind of the 850 took care of Minnesota.","Michael Roman","Yes. And that's the way to think about it, Steve. We\u2026","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Michael Roman","This was just to make it complete, so that we didn't leave Minnesota out and then have it kind of question by exception.","Steve Tusa","Yes. Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for detail.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Nigel Coe","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Michael Roman","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yes. Hi. I just want to pick up on Steve's point there. What was the trigger point to make this NRD charge probable and net submitable? I know there was a ruling in New Jersey. Was that the sole trigger point? Or was there something else that we're missing?","Michael Roman","With the NRD I think really what you're talking about Nigel is a year ago. I think what you're really asking is, what's the triggering point for us to be taking this charge now in the first quarter. And we've been working on that with a number of the parties, where we have litigation going on.","And we reached a point where we felt that based on the progression of those, the facts on those cases and where we stood with potential settlements, we actually did have some settlements occur in first quarter, which gave us better visibility in how to estimate more broadly across all our manufacturing sites, what we see is our liability.","Nigel Coe","Okay.","Michael Roman","And by the way\u2026","Nicholas Gangestad","The New Jersey is not one of the places where we manufacture. That's a different lawsuit related to the use of the product and not related to our five manufacturing sites Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Okay that's great. And then just one quick one on kind of two key setup. You talked about maybe 100 basis points of channel, you've got the selling day headwind moves away 1Q to 2Q, but then we've got a type of comp about two or three points. Would you expect to have [ph] that 2Q would remain sort of in this low single-digit decline range?","Nicholas Gangestad","Nigel, it would not surprise me if we were looking at negative organic growth in the second quarter.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thanks guys. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","Michael Roman","Hi John.","John Walsh","I guess maybe just to follow-up on Nigel's question about that point of inventory. Does your guidance assume that that comes back i.e., there is some refill at some point in the year? Or is that contemplated as just these inventories are now going to remain where they are for the balance of 2019?","Michael Roman","Yes, John it's really is the latter. So it's more a model of that remains. For inventory to come back there we would have to be a noticeable upturn in the market and that with some of the outlook for the second half that could be possible, but that's not what we're looking at. We're looking at the adjustment down levels out and we manage at that level as we go through the year.","John Walsh","Got you. And then I guess can you give us an update on, there was a lot of focus at the Analyst Day on this $1 billion sales bucket of priority growth platforms. Can you give us an update of what they did in the quarter?","Michael Roman","John, we'll update you maybe in more detail as we go forward. We saw very good progress across those priority growth platforms. There are two things that we measure. One is the revenue and the second is, are we making progress in the milestones so the product launches and the specifications. And you take automotive electrification and we saw significant wins in Q1 and new spec in business and we continue to see strong upper single double-digit growth even in that portfolio. And I would say across the businesses this has been one of the bright spots. When you look at quarter like this, there is a lot of challenges and it's disappointing, but there are some businesses and some bright spots and we had good business performance in our existing portfolios and we've certainly would count our priority growth platform as one of the positive contributors to growth and new products more broadly. But those priority growth platforms are even stronger. So we \u2013 I'm pleased with where we are. We're tracking to our plans and we can update individual programs when we talk to you.","John Walsh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.","Michael Roman","Okay. Thank you. To wrap-up, we are moving with urgency and taking action to strengthen our performance in 2019, while investing for the future. I remain, confident in the world-class capabilities of our enterprise and in our 3M model. We know we have to rebuild our credibility. I'm confident we will get our performance back in line with the expectations of our investors. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you to please disconnect your lines."],"525":["3M Co (NYSE:MMM) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call April 24, 2018  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Bruce Jermeland - Director, Investor Relations","Inge Thulin - Chairman, CEO & President","Nicholas Gangestad - SVP & CFO","Michael Roman - COO & EVP","Analysts","Scott Davis - Melius Research","Steven Winoker - UBS Investment Bank","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group","Charles Tusa - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Bank","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Operator","Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 24, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO; Mike Roman, our Chief Operating Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer.","Inge and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our upcoming investor events in 2018 found on Slide 2. Please mark your calendars for our upcoming earnings calls on July 24 and October 23. Also, we have established a date for our next Investor Day, which will be held at our headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota on Thursday, November 15. More details will be available as we get closer to the event.","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please note that throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, in particular, measures which exclude the impact of the measurement adjustment for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the previously disclosed legal settlement with the State of Minnesota. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation and press release.","Lastly, we filed a Form 8-K on March 15, updating our business segment reporting for dual credit and reflecting the adoption of the new financial accounting standard relative to pension and post-retirement benefit cost. Both of these updates are reflected in our reported results and on a historical basis starting this quarter.","Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll hand off to Inge. Inge?","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Coming off a strong 2017, our team opened the new year with broad-based organic growth across all business groups. We expanded margins and posted a double-digit increase in earnings per share while continuing to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders.","Looking at the first quarter numbers, we deliver earnings of $2.50 per share, a 16% increase year-on-year. Total sales rose to $8.3 billion, which is an all-time high for our enterprise. Company-wide, organic growth was 3%.","Three of our business groups, Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy and Consumer, all posted good growth that was within or above their expected full year ranges. Safety and Graphics delivered another robust performance with 7% organic growth, coming off 6% growth in 2017. As you know, we have significantly adjusted the Safety and Graphics portfolio over the last several years, and those actions continued to pay off in terms of improved growth and margins.","Electronics and Energy posted 2% growth in the quarter with strong growth in data center and semiconductor markets. Within this business group, we have also adjusted the portfolio in recent years, and we now see, in addition to growth, continued and sustained improvements in margins.","Consumer also delivered 2% organic growth, its fourth straight quarter of positive growth, with particular strengths in our home improvement business.","Our Health Care and Industrial Business Groups, which grew 3% and 2%, respectively, each had many areas of strengths but also few areas of softness that temper overall growth.","Within Health Care, we delivered good growth in medical consumables, health information systems and food safety. We saw flat growth in oral care and sales in drug delivery were down against a tough comparison.","Turning to our Industrial Business Group. Industrial opened the year with 2% growth with good performance in abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes. Automotive OEM business also grew well and once again outperformed global auto builds despite negative build rates for the total automotive industry. Finally, growth in our automotive aftermarket business was softer than we anticipated going into the year.","Looking at our entire company's performance from a geographical perspective, we continue to capitalize on opportunities in developing markets. In Q1, we posted 7% growth in developing markets, including double-digit growth in China, along with strong growth in India, Southeast Asia and Brazil.","Turning to margins. Our team expanded margins to a healthy 23% with 4 of our 5 business groups at 23% or higher. We also continued to build for the future, including investing 10% of sales into the combination of research and development and CapEx while returning significant cash to our shareholders.","In the quarter, we returned $1.7 billion to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And as a reminder, we increased our Q1 dividend by 16%, which marks 60 consecutive years of dividend increases.","In summary, we delivered good growth in the quarter throughout much of the portfolio while a few markets were softer than we anticipated going into the year. As a result, today, we're adjusting the top end of our full year guidance for organic growth and earnings per share. We expect organic growth of 3% to 4% versus 3% to 5% previously, along with EPS of $10.20 to $10.55 against the prior range of $10.20 to $10.70.","Going forward, we remain confident in our ability to keep generating premium value for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders. We will continue to execute the 3M playbook and strengthen our competitiveness and are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2018 and beyond.","With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who would take you through the details. Nick?","Nicholas Gangestad","Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. Let me begin with two topics that impacted GAAP earnings in the first quarter that Bruce touched on at the beginning of the call. Recall that following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we recorded a provisional tax expense in Q4. As expected, the IRS has issued subsequent guidance resulting in updates to these amounts. As a result, we booked an additional tax expense of $270 million or $0.36 per share in the first quarter. We expect further IRS updates throughout the year.","Also, we incurred an $897 million charge for the legal settlement which amounted to a $1.16 impact to earnings per share. This charge is reflected within Corporate and Unallocated. Excluding these impacts, first quarter earnings were $2.50 per share, an increase of 16% year-on-year. Please note that the balance of my prepared remarks today will exclude the impact of both items on 2018 earnings. Please turn to Slide 6 to review first quarter sales. Sales growth in the first quarter was 2.8% organically. Selling prices increased 70 basis points in the first quarter. Excluding our electronics businesses, selling prices were up 90 basis points and were positive across all geographic areas. This marks our strongest underlying price performance in several years.","The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 70 basis points to growth in the quarter. In addition, foreign currency translation increased sales by 4.2 percentage points. All in, first quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 7.7% versus last year. In the U.S., organic growth was 2.3% with selling prices up 80 basis points. Growth was led by Safety and Graphics and Consumer. EMEA was flat in Q1 with West Europe down 1%. Asia Pacific delivered mid-single-digit organic growth, led by Safety and Graphics and Health Care. Organic growth was 11% in China\/Hong Kong. Japan was flat or up 3%, excluding electronics. Finally, Q1 organic growth in Latin America\/Canada was 3.5%, led by Health Care and Safety and Graphics. At a country level, Canada and Brazil delivered organic growth of 5%, while Mexico was up 3%.","Please turn to Slide 7 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.3 billion with operating income of $1.9 billion, up 9.3%. First quarter operating margins were 23%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Let's take a closer look at the components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Leverage on organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year performance and footprint actions contributed a combined 120 basis points to margins. Acquisitions net of divestitures reduced margins by 40 basis points.","Selling price benefits more than offset raw material inflation, adding 10 basis points to operating margins. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins by 40 basis points, and higher retirement benefit cost decreased operating margins by 20 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings-per-share. First quarter earnings were $2.50 per share, up 16% year-over-year. The benefits of organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added a combined $0.17 to per share earnings in the quarter.","Foreign currency impacts net of hedging added $0.05 a share. Other expenses decreased earnings by $0.07 per share due to higher year-on-year net interest expense and retirement expense. Our underlying Q1 tax rate was 17.6%, in line with our expectations, which increased earnings by $0.18 per share. The lower tax rate was driven by tax reform and continued benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise.","Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. First quarter free cash flow was a minus $161 million, impacted by the legal settlement that I referred to earlier. The net impact from the legal settlement and tax reform adjustment decreased free cash flow conversion by 72 percentage points. First quarter capital expenditures were $304 million, up $17 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. As Inge mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 16%, resulting in $810 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter. We also returned $937 million to shareholders through growth share repurchases. With this in mind, we are increasing our full year range to $3 billion to $5 billion versus $2 billion to $5 billion previously.","Let's now review our business group performance, starting with Industrial on Slide 10. The Industrial Business Group delivered first quarter sales of $3.1 billion, up 2.2% organically. Within Industrial, growth was led by abrasives, up mid-single digits, and industrial adhesives and tapes, up 3%. Our automotive OEM business was up over 3%, outpacing growth in global car and light truck builds by over 400 basis points. In automotive aftermarket, we saw good growth in our products and solutions for retail car care, which was more than offset by softer demand from auto body shops. On a geographic basis, Industrial's organic growth was led by a 5% increase in Asia Pacific, followed by a low single-digit growth in both Latin America\/Canada and the United States. Industrial delivered first quarter operating income of $719 million, up 7.3%, with an operating margin of 22.9%.","Please turn to Slide 11. First quarter Safety and Graphics sales were up 6.9% organically to $1.8 billion with growth across all businesses and geographies. Our Personal Safety business continued to post excellent growth, up double digits in the quarter. This business continues to see strong global demand for our personal protective equipment across all end markets. The commercial solutions and roofing granules businesses were both up mid-single digits. Transportation safety also posted positive growth, driven by our core sheeting and pavement marking segments. In addition, this business recently won contracts with the State of California to upgrade their infrastructure and enable the roadway of the future.","Geographically, organic growth was led by high single-digit increases in both Asia Pacific and the U.S. with mid-single-digit growth in both EMEA and Latin America\/Canada. Operating income was $483 million and operating margins of 27.1%, up 140 basis points year-on-year. Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business generated first quarter sales of $1.5 billion, up 2.7% organically. Growth was led by a high single-digit increase in both food safety and health information systems.","Our medical consumables business, which represents the largest segment within Health Care, posted mid-single-digit growth in Q1. Oral care was flat with continued good growth internationally, particularly in developing economies, offset by softness in the U.S. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific led the way, up 8%, followed by 5% growth in Latin America\/Canada. We saw continued strength in developing markets, which were up 10% in the quarter, led by China\/Hong Kong and Brazil. Health Care's first quarter operating income increased 7% to $460 million, and operating margins were nearly 30%.","Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. Electronics and Energy organic sales growth was 1.7% in the first quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion. The electronics side of the business grew 3% organically, including low double-digit growth in electronics materials solutions. Growth continues to be very strong in semiconductor manufacturing and data centers, with robust demand for cooling fluids and interconnect solutions. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in display materials and systems due to softness in consumer electronics.","Our energy-related businesses were down low single digits organically with electrical markets flat and telecommunications down. Please note, we continue to expect to close on the sale of our telecommunications business later this year. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 4% increase in Asia Pacific. First quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $337 million with operating margins of 24.9%. Please turn to Slide 14. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion and organic growth was 2.1% year-on-year. Our home improvement business grew high single digits organically, building on its track record of strong performance over the past several years. Home care also delivered positive growth in the quarter while consumer health care declined.","Looking at Consumer geographically, growth was led by a 4% increase in the U.S. followed by 3% growth in Latin America\/Canada. We continue to invest and expand our category-leading brands, such as Filtrete and Post-it. During Q1, we launched the first-ever Bluetooth-enabled Filtrete Smart Air Filter. We also launched Post-it Extreme Notes, which are designed to hold to rough surfaces even in challenging conditions. Finally, operating income was $218 million with operating margins at 19.3%. Operating margins were impacted by year-over-year portfolio and footprint actions, along with the investments associated with the new product launches I previously mentioned. For the year, we expect margins to be in the low 20s, similar to 2017.","That wraps up our review of first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 15, and I'll review our updated 2018 guidance. As Inge summarized in his opening remarks, we are updating our full year organic growth expectation to a range of 3% to 4% versus previous guidance of 3% to 5%. With respect to earnings, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $10.20 to $10.55 versus a prior range of $10.20 to $10.70. Our full-year expectations for return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion remain unchanged.","With that, we thank you for your attention and we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Is this Inge's last call that he's hosting before he becomes Chairman, the special new job thingie?","Inge Thulin","No, it's not. I would be in July as well, and I own the next quarter as well, so I'm not going away.","Scott Davis","Well, good. Well, we're glad to keep you or have you still around. But anyways, I've got 2 questions and one just on the business and one really on succession. But first, on the business, electronics, is price decelerating in electronics? Is there some sort of change in supply dynamic or supply-demand dynamic? Or is it on the same, really, curve that's been on now for several years?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, Scott. What seeing in price in the Electronics and Energy business, I'd say there's no discernible trend of it getting better or worse. It's typically a slight decline in price as we compete on the electronics side of the business. We've been seeing that and we continue to expect that going forward, but not a trend of it accelerating down nor accelerating up. It's pretty constant, Scott.","Scott Davis","Right. And just as a follow-on, I mean, what -- Inge, what has Mike Roman been working on? I mean, what's the focus? Any early read on CEO transition of what might change or difference?","Inge Thulin","Yes, Mike is here, so he will give some comments around that. But yes, a couple of comments. The transition is going very well. Mike, first of all, we have worked together for many years, as you know. First time we worked together was back in Europe early 2000, so I think 2003 and so. And then Mike was also working with me on the strategies that were laid out in 2012 and 2013. And currently, we talk every day. I feel like we text every hour and are totally aligned to what needs to be done. But he's here, so he should make some comments relative to his initial thought and so forth. But most importantly, he is very much focused on delivering Q2 together with all of us and of course, also what we did in Q1. So Mike, if you like to add some comment on...","Michael Roman","Yes. Scott, that's where I would start to. I'm focused on delivering 2018 starting with Q2 now. So over those 15 years, I really enjoyed working with Inge. Especially the last six years, I've been proud to be part of his leadership team that has helped advance the company. And I -- we've accomplished a lot under his leadership. And so I would say what I focus on is the things that we've been building and really, where we have a lot of similarities, and our focus is on our playbook. And the commitment to that playbook, including the opportunities we have in Portfolio Management and the innovation in Business Transformation as we move ahead. So that's where the focus is right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with UBS.","Steven Winoker","Just wanted to make sure I understood the reduction at the high end of guidance. Is that whole $0.15 just sort of high incrementals on the 1% reduction at the high end?","Michael Roman","Yes, Steve. The EPS change in guidance really is a result of what we're doing on the adjustment to our outlook for organic growth and really making that adjustment from 3% to 5% to 3% to 4% and doing that, really focused on those businesses and markets where we saw some of the specific market softness as we came through Q1.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And that market softness mostly -- in this discussion, what I heard, sounds like -- maybe a little more clarity around Western Europe, what's going on there in terms of what you're seeing on the short cycle side.","Michael Roman","Yes. If you look at West Europe, organic growth came in as expected. And I would say -- come back to what we talked about in the past, that we're taking portfolio and footprint actions in West Europe to improve our growth in margins. And we're going to continue to do that. It's our part of our plan and our focus on delivering on that 20% income margin by 2020, and so that's built in. We still see West Europe tracking with our expectations to be low single digits.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And then in that case, just broadly speaking, the weakest organic growth on the short cycle basis that you saw globally, can you just nail that down for us?","Michael Roman","Well, I think we called out several specific markets. So automotive aftermarket, oral care and I would say, our consumer electronics is tracking as we expected as we come into the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","Can we maybe talk on the organic growth guidance, the step-down to 3% to 4%.? We spent some time together in March. It still seems like the higher end of the range was going to be achievable for the year. So I'm just wondering, if -- from a near-term perspective, have things changed at all? Have things gotten off to a little bit of a slower start than originally expected in April?","Michael Roman","Joe, I would tell you, back to March, we started to see the softness in Q1 coming through as we went through the month and we signaled that. And it was -- even at that point, it was specific to the market segments that we called out, and those played out as we thought they would through March. If you look at April, April is starting in line with our expectations. And so I think that the adjustment to the range was really looking to those specific markets that we saw coming through Q1, and we expect to see some improvement in a couple of those areas, but it's really -- that's what's driving the adjustment.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay, fair enough. If I were to maybe just touch on price costs for just a second. So clearly, pricing is coming through a little bit better than expected. But also, from a cost inflation standpoint, it seems like it's a little bit more difficult this year to try to offset with substitute products. Maybe just an update on the expectations for the year for both pricing and also on the cost inflation side.","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, Joe. You're picking up on those two points accurately. We see ourselves as off to a good start with our selling prices with it up 70 basis points and positive across all geographies. And for the year, we expect price growth to remain strong and that it will more than offset raw material inflation. But to that end, on raw material inflation, we are seeing more -- some increases in raw material prices. In fact, more than what we originally estimated when we gave the guidance back in December is particularly around crude derivatives and transportation and logistics expenses. For the year, we're still expecting our stronger price growth to more than offset the raw materials. And if you think back to the guidance that we set out for raw materials, and this may answer a little bit of Steve's earlier question too, we started the year expecting raw materials, commodity prices to be about a push, somewhere between a $0.05 benefit to a $0.05 headwind, depending on -- net of the projects that we do to offset that. Right now, we see that's somewhere between a $0.05 to $0.10 headwind. So that's part of what we're seeing impacting our earnings for the year. But that's being more than offset by the higher pricing that we're now also expecting for the year.","Joseph Ritchie","That's helpful, Nick. Maybe just one clarification there, there's a new like kind of $0.05 to $0.10 range from a headwind perspective. Does that include the increased freight cost as well?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, it does.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan Securities.","Charles Tusa","So could you give us maybe a little bit of color on how the -- how we're going to trend kind of over the course of the year from a growth perspective? I know that you had the Easter timing here in the first quarter you had called out before. How does that play into the second quarter? And then how do we -- is there any lumpiness or volatility in growth in the second half as well around the third and the fourth quarter, just high level?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes. Steve, as I look out over the rest of the year, April, we're seeing off to a strong and expected start for us. So as I look at the 3 remaining quarters of the year, I don't really see any discernible trend difference amongst those 3. All of them coming in, in line now with our expected 3% to 4% organic growth for the year. I don't really see any lumpiness there.","Charles Tusa","Okay. Is there anything that you think abnormally impacted the seasonality in the first quarter here? Maybe your -- I mean, the price costs are still kind of neutral-ish, so I wouldn't think it would be price cost. But anything in the quarter here that depresses the result from a seasonal perspective?","Nicholas Gangestad","Other than the one thing we mentioned with the timing of Easter, that's -- as far as anything else seasonal, I don't think we see anything like that, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So in Health Care, growth has been soft over the last couple of quarters, but maybe a little below expectations. You mentioned oral care, obviously, has been -- it was flat, a little weaker than the last couple of quarters. You did seem to outperform in oral care last year, but kind of improved this year. What could get better in Health Care to reaccelerate as the year goes on? We know your long-term expectations for Health Care growth are above the high 2% range that you reported in the quarter.","Michael Roman","Yes. Thank you, Andy. You look at Health Care, we had good growth in our medical consumables business, our food safety, our health information systems businesses, and we expect that trend to continue as we go through the year. Oral care was flat. We did see good growth internationally, especially in developing economies, but that was offset by some softness in the U.S. So if you look at that playing out, we expect to see some improvement there. But that is what's pulling down the organic growth in the first quarter. And we also -- our drug delivery business, as you know, was a project-based business and that can be up and down quarter-to-quarter and we saw Q1 down year-on-year against a strong comp that we had last year. So those -- was maybe more of a first quarter issue, but oral care flat was the real focus.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. And then maybe just shifting to Industrial. There, you did have a relatively strong momentum in the second half of the year. You talked auto aftermarket [indiscernible]. What's interesting obviously is you also mentioned last -- whether ","you're pulling that on rebates in Industrial. And obviously, you've had good pricing growth. Do you think that's had anything to do with sort of the slowing in Industrial, having maybe overpriced at all in Industrial? And how do you look at it sort of going forward?","Michael Roman","Yes. As you heard, we had good growth in abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes and in auto OEM over build rates. And all of those were part of that price performance as well. So I think that's a broad part of our portfolio, and that didn't see any volume fall off because of price. In automotive aftermarket, which was the decline in Q1, we saw strong growth in our products and solutions for retail. Car care was really the declines in auto body, and so it was a very specific market. And we saw no indications of a pull-in ahead of any price increases and really no changes. It was just a soft market for us as we went through that quarter. So it was really that. So I think we continue to see strong growth across the broader industrial portfolio.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. And you don't think it's share loss or anything like that in auto aftermarket?","Michael Roman","No, we don't see any indication of that at all, Andy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company.","Robert McCarthy","I think following up on Andy's line of questioning. Obviously, you got some decent price to the U.S. Definitely, 1Q, I think, was up slight -- '18, plus 80 basis points there. But you did see some weakness, I mean -- and if you think about your overall kind of formula for leveraging global IPI and having some decent strength in the U.S., do you think it's fair to say you under indexed the U.S.? And don't you think it raises some questions at maybe some parts of your product portfolio, you might be facing some level of commoditization in Consumer and some consumer health care? And how do you react to that aside from probably defiance?","Michael Roman","So Rob, again, I go back to -- we do see broad growth relative to those markets and overall economic backdrop. And so I think it's really isolated to specific market segments, and that's what we're seeing in the U.S. right now. And it's really been -- when you look broadly across the portfolio in the U.S., it's automotive aftermarkets, it's oral care and it's a couple of project-based businesses. We have some year-over-year comps with a couple of project-based businesses. Those are not price value kinds of changes.","Robert McCarthy","And then just maybe coming out a different way. Obviously, your gross margin contracted year-over-year by about 60 basis points. Is there any kind of narrative there you can kind of give us in terms of mix, price costs? What's going on there that's become the main driver if you look at Slide 19 in terms of your Q on a -- P&L on a consolidated basis?","Nicholas Gangestad","Rob, one of the bigger things in there that you may not be seeing visibility to is what FX is doing to our gross margin. Clearly, we get some benefit to our earnings per share from a weaker U.S. dollar, but that's partially offset by our hedging strategy that offsets some of our risk from FX. All of those hedging losses become part of our cost of goods sold. And that brought down gross margin in 20 -- in the first quarter of 2018 as well as bringing down operating margin by 40 basis points.","Robert McCarthy","Should we think about that currency translation drop through kind of like low teens, like a 10% drop through by definition of the rolling of the hedges and structurally? Or how do we think about the incremental margin coming from FX growth?","Nicholas Gangestad","The incremental margin, Rob, I haven't quite thought of it in that direction. Generally, what...","Robert McCarthy","Sorry, the drop through from FX to the bottom line.","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, it will vary depending where we are in the cycle with FX movements. Right now, we're at a point where we're going against a comp a year ago where we were having hedging gains. Now we're having hedging losses with the weaker U.S. dollar. So I can't put out one metric like that because it will vary quarter-to-quarter.","Robert McCarthy","Well, like traffic and oversimplification.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Just in terms of geographies, the China strength was impressive, up double digits. Maybe give us a context about the end market drivers or the product drivers there. And part of the issue here, maybe this is just an overhang with all the headline news about trade war and protectionism and so forth, is that if things came to a boil, any boycott of American brands would likely put 3M at risk. And have you given any consideration to that potential development?","Michael Roman","So Deane, I would say we saw broad-based growth in China, as you heard. And it was led again by our domestic-facing businesses, talked a bit about the trend here and how we're taking advantage of that. So health care, personal safety, some of the domestic-facing parts of our industrial businesses, industrial adhesives and tapes was a strong grower. We also are seeing continued strength in some key trends that are -- we're really taking advantage over their innovations, so air quality, water quality, food safety. And as we start the year, electronics has been in line with the broader China growth. So broad-based growth, led with that broader portfolio in the domestic businesses. When you look at the contingency plans for all the things that we can face in a particular market, that part of it is our broader portfolio and how we think about it with our different customer set. But I -- right now, we see we're well positioned with the China markets and the China customers to be in a good position, whatever the outcome is for -- or the outlook is for the economy there.","Nicholas Gangestad","Deane, this is Nick. Deane, I'll just add one thing. I think you're aware, our strategy in China has been we are putting local manufacturing there that we manufacture within China for our Chinese customers. And that's -- we think that's one other layer of protection we have in our strategy as we execute that in China.","Deane Dray","That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, Nick, we see that the increase in buybacks announced today -- what's the expectation in terms of adding leverage? Beginning of the year, expected a range of $1.5 billion to $4 billion being added. Where do you expect to be on that range and what kind of timing?","Nicholas Gangestad","Deane, I'm not updating the expected range on leverage. I would say M&A is the biggest variable on what that -- where we'll end up with added leverage, and that's difficult to estimate the timing of that. The range we're seeing right now is our best estimate, the one we communicated in December. This adjustment in share buyback level doesn't impact our total estimated leverage that we expect to add for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just the first question on the sort of productivity aspect of the earnings or EPS road map that you laid out previously. If I look at that, you had maybe $0.60 or so in aggregate coming from portfolio and footprint, business transformation and then productivity. So I just wondered, in light of the raw material headwinds and also the shortfall on organic volume growth, if there was any increased urgency around extracting higher savings from productivity this year, whether just pulling some forward or increasing the amount for the year as a whole.","Nicholas Gangestad","Julian, for the year, we're -- we still estimate our productivity level at how we originally estimated that in December. Looking at first quarter with our margins and the underlying productivity, our margins at 23%, underlying productivity was positive. But for the year, we expect that to improve going forward. Our lower volumes in the first quarter, we think, were one of the factors causing productivity to be slightly lower than what we're estimating for the total year. And as the year goes on, we're confident that we'll have productivity in the levels we estimated in December.","Julian Mitchell","Understood. And then my follow-up would just be around the Electronics and Energy segment. Just trying to understand, you had guided obviously sort of a slowdown there back at the end of 2017. We did see that slowdown very clearly manifest itself in Q1. So as you look at the balance of the year, is there a sense that, that may start to accelerate from that Q1 low base as you move through 2018? Or you think that the current growth rate is representative of the year?","Michael Roman","Yes. So I would say, Julian, that outlook, as we laid it out at the beginning of the year, it's playing out pretty much in line with that when you look at consumer electronics. We had strong growth in data centers and semiconductor markets, and we see robust demand for our products, our fluids solutions, our interconnect solutions in those markets. And that's offset by that, consumer electronics and the demand we see in those markets. And it -- but that's playing out as expected. And so we're right in our range for what we thought we would be doing as we come through the year.","Inge Thulin","This is Inge. One more comment, yes, around that business group because I think it's important when you talk about volume going forward and so forth. You have to remind yourself and we have to remind ourself the work that's been done relative to the portfolio. So if you go back many years ago -- now if we had tougher growth rate moving forward, we were really challenged on the margin side. And you can see now, quarter after quarter after quarter, and now a couple of years, that the structure is right and the relevance for the market is correct for us. So the margins is now very positive for us and on a high end even for the enterprise and it's sustainable as we move ahead. And I think that's the important element of that business as part of 3M. We manage that now very, very well despite some up and downs in volumes where -- because we know there is some business there that is more volatile, right? But I think the portfolio work now has put us in a place where we feel very, very good quarter-by-quarter in order to be able to deliver the return to you.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just on that point, would you characterize the sell in and the sell-through in electronics just being in good balance right now if there's any inventory?","Inge Thulin","Yes, it does. Yes, no increase, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","Two quick ones. Your comments were sprinkled with various end markets or various product lines that touch on construction. Is the traction that you're seeing there, better spending or more -- an increase in spending by your customers? Or is it an innovation cycle on your side? And secondly, with respect to the litigation settlement, can you update us on where you are, what is outstanding, what you see is a time line, if there are any issues to draw before we could reasonably expect to hear the use of shoes, however small, dropping?","Michael Roman","Yes. So Laurence, on the construction side, so we continue to see strong growth from our home improvement business out of our Consumer Business Group, and that is -- a big part of that is the construction, the growth we see in construction. And the businesses that buy through that channel is -- has been increasing and is being a big, important part of that channel. It's a mix of strong growth in that markets as well as the products that we are bringing to them. I -- we put a lot of innovation into that part of the -- our portfolio, have expanded it and we position ourselves well for the growth that's coming in that end market. So Laurence, just on your second question, back to your second question, on the follow-up to the NRD settlement. We are the process of implementing the grant to the state, and we're working closely with the State of Minnesota, as expected. We are -- we think we've got focus there and well positioned as we move ahead.","Laurence Alexander","But I guess, maybe just to clarify, is that a precedent for other states? Or does it rule out any similar issues in other states? I mean, just -- there's been a lot of media mudslinging around different scenarios, most of which we're seeing highly improbable. But maybe if you can just give your perspective on that.","Michael Roman","No, this is a unique situation. This is our home state and something that we've been working on with them for a number of years. So this is a unique situation in both the nature of the case as well as the grant and the process that we're working through with them.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just two quick ones for me, if I could. Just back to the consumer question. It is kind of interesting or perhaps concerning, the -- some of the anecdotes you shared there. Do you see in your results potentially kind of a cracking in U.S. consumer strength that perhaps is not readily apparent yet from a macroeconomic standpoint? Or do you actually think it is just some timing noise and other idiosyncratic things going on in a couple of these channels?","Michael Roman","Yes. Jeff, as you look at the U.S., that was actually one of the strengths of our consumer business as we came through Q1. We saw stronger growth there. And as we talked about, it was led by home improvement, but our home care business was also positive. We continue to see some slight declines in our office channel, but it was broad based, stronger growth in the U.S. market. So no, very much in line with improvements in low GDP and outlook for retail spending.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then just very specifically on dental, oral care, it's just kind of been a slog for you and Danaher and others, all these kind of distribution changes and things going on. Do you see any opportunity there that change the business model, perhaps go direct, not go through these various distribution channels? Are you doing anything proactive there to maybe kind of reshape, reposition that business in any way?","Michael Roman","It's interesting. The channel for oral care has become more efficient over time. They really changed how they manage it. You see that in maybe our balance in the channel and how our sell in and sellout is balanced in the channel. So we continue to work with, I would say, the changes that -- kind of the constant change that's going on in our commerce channels more broadly. We see that across many of our businesses, oral care included. So I think that's -- our focus always is creating new models to serve our customers. We're focused on those end use customers and we work with our channel partners through their changes and really through new models that come as well. So we're focused on a broad range of strategies there in oral care and beyond.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.","Inge Thulin","Thank you. As I look at our first quarter performance, there are many positives, broad-based growth across all business groups, which included strong pricing, expanded margins and a double-digit increase in EPS. Equally important, we continue to evolve and build out our enterprise for long-term success. 3M is strong and we have the experience, market position and capabilities to continue delivering sustained profitable growth in 2018 and well into the future. Thank you for listening, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"54":["3M (NYSE:MMM) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 26, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Inge G.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 26, 2012.","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter business review. With me today are George Buckley, 3M Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Inge Thulin, Chief Operating Officer; and David Meline, Chief Financial Officer. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2.","During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Let's begin today's review. And I'll turn the program over to David.","David W. Meline","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide #3. First, a brief summary of the fourth quarter, which I felt was a good finish to the year. We drove record sales and good returns and things finished largely as we expected. We once again saw some real strength in our many industrial-oriented businesses, along with steady growth in Consumer and Health Care. On a geographic basis, Latin America and the United States were the fourth quarter stalwarts.","Consumer electronics industry continued to adjust production levels during the quarter to better match demand and supply, much as we had described in our third quarter call in October, and again at our December investor meeting in New York. This had an impact on our Display and Graphics and Electro and Communication businesses, particularly within Asia Pacific. ","The flooding in Thailand hurt fourth quarter sales by an estimated $35 million and an operating profit impact of $20 million, which was in line with our estimates. On the positive side, we recorded $23 million in insurance recoveries related to last year's earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Therefore, from a profit standpoint, these 2 items largely offset one another.","We once again drove strong double-digit growth in Central Eastern Europe and the Middle East, which more than offset weakness in the West. We have yet to see significant signs of recovery in Western Europe. Inge will talk more about our businesses in just a minute.","Income rose 5% year-on-year and operating margins finished at 19.2%. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion, and we converted 128% of net income to cash, a good result and typical for a fourth quarter at 3M. So the business continues to generate significant profit and cash flow. Finally, in early January, we announced the acquisition of Avery Dennison's office and consumer products business. Inge will describe this in more detail in a moment.","Let's take a closer look at sales for the quarter. So please go to Slide #4. Quarterly sales were $7.1 billion, up nearly 6% year-on-year. The combined Latin America\/Canada region was up a strong 10%, with organic growth more than offsetting nearly 4 points of negative currency. United States also had an excellent quarter, with 7% organic growth. U.S. organic volumes have now grown for several quarters consecutively. Sales in Asia Pacific rose 3% in the quarter, slower than we have seen in recent quarters. Part of this, of course, was due to consumer electronics, where the market continued to sink bottom. We expect the market to turn positive sometime in the second quarter.","Clearly, China was also a factor in the fourth quarter as the Chinese government successfully slowed activity to stem inflation. Our China team anticipates continued below-trend growth in the first half of 2012, with stronger growth returning in the second half. Europe rose 4%, with strength in Middle East, Africa, and Central East Europe more than offsetting weakness in Western Europe. Selling prices rose 2% in the quarter, which exceeded raw material inflation. And for the full year, the net impact was neutral. Acquisitions added 2.3% to sales in the quarter and foreign exchange impacts were basically flat.","Please turn to Slide 5 for a more detailed look at our income statement for the quarter. During this period of slower economic growth, we were paying increased attention to protect the bottom line. For example, we have implemented hiring freezes in developed countries and replacements are being limited to key positions that are typically closest to the customers. Our businesses have also triggered contingency plans with respect to indirect costs. These costs total over $4 billion in annual spending for the company. The early results were encouraging, as fourth quarter indirect spending was down both year-on-year and sequentially. So we are getting some traction here.","In the fourth quarter, sales rose 6%, gross profit increased 4% and both operating income and earnings per share rose 5%. Operating margins were 19.2%. Volume growth added 0.2% to fourth quarter operating margins. Selling price changes, net of raw material inflation, added 0.8 percentage points and other productivity contributed 0.3%. Higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense hurt margins by 1% and foreign exchange was a 0.5% headwind in the quarter.  SG&A increased 5% in the quarter and R&D costs were down slightly. ","Recall that in the fourth quarter of 2010, we accelerated the investments to bring forward a number of 2011 growth programs. Given current economic realities, we chose not to repeat this in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings for the quarter were $1.35 per share, up 5% versus last year's fourth quarter. The tax rate was 26.7% in the quarter versus 25.3% last year, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. Conversely, a lower share count added $0.04 a share of benefit in the quarter.","Please turn to Slide #6. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up $116 million versus last year's fourth quarter. Income was, of course, up year-on-year and working capital was a net year-on-year benefit in the fourth quarter. CapEx investment was $517 million, consistent with prior year levels. Full year CapEx was $1.4 billion, which was within our original expected range. During the fourth quarter, we converted 128% of net income to free cash flow. We contributed $209 million to our pension and OPEB plans in the quarter, which lowered the conversion rate by 22 percentage points.","Note at the bottom of this slide, we intend to contribute $800 million to $1 billion to our pension and OPEB plans in 2012 versus the $600 million that we contributed in 2011. Of the 2012 contribution, $600 million will occur over the first 2 quarters compared to $125 million in the first half of 2011. As a result, free cash flow conversion rates will be lower than historical trends in the first half. We paid $384 million in cash dividends in the quarter, and gross share repurchases were $494 million. Our strong balance sheet enables us to return significant cash to shareholders, and importantly, to continue growing the business through economic ups and downs.","Now Inge will address the fourth quarter performance of our business segments. Please go to Slide #7.","Inge G. Thulin","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our businesses have responded well to the current economic environment, and that was evident in our fourth quarter results. Let's take a closer look at each business, starting with Industrial and Transportation.","This business posted outstanding growth in the fourth quarter. Sales grew 14% to $2.4 billion. All businesses within Industrial expanded their sales with double-digit increases in most businesses. All geographic regions drove double-digit sales growth, with Asia Pacific up 17%, the United States up 15%, Europe up 12% and Latin America\/Canada up 10%. Organic local currency growth was 8% in the quarter, an impressive result. Acquisitions added another 6% to growth, the 2 largest being Winterthur and Alpha Beta. Winterthur is a Swiss-based technology-rich addition to our abrasives business, specifically in hard-to-grind precision applications. Alpha Beta is a Taiwanese tape manufacturer that strengthens our offerings in the B and C product lines. Both acquisitions are tracking very well versus our expectations.","Profits grew by 14% to $472 million. Operating margins were 19.6%, basically flat year-on-year, as the team drove strong productivity to offset the 50 basis point headwind from acquisitions. Also, including in Industrial's profit for the quarter was $20 million of insurance recoveries related to the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. All in all, this was another solid performance for Industrial and Transportation business.","Let's now look at Health Care. Sales grew 5% to $1.3 billion. All businesses within Health Care grew their sales, with infection prevention and skin and wound care leading the way. Health Care sales increased across all regions, with Asia Pacific up 11%, Latin America\/Canada up 10%, the United States up 5% and Europe up 2%. Operating income in Health Care increased 12% to $389 million and margins were 30.8%. Health Care continues to gain recognition for innovation. Example, 3M ESPE was recently named the most innovative dental company for the seventh consecutive year. Our Health Care team continues to exemplify innovation for 3M. The healthcare industry has its challenges to be sure, austerity in West Europe, for example. But our business continues to deliver excellent results.","Now let's go on to Safety, Security and Protection Services business. Sales rose by 9% to $927 million, all of which was organic. We drove double-digit growth in security systems and in personal safety products during the quarter, along with single-digit growth in building and commercial services. Sales decline in the roofing granules business due to channel inventory corrections in the United States.  Looking geographically, sales rose 18% in the United States, 17% in Latin America\/Canada and 13% in Asia Pacific. In Europe, sales declined 4%. On the innovation front, this business, for the first time ever, exceeded $1 billion in new product sales in 2011. Operating profit increased 4% to $171 million and operating margins were 18.5% in the quarter.","Let's now look at our Display and Graphics segment. Sales were $823 million, a 9% decline year-on-year. Optical film sales in total fell 17% in the quarter, which was all LCD TV-related. Films for battery-powered devices continued to grow nicely. This includes tablets, smartphones and notebooks. Elsewhere in Display and Graphics, sales grew in both commercial graphics and in architectural markets. Sales declined in traffic safety systems, as government highway funding remains weak, particularly in the United States and in Western Europe. On a regional basis, sales declined 1% in the United States and Latin America\/Canada, 10% in Europe and 12% in Asia Pacific. Profits in Display and Graphics rose 10% in the quarter as the team drove outstanding productivity. Operating margins increased over 3 points to 19.2%.","Moving to Electro and Communications. Sales were $768 million, down 3%, and profits declined 7% to $153 million. Margins for the quarter were very close to 20%. Growth was again lead by electrical markets business and sales were flat year-on-year in telecommunications. Sales in our electronics-related businesses declined high single-digits, reflecting ongoing production adjustments across much of the industry. We expect these adjustments will continue until inventories are back in line with demand. On a geographic basis, sales increased 6% in Latin America\/Canada, 5% in the United States and 2% in Europe. Sales declined 9% in Asia Pacific, of course, heavily impacted by electronics.","Finally, let's look at the Consumer and Office business. Sales topped $1 billion this quarter, a 6% increase year-on-year. Half of this growth was organic, with particular strength in our do-it-yourself, stationery products, office supplies and home care businesses. We also added 3 points of growth to Consumer and Office this quarter via the recent acquisition of GPI Group. France-based GPI produces tapes, hooks, installation and floor protection products and is an excellent complement to our existing do-it-yourself business. It will help us quickly expand our presence in the European home improvement channels. On a geographic basis, sales grew -- growth was strongest in Europe at 15%, again, boosted by GPI. Sales grew 11% in Asia Pacific, 9% in Latin America and 1% in the United States. Operating income in Consumer and Office increased 2% to $179 million and margins were 17.6%, diluted somewhat by the acquisition. If we back out GPI's results, underlying margins were 18.4%, up 20 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter.","Please turn to Slide #8. We were very pleased to announce the acquisition of Avery's consumer and office products business earlier this month. As you know, Avery is a leader in this space with labels, binders and other office products. We anticipate closing sometime during the second half of this year. The acquisition brings several strategic benefits. We gained immediate scale in the United States, as well as several valuable brands including Avery, Hi-Liter and Marks-A-Lot. As you might expect, we plan to bring much-needed innovation to the business. And in the end, customer will benefit through better product, service and value. The purchase price is $550 million cash. As you can see on the slide, the multiples are quite attractive at 0.7x trailing sales and 5.7x trailing EBITDA. We see potential to expand operating margins to around 20% in the out years. We are very excited about this acquisition and look forward to bring new values to our customers.","Please turn to Slide #9. To summarize, 2011 was a good year for our company in a challenging environment. We grew sales 11% with double-digit performance in Industrial and Transportation, Safety, Security and Protection Services and Health Care. New products helped fuel growth and we finished the year with 32% NPVI.","Sales in developing economies rose 14%, and now represent 34% of the company. We continue to generate premium operating margins, finishing 2011 at nearly 21%. Margin strength was broad-based with all businesses above 20% for the year. Earnings were $5.96 per share, an increase of 6%. We once again generated significant free cash flow of nearly $4 billion and return on invested capital was 20%.  This strong cash flow allowed us to return $4.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, up 81% versus 2010. So all in all, there is much to feel good about in 2011 results, and we are well positioned for success again this year.","Please turn to Slide 10, where I will summarize our forward outlook. While our plans for 2012 have firmed up since we last spoke with you, we still think it's appropriate to maintain maximum flexibility. We don't know precisely what the global economy will bring this year, so we are managing cost very carefully in the early stages. But maximum flexibility also means capitalizing on opportunities as they arise. The key here is to be ready to act quickly on those opportunities no matter what they are. We know that in uncertain times, innovation is more important than ever. It differentiates great companies from the rest of the pack, so we will preserve key investment in R&D, sales and manufacturing to ensure future growth.","We also know that the emerging markets continue to present very promising platforms for growth in the future. Whatever challenges they present today pale in comparison to their opportunities. There is no better example than China, where near-term issues will not affect our investments for long-term success and growth. Sales in China grew 5% in the quarter and 13% x electronics, both clearly below trend. This is a result of several factors. First, the China government is successfully cooling the economy to manage inflation. As David mentioned earlier, our China team anticipate a stronger growth will return in the second half of the year. Second, China's prominence in consumer electronics contributed to our lower growth rate in Q4. And we also expect that to return upward sometime in the middle of the year. Thirdly, the soft economies in Western Europe, for example, continued to affect exports, and it's difficult to gauge exactly when conditions might improve. ","Overall, we agree with a consensus view that China growth will become more robust as 2012 goes on. But the main point I want to make is this, any temporary troubles are trumped by the magnitude of the China opportunity, and we will continue to invest to create and realize opportunities there. And the same is true for all the developing countries.","At our December meeting in New York, we described our financial expectation for 2012. Our outlook has not changed since then. So today, we reaffirm those expectations. We expect that full year 2012 earnings per share will be in the range of $6.25 to $6.50. Including in this range is an estimated $0.09 per share year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement benefits expense. We are estimating organic volume growth between 2% and 5% for the year. We expect that operating margins will be between 21% and 22.5%, with the lower end largely a function of potential one-time costs on acquisitions that might be completed later in the year. This is purely a planning assumption at this point. Finally, we continue to expect a tax rate of 29.5% in 2012. ","Sales and profit growth will be challenging in the first half of 2012. It is our view that first quarter economic growth will be low and will improve as the year progresses. Underlying these estimates are several factors. Europe, of course, is contracting at the moment. Again, consumer electronics will be tough in early 2012, and we expect to see recovery around mid-year. Optical, in particular, will have its toughest comparison in the first quarter. Finally, we expect to incur cost of $0.04 per share in the first quarter related to a voluntary retirement incentive program in the United States, along with some selective restructuring in a few mature countries. These actions, in aggregate, will be neutral for the full year 2012 earnings, with the cost incurred in Q1 and associated benefits realized over the remainder of the year. ","That concludes our formal comments today. Now we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal from FBR Capital Markets.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So just maybe to start with, on the Display and Graphics, margins holding steady at the 19% level despite the top line. And I know you talked about the first quarter inventory challenges. But maybe if you could talk about what margins could look like next year if optical remained at the current level. I know first quarter, there are challenges. But if things come back in the second half, how would margins look like?","David W. Meline","Sure, Ajay. So this is David Meline. First of all, I think to interpret the margin performance in Q4, what you need to think about is the fact that unlike last year in Q4, where we had quite a downtake in our margins, this year we've been facing into what were known headwinds in the business throughout the year. So they've been adjusting their cost base through the year and really operating in a much tougher environment. And therefore, even though in Q4 our utilization in the factories was similar this year to last, the margins were much better because we have a better cost base we've put in place. If we look forward into 2012, we think that optical systems is going to remain under pressure, in particular due to the price environment in the LCD TV business. And we think that the optical business will run closer to the company average, and we think D&G as a sector will be a little bit below where they were in terms of margins in 2011.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Good. And then maybe on the cost saving and restructuring initiatives, you talked about the $4 billion in indirect costs. You obviously have some initiatives already in place. Could you maybe talk about what -- whether you're done with the actions that you wanted to put in place for the cost savings or there's more to be done?","David W. Meline","Yes. So first of all, indirect costs at 3M, this is a broad definition of costs. So this includes basically all of our costs, with the exception of material inputs and our people cost compensation and benefits. So broad definition, we were pleased in terms of how we've managed down those costs in a tougher environment. So if you look at discretionary spending, like external costs that we -- for consultants, this type of thing, if you look at travel expenses, if you look at other discretionary items, we've managed that down in obviously a tougher environment for the company. And we expect that to continue in a similar fashion, certainly through the first half and probably through the entire year, depending on how the year develops. So in terms of additional actions, I would say I think you're seeing the kind of environment right now and performance that will continue into 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Investment Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I might have missed this. Is George on the call this morning?","Matt Ginter","He is.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, because my question relates to -- it's a delicate topic, but management succession. And maybe this is more appropriately directed to 3M's board. But I'm surprised there hasn't been more clarity about succession plans at 3M. And if you compare the big industrials, UTX, GE always have these well-signaled transitions, and it's been really frankly ambiguous at 3M. So is this -- does the board not consider this to be a priority? And what comments can you share with us this morning?","George W. Buckley","Well, Dave, obviously, they do consider it a priority. It's obviously -- must be one of the most important things on their mind. But I think they're trying to figure out what is the best way forward. And we've got a board meeting coming up. I'm sure they'll be considering it at that. And when the appropriate time comes, they'll be letting people know what their decision is. And I don't think there's much else I can say about it because, in a sense, I'm the informed, not the informer, if you know what I mean.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","George, I really appreciate that. I know it's a delicate question. But I just wanted to put it out there that, from our perspective, it's been ambiguous and we'll leave it there. And then in terms of the quarter, I'm trying to reconcile a comment earlier that innovation is important, focusing on new product development is important. But still you've chosen not to invest in R&D in the quarter compared to the spending 1 year ago. So what's the trade-off that you're making today in holding back on what might be incremental growth investments?","David W. Meline","Yes, Deane. I guess, what I would say is that we think that the investments that we've got in place, including in Q4, is certainly perfectly adequate and a very strong level of R&D commitment that the company has. So don't misinterpret what we're showing in Q4 as being us changing our view on the importance to 3M's business model of a very strong R&D investment trend. But obviously, R&D, just like the rest of the areas, as we get into a tougher cost management environment, we've had to temporarily defer some of the things that we'd like to do. We've had to hold down spending just like the rest of the company. But what I can assure you of is we're not throwing overboard important and good opportunities for the business.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just last one for me is I know you're not in the quarterly guidance business. But just based upon commentary, it doesn't sound like you're expecting to show EPS growth in the first quarter. Is that fair?","David W. Meline","In terms of EPS growth in the first quarter, if you look, first of all, at the overall business for the year, what we've said is that we're driving to improve our margins by about 1 point for the year, and we expect 2% to 5% organic growth. Obviously, toughest in the first half and in the first quarter. So I think it would be fair to say that we could see a level of performance that would be carryover or even considering this $40 million of items we've got in the first quarter, could even be a little bit below last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just want to get a sense for -- quickly first, that insurance recovery, which I think is like $0.02 to $0.025 per share or so it sounded like, is that it? Or is there more coming?","David W. Meline","Yes, Steve. So that's right, it's $23 million in total, so a little over $0.02 a share in the fourth quarter. We do have more claims that are in and under discussion. And we're very confident that we'll get some more recoveries beyond that. What we don't know is will those recoveries occur now in 2012 or sometime beyond that in 2013. But yes, the answer is we expect some more.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. But it sounds like certainly not in the first half of the year, right? Because these are longer-term recoveries now.","David W. Meline","I can't say first half. Second half, what's true is, I think importantly, we expect to get some recoveries, but we don't have that explicitly built into the plan right now.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And that $0.06 of Avery Dennison dilution, is that -- that is baked into your $6.25 to $6.50 guidance?","David W. Meline","No, it's not.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So that's in addition -- that would be -- okay -- separate from the...","David W. Meline","That would impact -- and obviously, depending on when it occurs, we'll also have the positive impact of the underlying performance of the business. So what we -- we want to leave that out until we get a better visibility on the timing of the closing.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on pricing. So 200 basis points with significant move-up in several of the businesses and sounds familiar to the '09 experience, where you really were able to drive pricing to hold margins and drive margins. How should we think about this time relative to that time? What's different, sustainability? Any particular areas that you would call out would be helpful.","David W. Meline","Yes, in terms of pricing, to be honest, you're right. We've had to push hard in this environment, particularly driven by the kind of cost inflation that we saw in 2011. As we mentioned in December, we do expect to see certainly more modest -- but in certain commodities, we expect some cost pressure on us again in 2012. So that's part of our planning. But we don't see any reason why, as was the case in 2009, that we can't hold on to our price. If you look at the business model, it's very much driven by innovation and having fresh product that's attractive to our customers. And therefore, our experience is typically we can hold price once we put that through.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. So this is not -- this is still more a function of material and commodity-driven escalators as opposed to new products and mix?","David W. Meline","Yes, I would say -- well, we always have new products, which enables us to hold price and hold margin, right? So in some way, that's in the base. And then the type of extraordinary pricing push we've put on, including now, we're seeing the real benefits of it in Q4. And certainly, we worked to offset the raw material cost inflation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura Securities.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","When you think about these dynamics in your consumer electronics Europe, putting price aside and just looking at kind of core volume growth, right? It was up 1.3% in the quarter. These pressures in the first half, are they incremental pressure on top of what you're already seeing? I mean, are core volumes going to get tougher before they get better? Maybe how to calibrate a little bit how this plays out as we enter '12.","David W. Meline","Yes. So if you look at -- and we can talk about segments. But if you look at the overall volume trend, what we observed in Q4 was very similar in total to what we saw in Q3. And so our perception right now as a -- on a total overall basis, is that we found the bottom across the various areas where we're seeing pressure, that being Western Europe, that being in the consumer electronics business. We do think that we will continue at this lower level of activity, as we said, through the first quarter and through the first half of the year at some level. So I guess, what I would leave you with is our sense right now is that we are stabilizing here on an overall basis. And barring an economic crisis, which we don't have in our plans, we would say eventually, the next step would be a level of recovery for the business.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then just on this Avery deal, kind of interesting. I mean, the deals you guys have done recently have been sort of growthier, I guess, I would say. And I know this is trying to reinvent the category or revitalize the category, I guess. But it's a lower multiple, more kind of cost synergy-related type deal. I mean, is that -- might we see more of those types of deals versus sort of more growth-oriented acquisitions?","Inge G. Thulin","Well -- this is Inge. Acquisitions will come in many shapes and forms. And maybe this could be viewed as slightly different than the ones we have done before. However, this -- in this business, scales matter, and this is very important for us in order to be able to build out opposition in that market. So this, we believe that this is very good because we will be able to add innovation to that business. We would be able to streamline our supply chain, mainly we will be able to give better services. And I think, overall, this is good for our customers and also for the shareholders, of course. So I think generally speaking, that it's slightly different, it's very much U.S.-based. But in this business, scales matter and we will be able to add a lot of value to our customers. We will also, with this business, be able to expand outside of United States. So we think, overall, this is a good addition for our Consumer and Office business. And it's a core for 3M. We know how to do this and have done it very well in the past.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes. No, I agree, it looks good. Obviously, I guess, I was just curious in terms of your pipeline of deals. Are there more things like this, where it's sort of a lower-priced deal where can add scale to something you already have versus maybe expanding into some new growthier areas that you're not currently directly in?","David W. Meline","Yes, if I could, Shannon. What I -- take away from this is that we haven't changed our approach in terms of the pipeline. We're still interested in, not only deals like this that add scale and leverage, but importantly, we think that to continue to have a chance to grow the business as we foresee doing, that we're also looking and will continue to look at transactions that involve businesses that might help our growth rate.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. Could you talk a little bit about your expectations for the linearity of volumes through the course of 2012? Are you expecting an incremental pickup through the course of the year? Or is there a bigger step-up baked in for the second half potentially?","David W. Meline","Yes. So what I would say is if you look at the volume trend, just like the outlook for the economy, we do see a rising volume trend in the second half, which would be a combination of both the way the economy's developing. If you look at Western Europe, Global Insight, for example, it's calling for a positive economic growth by the fourth quarter. If you look at the electronics business, which is impacting us, that obviously has some very dynamic features to a correction, which are a very hard and fast trend down. And typically, a recovery also looks like that, which is a pretty vertical recovery. So depending on the segment, I think it's fair to say that we would expect to see some acceleration in the second half. And the other element of that, which we've talked about in the past is if you look at the inventory cycle, that's a very relevant impact on our business. So if you look at our reported volume in Q4, it was about 1%. But we believe that if you adjust for inventory, it would have been closer to 5%. So if you think about that inventory cycle, we expect that, that, too, would then be reversing as we move through 2012.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up, excluding the acquisition effect, margins in Consumer and Office were basically flattish year-over-year despite the top line growth. Was this driven by some heightened spending? Or was there any other factor driving this? And also, how are you thinking about margins in 2012, including the potential addition of Avery's business?","David W. Meline","Yes. So you got it right, which is that if you look at the margin year-over-year, it was down. But excluding the acquisition, it was flat to up a little bit. We do expect -- it's a tough consumer environment out there right now, in particular in the emerging -- in the mature markets where we have the biggest presence. So what we expect is that kind of a tough environment will continue. And if I think about 2012 margins in Consumer, I expect they'll be pretty flat with 2011.","Matt Ginter","And Abhi, just to reiterate, you asked about Avery. Any impacts from Avery are not in our guidance at this point in time. So as we get closer to close, we'll provide some more insight there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays Capital.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Wanted to go back to Avery and see if we can dig in a little bit more detail. I mean, a couple of questions. I mean, when I look at the initial guidance, it seems relatively conservative, at least as back of the envelope. I would imagine there's some dual capacity and dual warehousing and stuff that would be fairly easy to take out. So I'd love to get your view there. Second, are there any other limitations on what you can do with the brand, given that Avery Dennison does still exists as a company? Are there any limitations as far as how far you can -- whether you could expand this brand out in other SKUs?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes, we are asked in the due diligence relative to what we can as we move ahead. So I think one thing is we are going to be careful in terms of any comments due to the regulatory we are under at this point in time. But as we have looked upon it, we believe that in that specific market around office supplies, that we can capitalize on those brands and be able to build it out. Of course, in terms of cost synergies, there is -- we expect quite a bit that we'll be able to do. And that will be a good benefit for us, both in terms of manufacturing and supply and how we go to market. So we believe that our strong brands that we were able to capitalize on, there is a very good commercialization machine in 3M today that would be able to take those products and commercialize them in a more effective way and a more cost-effective way. And then of course, the whole supply chain will be streamlined as we go ahead here.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So are there limitations with what you can do with the brand? I guess, I wasn't clear.","Inge G. Thulin","No, there is no limitation on what we can do with the brand.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. Second question is just related to R&D. And it's -- I think if you take a look back at the last 20 years or so at 3M, there's been varying levels of spend, mostly around that 5% of sales level, but varying levels above and beyond, give or take 100 basis points. Has there been any analysis done into kind of what is the optimal rate? I mean what is the rate where you are able to outgrow peers, hold on to your margins and earn an appropriate return for shareholders? I mean, I'm just curious to see if there's been a real analysis of that or if there's any way to really measure that, the ideal spend.","George W. Buckley","Scott, it's George here. Maybe I'll take a crack at that for you. We have, in fact, done some of what you suggest. There's always this question that hangs over the effectiveness of R&D. And I'd like to make 2 or 3 points. R&D spend goes up and down, depending on what we -- we may have some external projects that we fund. So you shouldn't really imagine that R&D spend would be perfectly flat all the way through the year, or for that fact, monotonically increasing every year. So there's that kind of variability mixed into the equation. But coming back to your point about the effectiveness of R&D, it's quite interesting that we really don't spend anything more in terms of as a percent of sale. If you take out the pharmaceutical business -- when I came to the company, we picked up spend and it sort of flattened and we've kept it in that similar sort of percentage of sales number all of the intervening years. But what has happened is this New Product Vitality Index, especially in the core, has somewhere between doubled and tripled. So the effectiveness of R&D has become very, very strong, and it's a big -- as David said earlier, what a lot of people perhaps overlook is the impact of these inventory corrections in the second half of our results from last year. The underlying growth is still very, very strong, and we expect it to continue. So whether anybody could ever answer the question, \"What's the optimum spend?\" But if you speculate in your mind and you look forward at the plans that we have for driving this NPVI, and the kind of way we think about it is we separate this Class 3, which is current replacement stuff, that's offsetting natural attrition and the balance of that. So today, this year, the number will be about 32% for the year, net-net, 15% in this sort of [indiscernible] and 17% in new products. You can kind of just get a rough idea of the growth rate which is underlying by just dividing that. It's not absolutely accurate. Just by dividing the -- 32 minus 15 equals 17 divided by 5, gets you 3.4%. So you know that, that's what's the underlying growth in the company. And now where would it be the right thing to do? I think -- we think that right now, we can see our way to around 40%. And that's what we need to get to that underlying organic growth rate that Pat and I talked about what seems like all those many years ago. So I think it's in that range. And the interesting thing then will be where should spend go? Should we -- can we flatten it out? Can we reinvest? Should we hold the investment at that level and the growth rate to that level? That's a ways away, but I think the thing -- the observation we can make is the impact of R&D and the efficiency of R&D has just gone up tremendously in 3M in these intervening years. And that's probably the thing that we ought to focus on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","I'm just wondering if we could dig a little further into Display and Graphics, and just a couple of questions. First, can you just ground is on where you ended '11 on your mix in optical between -- however you have it, but I'm thinking kind of TV, battery devices and other, just thinking about kind of that crossover point.","David W. Meline","Sure, Jeff. So if you look at the mix overall, first, for the calendar year '11, it was 53% battery and 47% plug-in. If you look at the mix in the fourth quarter, specifically, it had risen to 58% battery and 42% plug-in. So -- and as we've talked about going to somewhere 2\/3 to 3\/4 of battery next year, so very much on that trend line that we've laid out in December.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","All right. And that's a revenue number?","David W. Meline","That is revenue.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And can you tell us where you ended the year on attachment rates for LCD TV?","David W. Meline","Yes, we were -- in the fourth quarter, we were running at about 20%. And we think next year in our plans, we're expecting attached to run between 15% and 20%.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. And just one other detail question, and I'll pass it on. Commercial graphics and architecture, you pointed to that. Do you discern any particular turn or pickup in commercial construction activity? Was there something unusual going on there? Just any color on that nuance in the segment.","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. Well, commercial graphics is broad-based, as you know, in terms of both personalization and corporate identity programs. And that's going very well, and we are expanding very well in that area specifically. Architecture is a new business, a new investment for us, where we make very good inroad, which means that despite how construction is doing overall, we are able to go into that market and take market share and build our businesses. What's interesting for us is that commercial graphics is often a business that we're given early indicator of down or upturn in the economy, and we have not seen a downturn. And in fact, we're doing very, very well. I think one of the reason is this new personalization program that have been introduced, which was one of them -- when we talked earlier and David made a comment earlier, some investment that we did in the end of the year 2010 in terms of accelerated programs, 2 of the programs that was done there, one was in personalization for commercial graphics and the other one was around labels. So I see now that those programs are really taking off for us and we have really some good momentum going there. So that is the perspective on commercial graphics specifically. So that was early investment, and it's paying off now all over the world actually, as those programs start now to roll out in commercial graphics, specifically on the personalization side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line on Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dave, wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the nice improvement in pricing again. And I think in the past, sometimes you've given us a breakdown between the electronics businesses and the others. If that's not available, I'm wondering if you can talk about which segments maybe benefited the most on a sequential basis from that improvement.","David W. Meline","Right. So in terms of pricing, yes. I mean, as you observed, we were very pleased with the results. We've been working on this, obviously, through the year. And to see the 2% number print for us in the fourth quarter was very encouraging. If you look at pricing in the quarter x electronics, that was actually 2.7%. So not atypical of the electronics business. We did have price down in particular in optical systems, which impacted us there. In terms of where we have the most significant price improvements, it was most in the areas where we had the most cost pressure, which was more on the industrial side of the business.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And do you have that breakout for 3Q by any chance? I'm sorry, between electrical and nonelectrical? I'm just trying to -- the sequential improvement, was that just electrical getting less negative? Or did the industrial side actually pick up significantly to drive that? Or maybe it was a bit of both.","Matt Ginter","Terry, electronics, generally speaking, is about a 1 point impact on total price change for the company. So I don't think it changed that much really, Q3 versus Q4.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what is the price improvement assumption for 2012?","David W. Meline","We've got 0 to 1 in terms of price in 2012.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the strong Health Care margins in the fourth quarter. I mean, maybe backing up, David, I guess, the question, is it relative to where you guys were in December as we think about your organic growth range for the year? Can you just refresh comments on segments above and below kind of the midpoint of that range? And has anything changed there?","David W. Meline","This is on a volume discussion or on margins?","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Why don't we just talk about the volume discussion?","David W. Meline","Volume. So yes, so if you think about the ranges that we provided in December for 2012, we don't see any reason to be thinking differently about those trends as we finish Q4 and move into the first half. Obviously, while those trends indicate full year figures, we're certainly thinking, as I said earlier, that Q4 and Q1 are not going to look terribly different in terms of the volume momentum overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","David, could you -- any views on China post the new year? Any visibility yet into your order patterns or order books in that region?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes, this is Inge. What we see, as I laid out earlier, we -- there's 3 things that affected the growth in Q4. And I think most of what was built up for the Chinese New Year came in, in Q4, and we have seen a little bit of uptick in the beginning. But it's too early in this quarter to talk about the orders' inflow in China and the impact for the quarter. But I think the 3 things, as I said earlier, that made the result for China was the successful execution of the government to slow the economy in order to manage inflation. It's clearly the economic environment, overly in terms of exports going over to Europe and United States. But specifically, to Europe, as that now stands for 19% of the exports out of China. And then the prominence in the electronic industry also made, that there was a little bit of slowdown. But as both David and myself and George talked about here earlier, we see all those 3 things type of moving up as the year progresses. But it looked like Q1 for China would be very similar to Q4 as it looks like now.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly on raw materials, we see a number of your chemical commodity prices come down, but you're still looking for raws to be up year-over-year. Where are you seeing or expect to be seeing inflation in raw materials in 2012?","David W. Meline","Yes. The areas where we see it -- some of our chemicals still are experiencing some level of inflation. Resins as well rubber and rare earth materials are the most prominent areas of cost pressure for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a question on Health Care. Very strong margin there. And sequentially, I think revenues are flat but the profits were up. What's going on there? Is there a mix issue or something else? And what's the longer-term view on Health Care margin?","David W. Meline","Sure. Yes, I mean, the fact is, is that Health Care, just like the rest of the business, we've gone into a fairly tough environment where we are marshaling our resources and really focusing on managing cost. So as we've talked about pretty consistently, we believe the sweet spot for the businesses is in the high 20s. But from quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see this thing move up and down a bit. So this quarter, we had about 1 point of pickup. Does that again signal that we've got a different view of Health Care going forward in their margins? I would say not at all. What's true is we're seeing very good performance in some of the sectors. So for example, in infection prevention, is having strong performance, skin and wound care as well, which is also helping the results.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What's your most positive margin just directionally? What's your favorite business there, margin-wise?","David W. Meline","Actually, Health Care's portfolio is all pretty profitable.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you, so no rebuttification [ph]. One last question, just on the sequencing of the quarter. We've heard a lot about November maybe being a little bit weak. You guys seem a little bit better on your -- on the tone of the economy. Did you see anything change kind of second half of December or towards the end of the year maybe into this year?","David W. Meline","No, we didn't see any new inflection point. Obviously, we like -- the market was looking at 3M and looking for where we're stabilizing, and we're pleased to see that, that occurred in Q4. But as I said earlier, we think now, unfortunately, we're in a fairly weak environment at least through the first quarter.","Inge G. Thulin","I would like, yes, to make one additional comment relative to Health Care because I think there's a couple of elements there that is working very well and is overall based on the strategy for the company. First of all, in infection prevention, this Arizant acquisition that was down last year is playing out very, very well for us. And then in addition, we have introduced some new products here, specifically the new silicon tape that is making a big difference in the market. So many things in Health Care is going on in terms of both driving productivity in the commercialization part but also the execution of the acquisitions they have done and new product introduction, specifically then in wound and skin health. So I think that all those elements is driving good margins for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to -- one of the big headlines to come out of the CES show this year was the introduction of some OLED screens, primarily in the TV market. How does the transition from LCD to OLEDs change the game for your films business?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, we see OLED, of course, coming on. And we don't have any big impact as we go into 2012. In fact, we see with some of the innovation that we are working on in our laboratories that could be an advantage for us because the LED segment need to respond to it. So again, in that segment overall, the important thing is to have innovation so you can meet a competitive threat, and for us -- it's for us to be able to provide our customers with alternatives. And I say a couple of very, very good programs going on that will help them to be able to defend their position. Overall, in that segment, which is the same for -- if you think about some of the Display and Graphics businesses, but also Electro and Communications is that's a very good space for us to be in due to the fact it's about technology innovation and cost out. And that is what 3M does very well. And both those businesses have very high NPVI. I think Electro and Communications is the highest in the company of over 42%. Meaning, as they now develop new platforms for the future, we are there working with them because that is the future for us.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-on. George has talked a lot about inventory adjustments in the past. And you're obviously seeing some pretty big inventory adjustments in Electro and also in films. Can you just maybe describe what you're seeing as far as inventory reductions right now, perhaps focusing on China and Europe? And which businesses are you seeing the most severe inventory adjustments?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. I think that one thing we see that, generally, inventory levels have reset to healthy levels. And when you go in, as you talk specifically around film businesses for Electro and Communications and optical, they are now at 5 to 6 weeks in the channel. So when we talk to our customers and when we get the information from our own business heads here, its inventory levels have reset to a more healthy level.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions on asset footprints. First, what kind of deceleration or deterioration in the longer-term growth rates in Europe would you need to, say, to significantly rationalize your European footprints? And secondly, George, over the years, you've made several remarks about the need to shift the business model towards more of a solutions mindset with a lot more information technology intensity. Do you think that, that's something which the company needs to do more aggressively over the next few years in terms of larger-scale M&A? Or do you think it's -- or do you think that's within 3M's own skill set?","George W. Buckley","Yes, Laurence, it's George here. You seem sort of -- if you think about sort of what has really affected your life in the last 10 years, I mean, there's all sorts of different things. But probably 70% of the impact on your life was electronics. And the things you carry in your bags, the things you have on your desk, and so on, so forth, communications. So I don't expect that pattern to change. There are some other supporting things that we don't have time now to go over. But what we've done is sort of gradually cede this into the company, and you'll see in the makeup of the company's products, more and more electronics, more and more software-oriented businesses. I expect this pattern to continue. Whether I'd want to sort of recommend to anybody, to the board in particular, that we make a big -- a very expensive software acquisition because these things tend to be for us much more sort of engineering-oriented. We have a good group in the company already that does that. We'd expand that probably organically. So I don't expect to see any sort of big leapfrog acquisitions in software, Laurence. On Europe, Europe generally speaking as an area has had lower growth than pretty much any of the other areas that we have in the world. These economic cycles come and they go. This one will be the same. I think there's been a trend in our company just progressively to push down and really demand more productivity in Europe. That won't change. I don't think there's going to be any, again, any cataclysmic restructuring program in Europe. We'll just continue to drive it down. Just one last sort of comment. If you just think about attrition in its own right, we attrited around 5% a year. So we can get some pretty good productivity out of that, notwithstanding having to -- not all skills are fungible. So I think it's going to be largely attrition-driven and probably specific issues from time to time, squeaky wheels that we oil, and that's probably about the way that we'll likely handle it.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","George, I noticed on the Display and Graphics segment, you got actually a win with your new Power-Over-Ethernet film. Does that drive your content back on to power devices?","George W. Buckley","Well, very interesting, I -- you have to -- I think the people are going to be very interested in this as it continues to push down on energy. The rate of adoption, obviously, we don't know. It's a new product, we'll have to see. But I think it's a very interesting product. And I suspect it will drive up the content, and particularly, in monitors and all-in-ones as we go forward. So I'm pretty optimistic and pretty upbeat about that. So I suspect, without me getting into the forecasting business on that one product line in that one segment, I think it's going to be a nice lift for the business as the year unfolds and more people adopt it.","John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Is it similar content for device as your optical film?","George W. Buckley","Well, similar charges per square meter, yes. And a few other bits and pieces, of course, that we get along with that sale through that innovation. So probably content will go up a little bit.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.","Matt Ginter","Well, thanks for joining us today, everybody. Good questions. And we look forward to talking to you as the year goes on. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

(Operator Instructions) It is recommended that you use a landline phone if you are going to register for a question. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded; Thursday, January 24, 2013.","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you and good morning, everyone. On today's call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance along with the 2013 outlook. Inge and David will each make some opening comments and will leave plenty of time for your questions.","Recall that during the fourth quarter, we announced a realignment of our major business groups. Segment reporting for the new organization will begin in the first quarter of 2013. Today's results are presented on the basis of our existing segment structure. We will furnish supplemental, historical, business segment, sales and operating income information reflecting the segment realignments in an 8-K and expect to see this filing sometime around mid-March.","There'll be mention of few upcoming dates and events. First our 2013 earnings conference calls are set for April 25th, July 25th and October 24th. Also, we will host an Investor Meeting on the afternoon of Tuesday, December 17th. I know that December calendar fill quickly, so please hold these dates and more details will be available later this year.","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Now, please turn to slide number three and I will turn the call over to Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. I appreciate you for joining us today. For 3M, 2012 was a year of preparation, progress and performance. We developed and introduced our new vision and strategies and we aligned our organization more closely with our customers and markets. We combined several businesses for increased scale and relevance and we formed new businesses in promising markets.","We brought new streams to marketing, sales and e-business and we gave new emphasis and leadership to lean Six Sigma, and we put in place a dedicated team to more efficiently integrate our acquisitions. Today that team is hard at work on both, the FSTech and Ceradyne acquisitions. You will recall from our November meeting that Ceradyne is both, a good business and is strong technology play to build out 3M's ceramic's platform.","I am very pleased that in 2012, we brought portfolio prioritization into the forefront of our how we manage the company. This is important for long-term success and we are using the process to improve short-term results as well. In a few minutes, I will discuss several actions we have recently taken.","Perhaps the most significant progress we made last year was the strengthening of 3M's commitment to innovation. We expect R&D to approach 6% of sales by 2017 and you will see some evidence of our increased investment in the fourth quarter of 2012. Finally, as you all know, we reset our financial goals for the next five years. We now have targets that are both realistic and aggressive with real possibility of upside. All these actions are evidence of preparation and progress.","Let me summarize our 2012 performance. Please turn to slide four. For the year, earnings per share were up 6% to $6.32. Operating income rose to $6.5 billion or 5% increase. We maintain outstanding margins of 21.7% with five out of six business segments delivering above 21%.","Sales for the year were nearly $30 billion. In organic local currency terms, sales increased 2.6% with particular strength in Latin America\/ Canada, up 11% and the United States up 4% for the year. Asia Pacific was flat for the year in organic local currency, impacted heavily by a soft global consumer electronics industry, and Europe, Middle East, Africa was down 1%.","Currency impacts reduced worldwide sales by 2.4% and acquisitions added nearly a point. We returned $3.8 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which was 86% of net income for the year. Finally, return on invested capital for the year was 20%.","In summary, a solid year of results during uncertain economic times. The 3M team is well aligned and the company well positioned to win in 2013 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to David for more detail on our fourth quarter 2012 results. David?","David Meline","Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with slide number five where I will breakdown the fourth quarter change in sales. Fourth-quarter sales rose 4.2%, our strongest increase of any quarter in 2012. Organic growth was 4.3% as volumes rose 3.6% and selling price increases were a positive 0.7%. Acquisitions added nearly one point to sales growth in the quarter and foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by one percentage point.","On a geographic basis, Latin America\/Canada was once again our fastest-growing region with organic local currency growth of 9.7%. This performance was broad-based with all six of our businesses generating positive organic growth in the region including double-digit increases in healthcare, safety, security and protection services, consumer and office and electro and communications. Brazil and Mexico both posted impressive results. Brazil grew 11% organically in the face of a still recovering economy and Mexico grew 10%.","Organic local currency growth was 5.8% in Asia Pacific. Japan declined year-on-year reflecting continued tough economic conditions and the rest of APAC rose nearly 10% on an organic basis. For non-Japan Asia, this was the best quarterly growth performance in nearly two years. China was a significant contributor with organic local currency sales growth of over 16%.","We also had another very good quarter in the United States with organic sales up 5.2%. Consumer and office led the way with strong double digit performance. In EMEA, or the combined Europe, Middle East and Africa, fourth quarter sales declined 1% on an organic local currency basis. Western Europe was down 0.6% year-on-year. The economies there have stabilized but are not yet growing. Our teams in the region continue to focus on market share gains and productivity.","Let's now review the income statement. Please turn to slide number six. Sales for the quarter were $7.4 billion, an increase of 4.2% in dollar terms. We generated $3.4 billion in gross profit and maintained strong gross margins of 46% for the quarter. SG&A spending rose 1% and we have increased R&D investments by 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year.","Operating income increased 5.8% in Q4. Operating margins were 19.5%, up 30 basis points year-on-year. Four primary factors contributed to the margin change.","First, as I mentioned earlier, we grew organic volumes by 3.6% in the fourth quarter, which we leveraged into approximately 50 basis points of higher operating margin.","Second, the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 1.4 percentage points to fourth quarter margins. Selling prices increased 0.7% year-on-year, largely due to carry over price benefits from actions taken earlier in 2012. Raw material raw material cost deflation was approximately 3.5%.","Third, acquisitions in total reduced operating margins by 50 basis points. As Inge mentioned, we are in the process of integrating two recently closed deals Ceradyne and Federal Signal Technologies. Both integration efforts are going well with no major surprises, and from a financial perspective, we are right where we expected to be at this point in time. Adjusting for these deals, operating margins would have been 20% in the fourth quarter.","Finally, we experienced lower factory utilization in Q4 versus the same quarter of 2011, which combined with the other factors hurt fourth quarter operating margins by 1.1 percentage points. All things considered, we delivered full year operating margins of 21.7%, right near the midpoint of the 21.5% to 22% range we were expecting.","Fourth quarter earnings per share increased 4.4% to $1.41. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% year-on-year, which added [$0.01] to EPS. The fourth quarter tax rate was 28.7%, up two percentage points year-on-year which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. The fourth quarter concludes another year for 3M, and with our plan in place and our organization aligned, we anticipate a strong 2013.","Let's now review our fourth quarter performance on business by business basis. Please go to slide number seven. Sales in the Industrial and Transportation business were $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 4% on an organic local currency basis. We achieved good growth in a number of businesses, including industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives, automotive OEM and personal care products.","We posted double-digit increases in two businesses, specifically liquid filtration and aerospace and aircraft maintenance, where we continue to win business and penetrate further into these important markets. Our Renewable Energy business declined 12% on an organic local currency basis.","On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales in Industrial and Transportation increased 6% in Latin America, Canada and the United States, and 4% in Asia-Pacific. Industrial and Transpiration's fourth quarter organic sales were flat in EMEA. Operating income was $469 million and margins were 18.8%. Adjusting for Ceradyne, Industrial's operating margins were similar to fourth quarter 2011 levels.","Now, let's move to Healthcare. Fourth quarter sales increased nearly 6% on an organic local currency basis to $1.3 billion. Healthcare generated $430 million in operating income in the quarter, up 11% year-on-year and operating margins were 32.3%. Continuing the trend from recent quarters, the growth in Healthcare was very broad-based. All businesses posted positive organic local currency sales growth in Q4, led by food safety, health information systems, skin and wound care and oral care.","On an organic local currency basis, sales increased in all major geographic regions with double-digit increases in Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific. In developing markets, Healthcare drove nearly 15% organic local currency sales growth continuing our recent success in these areas and we expect the momentum to continue. In developed markets, our healthcare team continues to generate solid profitable growth despite ongoing government austerity efforts in many major countries. In summary, a superb quarter for healthcare.","Now, let's look at the Consumer and Office business. Sales were $1.1 billion this quarter, up 9% on an organic local currency basis and operating income rose 29% to $230 million. In the United States, sales increased at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter. Holiday sell-through was good and we saw some holiday related sales shift from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. This shift boosted our Q4 growth rate by an estimated 1.5 percentage points, year-on-year. We continued to benefit in the U.S. from a strong flow of new products in consumer and office, such as our recently introduced line of Command Clear wall hooks. We are also gaining excellent traction in safety products for the retail channel, most notably in protective eyewear under the 3M TEKK brand.","Finally, Filtrete brand filters grew well in Q4, boosted by colder weather patterns in many parts of the country. Elsewhere in consumer and office, we also drove double-digit organic local currency growth in Latin America\/Canada and low single-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and EMEA. On a worldwide business basis, our strongest growers were consumer health care and DIY with positive growth also in home care products and stationery and office supplies. All in all, this was a strong quarter for our consumer and office team.","Let's take a look at our display and graphics segment. Sales in the fourth quarter were $910 million, an increase of 8.3%. Optical systems had a good fourth quarter, with sales up double digits and stable profit margins year-on-year. Optical finished the year largely as we had expected. We also posted positive organic local currency sales growth in architectural markets, traffic safety systems and commercial graphics. Display and graphics grew 12% organically in Asia Pacific, 10% in Latin America\/Canada and 5% in the U.S., EMEA sales were down 2% year-on-year. Operating profits in display and graphics were $152 million, with operating margins of 16.7%. Margins declined 2.5 percentage points year-on-year, primarily due to the FSTech acquisition along with start up cost in a couple of businesses.","Let's examine safety, security and protection services business. Fourth quarter sales were $904 million, down 2% on an organic local currency basis. We posted good growth in most businesses with notable strength in infrastructure protection and personal safety products. Sales declined in our security systems division as the market remained soft and the business has been under strategic review. Inge will address the actions we are taking to better position security systems for success going forward.","On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales rose 13% in Latin America\/Canada, and 1% in Asia Pacific and declined 7% in the U.S. and 5% in EMEA. Operating income in safety, security and protection services decreased 5% year-on-year to $162 million and margins were 18%. Margins declined 50 basis points impacted by the aforementioned challenges in security systems.","Finally, let's review electro and communications. Sales in this business totaled $776 million in the fourth quarter, up 1.8% in organic local currency terms. Operating income total $142 million, down 6.5% year-on-year and margins were 18.4%. On an organic local currency basis, sales increased in touch systems, electrical markets and telecom. Sales declined a bit in consumer electronics and we are anticipating first quarter will be similar. In geographic terms, Latin America\/Canada rose 10%, the U.S. increased 4% and Asia Pacific rose 1%, while EMEA declined 3% in the quarter.","That concludes my discussion of the business segment results. Let's move on to cash flow. So please turn to slide number seven. From a cash flow perspective, fourth quarter was quite similar to the same quarter in 2011. Free cash flow was $1.23 billion, up $10 million year-on-year. We invested $507 million capital expenditures during the fourth quarter down $10 million versus fourth quarter of last year. Full year CapEx was $1.5 billion, which was in line with our expectations entering the year.","Free cash flow conversion was 124% in the quarter versus 128% in last year's comparable quarter. For the full year 2012, free cash flow conversion was 86%. We returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter including $714 million in growth share repurchases and $407 million in cash dividends. For the full year 2012, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders or 86% of net income.","So that concludes our review of the fourth quarter. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, David. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to spend a few minutes on 2013, and how we are working to strengthen 3M.","I said earlier that 2012 was a year of preparation, progress and performance. With a planning behind us 2013 is a year of putting our plan into action and truly competing to win. To win, we are strengthening our portfolio, and at the same time, working to resolve some challenging business issues. For example, in November, we announced a combination of our security systems division with our traffic safety systems division. In recent times, these businesses have not performed to the standards we expect and we are addressing these issues head-on.","Government spending for security has decreased over the last few years and those same factors have also affected our traffic safety systems' business. In a big picture bringing these two businesses together creates an opportunity to optimize the overall business and increase efficiency. We announced last week a restructuring in these businesses that will result in the reduction on 300 positions worldwide and we will take related Q1 charge of $8 million.","In a company of our size and breadth there would always be some businesses under strategic review, and while the specific solutions may defer the underlying principle is the same. They will not stay under strategic review for long. We will take action. And in context, these situations are few when compared to 3M's overall portfolio of outstanding businesses.","For 2013, we will continue to drive our strategies, invest in innovation, commercialize new product as quickly as possible and work to take market share everywhere. We have confidence in our plan and our people and in the planning estimates we gave you in December, which you can see on slide 10. We expect 2013 earnings per share in the range of $6.70 to $6.95. We look for organic local-currency sales growth of plus 2% to plus 5%. The tax rate is expected to be 29.5% to 30%. And finally, we anticipate free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%.","As for the near-term, we are naturally a bit more cautious. There remains a degree of uncertainty as we see some economies growing and others are slower to recover. The same dynamics can be found in specific markets. Healthcare is doing well for example, while consumer electronics just have to recover fully. Specific to the first quarter, we anticipate approximately $30 million of restructuring and one-time acquisition cost. This includes the $8 million in restructuring cost I mentioned earlier. The point is, we will execute our plan to keep improving and growing the business.","Thanks for your attention. We will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Morning.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Inge, just in Industrial, sequentially, the business sales declined $73 million, but operating profit declined $106 million, sequentially. Can you just describe exactly what drove that dynamic Q3 versus Q4 in Industrial?","Inge Thulin","Yes, I think we have some businesses that do well and continues to do well there, like automotive did well. I think one of the impacts is the RED business that we had an issue with and have had during the whole year. The way we look upon RED is that is relatively small division for us, generally speaking, it is a $400 million business and you can look upon the segment, it has two segments, one conservation and one generation.","Conservation is like the window films for us, that was type of flat. On generation side, which is wind and solar, as you know, on the global market that is a declining market. So we were down in that side. So I think that was a big piece for us during the quarter for the industrial in total.","David Meline","If I could, David, as we look at industrial performance in the quarter, the sales were quite reasonable in terms of 4% growth year-on-year. Certainly, Q4, we always see a decline in activity including margins. As you know, as we called out, we were also impacted by the cost in Ceradyne.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Very good, and just, Inge, on consumer electronics, you mentioned it would be like weak through Q1. Any further insight in to when it might pick up via your customer's order book or?","Inge Thulin","No, I think 2013 will look like the beginning of 2012. It will look like the same. So we don\u2019t know of the ways it will be coming but probably sometime in the end of Q2 is the indication that we can see at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you, good morning everyone. Inge, back in November, you gave us some good insight to your thinking around business under strategic review. I just wondered if there is not anything else moving around? I think, at the time, you said there was about $2.5 billion of sales that were, maybe, in the crosshairs. Could you just give us some color on how big security and transportation is, now that you have put together, as a percent of that? And if there is any other businesses moving around in that thought process?","Inge Thulin","First of all, as I said, we are taking action related to that. As I said, that\u2019s about fixed combined or closed in order to see the advantage of the businesses and if we can fix them moving forward. So I think this is a first good step for us. We believe by combining those two divisions that there is very good synergy for us in between the two businesses. Just to make a comment around it, both those businesses that are based on material as the core.","So we are very strong in both those businesses in the core relative to material. Then both businesses are type of reaching out and go into more solutions around electronic. So that is the advantage of combining them in order to look upon the synergy. So when we look upon it specifically, you have elements of the customer facing opportunity, which I think is still very precise in terms of execution and then you can get leverage around technology, business processes, compliance and then manufacturing and supply chain.","So when you do that, combine them, you will get more efficiency and also from an organization perspective around the world where we have all the subsidiaries. It will work very well for them because they get more focused, more dedication and can execute better. In many pieces there, as you know, is project management. So you need to have a specialist that is working with us.","So combined those two businesses, we feel very good in terms of, this is something we can fix, it is something where we will win and we will move them forward. Some other businesses, without calling them out, we are working on that in order to solutions for them as an outcome around the strategic review. So this was two of them that we looked upon in order to make sure that we can win for the future. I will update you as we go and the actions will be taken.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And these two combined, would be the biggest single piece of businesses under review now?","David Meline","So, if you look at the businesses under review, we have called out as part of that the security division was in there and that was a business, $400 million to $500 million of revenue out of that $2.5 billion. Traffic safety was not part of that group but inevitably as you look at how to get the right alignment across the businesses in our total portfolio, we made that change","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Inge, can you, or David, provide a little more color on what you are seeing in China, the organic growth in the quarter, any particular end markets that are standing out, and I guess everybody's question really is, is there a legitimate recovery of some sort now underway there as opposed to kind of the hopes for one that everybody had last year.","Inge Thulin","Well, we saw recovery. And as you saw, we had growth in the quarter of 16% in total. Our base business, which is excluding electronic was like 10%, so that's a good uptick for us. And, I would say then and that's a quarter for us last year, right? 2012. Looking into the 2013, our base business, I would say will continue in the same mode as we saw then. We don't know yet in terms of electronics.","So, electronic maybe will still be a little bit of a challenge as we move into the year, but for the base business we see recovery coming and we feel optimistic about that, but we're still cautious as you said, because when you look upon quarter-by-quarter, it's not the old China if you like, right? That's a different base line that we need to grow out from, but we can see recovery coming in base business and it's a big portion for us, so we sequential improvement in that as we move ahead for the base business going into Q1. Electronic is little more a question mark for us as we speak.","David Meline","Yes, if I could add. So, base being industrial, we saw a good growth again in healthcare in the quarter and China as we've seen all year. And also recall, or you may recall that we had a very weak quarter in China last year in the fourth quarter, so quite honestly there's a bit of an element here of the year-over-year comparison.","Inge Thulin","I think five of six businesses grew in China in the last quarter","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge Thulin","Morning.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","On Healthcare, those are stellar margins above 32%, and typically when we start seeing the margins bump up that high, there's some cautious comments about sustainability that you may be making some investments in this business, but how would you frame for us in terms of that level of profitability and the outlook over the near-term?","David Meline","Sure, Deane. So, as I commented in the speech, we are encouraged of course by the fact that we see broad-based growth across all of the divisions in healthcare again now in Q4. We did see a little bit of a pull forward in sales into Q4, in part due to those activities that will be impacted by the medical device tax. So, you saw it tick up a little bit in terms of growth and we know about a half a point of that growth was associated with that pull forward.","In terms of margins, we continue to believe now that in 2013, we do expect the margins to run at 30-plus percent for the time being, but looking at this one, obviously, we had everything came together at the same time in that quarter and so I wouldn't suggest you that that you would bank us continuing to operate every quarter at that level.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","That's fair. Then a broader macro question, I think a lot of folks in the industrial side were braced for some anxiety in December related to the fiscal cliff and certainly didn't see it in your organic revenue growth at 5.2%, but could you provide any color in terms of customer behavior? Was there any hold off or push out in orders other than that healthcare getting pulled in, but broadly anything that you think may have been delayed that may then snapback in January?","David Meline","No. I would say, Deane, we saw sale, if you look through the quarter, the trends during the quarter were quite stable. We didn't see any particular effects that we could point to other than the one I just mentioned in healthcare. Obviously, the other piece of course, we were very pleased with was a holiday performance for consumer, but beyond that were there other notable ups or downs or inflection points? I would say, we didn't see any and therefore as we look at our guidance into 2013 by sector, we think that the growth ranges that we called out in December still looked good in terms of what we expect in 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Good morning, guys. One question, just in terms of the overall margin walk, you had this utilization and other bucket. The volumes were up nicely and accelerated. What is going on the utilization? Did you actually choose to take your production a little bit down to get rid of inventories or is there anything else going on in that?","David Meline","So if you look at the margin walk, we did have about a point there related to utilization. It was really a couple of things that are the biggest pieces of that. One of them is, we included in there some cost related to startups of some new factories that were restarting up. So we have got in particular, if you look in Singapore we have in the traffic signage business, we have a new factory that started up here in the fourth quarter. So that impacted our utilization, because there are costs as you ramp up the business. There also was also a new project we have got in the electronics space in touch panels that impacted utilization in a similar way. Then we also had, if you look at our utilization year-over-year, in a couple of areas we did see a lower level of activity. Those being in some of the consumer electronics related spaces. So, if you look at utilization in the semiconductor space, amongst our customers that was lower in Q4 and that impacted our business. As well as, Inge was referring to RED, or the renewable energy business, we saw some lower utilization at some of those factories. So that was really what drove that impact.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay, and then just looking specifically at the display and graphics margins. You had a few factors in there. You had FSTech, you had some of the startup costs there. Then traffic safety has also probably had down margins right. So can you just give a little color on the buckets of those and how much they contributed to the margin?","David Meline","Sure. So if you look at it, we had a year-over-year decline D&G of about 2.5 points. As I mentioned, not related to divisions such as optical where we had very stable performance in terms of margin and very much what we expected. The two biggest factors there, as I did mention, about almost half of it was the impact of the FSTech acquisition and the other piece was more related to the startup cost which I mentioned that impacted the company overall. We had a little bit of product mix but I would say a third of the factors that you line them in terms of significance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks and good morning. Just first question on your pricing. So you had the pricing spread 140 on back of two quarters at 160, which is great performance but how much of that is or how do you think about that relative to commodities, giving you any kind of tailwind there and your ability to price on the commodity discussion and your ability to price going forward? How much is a function of that versus new product intro and what's giving you the pricing power across your businesses and what's your ability to maintain that given how critical that\u2019s been to the margin performance quarter-on-quarter.","David Meline","Sure. So you got the figures. We tried to lay those out quite clearly. She trend, as you know, is why we did have 0.7% price performance in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s primarily the impact of price increases that were taken earlier in the year. With the situation on raw materials, as I have said in November, we expect the pricing impact in 2013 to moderate further. As to our ability to hold price and avoid commoditization, of course, as you know the business model is exactly geared towards offering innovative solutions that differentiate our products for our customers and provide value that they are willing to pay for.","So no difference in that model next year versus any time in the past. In terms of raw materials, we do expect the tailwind of raw material price declines that we experienced in 2012 to substantially moderate. That's why we said in our guidance for 2013 that we think that that impact will pretty neutral. So, we do feel? We think it will be less of a contributor the combination in 2013 than we experienced in 2012, but also not the kind headwind we have the prior couple of years and we feel good about our ability to deliver on that.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","In the pricing part of that though, you think that 70 basis point. I mean, as you look forward, you think you can maintain that kind of pricing alone?","David Meline","In our plan for 2013, we do not expect to see price increases for the year as high as that 0.7.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Then what kind of inventory restocking impacts or destocking did you see across the portfolio over the last quarter and do you see that, has that been trending differently?","David Meline","Yes. We don't, other than a couple of specific areas that we've tried to talk about today in specific businesses, the general trend we've seen we would say, if you look at the sales trend pretty stable for the company through the quarter. And I would say, we did not observe anything notable in terms of unusual inventory patterns.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And just one more in the guidance, you've got 2% to 5%, you just did 4% on organic growth. So, you know, presumably certainly a sequential move the other way. Is that fair or how are you thinking about that?","David Meline","Well, yes. I mean, the overall guidance 2% to 5% for the company in 2013 we still think is the right way to think about it. If you look at the Q4 performance in terms of sales, which obviously we were quite pleased with moving from 2% on average during the first nine months up to 4%, if you sort parse that out about half of it was related to the performance in the consumer segment, which as I think we have talked about or we've inferred, we think that that was related to some fairly specific factors in Q4 and we continue to think 2% to 5% growth for consumer in 2013 is the right way to think about that segment.","Then the other contributors most significant one to that pickup in Q4 was the performance in Asia, most significantly the base business in China. And, as Inge said, we've taken some reasons for some optimism that we are seeing a recovery as I think others are talking about are we getting I would were cautious to start running away with that is something that's going to continue to trend more strongly. But, again, we are encouraged by the indications.","Inge Thulin","I think, first of all you know we stick to our guidance we gave you in December. We're, of course, pleased with outcome of Q4 in terms of our growth, we are as cautious as we move into the year here and operate in the same way that we moved into 2012 very successfully.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning. Could you maybe provide any color on how the quarter progressed? Obviously, very good organic growth quarter. Did you see any pickup in December?  Then maybe any early read into what you are seeing in Jan? Have the trends that you saw in the fourth quarter, have they continued? Have you seen any pickup? Any thoughts there would be helpful.","David Meline","Sure, Ajay. Yes. I would say, again, and not repeat but if you look at the selling rates more on a daily basis, we didn't see anything changing in Q4. Now, there were some issues around how many selling days there were as between October, November, December, so you know you get some different outcomes if you looked at that on a monthly basis because December actually had a lesser number of days than last year. But as we look at it on the on a very granular basis, we didn\u2019t observe any trends that were implying some new level of inflection in our overall business in total and again, obviously, some pluses and minuses which we have tried to call out here today. If I then roll forward into where we are sitting today in late January, we see relative stability in terms of the overall business. Again, I don\u2019t see anything that I would point to that would indicate some new information for us here.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets","Good, and then on the consumer business, I know there were a couple of things that helped the quarter but even ex-that, it looks like you had really good topline. So does that change how you are thinking about the business, how that business does this year. Your guidance I $2 billion to $5 billion for that segment. Based on just the performance, do you think you could be conservative? Any thoughts there?","Inge Thulin","First of all, we are very pleased with the performance from consumer. It is probably the business during this year that really put a very good plan together were able to execute it to very successfully. And as David laid out, there was some specifics in Q4 that boost the growth for us. But however it was a very good growth in both businesses and in all geographic areas. As you recall while we eventually can see a little bit of uptick as we go further out is our relatively low penetration in international. So we will keep the guidance for now.","What we can say very clearly that we are making headwinds both in international and in United States and have both very good growth in United States, as David called out in our Q4 in a highly penetrated market. Then we have still a lot of opportunities in international. The thing that what is happening is that business have improved the consumer insights and they have added their sign as big elements of the business on top of the innovation that we can provide for the company to them then their very strong category management capabilities that we have in that business.","So you look upon consumer, for us, long-term is a very, very good business for us with good upside and both that business and healthcare, as you know, for us is what we call very much local domestic businesses that we were able to grow and both of them have still big opportunities in international. So we are very encouraged as we move ahead but we are not changing the guidance in terms of growth as we speak here today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Thanks, good morning. I think most of my issues have been addressed but just quickly, you scaled the size of the security systems business but traffic systems have got my model at $0.9 billion. Is that about right?","David Meline","Yes, it's just under $1 billion business.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Then just couple of quick ones. Since you gave 2013 guidance the Yen has been under bit of a tear, does that change in anyway? You have got a quite a big exposure to Japan. It is about 8% of your sales, I believe. So does that change anything in terms of FX impact or perhaps margin?","Inge Thulin","No, it's not sufficiently material to us right now, Nigel that we would feel that we need to call out a change. Obviously, we are monitoring because the Yen has weakened already and there is obviously a lot of talk about a further weakening. If you recall, we hedge about 50% of all of our exposures. So that gives us certainly the ability to navigate and adjust the business if we see something more structural happening, but not material right now that we would need to talk about.","David Meline","Nigel, I would add too, it's 8% of sales, but we do have a 25% minority partner in Japan. So a quarter of the profits belong to the minority. So from a sensitivity standpoint, the move in the Yen is going to be less pronounced than it would be with the likes of the Euro.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, good, and then staying on FX, there is some linkage between U.S. dollar movements and pricing, particularly in regions like LatAm. Has the stronger dollar over the last couple of quarters had any impact, albeit at the margin, on pricing in those regions?","David Meline","Well, in some of our contracts we do price pegged to the dollar. So in fact to the extent that the currency has weakened we saw, in local currency terms prices increased and likewise you would see some reductions in pricing which would be reflected in the overall 0.7 that we mentioned.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great and then just finally, we finally saw a renewal of the R&D tax credit. You got a pretty big R&D investment. Does that change at all your tax view for 2013? I know you maintained the line at 29% to 30%, but does that maybe put it down by some tax rate in 2013?","David Meline","Yes. What I would say is first of all we came in for the year at 29%, which is right in the range of 29% to 29.5% that we had indicated for 2012. It is true that if I look at there is a modest effect for us of the carryover impact of the deferral of these extenders into 2013. But as we look at the number of different factors that impacts the tax rate during the year, lead us to include at this time that we think that 29.5% to 30% outlook for the company is a good. And quite honestly, the information I have in front of me, I don't see any reason why quarter-to-quarter that that rate is going to be vastly differed from the full year rate guidance I have got out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","You mentioned a couple of the moving parts on the first quarter. I think the normal seasonality is up, but no double-digit 10% to 15%, but you mentioned I guess $30 million of incremental restructuring are there any other moving parts into the first quarter or should we just expect kind of normal seasonality here on an earnings basis?","David Meline","Yes. I would say what we see right now is pretty normal seasonality, Steve. The one area that we are cautious about, which Inge mentioned is in the Electronics space. We do see some ups and downs there and we think that we may have some lower level of demand in some of those sectors for example, as I mentioned semiconductor, utilization has been running a bit lower. I think that will impact us in Q1. But overall, we think it's fairly normal.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","So, like low 160s kind of numbers? If that's just a 10% to 15% increase from the fourth quarter, just the math?","David Meline","Yes. We don't do guidance on a quarterly basis. We'll probably keep that at least for the time being.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. Then one last question, just on the inventory dynamics, I mean, I guess looking back there, your portfolio is kind of like electronics, healthcare and then some industrial businesses. Just looking back over the past year, did you think you have seen an impact from inventory dynamics outside of electronics mostly in the industrial businesses and maybe you noticed in the postmortem of the last year-and-half of the volatile economy? Is there any way to kind of quantify how much that might have been if you had any, or is it even material?","David Meline","I would say, yes. Good questions, Steve, and in the past we spent a fair amount of time talking about inventory dynamics and the effect on sales. If you look at the sales through the year, pretty stable. Obviously, the low end of what we were looking for as the economy was basically downgraded through the year.","If I look at our growth performance overall as compared to the overall industrial economy, it was a little bit towards the low end of that range and I could infer from that that there was probably either neutral or some level of destocking through the year that might have affected us.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. So, no material destocking that would lead to any significant benefits on auto restock? I mean, clearly looking at some of the more OEM component guys like Kondamal or something like that sales down 15%. You guys didn't really see that?","David Meline","Not anything dramatic like that no.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Just a couple of clean-up questions. In terms of this 1 percentage point drag, and you sort of seem to have indicated that most of it comes from, a lot of it comes from the start up costs. Should we expect those to moderate throughout the year?","David Meline","Yes. I think that's fair to assume. Well, we will always have start ups. We had certainly record levels of capital investment here in 2012. As we told you, we expect our CapEx to rise in '13, and while I would say as there is ups and downs in terms of both the startup cost, so we happen to have some startups in the fourth quarter, sometimes coincidence with both the lower production requirements in seasonally in the fourth quarter. Sometimes it will take advantage of a holiday shutdown to plan around those startups. So, if I looked quarter-by-quarter, quite honestly I haven't done the deep analysis, it may be true that you see seasonally a bit more startup costs in the fourth quarter, but throughout the year we will have that type of activity certainly.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But the drag should be the highest in Q4 than Q3?","David Meline","I think that's a fair way to think about it. Yes.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And other question I have just an observation, if I look at the organic growth, it's the best since Q1 2011 and if I look at the pricing, interestingly enough it's been on a downward slope and it's now probably the weakest since Q1 of 2011. How should I think about dialing up pricing up and down to drive the organic growth? Is there a linear function here?","David Meline","I would say, not on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I think the facts we are staring at here in Q4 are a perfect example of that, which is there is not a short-term and direct correlation, i.e. we have taken up quite a significant amount of pricing earlier in the year. The decline in that is more of a function of the fact that we had a lot of earlier price adjustments which now mathematically result in the lowest price increase in Q4. If you look at the sales growth as we have talked about some specific factors around what's going on with some improvement in the base business in China as well as the consumer business. So it's a good observation. I wouldn't draw a direct cause and effect in the short-term from that.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, I should be thinking that NPVI strategy continues to be successful and you can get both in theory, topline and pricing long-term?","David Meline","We believe that's true, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Walker - Jefferies","Good morning, this is Rob Walker for Laurence. Can you provide an update on your supply chain initiative?","Inge Thulin","Yes, we continue to build that out. As you recall, we started out maybe four, five years ago. One thing that is important is for us to build what we call those super hubs where we are coming closer to the markets and the customers around the world due to the fact that, that is where we see the big growth. So, it's an ongoing process. I don't think we will ever be ready with it because even when we will be ready the market is stagnating at that point in time. But we make very, very good progress and even now in last quarter, we started a new investment in Turkey, where we are building out a good hub for both Central East Europe and Middle East Africa.","So, we will be the bridge in terms of our initiatives for that part of the world from a supply chain perspective. We have also a big initiative going on in Europe but we try to consolidate our supply chain in West Europe specifically in order to be more efficient and coordinate that in a better way. So it's an ongoing process. We are making very good progress in the process there. But there's still more to do and as I said, I think it is one of those that you will never be ready.","Robert Walker - Jefferies","Thanks and then, what are the prospects for market share gains this year across your portfolio?","David Meline","Well, our plan is aggressive in terms of what we need to do in order to take market share and specifically in developed economy. As you know, there is not much growth in the market. So we have very aggressive market share plans in that part of the world. So you should look upon it like a 50-50 base. So what we say is you need to take 50% of your growth from market share and 50% based on penetration.","And I think in most businesses, we still have a good upside relative to market share. The other thing you have to think about our business model is that we are working in different categories, right. So we have a type of consumables that is going into health care and the consumer market and some consumables that is going into manufacturing product that is used in order to help to improve productivity and efficiency. That\u2019s one piece of it. The other piece is, where we are expecting on big platforms.","So, the point is for us is growth in total. In some businesses, we can go, write it down and calculate the market share. Other thing, we create new solutions on platforms that is running for long time. But if you go in to specific on consumables, in both consumer healthcare and the industrial, we have aggressive market share plans and we still believe we can deliver on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Fleck of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Fleck - Morningstar","Hi, good morning. Thanks for staying on guys. I appreciate it.","David Meline","Morning.","Adam Fleck - Morningstar","Quick question on inventory. Your company inventory came down sequentially, of course, that's typical for the fourth quarter but it finished a little higher than we've seen in previous years. Are you comfortable at this level here or how do you think about that?","Inge Thulin","Yes. So, I would say, as you exactly observed, we typically have seasonally here, Adam, decline in inventory in Q4. If we look at our turnover metrics, they look very comparable to other years, other fourth quarter-type performance areas. We did mention that we do expect here in the near-term to have some specific areas, where we might have some further reduction in activity in the first quarter, specifically in some of the consumer electronics area, but overall I would not say there is anything fundamentally different going on.","Adam Fleck - Morningstar","Okay. Great. Thanks. That's helpful. Then shifting to Europe, kind of a bigger picture question. You mentioned that you are seeing a bottom, but the region isn't really growing out in Western Europe, and of course you are forecasting, I think a negative 3% to a positive 1% growth for this year. How do the development that you've seen that bottoming, how does that fit into your expectation? Is that kind of right in line with it or is it on the top or bottom of that?","Inge Thulin","Yes. I'm not sure exactly if I'll answer your question as you're trying to pose it, but if we look at Europe right now, we've had a couple of years now or about a-year-and-half, where we printed negative growth performance. It has moderated obviously. And as you pointed out, we are calling out a range that centers on minus 1 next year.","So, everything we can see, we are running pretty stable there, there's some ups and downs as between north and south. But overall when you look at the portfolio pretty stable, and what we've really been focusing on with the business is to make sure that we are as competitive as we can be as a company in Western Europe, so we're looking at how we can take advantage of opportunities to leverage our business across the entire region.","We are looking at areas of growth, because inevitably there are opportunities to grow in the region. And so, in areas like healthcare, we've seen some growth opportunities and then we are also looking at how we can optimize and make sure we are making a reasonable return, so we were pleased this year that we did see our margins improve despite weaker sales performance.","Adam Fleck - Morningstar","Okay, great. That's it for me. Thanks.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.","Matt Ginter","I would like to thank everybody for spending the hour.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, July 25, 2019.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","Today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings.","Please note we are reporting our results under our new business group structures starting with the second quarter. Additional business group performance details can be found in the appendix of this presentation along with our May 30th, 8-K and our Investor Relations website.","Lastly, let me remind you and mark your calendars for our third quarter earnings call which will take place on Thursday, October 24th.","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2.","During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release.","Please turn to Slide 3, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike?","Mike Roman","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am encouraged by our company\u2019s progress and performance in the second quarter, coming off a difficult to start to the year. While we continued to face slow growth conditions in key end markets, our execution was strong. We implemented our restructuring while effectively managing costs and reducing inventory levels, which I will discuss on the next slide.","Our team is building momentum going into the second half as we focused on what we control and as a result today we are affirming our guidance for the full year. At the same time, we remain focused on our four priorities for long-term value creation, portfolio, transformation, innovation and people and culture.","In the second quarter, this included our acquisition of Acelity, an excellent complement to our health care portfolio and which we expect to close in the fourth quarter.","Please turn to Slide 4. As you recall on our last earnings call, we laid out specific and aggressive actions to strengthen our performance. In the second quarter, we made significant progress with each of those actions. First, the restructuring has been finalized across the enterprise, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $148 million.","We continue to expect annual savings of $225 million to $250 million with $110 million in the remainder of this year. Beyond the restructuring, we are driving increased cash flow through several other actions. For example, we adjusted our manufacturing output and reduced inventory levels by over $250 million in the quarter. We also curtailed indirect costs by more than $80 million year-over-year.","While we are making positive strides in our operations, there is still more to do and we will remain focused on managing costs and improving productivity. As we do this, we will continue to invest in organic growth, the research and development and CapEx to deliver on our promise to innovate for our customers.","Please turn to Slide 5 for a summary of our second quarter. Organic growth companywide was minus 1% in line with our expectations. Growth was led by our Health Care business at 4% which was a good improvement versus Q1 and consumer grew 1%. We saw continued end market softness in China, automotive and electronics, which tempered growth in our other two businesses.","Growth in Safety and Industrial declined by 5%, while Transportation and Electronics was down 1%. With respect to EPS, we posted adjusted earnings of $2.20 per share, which includes a $0.21 charge for restructuring and a $0.07 benefit from a pending divestiture, which Nick will cover in his remarks.","Underlying margins were 22.2% which excludes 140 basis points of impact from the restructuring. So we are making good progress relative to our Q1 margins, up 21.4%. Importantly, we delivered this improved margin performance even while reducing production and inventory, which reflects the strength of the 3M value model.","I wanted to take this opportunity to thank our people for rising to the occasion and for executing our plans with focus and urgency. And while there is more work left to do, 3M\u2019s foundation remains strong. We have deep competitive advantages [indiscernible] advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands.","We have market leading businesses and strong relationships with our customers. Moving ahead, we are focused on investing for the future and continuing to deliver operational improvements which will enable us to better serve our customers and maximize value for all of our stakeholders. That wraps up my opening comments. I will come back to discuss our guidance after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Second quarter organic sales declined 0.9% in line with our expectations. Volumes were down 140 basis points while selling prices were up 50 basis points.","The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 10 basis points. While foreign currency translation was a 180 basis point headwind to sales. All in, second quarter sales in U.S. dollars declined 2.6% versus last year.","Looking at growth geographically, the U.S. was flat organically versus last year\u2019s 6% comparison. Last year\u2019s second quarter was boosted by increased customer demand ahead of our U.S. ERP go-live. Health Care grew mid single digits with Consumer up low single digits. Transportation and Electronics was flat while Safety and Industrial declined. Asia Pacific declined 90 basis points in Q2 with Health Care delivering positive mid single digit organic growth [indiscernible] while each organic growth in China was down 80 basis points with growth in Health Care and Transportation and Electronics, which was more than offset by declines in Safety and Industrial and Consumer.","For the year, we now expect organic growth in China to be down low to mid single digits versus a prior expectation of flat. As we continue to experience challenging end market conditions, particularly in the electronics and automotive industries.","EMEA declined 3.6% on a nearly 6% comparison in last year\u2019s second quarter. Latin America\/Canada grew 70 basis points with Brazil, Canada, and Mexico each up low single digits.","Please turn to Slide 7 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Companywide, second quarter sales were $8.2 billion with operating income of $1.7 billion. Operating margins were 20.8% which included a 140 basis point impact from our second quarter restructuring and other actions.","As anticipated, the biggest impact to Q2 operating margins was the year on year decline in organic volume along with cost absorption penalties from lower production volumes as all business groups work to reduce inventories in the quarter. These factors resulted in a 200 basis point reduction to margins versus last year\u2019s second quarter.","Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by 50 basis points primarily due to the acquisition of M*Modal. Higher selling prices continued to more than offset raw material inflation contributing 30 basis points to second quarter margins. For the year, we continue to expect selling prices to more than offset raw material costs. And finally foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 40 basis points.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter adjusted earnings were $2.20 per share. That was a bit better than we anticipated, primarily due to improved productivity along with the held for sales status related to a pending divestiture, which I will cover shortly.","Let me now cover the reconciling items to second quarter earnings. Negative organic growth along with absorption penalties from lower production and inventory levels reduced per share earnings by $0.19 [indiscernible] divestitures combined increased second quarter earnings by $0.01 per share versus last year. This result includes a $0.07 tax benefit related to the held per sales status of the pending divestitures of the gas and flame detection business that we announced in June.","Restructuring and other actions lowered Q2 earnings per share by $0.21. Our second quarter underlying tax rate was higher year on year, which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share.","And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% versus Q2 last year, which added $0.07 to per share earnings.","Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.2 billion with a free cash flow conversion rate of 110% which includes a 14 percentage point benefit from the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary.","Second quarter capital expenditures were $421 million, up $56 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion.","During the quarter, we paid $830 million in cash dividends to shareholders and returned $400 million to shareholders through growth share repurchases. We continued to expect full year repurchases to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.","Please turn to Slide 10, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business which declined 5% in the quarter. Similar to first quarter, we saw continued broad based softness and channel inventory reductions across most of the portfolio.","These factors particularly impacted our automotive aftermarket, abrasives and closure and masking systems businesses. Personal safety was up low single digits in Q2 against the double digit comparison a year ago. And roofing granules turn positive this quarter, growing low single digits organically.","Looking geographically, Safety and Industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 1% increase in Latin America\/Canada, well Asia Pacific, EMEA and the U.S. each declined. Safety and Industrial\u2019s second quarter operating margins were 22.1% with an underlying decline of approximately 200 basis points. Margins were impacted by negative organic growth, reductions in manufacturing output and inventory along with our second quarter restructuring actions.","Moving to Transportation and Electronics. Second quarter sales were down 120 basis points organically compared to last year. The electronics-related businesses were down low single digits organically with growth in display materials systems more than offset by declines in electronics materials solutions.","Our automotive OEM business was down 5% year on year impacted by a 7% decline in second quarter global car and last year strong comp. Transportation safety was up mid single digits and advanced materials continued to deliver strong organic growth up high single digits in the quarter.","Geographically, organic growth was flat in both the U.S. and Latin America\/Canada, well Asia Pacific and EMEA declined. Transportation and Electronics second quarter operating margins were 24.1%, down 240 basis points. Similar to Safety and Industrial, margins were impacted by manufacturing and inventory reductions along with a 30 basis point impact from restructuring.","Turning to Health Care, as anticipated, this business improved versus first quarter as our team delivered 3.5% organic growth in Q2. Organic growth was broad across most of our Health Care business, led by a high single digit increase in health information systems.","Medical solutions, our largest business in Health Care was up mid single digits and we continue to look forward to Acelity becoming part of this business later this year, up low single digits. ","Finally, drug delivery was down mid single digits in line with our expectations. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific and the U.S. led the way each up mid single digits. Health Care second quarter operating margins were 26.4% which included a combined 210 basis point impact from the M*Modal acquisition and restructuring.","Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was nearly 1%. Sales grew low single digits in Consumer Health Care, stationery and office and home improvement. While home care declined.","Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 2% increase in the U.S. and Latin America\/Canada, while Asia Pacific and EMEA declined. Consumers operating margins were 20.6% in the second quarter which included a 40 basis point impact from restructuring. ","That wraps up our review of second quarter results. Please turn to slide 11 and I\u2019ll hand it back over to Mike to discuss 2019 guidance. Mike?","Mike Roman","Thank you, Nick. Today, we are affirming our guidance for the full year. We expect organic growth of minus one to plus 2% along with adjusted earnings of $9.25 to $9.75 per share. Please note that this guidance does not include the pending Acelity acquisition or the pending divestiture of our gas and flame detection business. We also continue to expect a return on invested capital of 20% to 22%. And a free cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 105%. While there is uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment, we are maintaining our guidance, as we will see continued momentum from the actions we implemented in the first half. ","[Indiscernible] PFAS, specifically, PFOA and PFOS, which are the subject of a litigation we face. As CEO, there are few things that I want people to know about this issue and our company.","First, 3M voluntarily phased out of the production of PFOA and PFOS in the early 2000s and was the first company to do so. Since then, we have been committed to using our expertise and resources to improve the knowledge of PFAS, support remediation and give people confidence in their water.","3M has invested $100 million in testing water sources. We have invested another $50 million for filtration systems as these substances can be effectively removed, which 3M has been doing for more than a decade. We have entered into voluntary agreements with states and communities where we manufactured these compounds.","We have also contributed to peer-reviewed journals, backed by hundreds of studies conducted by 3M and other researchers on the potential effects of PFAS. At the same time, we are continuing to work with the EPA along with state and local governments to support thoughtful regulations and solutions based on science and facts.","We also believe that an independent scientific body should partner with regulators to review all available [indiscernible] continues to evolve. The scientific evidence does not show that PFAS caused harm to people at past or current exposure levels. More broadly speaking, being an environmentally responsible company is core to 3M. We started our groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays program more than 40 years ago and we continue to step up our leadership to address climate and environmental challenges.","Earlier this year, we committed to move our entire global operations to renewable energy. And last year alone, 3M solutions helped our customers avoid 15 million tons of emissions. Sustainability is a value that matters deeply to our people, to our customers, and to me personally. It is a point of pride for 3M and we will defend with vigor our company\u2019s reputation in the court of law and in the court of public opinion.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning guys.","Mike Roman","Good morning, Andy.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike or Nick, can you talk about the cadence of the quarter as it went on? Some industrial companies have talked about a bit of a stabilization late in Q2, did you see that at all in Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, and last quarter you said these stockings from your customers cost you something like a 100 basis points of revenue growth was similar impact in Q2 as it does look like your auto OEM business performed a bit better than the underlying market. So have you seen any signs of industrial or auto destocking this closer to ending?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Andy. Throughout the quarter, the trends were pretty stable as we saw our sales progress through each of the three months. I can\u2019t say we really discerned any positive or negative trend as the quarter progressed. If I shift it internally, we did see our momentum in terms of reducing in regards to channel inventory I said about last quarter about 100 basis points of what we impacted channel destocking.","We were again seeing channel destocking impacting us in the second quarter in particular in the SIBG business, safety and industrial business group. We think that was a very similar destocking impact to what we saw in the first quarter and as far as automotive, we were in most noticeably impacted by destocking in China and that just was not the same event in the second quarter. It was a pretty much more normal relation of auto builds to our penetration and less channel destocking going on in relation to auto.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. Nick, that\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned in the presentation that you\u2019ll save $110 million in the second half of the year $0.15. It will help to have a decent step-up in EPS in the second half even outside the benefit to make the midpoint of your guide. So how much of the step-up is in your control? Can you give us some more color on how much of your business transformation and stocking optimization initiatives can help you in the second half? I think there'll be programs in terms of savings that are continuing to ramp in second half and in 2020.","Nick Gangestad","Yes. Andy, a few things are going on. First of all, we have been progressively taking more and more inventory out of our own operations. We think some of that that\u2019s going continue into the second half of the year. So that will continue to be a headwind that we are facing in the second half of the year. We will be getting the restructuring benefits of $0.15 that we talked about as well as I\u2019ll just say overall disciplined cost management in light of what we would call a slowing economy right now.","So some of that our own discipline in execution will be impacting us in the second half. On the margin, there are some other things that will impact us. FX, which has been a neutral to a headwind in the second \u2013 in the first half of the year, that will be likely if FX rates stay where they are, that they will be coming positive to us in the second half of the year. But mainly it\u2019s just going to be improved execution over what we saw in particularly in the first quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks Nick.","Nick Gangestad","Thanks Andy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Mike Roman","Good morning, Joe.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Hey Nick. Maybe just kind of staying on the \u2013 how to think about the margins for the rest of the year, obviously, like a big headwind this quarter was the manufacturing and inventory reductions. And you guys have given some estimates for what you expect, productivity to be like this year and clearly, you are also moving ahead with indirect cost reduction. So I don't know, is the right way to think about it as you progress through the year that these things are going to offset each other? Or should we be thinking about them as a tailwind? I'm just trying to understand how to think this through.","Nick Gangestad","Joe, if I think about where we are going to end for the full year, let me just start out by saying when I look at collectively where all the sell-side analysts are in their view of the total year. My view is it looks like you collectively have it dialed in about right. What I\u2019m seeing collectively amongst all of you means it lines up very closely with our own internal view of how things will progress for the full year.","If I look at in particular in Q3, Joe, right now we are expecting organic growth in the second quarter to be somewhere between flat to a low single digit organic growth. And as far as margins, what we\u2019ve been seeing happen throughout the year and what we expect to continue to happen as we progress into Q3, Q1 to Q2, absent the restructuring actions, was a sequential improvement in margins as we focus on execution.","We think that sequential improvement going into Q3 is going to continue. So we expect our margins to be 23% or higher in the third quarter. And so what we are seeing there is some momentum building on our margin story. And so I'd say, Joe, those are the headlines to think about and how you are thinking about the second half of the year.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That\u2019s super helpful, Nick. And I guess maybe, Mike, very, very helpful, commentary earlier on PFAS. I guess just as \u2013 obviously, it's hard to assess how this all shakes out, but I\u2019d be curious to get your views on like timing on when we could think about when we\u2019ll start to get some sort of resolution, as it continues obviously to be a bit of an overhang on the shares?","Mike Roman","Yes. Joe, I wouldn't think about timing. In respect to timing, let me kind of talk about what we can say today. And it's not a lot, but it\u2019ll give you a couple of things to look at. The first trial, if there is a trial, related to the Wolverine cases in Michigan that would be at the end of first quarter. These are kind of fuzzy time lines. They're not fixed. But that's kind of the expectation when the first trials related that if there is a trial would come to us. AFFF, the MDL, the multi-district litigation, we wouldn't expect any actions on that until late 2020. So those are kind of a frame of the litigation and timing. And as we learn more \u2013 as I said in my comments, we're gaining and understanding all the time. And as we learn more, we\u2019ll update you as we go.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of Merrill Lynch, please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Mike Roman","Yes good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Just a couple of follow-up questions. Could you just walk us through core gross margins ex restructuring sequentially versus the first quarter and how should we think about progression on that side of the equation through the year? Thank you. That\u2019s the first question.","Nick Gangestad","Okay, Andrew. A little bit of this will be a repeat from what I said to Joe, but our core underlying margins\u2026","Andrew Obin","Gross margin, yes.","Nick Gangestad","Gross margin. Thank you for clarifying that Andrew. So our gross margins in the first quarter if we pull out the costs related to some litigation activity that we had in the first quarter, our core underlying gross margin was 48%. In the second quarter that went down. If I pull out the restructuring down to 47.5%, and that's being impacted, we think we estimate by a 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the second quarter by the aggressive actions we're taking and pulling out inventory in our production. So underlying operations, we're seeing good execution on what we're working there. And we expect those gross margins to continue to be impacted by us taking actions on our inventory. But we also do see our gross margins improving slightly into the third quarter.","Andrew Obin","So if we pull that out, just to clarify, if we pull that out, you're sort of recovering slowly from that 48% into sort of more historical range of 49%, 50%. That's a fair statement if you take out inventory,","Mike Roman","Andrew that's a fair statement.","Andrew Obin","And then on inventory, I assume that improved free cash flow forecast for the, I think, it's Slide 23 upon Slide 24, that's all working capital, right?","Mike Roman","Yes, we\u2019re keeping our projection of free cash flow conversion. Well I think you're actually going into a deeper slide. Improved working capital is the biggest thing impacting our free cash flow conversion and dollars for 2019.","Andrew Obin","And if you were to quantify how much incremental working capital reduction opportunities do you have for the next 12 to 18 months?","Mike Roman","I'll isolate it just to inventory, right now, Andrew, in answering that question, 250 that we took out in the second quarter, we think there's another $100 million or $200 million that we can be taken out of the second half of 2019. And then as far as 2020, it's a little early to say, but we've been targeting to get down to 85 days of inventory outstanding. That's where we're targeting to get to the end of this year. If we're going to bring that down further in 2020, I\u2019ll likely be giving that guidance later in this year or early next year.","Andrew Obin","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell ","Hi. Good morning. Thank you.","Nick Gangestad","Hey Julian.","Mike Roman","Hey Julian.","Julian Mitchell ","Hi. Maybe just focusing on Q3, so I think you talked about flat to slight organic sales growth firm wide. Maybe just help with a couple of aspects of that. One would be, does that assume further channel destocking and how severe would that be in Q3? Not your own under production efforts, but that channel destock. And then what are you assuming for the Transport and Electronics business within that, after what was a pretty good Q2?","Mike Roman","It's probably good to step back. I recognize we've been seeing, the global economies slowing as we came through second quarter, but this is a trend that we've been seeing since late last year. And I would say if you look at now third quarter as we move sequentially forward to deliver on what Nick was just talking about, it really is a stabilization of the markets that we\u2019re facing and the trends that we\u2019re seeing. And to go below that it would have to \u2013 the economies would have to degrade even further.","And if you look at channel Nick talked about what we saw in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, we think when you look at the total year as it plays out a majority of the inventory adjustments in the channel are taking place in the first half. So it will be a lesser impact even though there\u2019ll be some impact in the second half. So that plus a easier comp as you get into Q3 if you look at it with our ERP deployment last year that would all add up to that trend.","And just on your question about TBG we would see them down in the second half from where they are in \u2013 sequentially from where they are in second quarter. But in line with the market outlook that we\u2019ve talking we don\u2019t \u2013 I think early in the year people had been talking about, been hoping for a stronger recovery in automotive and electronics. But we see a more conservative view of that now with build rates down and continuing to be soft as we go into second half may be stabilizing a bit versus where they are in the second quarter, but still down. So we see sequentially down in TBG.","Julian Mitchell ","Thank you.","Nick Gangestad","Hey Julian just to add a little bit what Mike said there for Transportation and Electronics in the third quarter particularly, we expect that to be down low to mid-single digits in the third quarter. And that\u2019s in line with what we\u2019re expecting as far as guidance for the full year for Transportation and Electronics. We\u2019ve guided that we think for the full year that somewhere between flat to down 3%. And if I had to estimate right now, I'd say we're much \u2013 we\u2019re leaning more towards the low end of that range for Transportation and Electronics for the full year.","Julian Mitchell ","That's extremely helpful. Just following-up on that Nick, as you said, that's trending towards the lower end. Also I think from a regional standpoint you took down your China assumption for the year. So maybe help us understand in the context of the overall reaffirmed organic sales growth guide for 3M for 2019 which of the regions or segments that are coming in maybe at the higher end or looking a little bit brighter today than back in April?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, so healthcare as far as the guidance that we've given for the full year on that, that's when we see more likely in the high end of the range; and Transportation and Electronics more likely towards the low end; Consumer. I'd put right in the middle of the range that we've laid out. And the SIBG we see it in the range, but that also could be in this bottom half of the range. And as we guided a negative one to plus two for the full year, last quarter and as we're affirming it, there was also a sense that we had there may be some places where things come in a little weaker and we're seeing that happen and that gives us the ability to continue to maintain that guidance, going forward.","Julian Mitchell ","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning.","Nick Gangestad","Hi, Nigel.","Mike Roman","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Hi. Just want to keep kind of follow-on that one really. Just kind of think about what the all means to that minus one plus two. So, it seems like you sort of biased in towards slightly below the midpoint based on what you see today, would that be fair, Nick, sort of looking at maybe flat to up slightly for the full year?","Nick Gangestad","Yes Nigel, I mean the midpoint of that range is up 50 basis points, so flat to up 50 to a 100 basis points, like that's I think of very fair zone for where our most likely landing spot is.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that's helpful. I'm not sure I missed some of the prepared remarks. Did you quantify the impacts of inventory headwind this quarter? So that down 90 bips, what was the sell through that you saw, excluding inventory headwinds?","Nick Gangestad","Now there's, Nigel, there's two different inventory points we talked about on channel inventory contractions that last quarter in the first quarter we said it was about a 100 basis point impact to revenue. We think second quarter was something similar to that. And Mike also clarified that we think well we still have some ahead of us for channel contraction, we think the majority is behind us. In terms of within our company as we have been reducing inventories ourselves, reducing our production, we've said that \u2013 I've said that we think that impacted our margin in the second quarter by a 100 basis points to 150 basis points.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That's very clear. Thanks for the detail. And my follow-on question is really on the location and implications of some of the one time of this quarter. There was $0.07 tax gain, did that land in the tax line or was that somewhere else Nick?","And then secondly, the restructuring is 1.12 operating, 3.6 non-operating. The payback was based on $0.20 of restructuring. Is that the right way to think about it or does the payback sort of come down because some of it is non-operating and maybe just touch on the nature of that non-operating restructuring charge.","Nick Gangestad","Okay, Nigel I\u2019ll just parse out the two pieces you're asking about, the $0.07 benefit we incurred in relation to the held for sale status for our Gas Detection business, that ran through the tax line, the income tax line of our income statement. The $148 million impacting our operating expense and the balance $36 million of non-op. And that's exactly in line with what we were expecting. We were estimating approximately $150 million. The fact that some of it is hitting non-op versus operating doesn't impact at all the projected benefits we have going forward of approximately $110 million yet this year and on an annualized basis, $225 million to $250 million.","As far as where that restructuring happened, I would say geographically it happened around fairly well dispersed around 3M. And as far as business of the $112 million that was in operating expenses of that restructuring, about 75% of that was in our corporate and unallocated section, and about 25% of that was in our businesses. Now the benefit, that $110 million of benefit, that will be felt by our businesses through the second half of the year and it will be fairly proportionate to the size of each of our businesses as far as the benefits that you\u2019ll see in the second half.","Nigel Coe","Great. Thanks Nick.","Operator","Alright, next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi. Good morning guys.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Nick, just a point of clarification on the inventory de-stock that you saw externally by your customers. You said that 100 basis points in the first quarter kind of look similar in the second quarter. But auto, I think, China auto specifically got better. So within that something must have gotten worse. Where did we see that get worse?","Nick Gangestad","As far as anything that got sequentially worse versus the first quarter Josh, nothing comes out particularly strong. I think in aggregate in China we continue to see China destocking on a more broad basis. So we didn't see it in our automotive business of any significance. What we saw across our Safety and Industrial business that view Josh was very similar in terms of the total destocking impact that we were seeing of a 100 basis points both quarters.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful. And then I know it's a little early to think about 2020 but I guess thinking back with historical context for how destocking and re-stocking cycles go, should we expect to just be selling to kind of market demand as we get to the end of this? Or presumably in China there's kind of a bit of rational exuberance on both sides of the equation that as soon as things turn destock turns into restock. Has that historically been the case or should we just think about 2020 starting point as, hey, maybe we will lose some of that destocking headwinds?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Josh, maybe a couple things. If you look at the channel and I would say the value chains, customer value chains, they react to the dynamics in the end markets pretty quickly. What you saw in the destocking the first half, they were reacting quickly to the build rates and automotive electronics. We expect that to stabilize in the second half. We'll see some additional destocking because of some of the slowing that we saw in second quarter, but it'll stabilize. So really to start to think about what happens in 2020 or even late in the year, it will depend on the end market dynamics. If they recover and their demand goes up, then you would see a pretty strong turnaround in restocking. But if it stabilizes and the projections and outlooks economically are more stable in the second half, then it would be balanced as we get into the second half. And then it depends on what happens in demand as we go into 2020.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful. And then just to follow-up on business transformation and the savings associated with that. Obviously there's a lot of moving pieces in the organization right now with restructuring, and some of the demand dynamics and the internal destocking. How are you benchmarking on some of the business transformation savings and kind of non-savings related kind of other benefits that would happen throughout the organization? Is that's something where those kind of go by the wayside or harder to execute on? Just an update on how that track. ","Mike Roman","Yes we've always talked about transformation as a focus that starts and ends with a customer. But it is really making us more agile, more efficient and more competitive and that that creates value, all of those create value. And it also helped us realign the company around the four businesses, the go-to-market models of customers that we have. So it's enabling us to connect our customers even better as we move ahead. And it's a lot more than an ERP deployment. It's the entire ecosystem around that and it's digitizing our enterprise. All of that's adding efficiency.","And so we are committed to the savings that we talked about at the beginning, it\u2019s the value realization that we would have by the end of 2020. But it does help us drive productivity. It does help us become more efficient broadly. And we talked about how that starts to show up in our margins over time. It's an enabler for us to continue to create premium margins as we move ahead. So it is going to be a driver of the savings that we've talked about, but also of that efficiency that will carry us forward.","Josh Pokrzywinski","All right. Thanks guys.","Nick Gangestad","Yes thanks Josh.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Tusa","Hi, good morning.","Mike Roman ","Good morning Steve.","Nick Gangestad ","Good morning.","Steve Tusa","The $0.07 of the tax benefit, I mean my tax line was relatively in line. Was there then a kind of a higher than expected effective tax rate and does that sustain itself? And also is that a $0.07 benefits kind of now in a run rate per kind of quarter here, or is that just kind of a onetime discreet item?","Nick Gangestad ","Steve first of all, it's a \u2013 let me just describe it in a little bit of detail. The gas detection business that we own is in a position where we plan to sell it and the tax basis that we're holding that asset at is greater than the plan selling price. But it's also the book value of what we hold with that asset is below the plant's selling price. So when we sell it, we will take an operating income capital gain on that.","But from a tax perspective it will be a loss. Now I'm a bit over my skis here describing accounting nuances to you, but the accounting rules are, once you place this asset in a held for sales status if it's in a tax loss position, you take the tax benefit immediately even before the deal actually concentrates. So that $0.07 is a result of us putting it in that status. So that's not an ongoing repeating thing that will be seen.","As far as the underlying operations, no see there's not any big one thing offsetting that. There's always little nips back and forth in the tax rate. And the underlying tax rate for the full year we still think is going to be in the range of 20% to 22%.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then gain when it comes to the divestiture, you said, that still $0.20 and that's still to come and not in the guidance.","Nick Gangestad ","It's still not in the guidance.","Steve Tusa","Pre mature?","Nick Gangestad ","Yes, that's still not in the guidance.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one last one, just on the second half are you planning for kind of there's a lot of things moving around, but are you planning, is this in your mind kind of normal seasonality for you guys for the second half of the year?","Nick Gangestad ","Normal seasonality if I look at\u2026","Steve Tusa","Normal.","Nick Gangestad ","But the only thing that's abnormal is last year was a bit abnormal for us with some of our pull ahead sales into second quarter. So from a sequential basis we're not seeing this year progressing on an abnormal path. I think it'll be fairly normal.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then just one last quick one, this $0.07 it's in the tax line, correct in the models that $0.07?","Nick Gangestad ","That is correct, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Mike Roman","Hey Deane.","Nick Gangestad","Hey Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, the three problem areas that have been pressuring 3M for like more than past year auto electronics in China. So the China you called out has continued to be soft but notionally on a geographic basis is quarter it did not stand out as a particular negative. So can you comment on that and what kind of color you see across your businesses in China, in particular related to kind of the tariff and trade frictions?","Mike Roman","Yes, Dean, we do talk a lot about China auto electronics and kind of get them all together, but maybe just if you step back and look at China for 3M we continue to see strength in our healthcare business up high single digits. And so that was driving a strong growth for us. We also saw strength in our Medical Solutions business in particular. Transportation and Electronics was up low single digits in the quarter. We saw significant decline in Automotive OEM, but that was, countered offset by electronics up low single digits. We saw strong growth in our Transportation Safety business there and our Advanced Materials business. So there was some strength areas that helped trying to balance out.","As I said earlier, sequentially we see Transportation and Electronics a little softer in the second half. And so we're taking a conservative view around build rates in electronics outlook as we built our view of the second half. And that's part of impacting China. But second quarter, some strengths and a good performance against a strong comp year-over-year.","Deane Dray","That's helpful. And then on electronics, everyone wants to paint electronics all with the same brush, both product lines and geographies. But you made the comment earlier that display film was actually up and relatively strong and it was electronics material solutions that were softer. Maybe just share with us the nuances about why you would see those different dynamics within the supply chain. Maybe there's some semiconductor exposure there as well, but color would be helpful there.","Mike Roman","Yes I think that your last point is the place to start. Our electronic materials solutions business has a broader exposure in electronics, including semiconductor, fabrication, data centers, which continues to be a helpful market and growing. But it's got a little different exposure. Display materials, certainly has the consumer electronics piece. The biggest part of the revenue there is consumer electronics, but we're also moving into higher growth areas like automotive electrification and we continue to see growth there. We continue to see some good results. And I would say consumer electronics, we saw a little bit of an uptick in displayed demand in second quarter, little stronger than maybe we even expected as we started into the quarter. Some of that is you start to see a little bit of buying in anticipation of the second half season for consumer electronics. And so we saw a little bit of that starting in second quarter. And that that hits display materials more so in a much bigger impact than in electronic materials.","Deane Dray","That's helpful. And just last one is more of a comment than a question is I really appreciate the comments about PFAS, and where that stands and the level of transparency that 3M is providing here. I'm just struck by how much misinformation is on the Internet regarding the chemical. Referenced it to being a forever chemical. And the reality is there are a number of very effective ways to remediate the chemical from water. They're all proven to be effective. The question of how much you want to spend, how big is the water body and your timeframe. So the remediation on this looks like it's doable and you all are taking an appreciated approach to this. So just wanted to have that.","Mike Roman","Yes thank you Deane. And we understand the concerns people have about their water. We take the issue seriously, but we're also seeing that we can make a difference in remediation and we'll continue to be transparent and update you as we go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.","John Inch","Thanks everyone. Good morning.","Mike Roman","Good morning John.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning John.","John Inch","Nick just to clarify. So the $0.20 when you say it's not in the guide, just to be clear, the $9.25, $9.75 would not include the $0.20 of pending gain from the sale of gas and flame. Is that correct?","Mike Roman ","John that's correct. It does not include the pending gain from the sale of our gas detection business, nor does it include any impact that will come from Acelity when and if that in and when and if that closes which we expect will be later this year.","John Inch","Right. And then Nick in the P&L the other expense income line of minus $256 million versus $51 million a year ago, I'm assuming Venezuela charge of $162 million is in that. And is the delta, the $36 million of nonop restructuring kind of getting you to $58 million? And does that number run through \u2013 doesn't look like it\u2019s running for the adjusted number, but maybe you can help me with just the bridge there.","Nick Gangestad","Yes, that other, that will include the Venezuela, will also include $36 million from the restructuring actions we took that were not part of operating expense, those were the two biggest things in there.","John Inch","There's nothing else in there as consequences. And $36 million does run through, as a cost, runs through the adjusted number, is that correct?","Nick Gangestad","That is correct. That is correct.","John Inch","Okay. Are there any, just while we're on gas and flame, are there any other businesses, I guess this was part of safety, right? Was there any other businesses Mike or Nick that you're looking at that may be potential candidates for divestiture?","Mike Roman ","John, portfolio management is one of our top priorities and as you know it's been ongoing process for us. And we're actively managing this aspect of the portfolio and their fit with our value model. We've shown that when we don't have the right fit, we'll take action. But that's something ongoing process we'll keep you updated.","John Inch","I guess my question is, would \u2013 did this just come about? Or were you've been working on it for a little while, or what was the genesis of it?","Mike Roman ","This particular case, the gas detection business, when we made the acquisition of Scott Safety, this was part of our strategy at the time of acquisition. So this was we've talked about on portfolio how we think about complementing our organic priorities with acquisitions that leverage our fundamental strengths. Scott Safety was one of those, moves us into a high value space. And gas detection we identified that early that wasn't part of our strategy and now we're acting on it. ","John Inch","Got It. And then just a couple more cleanups. I think you said \u2013 maybe Nick can you just update us on your expectation for share repurchase in the second half? And then I think you raised the dividend by 6% in the first quarter. Maybe Mike, philosophically you've got a lot of \u2013 you got a few pressures on your cash call at the moment. Are you committed still to an annual dividend increase kind of looking out?","Nick Gangestad","Yes John, let me take that. First, as far as the dividend our position for many several years has been that we expected to grow, our dividend to grow in line with earnings over time. Now this particular year is with the 6% increase that's outstripping our earnings growth, but the concept of us continuing to increased earnings our dividends year-over-year, I'd say that's a philosophy and approach we continue to expect. But I would say as far as expecting a dividend increase that over time it will parallel fairly closely our earnings per share growth.","And then John remind me of the first part of the question.","John Inch","Sorry share repurchases.","Mike Roman","Share repurchase, yes.","Nick Gangestad","I've guided $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year. That would imply at most just a few hundred million in the second half of the year.","John Inch","And, I'm sorry for this last point. Obviously the earnings are going down, is the philosophy you grow dividends with earnings, but if your earnings are going down, are you just going to hold the dividend, or and then wait for the catch up? Is that kind of the implication? I'm not actually trying to hold you to a number I'm just trying to understand the philosophy.","Nick Gangestad","No, the philosophy would be over time. I would think unlikely that we would decrease full flat or decrease a dividend even if there was one year of an earnings decline. If I go back to other times in our history where we've had an earnings decline, we still have some small increases in our dividend.","John Inch","Got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning.","Mike Roman ","Good morning John.","Nick Gangestad ","Good morning John.","John Walsh","So in the prepared remarks you kind of talked about higher pricing being able to offset inflation for the full year. Just want to pull apart that price piece and just we've seen a deceleration right for the full year on an absolute basis.","Nick Gangestad ","Yes, I'll go even further John. So we've averaged about 70 basis points of price growth in the first half of the year. My best estimate for the full year is we'll be right in that range. So I wouldn't characterize it as a deceleration. I think about 70 basis points first half. I think something in the range of 70 basis points that can have is our best view on that now. And remain quite confident that it will more than outpace what we're seeing from a raw material and tariff inflation impact.","John Walsh","Got you. And then just thinking about the third quarter organic growth the flat to up low single digits that still implies that the growth on growth would decelerate because you have an easier comp in Q3 of 2018, just maybe some color that you saw exiting the quarter, June, July, anything you can kind of talk to as the trajectory seeing currently.","Nick Gangestad ","John's the biggest trajectory change that I'll say that that colors the flat to up low-single digits in the third quarter as far as versus a comp is my earlier statement that we expect Transportation and Electronics to be down low to mid-single digit. I think that will be the thing that colors why sequentially versus an easier comp it's not quite the same level of growth you would expect. When I look across the rest of our businesses your analysis you just went through, I think, is a pretty valid analysis.","John Walsh","Great, appreciate it. Thank you.","Mike Roman","Yes thanks John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. I have two quick ones. Can you just give a little bit more detail on what trends you're seeing in aerospace, it seemed a bit weaker than what we've heard from other companies.","And secondly, on PFAS or PFOS and PFOA, that litigation area, can you characterize whether the U.S. standards are tougher or easier than in Europe? And maybe just sort of help us get in front, get ahead of where the food contactor base is because I think that that's like another cloud of noise that shouldn't really be affecting you. But I think sort of people are, sort of focused on the European side there?","Mike Roman","Yes, Lawrence maybe starting with aerospace when we talked about the business we talked about Automotive and Aerospace together as one business and when you look at the divisions that we share and that we report the revenue from its together. Our aerospace business actually has shown some good growth as we come through the first half of the year. So it's smaller than our automotive business, but it's an important business for us in doing well. So I don't think we're saying anything different, in that respect. ","What I would say about, thinking about Europe versus U.S. and PFAS or PFOA, PFOS regulations, the regulations are really evolving right now. I don't think it's clear to \u2013 I don't think I can clearly compare U.S. versus other international Europe regulations it\u2019s very evolving and we're working with regulators broadly both federal and local.","Laurence Alexander","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning fellows.","Nick Gangestad","Hi, Jeff.","Mike Roman","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Hey obviously a lot of ground covered. I thought it might be interesting to just flip the script a little bit to things that look okay or a little bit better. So in particular your confidence level and consumer maybe being kind of middle of the guy, healthcare may be better. Just a couple finer points on what you see going on there what would drive that? Where are we at in kind of the drug delivery, comps, et cetera?","Mike Roman","Yes, so I would say if you look at healthcare, we talked about at a good quarter. And behind that is a strong market growth. So this was a \u2013 we\u2019re not a place where we got good market dynamics and our businesses are performing well. We had our biggest business, our Medical Solutions business, up mid single digits, we saw strength in the U.S. we saw strength in China as I talk about it.","Our food safety business was up mid-single digits, our Health Information Systems business was up high single digits. So it's pretty broad-based performance as we went through the quarter. We did see a decline in drug delivery as we expected in mid-sing digits in Q2. We\u2019re talking about how we see that stabilizing as we go through 2019 and we do see some improvements sequentially as we go into the second half in that business. So that will actually help the overall performance of the Health Care business. So second half we also have the same comparables year-over-year dynamic. We have a little easier comparable in the second half. So strong market dynamics, a portfolio performing well, broadly and I think, a strong of performance against comps in the second half.","You look at Consumer we're at 1% and as Nick's comments said, kind of the middle of the range as we look for the total year. If we look, we got good balance between our sell in and sell out. And all of our businesses in the second quarter were growing with exception of our home care business. And we see that sell out dynamic setting up a good middle of the range kind of performance in the second half against some growth in retail spending in the macro.","Jeff Sprague","Is there anything that conclude or any comp issue as it relates to that home care business? What was actually going on there?","Mike Roman","I think we saw maybe a little bit of a comp year-over-year we had some of the same go-live of the U.S. ERP deployment impacting that business. And I would say consumer is larger in the U.S. than some of our other businesses. About half of our global revenue is in the U.S. So it's a bigger footprint. So it has a slightly higher impact when you have that pull ahead, and it did impact all of those businesses in 2018.","Jeff Sprague","Alright, thank you guys.","Nick Gangestad","Yes thanks Jeff.","Mike Roman","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments","Mike Roman","To wrap up, I am encouraged by our Company's progress in the second quarter. Our execution was strong in the face of continued slow growth conditions and key end markets. As we effectively managed costs and improved our cash flow. Moving ahead and we remain focused on continuing to drive operational improvements, investing for the future and delivering for our customers and shareholders.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, April 25, 2017.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for this year's investor events. Please turn to slide 2. First, starting with earnings, our Q2 and Q3 conference calls will be held on July 25 and October 24 respectively. Next, our 2018 outlook meeting will take place on December 12. Please mark your calendars.","On slide 3 are details for our upcoming European investor meeting, which will be held on June 6 and 7 at our headquarters in Neuss, Germany. We will be posting the presentation materials on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com for those that are not able to attend the meeting in person.","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide 4. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please turn to slide 5, and I'll hand the call off to Inge.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","The 3M team delivered a strong start to 2017. We posted good growth that was positive across all geographic areas while expanding our profitability. At the same time, we increased investments across the enterprise to accelerate organic growth and improve productivity. I will take you through the first quarter highlights.","Companywide, organic local currency sales growth was 5%. Growth was led by Electronics & Energy, which grew 12% in the quarter. We have done a lot of work in this business to improve our relevance to customers and the marketplace, and those efforts are paying off.","Industrial, our largest business group, had another good quarter with 6% growth, as did Safety & Graphics, which grew 5%. Health Care grew 3% organically, and we continue to expect growth in this business to accelerate further into the year. Our Consumer business declined 1% due to ongoing channel adjustments, specifically in the office and retail space.","Companywide, we posted total sales of $7.7 billion along with earnings of $2.16 per share, up 5% year over year. Operating margins were 23%, which includes $136 million of strategic investments we made in the first quarter. Excluding those investments, our core operating margins were nearly 25%, so we are executing extremely well.","We also returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes a 6% increase in the dividend, which marks 3M's 59th consecutive year of increases. And over the last five years, we have doubled our per share dividend.","Beyond financial results, we continue to execute our three key levers, which are big value creators both today and into the future. The first if portfolio management. And in March, we announced the acquisition of Scott Safety for $2 billion. This will further strengthen our position on the fast-growing personal safety market.","The second lever is investing in innovation, and in Q1 we invested $470 million in research and development, or 6.1% of sales. This includes adding more resources in the field to bring our scientists and application engineers even closer to our customers. These investments support organic growth along with our ability to constantly deliver premium margins.","We also continue to move forward with a third lever, business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers. It is making it easier for our customers to do business with us while creating an even more ideal and efficient 3M. The backbone of business transformation is our new ERP system, and the rollout in West Europe is nearly complete. You will hear more about this at our Investor Day in Germany on June 7.","Please turn to slide 6. In addition to the three key levers, we took also other actions to prepare our enterprise for success in both the short and long term. Earlier, I mentioned the incremental $136 million of strategic investments we made in the first quarter, which include $36 million to accelerate growth in the core platforms. These growth investments will continue throughout the year, and we expect them to contribute 50 to 100 basis points of growth in 2017, which we began to see in Q1. We also took actions to strengthen the portfolio and optimize our manufacturing footprint. These actions will increase productivity and intensify our focus on larger, faster growing opportunities in the future.","In summary, the first quarter was strong for 3M. We delivered good financial results while investing for the long term.","I will now turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through the details. Nick?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 7 with a recap of our first quarter sales performance.","As Inge mentioned, we posted strong organic growth in the quarter of 4.6%, with volumes up 4.5% and selling prices up 0.1%. Divestitures of non-strategic businesses reduced sales by 0.4 percentage points, and foreign currency translation decreased sales by another 50 basis points. As a result, total first quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 3.7% versus last year.","As you can see on the right side of the slide, growth was broad-based across all geographic areas. Let me start with the U.S., where organic growth was 1.4%, led by mid-single-digit increases in both Industrial and Safety & Graphics. Our Electronics & Energy and Health Care businesses also delivered solid growth in the quarter. The Consumer business declined mid-single digits organically in Q1, impacted by channel adjustments in the office market, as Inge mentioned.","Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 10.1%. All business groups posted strong growth in the quarter, led by a double-digit increase in Electronics & Energy. We also had strong growth in Industrial, Health Care, and Consumer.","Looking at key countries within Asia-Pacific, organic growth increased 13% in both China\/Hong Kong and Japan. Excluding our Electronics businesses, China\/Hong Kong grew 12%, and Japan was up 2%.","Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 4% in Q1. West Europe was up 5% organically, with sales growth led by Industrial and Safety & Graphics. Central\/East Europe and Middle East\/Africa grew nearly 2%.","Finally, organic growth in Latin America\/Canada increased 2.3%, led by a high single-digit growth in Health Care, along with solid growth in Consumer and Safety & Graphics. At a country level, Mexico continued to deliver strong growth, at 8%. Canada was up 3%, while Brazil declined 3%.","Please turn to slide 8 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, first quarter sales were $7.7 billion, and net income increased 3.7% to $1.3 billion. GAAP operating margins were 23.1%, down 100 basis points versus last year's Q1.","Earlier, you heard Inge mention the additional $136 million of strategic investments we made in Q1 to strengthen 3M for the future, in terms of both growth and productivity. Excluding the impact of these investments, margins were up 80 basis points year over year, driven by strong organic growth and solid operational performance.","Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the first quarter. Organic growth, along with improved productivity, contributed 120 basis points to margins. Lower raw material costs, net of selling price changes, added another 50 basis points. Raw material prices remained favorable to start the year, as our global businesses again delivered savings in excess of market price changes. We expect raw material benefits to moderate as the year progresses, but still remain positive for the full year.","Turning to headwinds, foreign currency, net of hedge gains, brought margins down 40 basis points in the quarter. As previously discussed, strategic investments impacted margins by 180 basis points, and higher pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points year on year. Finally, lower year-on-year gains from divestitures reduced margins by an additional 20 basis points.","Let's now turn to slide 9 for a closer look at earnings per share. First quarter GAAP earnings increased 5.4%, to $2.16 per share. The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.22 per share to Q1 earnings. Business transformation is having a positive impact on our productivity efforts. The year-on-year impact from divestitures reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. Foreign currency, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $0.04 a share, while strategic investments were a $0.16 impact.","The first quarter tax rate was 23.7%, versus 26.8% in the comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.09 per share. The lower year-on-year tax rate was driven by favorable geographic profit mix, increased tax benefits from employee equity-based compensation, and ongoing strategic tax initiatives. In light of the first quarter performance, we now expect our 2017 full-year tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27.5%. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined nearly 2% year on year, which added $0.03 to Q1 earnings per share.","Please turn to slide 10 for a look at cash flow. We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company, which allows us to consistently invest in the business and also return cash back to shareholders. First quarter free cash flow was $701 million, down $245 million year on year, largely due to the timing of pension contributions. Full-year 2017 pension contributions are expected to remain in the range of $300 million to $500 million, similar to 2016. Free cash flow conversion was 53%, and for the full year, we continue to anticipate free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 95% to 105%. Recall that Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year.","First quarter capital expenditures were $287 million, in line with our expectations heading into the quarter. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 6%, resulting in $702 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter. We also returned $690 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. We continue to expect full-year repurchases in the range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion.","Let's now review our performance by business group, staring with Industrial on slide 11. Industrial continued its strong growth momentum from Q4, delivering first quarter sales of $2.7 billion, up 5.7% organically. Industrial's growth was broad-based, across all businesses and geographic areas.","Our automotive OEM business continued to lead sales growth within Industrial, increasing double digits organically. Growth in this business outpaced the rate of global car and light truck builds by more than 400 basis points. Advanced materials also had a strong start to the year, up high single digits. Our Heartland businesses within Industrial, abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes, and automotive aftermarket, each increased mid-single digits organically.","On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific, up high single digits, while the U.S. and EMEA increased mid-single digits.","Industrial delivered first quarter operating income of $625 million, with operating margins of 23.1%. Operating margins were down 80 basis points year on year, or up 40 basis points adjusting for a Q1 2016 divestiture gain.","As you can see, Industrial is off to a strong start to 2017. For the full year, we now expect organic growth in the range of 2% to 5% versus our prior estimate of 1% to 3%.","Please turn to slide 12. First quarter sales in Safety & Graphics were up 4.8% organically to $1.5 billion. Personal safety, another Heartland business, delivered strong organic growth in the high single digits, with particular strength in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. The roofing granules business continued to perform well in the first quarter, posting double-digit organic growth, as demand remained strong in the replacement shingle market. Geographically, Safety & Graphics grew organically in all areas, led by mid-single-digit increases in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S.","Operating income for the business group was $399 million, and operating margins increased 180 basis points to 26.1%. Adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity in this year and last, operating margins were up 80 basis points.","As with Industrial, Safety & Graphics is off to a strong start, and growth is better than we anticipated entering the year. We now expect organic growth for this business to be between 2% and 5% versus a prior estimate of 1% to 3%.","Please turn to slide 13. Our Health Care business generated first quarter sales of $1.4 billion. Organic growth was 3.1% year on year, in line with our full-year expectations of 3% to 5%. Growth was led by a double-digit increase in both drug delivery systems and food safety. Our medical consumables businesses, which represent the largest segment within Health Care, posted good growth in Q1. Oral care delivered mid-single-digit organic growth in the first quarter, a marked improvement from the second half of 2016. Our health information systems business was down low single digits organically. We expect the business to improve throughout the year.","Geographically, organic growth in Health Care was positive in all areas, led by high single-digit growth in Latin America\/Canada and Asia-Pacific. We saw notable strength in China\/Hong Kong, which was up double digits in the quarter.","Health Care's operating income was $434 million, and margins remained strong at 30.5%. Importantly, we generated these returns while investing an additional $21 million to enhance growth in core platforms across the business.","Please turn to slide 14. Electronics & Energy led our company with organic growth of 11.5% in the first quarter. Sales were $1.2 billion. The Electronics side of the business grew 18% organically, as our team successfully drove increased penetration on a number of OEM platforms. Demand strengthened across most market segments in consumer electronics, which also boosted our growth rate, and we benefited from favorable year-on-year comps. Our Energy-related businesses were up 1% organically, with low single-digit growth in electrical markets, while telecom was flat. On a geographic basis, organic growth was up double digits in Asia-Pacific, where our Electronics business is concentrated.","First quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $225 million, with margins of 18.6%, up 70 basis points. Adjusting for first quarter portfolio actions, margins were nearly 24%, up 600 basis points year on year.","As you can see, Q1 organic growth was very robust for Electronics & Energy. As a result, we are updating our full-year growth expectations for this business to a range of up 1% to 6% versus a prior range of down 3% to up 1%. The first half of the year is expected to be stronger than the second half, largely driven by year-on-year comps.","Please turn to slide 15. First quarter sales in Consumer were $1 billion, and organic growth declined 1.2% year on year. Three of our four businesses within Consumer grew organically, again led by home improvement followed by consumer health care and home care. Within the home improvement business, our Command damage-free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth, as accelerated investments continue to pay off. Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter. More than offsetting this growth was a year-on-year decline in our stationery and office supplies business, which was impacted by continued channel inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. office retail and wholesale.","Geographically, organic growth in Consumer was led by Asia-Pacific and Latin America\/Canada, which was more than offset by a decline in the U.S.","Operating income was $222 million, with operating margins of 21.3%. Looking at the full year, we expect organic growth for Consumer to be in the range of 1% to 3% versus a prior estimate of 2% to 4%. We also expect to see growth improve as the year progresses.","Please turn to slide 16. Before I turn it back to Inge, let me address a few items that we anticipate will happen over the remainder of 2017. The net impact of these items is factored into our EPS guidance today. First, as you may recall, in December we announced the divestiture of our Identity Management business within Safety & Graphics. The sale of this business, which has annual sales of approximately $205 million, is expected to close during the second quarter. Upon completion, we expect to record a gain on sale of approximately $0.55 per share, partially offset by the profit that will go with the business in 2017 after the divestiture is closed.","In addition, recall at our Investor Meeting in March 2016, we introduced a plan to better optimize our portfolio and supply chain footprint. We expect to make significant progress on that plan in 2017, with associated costs in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share over the remainder of the year. We anticipate $0.20 to $0.30 per share will incur in Q2. In total, the net impact of these items is expected to add between $0.05 and $0.10 to 2017 earnings per share. Again, this impacted is reflected in our full-year updated guidance, which Inge will now cover on slide 17.","Inge?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you, Nick.","As you have seen, our team delivered a very strong start to the year. As a result, today we are raising our full-year expectations for both organic growth and earnings per share. We now anticipate organic growth in 2017 of 2% to 5% versus a prior range of 1% to 3%.","With respect to earnings per share, we expect earnings of $8.70 to $9.05, up 7% to 11% versus a prior range of $8.45 to $8.80. Finally, we continue to expect strong performance in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion in 2017.","With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.

You said that you were going to do $0.05 to $0.10 of investments in 2017, but you did $0.16 in the quarter. A lot of that seems to be in E&E and Health Care. You mentioned the increased growth, where you expect the 50 to 100 basis points. How much did you see in the first quarter? And can you classify these moves as a lot more offensive to gain share, or maybe more defensive, in E&E especially, given that you've had some share impact from OLED for instance? So how do you characterize it all?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Andy, thanks for the question. You covered quite a few things there. Just from an overall theme standpoint, Andy, we're always looking for opportunities to enhance the value of the enterprise, and that's really part of our business model. What you see in the first quarter for incremental investments, some of that was investments we were taking to accelerate growth. And that was really lined up with what we had shared last December of the incremental $100 million over the course of 2017 to deliver accelerated growth throughout the year.","The other context I'd share with you in thinking about this step up in strategic investments, if you think back to last March at our investor meeting when we laid out our five-year plan, we shared plans for optimizing our portfolio and supply chain footprint with at that time what we described a total of between $500 million and $600 million of investments, and ultimately that we expected that by 2020 to be creating $125 million to $175 million of annualized benefit, operating income benefit. What you're seeing in this step up of accelerated strategic investments both for the quarter and for the year is us taking more action related to what we laid out last year for the optimized actions on our supply chain footprint.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it, okay. That's helpful, Nick. And then shifting gears, your guidance of 2% to 5% expected growth in Industrial, you did 5.7% in the first quarter. Comparisons do get a little harder, especially in 4Q, we know that. But your Industrial business also seems to have momentum entering the second quarter. So what do you think could slow down as the year goes on? How much of the new guidance is conservatism versus concerns around things like auto OE? Or is anything else in the investor portfolio slowing? Or is this just it's early in the year and you've seen a nice uptick in the businesses and you do expect momentum here as you go into 2Q?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Hi. Good morning, Andrew. This is Inge. What I think you should look, first of all, we see good momentum globally for the Industrial business, and you can see that also then going over to our Safety & Graphics business. So both of them are doing slightly better than we thought when we started the year. And you can see, we changed the range not only for the company but for those two businesses specifically, from 1% to 3% to 2% to 5%. It is early in the year, so we don't see at this point in time anything specifically that will slow. But I think a range of 2% to 5% is more realistic at this point in time.","And when you look upon Industrial, there was in the United States very good growth for us, and the same in West Europe. And I just came back from China two weeks ago, and you can see a slight momentum upwards there as well. So we are raising it now to 2% to 5%, and we will maybe, of course, talk more about it as we have maybe one more, two more quarters under our belts here.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Inge. Appreciate it, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So maybe staying on the growth point for a second, so clearly really strong organic growth quarter. I'm just curious. As the quarter progressed, did the things \u2013 did momentum continue to get better? Was there any particular month that was better than others? I'm just trying to understand, I guess, really in the context of the full-year guidance.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah, Joe, as the quarter went on, it was consistent strength across the quarter, all three months of the quarter. And I'd further add, we're seeing April, the start of April, tracking very much in line with what we've been seeing for the first quarter, so really no intra-quarter trend changes to note.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then I guess, maybe taking two of those businesses and talking for a second about Electronics, which had a great quarter at plus 11% and change, and the guidance for the rest of the year, and the expectation for what you expect will be the shift to OLED over the next couple quarters, and then contrasting that maybe with the Consumer business, which has been a really stable business for you guys for quite some time, and whether you think that there are maybe some structural versus cyclical pressures that you're seeing there.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Well, first of all, if we start with Electronics & Energy, as I said earlier, we have done a lot of work in that business during the last couple of years, in order to make sure that we have the right structure in place. And I think those are the things that you see, in terms of action we are making on the portfolio, some right-sizing on manufacturing, et cetera.","But what also had been going on for quite some time is our shifting of commercialization capabilities into faster-growing businesses in Electronics & Energy. And we will continue, of course, to look upon consumer electronics, utilities, construction, and semiconductor. But over time here, for the last couple of years, we have shifted more into data center, to automotive electrification, to energy grid, and communication infrastructure. So that's a move over time, and that starts to pay off.","And your comment on OLED, there is no change to what we laid out earlier in the year. But one thing that you need to understand with our \u2013 we are global. So what we see in what you call consumer electronics, we are going on big platforms for the Chinese OEMs as we speak. So I think we have a tendency to over-rely on the United States enterprises, in terms of that platform.","And as I said, came back from China two weeks ago, and the progress we are making on platforms out there on consumer electronics is just fantastic. So I will say, on that business, the things that you see in terms of actions, but there's also things that we have done, in terms of shifting our focus into faster-growing businesses. And I think we showed that at the last investor meeting, where we talked of (33:50) moving more capabilities into $12 billion market opportunity that is growing 10% to 15%. So that's the piece you see. So I'm very, very pleased, I would say, with the hard work that business had done in order to manage the cost and efficiency, and then type of shift to faster growing markets.","In terms of Consumer, Consumer had basically, this quarter, three or four division was growing. One division was down, and it's basically into United States, and it's into the office channels. When we look upon that now, for the second quarter in a row, our sale-out is 2%, but our sale-in is down. So I think it would take us a couple of more quarters in order for the inventory levels to come right in that channel. It's not a 3M issue. It's maybe an issue relative to consolidation in that channel that is pretty robust, I will say, if you follow what is going on into that channel.","And when we looked upon the growth for Consumer around the world, we had robust growth everywhere except in Central\/East Europe, Middle\/East Africa, we were down 2%. And then, as Nick said, in the United States we were down 5%, all into the office supply. But if you look upon the rest, it was very good growth. We had China\/Hong Kong 40%, Canada 5%, Latin America 2%, and total international was actually 4% growth. So let's see how long time it will take for the channel to adjust. I cannot predict that as I sit here, but probably another two quarters or so.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you for the color.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Hi, thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Good morning. I just wanted to start with the pricing side. I think core price in your EBIT margin bridge was flat in the first quarter. It was down slightly in the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about price overall for the balance of the year, versus that figure in Q1? And I noticed your U.S. pricing, at least in your revenue commentary, is still negative. Do you think that will turn up in the balance of the year?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yes, Julian, we're not fundamentally seeing any change in our pricing power. That remains strong. We do continue to look for targeted places where we can use price to help drive organic volume growth. If I look out over total 2017, we're expecting U.S. price growth to be approximately flat. If I expand it to the total globe, if I pull out the FX impact, we expect pricing to be up slightly. Our normal range is 30 to 50 basis points of core price growth. I think it will be somewhere between there and flat for total 2017.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Thank you very much. And then my second question was just around the strategic investments. I was just trying to square some of the different numbers. Is the sense that the higher operating leverage you're getting from the better organic growth, you're redeploying most of that into growth-related strategic investments, and then the majority of the gain you're getting you're redeploying into cost or COGS-related reduction efforts? Is that a fair summary, or is there something going on in the end markets that's also driving some of this stepped-up spending?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yes, of the $136 million in strategic investments in the first quarter, Julian, a little less than half of that is investments that we see having a fairly short-term return in 2017 and into early 2018. And those are primarily growth-oriented investments, and those growth-oriented investments were factored into the guidance we set out for the year. The remainder of the strategic investments, those relate to our portfolio, supply chain footprint. And that's really laid out aligned closely with the plan that we put forward a year ago in March.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Understood. So in your initial EPS bridge from December, the $0.05 to $0.10 of strategic investment headwind, that correlates fairly closely with that $0.40 to $0.45 portfolio and footprint actions you called out in today's slide 16?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","No, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Not entirely, but it's a different line is it?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yes, so in December when we laid out our guidance, EPS guidance for the year, strategic investments we had incrementally in a $0.05 to $0.10 range. That was aligned primarily \u2013 or almost exclusively with our growth investments. Now what you're seeing, we're seeing the growth investments play out exactly as we guided, still in that $0.05 to $0.10 range for the total year. What we're layering on top of that is additional footprint actions and portfolio actions that we're taking throughout 2017. So on top of the growth investments, there's roughly an incremental $0.10 of supply chain and portfolio actions that we took in the first quarter of 2017.","And then in terms of the guidance for the balance of this year, for Q2, Q3, and Q4, there's an extra $0.40 to $0.45 on top of that that was not part of our initial guidance. So all in, the growth investments, the incremental $0.10 that we took in the first quarter plus what we're expecting Q2 through Q4, it's now in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 for the total year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","That's really helpful. Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","At the risk of \u2013 yes, good morning, guys. At the risk of flogging that dead horse to death, so the timing of the accelerated investments in 1Q, is it because you saw you had a tax benefit and then therefore you decided to offset that? Does that explain the timing of the investments? And should we think of this as more of a pull forward from \u2013 you mentioned the $0.05 to $0.10 of growth investments. It sounds like all that's been made in 1Q, so this is a pull forward, Nick?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Nigel, we're always, as I said earlier, we're always looking for opportunities. The level that we were investing in Q1 in strategic investments around growth, no pull forward there. That's coming exactly as we had planned. The increased strategic investments around portfolio actions and the supply chain footprint, that's aligned with our longer-term vision. The exact timing of when we were going to do that we did not have clarity on until we started pulling the trigger on some of those actions in the first quarter and some that we expect to have happen over the next three quarters. So I'm not sure I'd characterize it as a pull forward as much as it would be now is the time that it looked like the right time for us to pull the trigger on actions that we had laid out last March.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then the revised guidance, does this bake in anything for Scott Safety, or is that still outside of the guidance? And I'm wondering if maybe the $0.40 to $0.45 of actions maybe includes the $0.10 of dilution from Scott.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","No, the $0.40 to $0.45 does not include anything for Scott Safety. At the time that closes, we will update guidance to take into account any impact that will have on our 2017 earnings.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and then just one quick one. Some companies have talked about the benefit from channel restock. I'm just wondering. What sort of intel do you have on sell-in versus sell-outs? Did you see any restocking? It looks like our checks (43:10) might have been, but any color there would be helpful.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yes, first of all, you heard Inge talked about some of the channel impacts in our office retail and wholesale channel. In addition, in our Industrial channel, we are seeing increased confidence in the channel, which we're seeing good sell-out of our product. We're seeing even stronger sell-in to the industrial channel, primarily in the U.S. So that is one place where we're attributing it to higher confidence amongst that channel and seeing what appears to be some restocking of depleted channel levels that we've seen in the past.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Deane.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I was hoping to circle back on Consumer and the stationery office commentary. This came up in the fourth quarter. And, Inge, you gave us some good color in terms of the sale-in and sale-out as the destocking going on. We can see and read about all the consolidation in this channel, but I was interested in hearing your commentary about e-commerce because that is a growing factor in these products. And how was this captured in your channel descriptions and categories? Are you calling the brick-and-mortar customers a part of your channel overall? Does that include their e-commerce? And so how does e-commerce factor into this?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yes, it does. So e-commerce is one channel of many for us. And if you think about the total enterprise, in a quarter like this, our e-channel sales is north of $200 million, and we are growing 6% in that channel generally as a total company. International actually grew 25% in e-business for the quarter. So it is an element.","And so for us, we look upon our customers in terms of one channel. Then inside of them, they have omni-channel, et cetera, which they are utilizing. And as you have seen, when you \u2013 I cannot talk about them. We have to look upon their reports. But as you see, for many of them, the \"e\" part is growing very, very fast, and it's type of slower growth in the traditional business, if you like. And that's the same for us then when we look upon our \u2013 as our output in terms of growth. But as I said, for that channel, generally speaking it is the United States at this point in time that are consolidating as a total channel. The e-channel is growing I think for most of our customers, and we are part of that.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's real helpful. And then just over on Health Care and oral care specifically, one of your key competitors was seeing destocking in this business on the consumables side. It looked like you didn't suffer from that. Is it easier comps? Have you seen the destocking trend over? And maybe you can comment on the sell-in versus sell-through.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","We did not see what you're describing here. We saw maybe a little bit more confidence actually into the channel on our products. So we took market share on the consumable part into the oral care, and I think there's momentum there. So we had 5% growth, and I think the momentum and the confidence with the retailers is very high for our products as you move forward into the year. So I think it's a combination of us taking market share and also the retailer, as Nick said, for Industrial specifically, we have good confidence as we move into the year and maybe build a little bit of inventory, but it's not the majority of the growth.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful, thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","A couple loose ends here. First just on Electronics, you actually raised the range, particularly a wider range with one quarter in your pocket already. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on what the big swing factors are as you think about how the rest of the year plays out for you specifically.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","First of all, I think the positive is that we changed the guidance north. We extended the range a little bit, and that's based on, I would say, very positive outlook that we have as we move in on some of the platforms, specifically out in Asia. And as I said earlier, we have worked for quite some time relative to our commercialization capabilities into market segments that are growing faster. And I talked about data center. I talked about automotive electrification and energy grids and communication infrastructure. That is starting to pay off.","So I will say that it looked positive, but it's still early. But as you see, we go rather 1% to 6% than 1% to 5%. This may be indicating the positive signs that we see in that business in terms of growth. And of course, margins have improved dramatically the last couple of years. And as you see again, this quarter we took some actions that we could do and still deliver very, very good margins for that business.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Are there some specific OEM wins that really drive how this plays out that you don't have visibility on yet, or is it just an end market demand question?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","No, there are also wins, and that will of course especially now and the sales will come later. But as I said earlier, I think we have a tendency to think about 3M as a U.S. company. We are a global company. So we work on platforms all over the world. And as you know, out in Asia there are very big movements coming from the Chinese OEMs relative to this space. And they're all spec'ing in our products as they move ahead.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just a couple quick cleanups for Nick, if I could. Nick, on tax, have you solved your 2017 tax rate down to what you think your ongoing sustainable tax rate is going to be, or do we have more downside as we look forward?","And also just on the $136 million of spend, where was it precisely? I think $21 million in Health Care and maybe it was $70 million to $75 million in E&E. Is that right? Where was the rest of it? Thank you.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Jeff, to your first question on the tax rate for what we're now seeing for total 2017, there are a few dynamics going on. First of all, we are seeing a favorable geographic profit mix for us that is helping us in our tax rate. It's been a headwind for us the last couple years, and that's switching over to a tailwind for us this year. We're also seeing some of the benefits, as you'd expect, from some of our tax planning. But one of the more significant items just in the first quarter is the benefit we're getting from the accounting standard change that came into effect last year for the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. From a year-on-year basis, that's about a $0.04 benefit versus what we had a year ago.","And, Jeff, I'd say that's the wildcard. Other things are going very much as we had planned, to get to the 27% tax rate by 2020. But with the added variability from what happens with this excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, there will be some quarters that's a benefit, and some quarters we won't see any benefit at all. All in, we're well on track for hitting the 27% in 2020, possibly even lower than that. But when we have better clarity on that, we'll give a revised number of, can that go even lower than the 27%.","To the second point on the strategic investments, the $136 million, of the growth-related investments, you're correct. Health Care had the majority of that. There were small amounts, single digits of millions of dollars, low to mid-single digits in millions of dollars, in the other four business groups. And then, from a portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization, the vast majority of that is impacting the Electronics & Energy business, with a little of that hitting the consumer and office business, the Consumer business group.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Can you hear me?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yes.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yes.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. So this is more of a longer-term question. Obviously, listen, you're a global company, you've been making investments with the perspective of a multi-year view, which is obviously wise and prudent, but you are dealing with geopolitical headwinds, across-the-border volatility. How do you think about the investments you've made, particularly in global excellence, particularly in the Eurozone? If we see an increased risk of a breakup there, is there actions you're going to have to take? How are you going to react to some of these black swans with respect to perhaps increased nationalism?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","First of all, as you know, we have done business in international for many, many years, so we have a good understanding of the ins and outs relative to different parts of the world. And I will say that the way that 3M emerged and developed itself over years have been country by country, and starting with a sales office, then becoming a subsidiary, adding in technical capabilities and then manufacturing, et cetera. And I think, the last 10 years or so, we have start more to regionalize and be more efficient, specifically around supply chain and manufacturing, where we still have continued to execute commercially in every country because, as you know, this is \u2013 in most cases, different languages and in some cases, different currency.","I don't think there will be much of a change as we move forward, to be honest, and if so, we have to adjust to that. So I think we have had experiences in the past where we need to change the business model geographically, based on what is happening in that specific area from time to time. And we can go back as early 1990s where the European Union was formed, and the way we changed the structure at that point in time, in order to serve the European market with free goods flowing, people able to move in-between countries, and there will be one currency for all countries in Europe. Now, that didn't really play out the way that that was laid out and that was figured out, not last year, not two years ago. That was figured out 10 years ago. And we adjusted again to that, and have been successful ever since in those geographical areas.","So, it's difficult to talk about specifics here today, because we don't know what will happen, but I can guarantee you one thing, that we are diverse enough in our management, and we have experience enough, both in United States and overseas, in order to adjust our business model at any point in time in order to serve our customers.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Just as a follow-up to that, I think one thing about the ERP investment, the global excellence investments, is ultimately looking at SKU rationalization around the company. But if you have this countercyclical trend of increased nationalism and perhaps higher trade barriers and less regionalization, doesn't that cap the upside from SKU rationalization?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Not necessarily. I think that the business transformation we put in place will serve us very well for the future, despite what will happen in terms of things in Asia and Europe, et cetera. I think we will see \u2013 people are rational relative to growth. So people will understand and see that fewer distribution centers are better because, by definition, you can serve the customers in a more efficient way, to a lower cost. So reality is, when everything is \u2013 all cards is putting down in place, people understand that is the most effective way to do business, and it will enhance growth of the economies around the world and Europe specifically, as you talk about it.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Just a last follow-up. Has there been any change in your outlook, in terms of CapEx or investment, with respect to automation in your facilities for the last 18 to 24 months?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Rob, as far as the automation portion of our CapEx spending, a year ago at our investor meeting, we laid out that we expected that to be a noticeable part of our CapEx investments. What we're seeing is, that's playing out exactly as we laid out a year ago, that we're seeing continued opportunities for automation investments within our CapEx plans. And I wouldn't call it an uptick, but I'd say it's playing out exactly as we laid out.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Inge, I can't remember a time where we had 5% core growth in Western Europe, and I'm trying to figure out whether this is just a weak euro and most of that is just export markets. Or is it really broad-based, both internal consumption plus export, given your experience in running Europe for so many years? Maybe you can give us a little bit of color around what you see in Europe, and what you think the outlook is for the rest of the year more specifically?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","So first of all, it was broad-based, where we saw \u2013 if you first talk about business groups, all business groups, except one, had growth of \u2013 we had one that grew 5%, which was Industrial, so you have 5% in Industrial for the whole of West Europe. You have 6% for Safety & Graphics. You take those two businesses together, which is into the industrial sector very much, we'll say, you looked upon 5% to 6% there, and it was broad-based. Electronic was up to 7%, and then it was slow in Health Care and Consumer. In fact, Consumer, that is a very small business for us in Europe, was actually flat. So you look upon that, it was broad-based, with growth of I will say 4% to 6% in the most important business for us.","There was no big change on the country side, but you can see countries that have been slow in the past like Spain \u2013 it will now be called Iberia \u2013 are coming up, but that's very much due to comparison for them. But I will say there's positive momentum, driven very much out from Germany, I will say, and that's broad-based and it's of course starting in Industrial and Safety & Graphics. So it was very good and it was not one-time shot as I see it.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, so there's some sustainability to it?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yes.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So I know there's been a half dozen questions on this, but I'm not sure I got the answer or the answer was clear. If core growth positively surprises \u2013 I think you're being reasonably conservative the rest of the year. Will your growth investments need to accelerate from these levels, or are these new levels that you've stated the new line in the sand for 2017?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Scott, the increase in the strategic investments from what we originally guided is really around supply chain and portfolio optimization and much less around growth. If we see growth even higher than what we're currently expecting, could our growth investments tick up some? I think the short answer is yes. It could tick up some, but I don't think on a material basis. I think we're now talking single digits of pennies at that point.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","As you remember, Scott, we laid out for the year, actually I think it was $100 million to $105 million in those investments that we call core surge, core platforms. And $36 million was there the first quarter, and we started already last year to load into those opportunities. And we see the result coming, so that's the positive thing.","So the growth coming this quarter, I will say that there's been a lot of work there that is in my view both the microscope and a telescope. The microscope is to make the investment and get growth going. And then you saw some of that investment we did in strategic investment is a type of a telescope. This will create very good value for 3M and for the shareholders as we go ahead. So if you think about what we did here this quarter, I think if you look upon it as a playbook, this is right what you would like to do in order to build both short term that most of us are focused on, but also for the mid to long term for shareholders for 3M. So I think it was the right thing to do.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, good color. Thank you, guys, and good luck.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Steve.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Good morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you just remind us what exactly when you talk about supply chain rationalization, what exactly that is? Is this just a fancy way to talk about restructuring? Or just remind us in I guess the most brief way, since we're coming to the end of the call, what exactly some of those actions are.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Steve, thanks for the question. Part of what we talked about a little over a year ago at our outlook meeting, for the five-year outlook meeting, is the number of manufacturing sites we have around the world and looking at the productivity in those sites and the opportunity we have through rationalizing the number of those sites, increasing capital into some of our more productive sites, the opportunity to reduce the total footprint of our manufacturing and supply chain sites over the course of the next four years. So that's what we mean when we talk about it when we laid out a $500 million to $600 million investment that we expect to take, the resulting productivity from that, that by the time we get to 2020 we think that will add another $125 million to $175 million of added operating income through that productivity we can get through rationalizing our supply chain footprint.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right, okay. That makes a ton of sense, and one last question just on price\/cost. Outside of Electronics, was there anywhere where price was negative? I know it was 0.1% or whatever, so there probably \u2013 maybe outside of Electronics it wasn't. I'm not sure. Just maybe a little bit of color on where, if there is any, there was price pressure outside of Electronics.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","If I look at this globally, Steve, we had positive though very small price in all businesses except for Health Care, where we were flat.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys, just two very quick ones. First on the restructuring costs in Q2, any segments in particular where margins would be noticeably distorted?","And secondly, as you think about the cadence from 2017 to 2018, do you now think your growth investments and restructuring costs will be flat year over year, or do you think they'll be a bit of a tailwind into 2018?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Laurence, to the first question on business, and I'll go further in geography, we expect that this action that we're taking in the second quarter and in the third and fourth quarter will impact all businesses and all geographies, that it will be broad. As far as the specific details of each business, we're still working through those details. We're not ready to be sharing that yet, Laurence.","And then as far as 2017 to 2018, some of these actions will have a tail into 2018, where there will be residual cost impacts hitting us in 2018, though I expect it will not \u2013 I very much expect it will be a decline from the level that we're projecting now for 2017.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over Inge Thulin for some closing comments.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you. To wrap up, this was a very strong quarter for 3M in terms of healthy broad-based growth, increased earnings per share, and good execution across each of our business groups and functions.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, July 25, 2017.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our future investor events. Please turn to slide 2. First, starting with earnings, our Q3 earnings conference call will be held on October 24, the Q4 call will be next year on January 25. And lastly, our 2018 outlook meeting will take place on December 12. Please mark your calendars.","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please turn to slide 4, and I'll hand the call off to Inge.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","For 3M the second quarter was marked by strong organic growth of 4% with positive growth across all five business groups. At the same time, we took a number of actions to better position our enterprise for success in both the short and long-term. This includes accelerated strategic investments to support growth and strengthening our portfolio along with M&A.","I will now take you through some of the numbers. As I mentioned, organic growth across the company was 4% led by Electronics and Energy at 8%. Industrial, and Safety and Graphics continued to grow well posting organic growth of 4% and 3% respectively. Health Care also grew 3% and it was good to see our Consumer business turn positive with 1% organic growth.","Company-wide total sales in U.S. dollars were $7.8 billion, up 2% year-on-year. We delivered earnings of $2.58 per share along with margins of 28%. Note that these results include impacts from both M&A and strategic investments, which Nick will cover in more detail. Excluding those impacts, core operating margins remained strong at more than 24%.","Turning to free cash flow, we posted a good conversion rate of 85% in the second quarter. Our healthy cash flow enabled us to invest in enterprise by also returning significant cash to our shareholders. And in the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","That concludes my opening remarks and I will now turn the call over to Nick who will take us through more of the numbers. Nick?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 5.","As Inge mentioned, GAAP earnings for the quarter were $2.58 per share. Since we had several moving parts this quarter, I thought I would take a moment to cover each item to make our underlying second quarter performance as clear as possible.","As Inge mentioned, we continue to execute our plans in Q2 to strengthen the company for the future. During the quarter, we made incremental strategic investments of $178 million; $39 million was growth related and $139 million related to portfolio and footprint actions. For the second half of the year, we anticipate another $0.20 to $0.25 per share impact from incremental strategic investments, largely footprint related.","These actions drive greater productivity from our manufacturing and supply chain base and will improve our service to our customers. Looking ahead, we expect footprint actions to be, at a minimum, an expense of $0.10 per share in 2018. This expectation includes benefits from actions implemented in 2017.","In addition, we had divestiture related activity in the quarter which added $0.57 to GAAP earnings per share, of which $0.54 relates to the identity management business. Taking into account these items, underlying earnings were $2.25 per share, up 8.2% year-on-year.","Please turn to slide 6 for a recap of our quarterly sales performance. We posted good organic growth in the quarter of 3.5%, with volumes up a solid 3.8%. Selling prices were down 30 basis points year-on-year due to a couple of factors. Strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price, and we saw less price growth in Latin America as currencies were more stable versus the U.S. dollar. We continued to actively manage the portfolio in Q2 and divested some non-strategic businesses which reduced sales by 100 basis points. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by another 60 basis points. All in, second quarter sales, in U.S. dollars, increased 1.9% versus last year.","In the U.S., organic growth was 1.9%, led by a mid-single digit increase in Industrial. Our Health Care and Safety and Graphics businesses delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter. The Consumer business was down 1% organically in the U.S. in Q2, impacted by continued channel adjustments in the office market.","Asia Pacific led the company with organic growth of 10% in Q2. All business groups within APAC posted strong growth in the quarter, including a double-digit increase in Electronics and Energy and high single-digit growth in each of our other four business groups. Organic growth was 17% in China\/Hong Kong and 8% in Japan. Excluding our electronics related businesses, China\/Hong Kong grew 12% and Japan was up 4%.","Moving to EMEA, organic growth declined 2% in Q2, with a similar result in West Europe. This area experienced fewer billing days versus last year due to the timing of the Easter holiday. Through the first half of the year, EMEA grew 1% organically, led by our Safety and Graphics and Industrial businesses.","Finally, Q2 organic growth in Latin America\/Canada was 4%, with all businesses posting positive growth. Health Care led the way, up high single-digits and Consumer grew mid-single digits. At a country level, Mexico continued to deliver strong organic growth at 8%. Brazil was up 6% while Canada grew 3%. We continue to generate broad-based growth across the globe, giving us confidence in our full-year expectations, which Inge will discuss later.","Please turn to slide 7 for the second quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide second quarter sales were $7.8 billion with net income of $1.6 billion, up 23%. On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margins were 28%, or 24.3% year-over-year excluding the previously mentioned impact from incremental strategic investments and divestitures.","Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the second quarter. Gains from organic volume growth and productivity contributed 60 basis points to operating margins. Lower raw material costs net of selling price changes added another 10 basis points. Foreign currency net of hedge gains brought margins down 50 basis points in the quarter, while higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points.","Finally, incremental strategic investments reduced margins by 2.3 percentage points and divestiture related activity benefited margins by 6 percentage points.","Let's now turn to slide eight for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter GAAP earnings were $2.58 per share, including a net earnings benefit of $0.33 per share from the combined impact of gains on divestitures which were partially offset by incremental strategic investments and non-repeating lost operating earnings. Excluding these items, our operating EPS was $2.25, up 8.2% year-on-year. The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.08 per share to Q2 earnings.","Business transformation continues to have a positive impact on our productivity efforts. Foreign currency, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $0.05 a share. Our Q2 tax rate was 26% versus 29.6% in the prior year, which increased earnings by $0.12 per share. The lower tax rate was driven by favorable geographic profit mix, our supply chain centers of expertise, and ongoing strategic tax initiatives. For the first half of the year, our tax rate was 25%. We now expect the full-year tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27% versus a prior range of 26% to 27.5%.","Finally, lower shares outstanding and higher interest expense together had a net $0.02 positive impact to EPS.","Please turn to slide 9 for a look at cash flow. We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company, which allows us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.3 billion, up $378 million year-on-year. Free cash flow conversion was 85% in the quarter. And for the full year, we now anticipate free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 95% to 100%, versus 95% to 105% previously. The adjustment to the high end of the range is primarily due to the gain on sale of identity management.","Second quarter capital expenditures were $302 million, and for the full year we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.","During the quarter, we paid $701 million in cash dividends to shareholders and also returned $494 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. In the first half of the year, we repurchased $1.2 billion in stock and now expect full-year repurchases to be in the range of $2 billion to $3.5 billion versus $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion previously.","Let's now review our performance by business group. Please turn to slide 10. Industrial, our largest business group, continued its strong growth delivering second quarter sales of $2.7 billion, up 3.8% organically. Industrial's growth was once again broad-based across all geographic areas and nearly all businesses. Advanced materials led the way with low double-digit growth in the quarter. The automotive and aerospace solutions business grew mid-single digits in the quarter as we continue to grow the market.","Our Heartland businesses within Industrial, all posted positive organic growth in the quarter. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew mid-single digits, and abrasives and automotive aftermarket, each grew low single digits.","On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia Pacific and the U.S. Industrial delivered second quarter operating income of $523 million with an operating margin of 19.2%. Adjusting for incremental strategic investments, operating margins were 21.5%, down nearly 200 basis points year-on-year. Half of the decline was due to foreign currency with the remainder from mix and select pricing actions to drive volume growth. Looking ahead, we expect operating leverage in the business to improve in the second half of the year.","Please turn to slide 11. Second quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.5 billion with organic growth of 3.2%. Organic growth was led by our personal safety business which again delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter. We continue to experience strong demand for our personal safety solutions across the world with particular strength in Asia Pacific, up double digits, followed by high single-digit growth in the U.S.","In transportation safety, we continue to take actions to improve the portfolio. In Q2 we finalized the sale of the identity management and tolling businesses and announced the exit of electronic monitoring. For almost 80 years, 3M has pioneered industry-leading solutions to improve road safety and mobility. We continue to focus on the rapidly changing trends in transportation safety and mobility including the connected roadways of the future.","Finally, Q2 organic growth in our commercial solutions business was flat while the roofing granules business declined, primarily due to tough year-on-year comps. Geographically, Safety and Graphics grew organically in all areas led by a 9% increase in Asia Pacific. Second quarter profits in Safety and Graphics more than doubled year-on-year to $852 million, boosted by divestiture gain. Adjusting for these items and strategic investments year-on-year, operating margins were 27.1%.","Please turn to slide 12. Our Health Care business generated second quarter sales of $1.4 billion. Organic growth was 2.5% year-on-year. Organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in drug delivery systems followed by food safety which was up high single-digits. Our medical consumables businesses which represent the largest segment within Health Care, posted 3% organic growth in Q2.","Health Information Systems was flat year-on-year and delivered sequential improvement. Looking ahead, we expect organic growth to improve in this business throughout the balance of the year as our contract pipeline continues to build. Oral care was flat in Q2 with the first half of the year up 2%.","Geographically, Health Care was led by high single-digit organic growth in both Asia Pacific and Latin America\/Canada. The U.S. grew 3% and EMEA declined mid-single digits. We saw a notable strength in China\/Hong Kong and Latin America which were both up double digits in the quarter. Health Care's operating income was $412 million and operating margins were 28.6%. Adjusting for strategic investments year-on-year, operating margins were 30.6%.","Please turn to slide 13. Electronics and Energy continued to lead our company with second quarter organic growth of 8.4%, resulting in sales of $1.2 billion. The electronics side of the business grew 15% organically, as our team continued to drive increased penetration on many OEM platforms. For example, our Novec specialty fluid grew high teens as we continue to see strong demand for its many applications. Demand strengthened across most market segments in consumer electronics and we continue to benefit from favorable year-on-year comps. Our energy related businesses were down 3% organically with electrical flat while telecom declined.","On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in Asia Pacific which is where our electronics business is concentrated. Latin America\/Canada grew slightly, U.S. was flat while EMEA declined.","Second quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $301 million with operating margins of 24.8%. As you can see, Q2 was another strong quarter for our Electronics and Energy business.","Please turn to slide 14. Second quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with organic growth of 0.7% which was an improvement versus recent quarters. We continue to see positive organic growth in three of our four consumer businesses namely home improvement, home care, and consumer health care.","As expected, our stationery and office supplies business was again impacted by channel inventory reductions in the U.S. office retail and wholesale channels, although these growth headwinds were lower in Q2 versus Q1.","We expect to see these channel adjustments continue, but to have less of an impact in the back half of the year. We are seeing a good return on accelerated investments in some of our key category defining brands. For example, our Command damage-free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth and we also delivered good growth in Scotch-Brite cleaning products. Geographically, organic growth in Consumer was led by Asia Pacific and Latin America\/Canada, both up high single-digits. This growth was partially offset by declines in the U.S. and EMEA.","Finally, operating income was $195 million with an operating margin of 17.2%. Adjusting for strategic investments year-on-year, operating margins were 22.2%.","Please turn to slide 15 and I will now turn the call back over Inge. Inge?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you, Nick.","As I look upon the first six months of the year, I'm pleased with the performance from our global team. We are successfully executing the 3M playbook while delivering strong growth and premium returns.","On the left hand side of this chart, you see the first half numbers. Robust earnings of $4.74 per share. Organic growth of 4%, margins of more than 25%, up 130 basis points year-on-year or up 40 basis points excluding the impact of M&A and strategic investments, and a free cash flow conversion rate of 70%.","Equally important, we were active in taking action to strengthen 3M today and into the future. As you heard Nick discussed, we accelerated strategic investments in the first half which include an incremental $75 million to support growth in core platforms. This growth investments will continue throughout the year and they will contribute 50 basis points to 100 basis points of growth in 2017.","We also invested another $239 million in the first half to optimize our portfolio and manufacturing footprint. This is part of the five-year plan we laid out in March of 2016 at our investor day in St. Paul, and we are making good progress executing that plan.","These investments are important to strengthen the long-term competitiveness of our enterprise. Beyond strategic investment, we also continue to make good progress on our three key levers. The first is portfolio management and in March we announced the acquisition of Scott Safety which should close in the second half of this year. This acquisition will complement organic growth and further improve our position in the fast-growing personal safety market.","In the first half, we also finalized three divestitures and announced another one. Ultimately, selling the businesses will allow us to focus on our biggest and best opportunities and create the greatest value for our shareholders.","Investing in innovation is the second lever. In the first half, we invested $944 million in research and development or 6% of sales. These investments support organic growth while enabling us to deliver premium margins and return on invested capital.","The third lever is business transformation which starts and ends with our customers. At our Investor Day last month in Neuss, Germany, many of you saw the good progress we are making with the rollout of the ERP system in West Europe. Our business transformation plan is on track and I remain confident going forward.","In summary, our team delivered a strong first half performance. We're executing our strategies, building for the future and posting a good financial performance. As a result, today we are raising the bottom end of our full-year guidance for both earnings per share and organic growth which you will see on slide 16.","With respect to EPS, we now anticipate earnings of $8.80 to $9.05 per share, up 8% to 11% versus last year, against the prior range of $8.70 to $9.05.","Organic growth is estimated to be 3% to 5%, up from the previous range of 2% to 5%. And as you can see, we continue to expect strong results in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion for the full year.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Andy.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Nick, can you give us more color on what's going on with your ability to price? You mentioned the electronics pricing impact in APAC, the U.S. pricing continues to drift down. You did preview price versus raw as getting less positive as the year went on and it did stay positive during the quarter, but could you talk about your confidence that it will stay positive as the year continues? And then the negative pricing, you're seeing more choice and a market share gain for you or is it simply more competition?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah, Andy, in the case of pricing both for the quarter and for the year, we're not \u2013 if I think about 3M's business model, where we take technology, use that to create value for the customers, that ultimately creates our fundamental pricing power. That hasn't changed. That remains strong. For the second quarter, we saw price down 30 basis points and as you mentioned we saw it down approximately 40 basis points in the U.S.","On a global basis, what we're seeing, Andy, is two main things that have changed from first quarter are strong growth in electronics which was much more of a price down that the other businesses that we saw that strong volume growth there contributed to more negative price growth in Asia Pacific. And then in Latin America, where we often see price growth often driven by a weakening currencies against the U.S. dollar, we saw much more stable currencies there versus the U.S. dollar, so some of the corresponding price growth we see didn't materialize.","The core price growth and this gets into what we saw in the United States. Core price growth, we traditionally see somewhere between 30 basis points and 50 basis points of core price growth. In the U.S., we see ourselves now tracking to the low end of what we've been expecting for price growth. We expect it to be closer to flat for the total year in the U.S. And we are taking in some markets selected price adjustments to gain market share, to accelerate volume growth. Some examples are our Industrial business and our Consumer business.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, Nick. That's helpful. And then, Inge, can you give us a little more color on what's going on in your Health Care business? You've talked about seeing an acceleration in that business? Health Care also seems like the biggest target for your growth investments that are supposed to boost growth in that segment this year, yet you did see some deceleration in the quarter. Obviously, the deceleration looks oral care related, maybe that's shift Easter, but your growth investments, are they having their intended effect and could you still see some acceleration in that business in the second half here?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yes, we will see acceleration of that business in the second half. And it is a very strong business for us. And you're right, we have made investment now for quite some time and in fact in Q2 we peaked that investment moving forward. So we see a couple of things happening for us. The accelerated investment for growth is now in a way hitting the peak for us, and you will see some of the business is really picking up in the second part of the year. And we have some easier comparison as well.","So you comment on oral care and, as you'll recall, all will recall, we had a very strong first quarter, almost 5% growth, second quarter was flat. And I think when you look upon that there is of course an impact, as we talked about billing days and selling days in West Europe due to Easter specifically. But I also think you saw in the United States end-user demand was down in the second quarter due to the reduction of restorative procedures. So I think, if you take those together, the growth for oral care after the first two quarter is 2%. So clearly, we are continuing to grow and we take market share. So I'm not overly concerned about that shift in between Q1 and Q2 for that business. And Health Care will do very well as we move ahead into the second part of the year. So we're on plan and it look good for us.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Inge.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. I'd like to pick up on the price theme just for a second. I think you have to go back to 2008 to see net price negative. And I guess I'm curious to know, are you guys \u2013 are you cutting price because your products are too expensive? Or because competitors have cut price? Or the underlying markets are changing out from under you? Maybe a little more color as to what's the context and nature of these adjustments? And in theory price cuts just don't happen on a one-time basis, there's a certain degree of perpetualness to it, right? Maybe you could help frame the durational context in your minds.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah, John, you know as well as I do, it's a competitive world. We're constantly working to, how can we gain the market share that we think our products should be having? In this kind of competitive world, we keep looking for \u2013 where are there opportunities where price could have been a barrier for us taking market share? And in a couple of businesses I mentioned, Industrial and Consumer as well as Electronics in Asia, we look for where there are those opportunities. Partly how I think about this, John, we're also through our investments to accelerate growth as we're investing more dollars to commercialize many of our existing product lines. In some of those cases we looked at where are there opportunities where price \u2013 our current price position could be a barrier to us reaching the maximum market share potential that we felt we could attain. And we're making those selected adjustments.","I do think we are at probably the peak of the price declines that we've taken to do that. I don't see much further downward pressure from the momentum we've had. And if anything, I see the second half of the year with some uptick in that pricing.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So if I read between what you're saying, it sounds like you're saying that as you're looking at sort of strategy in the future, you said, hey, certain product lines in these categories are going to face upward limits if we don't actually adjust prices lower. So in other words, competitors weren't putting pressure on you, although maybe that happened thoughtfully (34:22), but this is very much 3M driving the strategic pricing, is that fair?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah, John, I think the fair way to characterize it is, these are 3M decisions we're making not responses we're making in the market. These are 3M driven actions.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Understood. And then next, just the decline in share repurchase for the year kind of at the midpoint, what exactly are you signaling if anything? And maybe you could remind us what exactly is your dividend policy? Your stock's done incredibly well, but now your yield is kind of \u2013 it's bordering on below-average. I mean, is it a payout formula? Or is it a yield function? Or maybe you could just remind us again please.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","I'll talk broadly on returning cash to shareholders and then go into specifically what you're asking on the dividend, and the share repurchases. So you know for us, John, returning cash to shareholders is a priority and we do it both through dividends and we do it through share repurchases. On the dividend front, we've reached a point where we think our dividend payout ratio is in the zone that we want it to be, and future increases in our dividend over time, we expect to be very similar to what we anticipate for earnings per share growth. So in the coming years, we expect our dividend to grow in line with earnings over time.","On the share repurchase front, that's more dynamic for us, and you've probably heard me say this before, we have a two-fold strategy there. We do maintain a consistent presence in the market with a base level of repurchases, and then we augment that with opportunistic buyback based on relative value. We continually assess the market valuation through our own analysis, comparing it to how the stock is trading, and over time, we've found that to be a good risk-adjusted basis to be creating value.","Now, in the case of lower purchases, both for the quarter and for the year, we adjusted the full-year range down based on where we stand through the first half of the year. The market has been strong and we're exercising discipline. And we anticipate that there will continue to be opportunities in the future to effectively deploy capital to maximize those returns.","I would also add that our allocation of capital to share buyback is also influenced by other demands on capital such as M&A.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So in other words, Nick, is the money you're going to save from share repo this year, is that sort of earmarked for something else? Or is it kind of a wait and see then?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","There's a bit of a wait and see on that, John, that we still plan to be putting significant capital into share repurchases. We have announced our planned acquisition of Scott Safety, which we anticipate to happen in the second half of the year. But as you know, this type of market, there can be dynamics, so we are keeping our options open for the second half of the year.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yes, we'd like to have flexibility, John, as we move ahead.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely, makes sense. Thank you very much.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. In terms of the strategic investments, you have spoken a lot about it on the call and it's been consistent with kind of your contemplation through the first half of the year. Could you talk about specifically what kind of returns you're looking for on these investments, whether paybacks or ROI? And talk about are the nature of the investments truly growth investments or there's some restructuring involved as well in certain areas where perhaps demand is not what you're thinking it is?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Rob, you can think of our growth investments this year in two big components. One is our investments in growth, and that's the minority part of the investment and it's aligned with what we originally guided back in December about an incremental $100 million that we anticipate to be spending in growth investments. There's a number of core product platforms we have that we're investing in commercialization dollars in some cases that can be advertising, merchandising, in some cases it can be people involved in adding people in the actual selling process of our products.","And we anticipate that that will add 50 basis points to 100 basis points to our growth for the total year, and that's factored into our guidance now. And through the first half of the year, Rob, we're seeing our growth and our expenditures on that front tracking very much in line. But that's the minority of our total strategic investments.","The more significant thing on strategic investments for us in 2017 is the actions we're taking in optimizing our manufacturing supply chain footprint. And that aligns with what we shared in March of 2016 when we laid out our five-year plan.","And in optimizing our footprint and our manufacturing base, we anticipated over a period of the next few years we'd be investing between $500 million and $600 million, in some cases closing manufacturing sites and shifting manufacturing and expanding manufacturing in our more efficient sites, ultimately to reduce our total manufacturing footprint, to improve efficiency and to improve our ability to service our customers. Most of what you're seeing under strategic investments fits under that strategy. We took a number of actions in the second quarter, and in terms of the return, the way we've quantified that there's a couple ways I can quantify that for you, Rob. One is, by 2020 we anticipate that this will increase our operating income annually between $125 million and $175 million. That's one way for you to think of it. Another way is that we anticipate that this will be greater than a 30% return on investment for the investment that we're taking on this footprint optimization.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's very thorough. Thank you. I mean, I guess the other question in the context of some of these pricing discussions that John and Andy alluded to, you'll find that investors in the space generally have a lot of PTSD when it comes to Amazon with respect to the distribution disruption that's going on across the board, and we see price concessions or a pricing regime of sorts in consumer, industrial businesses. Can you talk about your \u2013 are you rethinking distribution and the sensitivity to price or going direct? Or anything along those lines that would kind of orient why you think this is a forward thinking 3M movement that you're kind of looking at things and saying maybe the business is changing, or maybe the environment is changing, we're going to get ahead of this and have more concessions on price or maybe do value engineering around new products to drive better growth. Could you just comment on that?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","This is Inge. Let us first of all talk about what is going on in the marketplace. And as you talked about initially, consumer if you like, what is going on in the retail and consumer space. When you lead a business in totality, it's not price that you initially think about, you think about structure. And if you take our Consumer business, in order to adjust our structure for the future we started that back in 2012. So 2012 was when we start to look upon our Consumer business in terms of how do we operate, and how do we think the future will look like, and how can we become more relevant to our customers? That was the question.","At that time we had nine divisions in consumer, today we have four. So you think about that in terms of evolution of the portfolio. We started back very early to adjust for future that eventually could look different. And as you heard in the result today, there's slight difference in it in terms of consolidation for us as we have three or four business divisions growing. It's basically the office supply that still consolidation is going on.","We have not seen any either in Consumer or in Industrial, any differences relative to the power for us to drive growth. We're often a price leader and we're executing those plans. So we don't see differences there. And if you think about 3M generally speaking as a business, 70% of our business is either design or specked in or regulated. So if you think about it from that perspective, it's a smaller portion of 3M that eventually could be impacted. And we will adjust relative to that. But we're not thinking of going on price because that's not our business model. Our business model is to introduce a product that is adding value either through different design or improved productivity, and then we're driving price based on that. But your question is on price, and I would say we are adjusting our business models as we move forward. And often that is for us the structure in commercialization and it's also footprint, right? So you saw the investment we are doing here and the first question relative to return on that $500 million to $600 million with an annual return by 2020 of in between $125 million to $175 million. Those are important things for us to improve our competitiveness as we move forward.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So I hate to return to the same pricing, but I just don't think I've ever heard 3M trying to drive volumes or market share gains through price, so I'm wondering are you taking here a decision to invest some of the raw material goodness, the deflation in raw materials into price and hence market share? And just may be, Nick, thinks about that $0.10, $0.15 of raw material deflation benefit in the plan, how does that look on a net basis versus price at this point?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. For the raw materials, the $0.10 to $0.15 that we anticipated of benefits at the beginning of the year, there's been puts and takes as we go along on the raw material side, but so far we're still seeing ourselves in that range of $0.10 to $0.15. I'd say, the potential were, in the last couple of years were we could go past that number, I don't see that is a very high probability. I see this in this range, maybe $0.10 being a little towards the bottom end of that range based on what we're seeing in the raw material markets today.","On the pricing front, I don't know what to repeat, but other than there have been these isolated places where we've taken action. In the second half of the year, we expect a more normal price growth for 3M as we've put in plan some actions to be bringing price back to a more normal level that we've historically experienced in 3M. So I don't see much changing on that front from our original guidance, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's fair. And just to clarify, when you say normal, do you mean the 30 bps to 50 bps ex-FX, will that be the second half of the year? Or is that more 2018? And then maybe just clarify as well the comment you made on the investment spending in 2018, you said $0.10. Now, is that $0.10 on top of the $0.05 to $0.10 run rate or $0.10 total?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","On the strategic investment around growth, when we started the year we said that we expected that to be an incremental $0.10 expense and we continue to expect it to be that incremental $0.10. We're not increasing that number any further.","And then on the price growth, Well, I'd say it is a more normal range, I do think it'll still be to the lower end on price growth in the second half of the year, approaching in the positive zone, but not up to the whole 30 basis points to 50 basis points that we normally are getting for core price growth.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So when you think about the Industrial business and I guess you can kind of throw Safety and Graphics in there as well, how much of that business currently goes through kind of the proper industrial distributors? And then how has that kind of trended relative to online and the Amazons of the world over the last, call it, two years here, three years, in rough terms?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yes. This is Inge. If you think about \u2013 you combine the two businesses which is a good way to look upon it, I would say that think about it like a 50-50 model, if you think on it globally. Some countries will have more distribution than others. But if you think about the two businesses combined and how we go to market, I think it's 50-50 generally speaking.","Again, if you take many businesses in both Industrial and in Safety and Graphics, they are spec in or designed in or also regulated in a way. So the push will maybe happen for some consumables that will go through e-business channels, if you like. But we have not seen a big trend in that space as of yet. Maybe it will come, but I think then you have to think about how will that impact you relative to what you do with your end customers. But we are prepared to move in that direction. And if you look upon our business in the second quarter, if you take the two businesses you're talking about, the increase relative to e-business was 9%, and they estimate it to be 14% for the second half of the way. But you have to think about it also, that piece today for us is 2% to 3% of our total business what we do e-business direct ourselves. Many, many of our customers are of course finding the platforms themselves but they will not impact us by definition as we see at this point in time on price levels.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So when we think about kind of what's going on in the world going back to Rob's question around the higher level strategic type of stuff, Grainger obviously came out and made some headlines talking about cutting price to drive growth. They have a great franchise historically. I mean, you guys obviously have one of the greatest franchises ever and you're talking about cutting price to drive growth. Is this just coincidence? Is this just kind of the macro environment that we're in? Or are these in some way linked to what's become a much more dynamic competitive environment in the Industrial or even Consumer channels if you want to throw Consumer in there as well. Any relationship there at all? Has Grainger at all called you and said, hey, let's take some of the pain because I know you guys go to them a bit. It's just \u2013 this deflationary environment is just something new for all of us, I think, over the last (51:44).","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","I cannot comment on Grainger, but of course in business, generally speaking, that would be more dynamic as you move ahead, right? I think we see that specifically in the retail area at this point in time. And then I think different company will have different impacts, right? If you think about what we're all about relative to our portfolio, as I said, a lot of it is spec in, design in and regulated. So by definition, to drive that in terms of price down, that's where you have to hold back to your technology platforms, to your brand equity, et cetera.","So I don't see a direct correlation as you talk about this quarter to be honest. But I will agree to as we move ahead that in all businesses, in health care or electronics or consumer, industrial, dynamics will happen and we have to adjust to that and that's what we're doing by the way, right? When you see some of our investments in terms of strategic investment for the future is to make sure we are more competitive as we move ahead. And we take action on most things in terms of our infrastructure to make sure we drive out as much cost as we can, flatten the organization and make sure we have a more agile execution model as we move ahead. So you're prepared for whatever is coming at you, right.","And as I always have said, when you take those actions, do it when you can not only must. So we are taking some of those \u2013 we do it now because we can and prepare ourselves for a much, much better, more competitive and more agile 3M as we move ahead.","Will pricing be one part of those and be driven by the market? Well, let's see. But important thing that you have all your fundamentals in place so you can complete.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And, Nick, just very quickly, just in the second half, the comps get just a little bit tougher yet you're kind of into the high end of the range even though the first half growth is more at the midpoint of the new range. So should we just kind of ignore the comps and assume that things accelerate in the second half of the year despite that? Do you see the true economy getting better in the second half? It just would seem that your peak growth rate probably happened in the first quarter. Maybe I'm wrong about that from a timing perspective \u2013 or days sales or something.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah, when it comes to the comps, there's a couple of different things going on. One, like for instance our Electronics and Industrial, both of those, I agree with you, we're going to have slightly tougher comps in the second half of the year. In the case of Consumer and in Health Care, both of those will be seeing easier comps. I wouldn't call it a big statement on our fact that we're seeing an improving economy. We're seeing a fairly stable economy outlook for the balance of the year. Our move in the organic growth range to now would be 3% to 5% and take us confidence in our ability to maintain the growth trajectory even with the tougher comp that we'll be facing, primarily in the fourth quarter.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Thanks for the detail.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Deane.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Hi, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just to start off in Consumer with the U.S. being down 1%, this is seasonally where we see a back-to-school impact in Consumer. How did that play out in the quarter? We've seen industry reports where spending has been higher year-over-year, and want to see how that rippled through for you guys?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","So we're not through that, but I think the headline there is that this is the strongest we've seen in the past and maybe slightly stronger. I think, what you see is if you compare maybe the last couple of years versus five, six years ago, is that they wait longer to make the purchase today versus three, four, five years ago. So we will see more growth coming for that category specifically.","If you look upon our performance for Consumer in United States, we can basically go right down to the office supply by definition. So there's nothing else going on there. And when you talk about back-to-school, it looks very solid for us.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good to hear. And then a follow-up question, Inge, there was some interesting announcements regarding succession planning at 3M this quarter, looks orderly, looks well signaled, especially compared to the past. Can you comment on these announcements? Maybe specifically on expectations regarding timing?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Well, first of all the announcement was not about succession planning. The announcement was around we have a job to do. And if you saw the two announcements we did, we announced Mike Roman to take on the growth piece of the enterprise, right? So leading the five business group and the international piece. So that's around growth, and we need more growth, so that will be his focus. And then H.C. Shin was appointed Vice Chair, and he's taking on all the efficiencies, so everything going in relative to manufacturing and supply chain. And also R&D was put, and strategic planning was put under his plate.","And as I said earlier, now succession planning started first day in office, right? So as a CEO you have to look upon it from the first day you walk into office. That's your obligation, and I have done that. And we have many very strong leaders in the company, Mike and H.C. are two of them, and they both have had tremendous successful record relative to leading businesses. H.C., the last six years led international, replaced me in that role before I became CEO. And before that, he in fact led the Industrial business group. Mike Roman has led the Industrial business group the last three years, before that was the Strategic Planner for the company, have lived both in Europe and Asia and have had good results. So we have two very solid individuals that have a job to do here. And so that's the whole point I would like to make with any comments around it.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Morning. Just a question on the EPS bridge. So in Q2 you had about $0.08 of tailwind from organic growth and productivity. In the first quarter that was about $0.22. And the price-volume dynamics, despite the questions so far, aren't grotesquely different in Q2 from Q1. So I wondered if there was something else going on that had weighed on the operating leverage in Q2? Maybe the timing of the business transformation or something like that? And how you thought about that $0.08 tailwind in Q2 in the context of what we should see in Q3 and Q4?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. Julian, if I think about the different quarters, as you're talking about Q1, Q2, we did see core underlying margin expansion once we strip out the gains in the strategic investments in Q1. And in Q2, we're more or less flat. So that's mathematically much of what's describing what you're seeing there on that EPS differential between Q1 and Q2.","As we dissect that a little deeper, Julian, where did we not see some of the margin expansion we had seen in the past, and what does that mean for the second half of the year? Our Industrial business is one of those businesses where we didn't see as much leverage as we have seen in the past. And as we look to the second half of the year, we're expecting for the total year that we're going to be seeing 50 basis points at a minimum, possibly higher, of year-on-year margin expansion, stripping out the gain and strategic investment impact, so if we get to the underlying 50 basis points or slightly higher. Some of the reasons that will drive added leverage in a business such as Industrial, we do see that improved pricing that I talked about earlier. We do see improved results from our productivity programs, and probably some added belt-tightening going on.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Understood. Thank you. And then just my second and last question would be around the growth outlook in the EMEA region. I think a lot of companies this earnings have talked about a disconnect of the good soft data not necessarily translating into hard orders or sales. Should we think about your first half overall organic growth in the region of 1%? That is a good placeholder of what you expect for the second half? And maybe just any update on how you're seeing business in Europe in recent months?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. I think, when we look upon the rest of the year, I think you can see slightly more growth than you have seen in the first half of the year. So we look maybe for 2% in the second part of the year.","I would say the comment relative to West Europe specifically is more around, I think Germany is still doing well. And if you look upon our figures and the way we do business over there, if you take manufacturing PMI in Germany, the second quarter was 59%, if you compare that to like 50% and 51%, 52% for China. So Germany, by definition, which is the big engine in Europe are doing well on the manufacturing side. And our business in Europe, if you look upon the portfolio, our Industrial business is very strong.","So from that perspective, it's okay if you look ahead. We have not seen much of an impact to us relative to Brexit. I think countries like Spain are improving, but very much based on a lower base and some trouble they've had in the past.","So when I look upon it, I would say Germany is doing well, which is a key element for you to be successful in Europe, and Nordic is doing fine, and you start to see some uptick maybe from countries like Spain. France goes sideways as we speak, but with the outcome of the election, I think that will be more positive if they can execute what they have promised, and why not? So, I think, as an outcome for Europe, generally speaking, is more positive than negative in my view.","Relative to 3M, we have been on this optimization of the organization for quite some time, and if you joined, or for those of you that joined in Neuss, Germany here, a little more than a month ago, our whole execution of the EPS and SAP system is going very, very well. And I was \u2013 last week, I visited both center of expertise that we have. We have one service center in Poland and we have one supply chain center in Switzerland. I visited both of them and things are going very, very well for us in that execution.","So for me, Europe generally speaking, externally, look more positive than negative. And I'm not talking only here the next two quarters. I'm talking a little bit further out, and our structure in place in Europe start to really gain momentum and deliver for us. This quarter was a little bit tough on top line but, generally speaking, I'm pleased with the progress we have made and that will pay off as we move ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. And good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Joe.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Hi, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, Nick, I want to kind of circle back to some of the comments you made earlier on the strategic investments, and just doing some of the back of the envelope math here, it seems like you're going to put forth about $400 million towards strategic investments this year, call it roughly $100 next year, and then we'll see in 2019. And then the payback in 2020 on an annualized basis is $125 million to $175 million. I'm just wondering like what is it about the investments that you're making? It just seems like it's taking a while for the payback to actually be seen in your margins. And so maybe if you can just provide some color on that? That would be helpful.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. Joe, thanks for asking that question. There's different types of actions a company like us, like 3M can take. Sometimes an action where we enter into a restructuring where we're reducing the size of our workforce, that can be a much faster payback. And you've seen actions like that that we've done and see very fast payback.","When it comes to optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain footprint, those paybacks take time to materialize. We don't start seeing benefits, Joe, until we actually have the manufacturing site closed that we've chosen to action, and have the new manufacturing going on in a new location. That takes time to happen. It takes time to work with work councils, with employee organizations, it takes time to, in some places re-qualify that product if we're moving. It can many times be several quarters before we \u2013 from the point we announce it until we've actually physically made the change and start realizing those benefits. So this is different, and this is why this one takes longer to get happen. Still a very important part of our strategy though to be by 2020 getting to those savings that we're projecting.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Nick, that's helpful color. I guess, just a clarifying question on that, so this year you have gains that are essentially offsetting all of the investments that you're making. Next year there's going to be additional investments that you're making. Is the right way to think about 2018 that there's going to be a net negative to your margin from these investments? Or are there going to be other offsetting items as well in 2018?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Well, I can't speculate on whether there will be more M&A activity that will happen because those we announce once we have clear line of sight that they'll actually happen. But in terms of the footprint side, we'll still be seeing the negative impact in absolute terms in 2018 on our margin and on our EPS. We expect in 2019 to become positive, and then by 2020 to be the full amount. As far as the M&A and what that might do in 2018, I think it's too early for me to speculate on that piece.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And maybe just talking about the growth investments that you're making, and just to make sure that I understand that well, so you mentioned about $100 million in growth investments this year. And so if I just kind of think about just the payback from those investments, you mentioned it was about a point of growth, so call it like $300 million or so in revenue, at your operating margin 25%, say, if you're talking about, call it, roughly $75 million in profit. The question, I guess, is regarding these growth investments, do you think that going forward this is going to be part of the status quo or you're going to have to continue to make these investments? Or are these investments going to drive like a longer cycle product growth across your portfolio?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Well, first of all, it's $104 million additional investment for commercialization this year. And we said it will drive 50 basis point to 100 basis point of growth. And six, seven months into the year, we see that coming exactly as we laid out.","I think, it's important to think about it. This is products and categories where we already have a very good position in the marketplace. So this is more, sell more of the same, but penetrate different parts of the world. So this is not relative to total new products or anything, this is category of products into markets where we already have a very good return and a good position in some parts of the world, but not everywhere. So we selected those programs in August of last year in order to make those investments.","So with success, I think they will get more investment as they go, but it will be part of the normal business model. So this was an acceleration for us and an additional push. And I would say pretty safe product lines for us to penetrate more and broader, and deeper around the world.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, Inge.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys. Just a quick one. You flagged certain markets where in organic local currency terms you've been in decline on filtration, roofing granules, office supplies, European health care, European energy, European consumer. If you look at that cluster of businesses, I think I might have missed one or two, if you look at that cluster of businesses, do you see a line of sight to getting that cluster back to a growth track next year? Or do you need a change in the macro environment to get there?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Well, I think, generally speaking, you will have from time to time some businesses that are not growing as fast as the rest of them. I think, the important thing for us is to make sure that all businesses can capitalize and use our four fundamental strengths in order to be strong. So the four fundamental strengths we have talked about is our technology platforms, our manufacturing capabilities, our geographic reach, and our brand equity. If you follow those categories, you will grow over time, and you will perform very, very well. And there's none of the businesses you listed there that I would say will fall out of that frame specifically. So I'm not overly concerned relative to any of them that you talked about specifically.","And I would say, all of us leading businesses, we would like all businesses to grow every quarter, the whole time, right? But that is not reality. So I would say, our competitive position based on the four fundamentals of the company is very strong, and we should be able to outperform the local market wherever we compete. And as you know, we have talked about 1.5 times IPI, industrial production index, as a target that we have done in the past. And I think we should do closer to 1.7. So I'm optimistic relative to the future.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Inge G.

Gangestad - 3M Co.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If I could just summarize \u2013 it's been a bit of a frustrating call \u2013 but just to summarize, your predecessor focused on driving top line, and there was this view that top line comes at the expense of margin that if you get growth you're not going to get margin. And this quarter I think seems to bring back those fears. On top of that of course you have the Amazon fear. If you look forward, do you think your new strategy for expanding some key products means that margin is now capped for a while as we're pursuing this growth strategy? Or do you think 3M still has levers to drive margin up both near-term and long-term?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Andrew, no fear. Don't be overly concerned relative to that strategy. And I think you have to think about it in a way that a certain element at a certain time you need to do with the business. And I think what we have done, we have worked very hard on the portfolio in order to make sure that we stay in businesses where we can use our four fundamental strengths. And if there's some businesses that have been underperforming, in every single case have been \u2013 the reason have been that they have not been able to use the four fundamental strengths. I think that's the basis for it.","We have also said that by shifting and moving in the portfolio, our performance will be much better over time. And I think we have proven that in Electronics and Energy. I think we have proven that in Safety and Graphics. I think we have proven that in Consumer, if I go back to the 2012 starting point. And in Health Care we didn't need to do much because that portfolio was very strong by definition with high margins.","Now we are focusing more in on the Industrial, and we are taking action there. And one \u2013 that's one-third of the company, so we need to get Industrial up and growing at a faster rate. And we have now had three good quarters of growth as we speak.","And we are now taking action and more focus as we move forward relative to productivity, organizational structure, et cetera. So for me, it's not a question of one quarter, it's a question of how will it look as we go forward. I'm totally confident with all the work we have done, the way we have worked on the portfolio, the way we are improving the way we go to market, that we will continue to lever very well and deliver good result as we move forward. If not, I wouldn't execute the plan at all.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. That's a great answer. And just a question in terms of what would it take to get high-end of your guidance on top line in terms of key regions and businesses, if you could outline the bull case scenario?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah, we upgraded the range from 3% to 5%, as you saw, right? And I think to be in the middle of that is very doable. We have 4% growth in the first part of the year. I think, we're not talking about businesses, but I would say from a geographical perspective, if we can capitalize more on our strengths in the United States, even more on that will help us. And I think the same for West Europe.","So I think, it's \u2013 the United States, where we are \u2013 we are doing fine, but I think we are so strong here that we should be able to take even more of the opportunities in the United States. And as I said earlier, West Europe looks slightly better in my mind than I thought maybe two, three quarters ago. Let's see if that can come through during the rest of the year.","If that's happened, then maybe can push us up to the higher end. But let's see? So let's hold for the \u2013 let's hold the range for 3% to 5% for now, and then we can talk next quarter to see how it look like if we can give you some more color to it. But 3% to 5% is very, very realistic for us. And as I said earlier, I'm very pleased with where we are after two quarters in terms of the result. 4% growth after two quarter is respectable for us I think and pretty good.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to reiterate, because I am getting these e-mails, you outlined a margin growth strategy in Europe, you're sort of positive on margin opportunity in Safety and Graphics. None of that has changed?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","No. Nothing of that has changed.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","No, nothing has changed on that front.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","No, no, no. Not at all.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Absolutely not.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Not at all.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you. As I said earlier, I'm pleased with the performance through the first six months of the year. We are successfully executing the 3M playbook and positioned to deliver a strong 2017. As you saw today in our updated guidance, this includes good progress relative to our four primary financial objectives: earnings per share, organic local currency sales growth, return on invested capital, and free cash flow conversion. At the same time, we are making investments to accelerate growth and strengthen our portfolio, which will build on an even more competitive 3M for 2018 and beyond.","Thank you very much for joining us, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 25, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading, quarterly earnings.","Before we begin, I would like to address our upcoming investor events, highlighted on slide number two. First, we have set the dates for our 2017 quarterly earnings calls. They are January 24, April 25, July 25, and October 24. Second, we'll be hosting our 2017 outlook meeting on the morning of Tuesday, December 13 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Invitations for this event will be sent this afternoon, so please RSVP as soon as possible. We hope to see you there.","Finally, next June we will be hosting a European Investor Day at our Germany headquarters in Neuss.

Additional information will be provided closer to the event.","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide three. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1a of our most recent form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please turn to slide four and I'll hand off to Inge.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our company delivered increased earnings, robust cash flow, and a broad-based margin performance with each of our business groups posting margins greater than 22%. At the same time, we continued to execute on business transformation, took actions to strengthen the portfolio, and increased investment in future growth. The third quarter also marked our company's 100th straight year of paying dividends, which we increased for each of the last 58 years.","With respect to EPS, our team posted earnings of $2.15 per share, up 5% year-on-year. We delivered total sales of $7.7 billion, flat versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was down 80 basis points while the combined impact from acquisitions and FX increased sales by a similar amount.","Looking closer at our organic growth, we once again delivered positive growth from three business groups: Consumer, Safety & Graphics, and Health Care. Consumer paced our company's growth at 3% with positive growth in all businesses. Safety & Graphics grew 2% organically, led by roofing granules and commercial solutions. Organic growth in our Health Care business was 1.5%, which was tempered versus recent quarters due to some softness in the U.S. healthcare market. Industrial's organic growth declined 1%, and we continue to anticipate growth in this business to turn positive in the fourth quarter. Finally, Electronics & Energy was down 8% in the quarter, in line with what we indicated during our last earnings call.","Even in a challenging macro environment, the strength of our business model is enabled us to deliver premium returns and generate healthy cash flow. Company-wide, we increased margins 40 basis points to nearly 25%, ranging from 32% in Health Care to just shy of 23% in Industrial. At the same time, we increased free cash flow by 19% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 117%.","Our strong cash flow allow us to invest in the business while also returning cash to shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also continue to build our enterprise for the future, and I will make some comments on our recent progress. Please move to slide five.","You have heard me talk many times about the 3M playbook, which is the key enabler for our short and long-term success. The playbook includes three levels that are creating value for enterprise and that we continue to make good progress on. Two of the levers, investing in innovation and portfolio management, are important to our long-term growth objectives.","In addition to ongoing investment in research and development, we continue to prioritize our portfolio and make targeted investments to support organic growth. We also drive growth through acquisitions which complement organic growth and enhance our technology capabilities as well as partnerships which combine our strengths with those of other organizations.","Most recently, we finalized an acquisition and established one partnership, both related to Health Care. You will recall that in February, we decided to retain and further invest in our health information system business. To bolster our technology capabilities in that area, in September, we acquired Semfinder, a medical coding company based in Switzerland. This acquisition helps us accelerate penetration in international markets, which is important as more countries move towards electronic medical records.","To further strengthen health information systems, earlier this month we announced a collaboration with Verily, the life science business of the Alphabet Company. This is a partnership between two highly creative and innovative companies that will leverage our expertise in healthcare coding with their expertise in data analytics and software. Ultimately, we will develop tools to help providers increase the quality and affordability of healthcare, which comes back to our company's vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home, and improving every life.","Beyond growth investments, we are taking other recent actions to prepare 3M for the future. Three weeks ago, we finalized the sale of a non-core protective films business that will further enhance and focus our Industrial portfolio. We're also making solid progress on our third lever, business transformation, with two recent ERP rollouts in West Europe. As a reminder, we have now deployed ERP in 15 countries and in four of our largest European distribution centers.","In summary, I'm pleased with our team's performance in the quarter in terms of controlling what we can control while also building for the future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Nick who will take you through the details. Nick?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Thank you, Inge, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide six for a recap of our Q3 sales performance. Organic local currency sales declined 80 basis points in the third quarter, with volumes down 1.4% and selling prices up 0.6%. Our acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana net of three small divestitures added 0.3 percentage points to sales. And foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.5%. In U.S. dollar terms, worldwide sales were flat versus the third quarter of last year.","Looking at organic growth by geography, the United States declined 0.3% in Q3. Our Consumer and Safety & Graphics businesses generated positive organic growth, which offset declines in Industrial and Electronics & Energy.","In Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 2.2%. Solid growth from our Consumer, Health Care and Safety & Graphics businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics & Energy. Organic growth increased 1% in Japan and declined 2% in China\/Hong Kong. Excluding electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 1% and China\/Hong Kong grew more than 4%.","Let's now take a look at the EMEA region starting with West Europe. West Europe delivered 1% organic growth, led by Germany, Sweden, and Spain. From a business perspective, growth was led by Health Care and Safety & Graphics. Central East Europe and Middle East\/Africa declined year-on-year, impacted by ongoing challenges in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In total, organic growth across EMEA declined 1% in the quarter. Finally, organic growth in Latin America\/Canada was 1.2%. Mexico grew 5% and Brazil rose 2% while Canada declined 3%.","Please turn to slide seven for the third quarter P&L highlights. Third quarter sales were $7.7 billion, and we generated record third quarter earnings of $2.15 per share. GAAP operating margins were again strong at 24.7%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 100 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 90 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's Q4 restructuring, expanded margins by 40 basis points in Q3.","Looking at headwinds, first year acquisitions reduced margins 10 basis points. This includes the impact of Capital Safety and Membrana. We continued to accelerate strategic growth investments across the portfolio and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint, which reduced margins by 40 basis points. The impact of lower year-on-year foreign currency hedge gains decreased margins by 50 basis points. And finally, organic volume declines along with related utilization impacts reduced margins by 90 basis points. Most impacted were our Industrial and Electronics & Energy businesses.","Let's now turn to slide eight for a look at EPS. Earnings per share in the third quarter were $2.15, an increase of 4.9% versus the third quarter of 2015. Margin expansion net of organic sales declines added $0.05 to earnings per share in Q3. Foreign currency impacts, net of lower year-on-year hedge gains, reduced pre-tax earnings by $20 million or the equivalent of $0.02 a share.","The third quarter tax rate was 28.5% versus 29.6% in last year's comparable quarter, which increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Favorable developments on international tax audits had a positive impact on the Q3 rate. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year, which added $0.04 to third quarter EPS.","Please turn to slide nine for a look at our cash flow performance. We generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, a $244 million increase year-over-year. Lower cash taxes drove the increase, offset in part by higher year-on-year pension contributions.","Q3 CapEx investments were $347 million, in line with last year's third quarter. And we now expect full-year CapEx in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion.","Third quarter free cash flow conversion was 117%, up 16 percentage points versus the same period last year. And for the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter conversion is typically the strongest of the year.","In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders in Q3, including $670 million in dividends, up $35 million year-on-year. We also returned $774 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases or $2.8 billion year to date. We now expect our full- year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion versus a prior range of $4 billion to $6 billion.","Let's now review each of our business groups starting on slide 10. Our Industrial business posted sales of $2.6 billion in the third quarter, with an organic growth decline of 1.1% year-on-year. Our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter, continuing its long track record of increasing market penetration and outpacing the rate of global car and light truck builds.","We also posted positive organic growth in our Automotive Aftermarket business. Advanced Materials declined double-digits year-on-year, impacted by persistent weakness in the oil and gas market. Looking by geography, Industrial's positive organic growth in Asia-Pacific was more than offset by declines in Latin America and the U.S.","Third quarter organic growth in our U.S. Industrial business improved slightly versus the first half of 2016, and we expect to see further improvement in Q4. The Membrana acquisition, net of one small divestiture, added 1.4% to industrial sales growth in the quarter. Membrana continues to exceed our sales and profit expectations. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $591 million in Q3, and margins were up 30 basis points to 22.9%.","Please turn to slide 11. Third quarter sales in Safety & Graphics were $1.4 billion, with organic growth of 2%. Q3 organic growth was led by our roofing granules and commercial solutions businesses. Roofing granules posted another strong double-digit increase in the third quarter. Demand in this market has been strong throughout 2016. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety & Graphics was led by Latin America\/Canada which increased mid-single digits, followed by positive growth in Asia-Pacific and the U.S.","Operating income was $364 million, and operating margins were once again strong at 25.1%, up 220 basis points year-over-year. Q3 margin expansion was boosted by lower year-over-year acquisition costs related to Capital Safety and solid productivity efforts across the portfolio.","Please turn to slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was up 1.5%, led by a double-digit increase in food safety along with positive contributions from drug delivery systems, critical and chronic care, and health information systems. Organic growth in oral care solutions was flat, which was impacted by soft market conditions in the U.S.","On a geographic basis, Health Care delivered mid-single-digit growth in Asia-Pacific. Latin America\/ Canada and EMEA both posted low single-digit growth while the U.S. was flat.","Organic growth was up low single digits in developing countries, a bit softer than recent quarters. Health Care organic growth in Q3 was below recent trends, and we expect soft market conditions to persist in the near term. Health Care's operating income was $429 million and margins remain strong at 31.5%. Importantly, we generated these returns while continuing to increase growth investments across the business.","Next, I'll cover Electronics & Energy on slide 13. Third quarter sales in Electronics & Energy were $1.3 billion, down 8.1% organically. Organic sales declined 8% in our electronics-related businesses. Market challenges persisted across most consumer electronics applications, which impacted volume growth.","Channel inventory levels have improved versus earlier in the year, but further adjustments occurred in Q3. Our team continues to focus on driving spec-ing wins and increasing customer relevance across all consumer electronics OEMs. Our energy-related businesses declined 9% organically. Electrical markets declined high single digits, and Renewable Energy was down double digits. As a reminder, we exited our Renewable Energy backsheet business last December, which reduced energy-related organic growth by nearly 300 basis points in the third quarter.","Our third quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $312 million. And even in a challenging growth environment, our team delivered healthy margins of 24.2%. Please turn to slide 14 where I will cover our Consumer business.","Consumer had another strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and organic growth of 2.9%, which led the company. Geographically, Consumer's organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific and the U.S., both up mid-single digits, along with solid growth in Latin America\/Canada. Looking by business, organic growth was positive across the entire consumer portfolio, paced by a mid-single digit increase in our home improvement business.","Within home improvement, our Command mounting projects, ScotchBlue Painter's Tape and Filtrete filters once again posted strong organic growth. We continue to accelerate growth investments to enhance the value of these important brands.","Consumer-generated operating income of $317 million, with margins of 26.2%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Positive organic growth, portfolio prioritization and ongoing productivity efforts drove the margin improvement. Please turn to slide 15 for an update on our 2016 planning estimates.","We now expect 2016 GAAP earnings in the range of $8.15 to $8.20 per share versus a prior range of $8.15 to $8.30. The narrowed range equates to approximately 8% EPS growth year-over-year. Full-year organic sales growth is now expected to be approximately flat, at the low end of our previous range of flat to up 1%. Foreign currency translation is now anticipated to reduce sales by approximately 1% versus a prior range of down 1% to 2%. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, will add 1% to full-year sales growth. The full-year tax rate is now expected to be approximately 29% versus a prior range of 29% to 29.5%. Lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105% for the full year.","With that, we thank you for your attention and we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. One moment, please, while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Joe.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Good morning, Joe","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So my first question I guess is going to be on healthcare. It's been such a great business for you guys for such a long period of time. And the growth we saw this quarter was about the slowest growth we've seen, I think, since 2009. And so to your comments from earlier that you expect the soft market conditions to persist, I'm just curious. What specifically slowed down this quarter in that business?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Well I think first of all, geographically, U.S. slowed down. And it slowed down basically in the last months of the quarter. And then I think there's two other elements out there in the world that happened to that business. Some, it's in developing economy where Brazil had a little bit of slowdown that was more than we expected. And then as you know, things are going on in Central East Europe, specifically in Turkey, that tempered it, generally speaking. So when you look upon it from a business perspective, if you tempered in United States which we did, that would go over all businesses. The U.S. I think tried to move some purchases forward maybe one to two quarter. That's what we're talking about, like mid-term or short-term tempering.","So I would say all businesses except one, which is oral care, had positive organic local currency growth. And oral care was flat, so still showed growth but it was tempered. And by definition, I'm not concerned at all relative to the future of that business. And we continue to invest for the future. We've done quite some investment, as you know, the last couple of years. So there's no concern. Was just that it slowed down and it was basically in the last months of the quarter.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful color. And I guess the \u2013 just following on, on the kind of soft market conditions to persist comment. Does that mean we should be expecting 1% to 2% type growth in this business moving forward? Or how are you guys thinking about that?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","No, no. We don't \u2013 no, we don't change the guidance relative to that business moving forward at all. I think you should think about it, for the fourth quarter this year will maybe be very similar to the third quarter and then it will come back in the first quarter. I cannot tell you here and now \u2013 we cannot tell you here and now when in the first quarter that will come. It come early, mid or late in the quarter but it will come. So we don't change the guidance at all for this business moving forward into 2017.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And maybe my follow-on question is on the buyback. I saw that you guys reduced the buyback guidance for the year. I think when we last spoke, we talked about if perhaps M&A was not going to come through that maybe we'd see a little bit more aggressive share repurchases in the second half of the year. And so I'm just curious, maybe talk a little bit about the M&A pipeline and just the reasons for the reduced buyback items. Thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Well relative to the pipeline, it's still very good in terms of what we are looking upon in all businesses. And as I've said earlier, there's some prime target in terms of business groups there when \u2013 and if you think about it, with Industrial, one-third of the company, of course we have interest in that business. Health Care and Safety & Graphics continue also to be prime objectives for us, but the pipeline is very solid for all of the five business groups. So solid. As always we have a look upon it from a strategic perspective and then make sure that the valuation is acceptable for us. And Nick will make some comments here relative to buyback.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah, Joe. Yeah. As you've seen year to date, we've repurchased $2.8 billion of our stock. And in Q3, the market was trading at near all-time highs and you've heard me say this before, that one of the factors that influences our repurchase activity is relative value and price. And as you know, that's why we stepped up our activity earlier in the year in the first quarter. So over time, the pace of our repurchases is dependent on other demands on capital such as M&A along with the relative value of the stock. And those things are what's impacting us, now putting a guidance at $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion for the year.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Andrew.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Nick, you've said publicly that you're cautiously optimistic that you can grow margin in 2017, but obviously your overall markets have been a bit weaker than you expected. As we get closer to 2017, do you still have confidence that you can grow margin? And how should we think about the contributions of the drivers of the margin expansion? Business transformation should be a more meaningful driver than this year. Price costs still help. Maybe mix helps, but obviously we know pension and FX is offset. So maybe any more color that you can give us as we're getting closer to 2017 here.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. Sure, Andy. As you can imagine, we're still working on our 2017 outlook. And on December 13, we'll provide more details on that at our outlook meeting. At a high level, Andy, we expect an external growth market to continue moving sideways in 2017. That's the overall external picture we're anticipating. From a business perspective, we do expect our Industrial and Electronics & Energy businesses to have improved growth rates in 2017 versus what we've been seeing in 2016.","And then to part of your question on margins, Andy, we're still expecting price raw materials to be positive to earnings and to margins in 2017, probably at a lower level of contribution to margin enhancement than what we've seen in 2016. And then business transformation, I expect that to have a increased positive impact on our earnings per share and net margin in 2017. I think you've heard me say that we expected and we're realizing approximately $50 million of operating income benefit from business transformation in 2016. And that's part of our journey moving to $500 million to $700 million of savings by 2020. And I'd expect 2017 to be a continued progression on that path.","That said, we are as you mentioned, we're going to have a couple headwinds. Pension is likely to be a headwind for us. If I were to take current rates where they are, I'm estimating this will be about a $150 million headwind for 3M in 2017. And FX will likely be a headwind for us, not so much based on movements in exchange rates, but the fact that we won't be repeating some of the hedging gains that we experienced in 2016. All in, those lower hedge gains will probably hurt our margins by about $100 million. So all in, Andy, that's the puts and takes of a preview of what I expect we'll be talking about in a month and a half.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, Nick. That's very helpful. Inge, maybe I can ask you about Industrial. You said the U.S. looked a little better, but overall it seems like Industrial, it didn't get as good as the comps got easier. Abrasives turned down again it looks like sequentially. You do have easier comps as you mentioned in 4Q and you expect growth. In advanced materials, I mean it should shift, especially as you've got this defense contract from last quarter. So should we resume low single-digit growth moving forward? And how confident are you of that in that business?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah, as you said, so it being U.S. that hold back Industrial during the last couple of quarters, it was better in Q3. So that's positive, and we will see positive growth for Industrial in Q4. And that will be driven exactly as you said relative to we start to deliver now on the body armor. And we see some uptick in some of the other businesses. But it's very much the comp that will be a driver for us in Q4 and as we go into Q1. I'm very confident in our Industrial business group relative to growth going forward. And the reason for that is we have worked now for quite some time, not only in Industrial, but in all business group in order to make sure that we get the portfolio that be relevant for us in order to serve our customers.","We have seen during the last couple of years some heavy lifting going on in the portfolio work, not only in Electronics & Energy but in Safety & Graphics and in Industrial as well. So when I look upon it, we are moving the company to spaces and places where we are more relevant and that we can also capitalize on technology conversion, meaning also driving better margin for us. So in fact, we have fired some of our portfolios over the years. So and it takes some time as you go through that process. It's not like you start to shift your portfolio and you start to shift your infrastructure in the company and everything will come immediately. But I'm very positive that we, now we start to see Industrial turning the corner as we move forward. And we will see the first quarter happen here in Q4.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Inge. Appreciate it, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line with Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Morning, Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Want to get a sense, when I look at Electronics & Energy, you're going to anniversary the renewable energy exit that's 300 basis points. So pound for pound that means you're down 4.5%, not 7.5%. I mean do you have a sense of after that you start to get double easy comps, I guess, if you will. Is this a business that can turn actually positive in 2017 or just less negative? And I know your comment earlier is they would get better, but can we count on it not hurting us any more I guess is my question.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Good morning, Scott. I think first of all, you have to look upon that business in terms of the overall portfolio. So for this quarter, just to make a couple of comments, we did better in electronic than we thought, and it was slightly tough with energy. In the energy piece was some big project that was delayed, specifically in telecom and in utilities. So I think that's again coming back to uncertainty in the market. It was not much of a shift, but it was a little bit of a shift. All in, we were down 8%, exactly as we told you at the last earnings call. So I feel good about that piece.","Going forward, as we have shift the portfolio there as well, we will as we go start to see some positive evolution relative to growth rate because we are moving to segments that are growing faster and where we are more relevant. So if you look upon it, it will be around automotive electrification, data centers, sustainability, chemistry and green automation. That will be a shift as you go relative to where you today can look upon \u2013 it's very much design and assembly. So we have a range in the five-year plan as you know of zero to 4. We are in the first year of that plan which is then down. So it will be still the low end of that range, but as we roll in here for the future we should start to see some more positive movements forward for us in terms of growth rate.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's very good. And then as a follow-up on M&A \u2013 and I know...","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","And the other thing though, Scott. You look upon the margins now in that business. That business is now running at almost \u2013 they're 24%. So if you think about that where we started. We started at 15% 16%. That's work not only of cost out and structure out; it's also the portfolio work that had been going on. So for me when I look upon that business \u2013 and I think for all businesses, we should be positioned to win in places where we are relevant and can capitalize on technologies that we drive productivity and efficiency for our customers and also margins for us.","So I think 8% down, you would like to grow. But we're able now to as I've said earlier, even where we are tempered on top line, we are able to deliver based on our new model. And we couldn't have done that for you five, six years ago. If we were down 8%, it would be terrible on the margins, so I feel confident now with our model there. And now as we move forward, now we will start to see some positive growth.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I remember those days well.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a quick follow-up, guys. When you're looking at transactions \u2013 and I think in the past you've said you'd like to start to look at some things that are a little bit bigger. I mean what are the probabilities we see in a deals larger than Capital Safety over the next 12 months?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","That's a very good question. It's a very good question. I don't know. I cannot get a probability of that. But as I've said the portfolio is rich in terms of candidates. I'd rather do slightly bigger than smaller. As I said earlier, we have during the last couple of years stepped up our probability \u2013 or the output on what we have done. And by definition, in order for us to move the needle forward, they should more sizable than we did in the past. So I think I hold it for then. Then when the news are coming out, we'll look upon the size of them. But we are ready. I mean we are ready. We are ready. I think we're on a good position to do what we need to do in order to bolster growth with or without acquisition. Also organically, we're doing okay.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Good. Thank you for the answer.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Just wondered first of all if you could give a little bit more color on the slowdown you saw in the EMEA region in recent months relative to Q2. I know you talked a little bit about Turkey had slowed. But did you see anything broader, anything in Western Europe, for example?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Well, yeah. So if you start first of all, of Central East Europe and Middle East Africa. So yeah, of course, we saw, due to the situation, we saw Turkey slow specifically. And I think there was some slowdown also in Saudi Arabia. But I think if you look upon that region in total, yes, it's a tough situation. It's a tough situation there, and I think we have just to wait out for the euro-political situation to be settled before you start to see some big growth coming back there. Impact on West Europe. We had a very good quarter last quarter in West Europe and pleased with the quarter this quarter as well. Slightly slower growth, but still Germany had 3% growth in the quarter coming on a quarter last quarter that was 6%. So you add them together because the \u2013 a quarter or year doesn't start and end with a date. So if you look upon that.","You take the biggest economy in West Europe, Germany, 6% for 3%. Let's say they are growing now around 4% and the business transformation is helping them. So I think the biggest concern generally speaking will then be Central East Europe and Middle East Africa in terms of growth rate at this point in time. I visited \u2013 Nick as well Europe just a couple of weeks ago and there's good momentum in the market, very much driven by automotive, by the way. So if automotive is doing well, we are doing well as well. So \u2013 but you saw this time, good growth in Sweden; good growth in Spain; Germany 3%. It's better growth than United States.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful. Thanks. And then my follow-up question would be around electronics and within that on the OLED transition, specifically. I just wondered how you thought about your cost base on brightness enhancing film in light of that transition. And also I guess you've already started to see some impact from the OLED transition this year. Do you think that impact is significantly larger next year or pretty much steady in terms of transition rates?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. I think when you think about the cost, think about 3M as a company that are using multiple technology platforms. We have 46 technology platforms that is owned by the company, not one specific division or country. And then number two that we have manufacturing assets that can be used in multiple businesses. So \u2013 and as you can see now, the margin in that business, EEBG, as a business group, is on a very respectable level. So I would not be concerned on the cost side of the assets.","On the technology transition, as I've said before, always when there is a technology transition, you can short term lose a little bit and then come back. I think it's important to know both in LED and OLED, we are providing solutions to those devices also that have OLED. It's slightly less but \u2013 than versus LED but we are still in that business and it's expanding in a way. I will say going into next year, I will look upon it may be similar to 2016 as we roll into the year. But we have worked on that for a long time. This is not a surprise for us. So that means that technologies is in the pipeline. And as I said, technology transition is always giving you either short-term up-tick immediately or you have to have a little bit of drag. But it will not be very, very long.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks.","Inge G.

Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, good morning. This is Peter on for Steve.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Morning, Peter.","Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I was hoping maybe we could talk through some of the core pricing dynamics a little bit. So sort of parsing out between how much pricing was to offset FX headwinds and how much was core sort of pricing increases. Because it looks like price in the U.S. was negative but in many regions with positive price, that those are the regions that had negative FX. If you could talk to that a little bit.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Of course, Peter. Yes. For the third quarter in total, we reported 60 basis points of price growth. And 30 basis points of that was related to pricing adjustments we make in relation to FX. So you can split that right down the middle. 30 of it is core underlying price growth and another 30 related to FX. And many of you have probably heard me say over time that stripping out FX that our core ability to price ranges between 30 and 50 basis points. So we saw third quarter as another consistent quarter in that trend.","In regards to the U.S., we were down slightly in price. That's really consistent with where we've been for the total year in the U.S. with prices more or less flat. And there's selected businesses at any given time where we're choosing to raise price, some where we're choosing to lower price based on competition. And in the case of the U.S., there's been selected cases where we've adjusted our pricing in our strategies to gain market share.","Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And maybe actually just sticking on the price or price raws. Earlier, I think it was Q3 you said you were expecting 100 basis points of benefit for this year. I know you've addressed next year. Is that still the range you're looking at?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yes. We're still expecting price raws to be adding approximately 100 basis points to our margin for total 2016. Very similar to what we saw in Q3 which was also 100 basis margin benefit.","Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. That's great. And then just maybe last one on that, on the same point. How much \u2013 what was the split between price and raws in the quarter?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Of the 100 basis points of price raw materials, 70 basis points is coming from lower raw material prices. And that's really a combination of both. Some benefits we're seeing in commodity prices but increasingly reliance on our own sourcing teams' negotiations and productivity efforts. So that's 70 basis points. And the other 30 basis points from the price I talked about earlier.","Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. Okay. Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks very much, guys.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yes.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Morning, Shannon.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. On the Electronics & Energy margins being up at 24%, even on the down volumes, how should we think about that segment now? I mean you've got all the other segments sort of 22% or better. Comps are easing there. I mean should we now expect that, that kind of joins the rest of the group here at 22% or above on an annual basis?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","22% for the EEBG? Is that what you ask or what?","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah. Electronics & Energy, I mean seasonally it's a little stronger here at 24%. But you've gotten every other segment up 22% and now you've changed the business model there. The volumes are easing. I mean is that kind of a reasonable entitlement view of where that segment should go?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. Shannon, we expect E&E's margin for the total year of 2016 to be about 20% operating income margin. And it remains one of the businesses that we continue to see overweight margin expansion capacity in the coming years. So we're certainly striving to get it up to the company average, and I think you'll see it overweight for margin expansion in the next couple years.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just on this sort of temporary healthcare slowdown that you're seeing, just a little more color on what's driving that. I understand you think it's temporary and it's going to \u2013 you're confident in the future. But is it more channel inventories? Are there specific uncertainties that are driving a pullback? I mean it seemed like it was kind of broad-based.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","In the U.S...","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. I think the reality of business is that it will be both. But it start by people holding back a little bit and then they work down the inventory. But it's not an inventory correction in any sort or shape or form. I think it is yes, that people have a little bit of uncertainty here in the quarter of how this will shake out and then they're ready to go again. So I think it's a normal reaction for anyone around the world when you're going into a period of uncertainty relative to, will there be any changes or policies as you move forward, et cetera. So I'm not too, honestly, I'm not concerned at all \u2013 as I said, and you like to see more growth there of course with the margins we have. But it's not overall concern at all.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Inge G.

Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Morning, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey \u2013 morning \u2013 Inge, I realize you have various industrial initiatives you're working on and you do have easier compares in the fourth quarter and obviously into next year. What about the markets, the broader U.S. industrial markets in which you serve? What do you see happening today in terms of the sequential trend? Is it getting better? Is it flat? Does the end of the quarter get a little softer as some companies experience? What did you see? Again, not your initiatives. I realize you've got initiatives that you're outperforming. But what are your markets industrially doing?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. Well as you saw, the U.S. IPI was negative 80 basis point in the quarter for Q4. So you think about that in terms of there's some negative thing there. But we see indications of positive movement in the industrial space relative to manufacturing. So we are not immune to the overall industry. And when you \u2013 at least what is projected now for the IPI in this was actually in Q3 was down 80 basis point in IPI output. For us, as we move ahead, we will see positive growth in Q4. And if you look into the year as we move ahead, Industrial is going for us over many, many segments if you like. Even into Safety & Graphics, in some pieces also in energy. And we see slightly, slightly positive movements in that total market segment as you move into next year.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I'm sorry, Inge. What indications are you looking at where you say there's positive movement relative to manufacturing? You were talking about the macro. Is that sort of a customer commentary or is it about inventory? Or what exactly are these indications?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. I think it's both. It's like when you work with the customers, you get the indication of they start to see an uptick in order. I cannot comment on inventory. I don't think we have seen any change in inventory, to be honest. And I think it's a okay level at this point in time.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Switching to Electronics & Energy, could you size for us how big your businesses are that would have some sort of a \u2013 would touch in some manner LED or OLED? Like I mean just how big are these businesses? It's like $1 billion, $1.5 billion, something like that?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","John, our electronics business is $3 billion out of the Electronics & Energy business. The display material solutions division within electronics is about 60% of that total, $3 billion, so about $1.8 billion. So, and much of that is connected with LCD but not all of it.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Nick, and what do you believe is the mix today of LED in these applications versus O-L-E-D or OLED?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Well it depends, John, on device. Right now, mobile phones is the most significant device impacted between LCD and OLED. And we see that as approximately 30% OLED today in 2016 and about 70% still LCD.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And the rest are lower in the mix? Is that?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Right. For instance, television, still vast, vast majority LCD or LED. And tablets is a pretty small number there as well.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then just lastly, is the collapse of the British pound actually helping you in terms of your position in Britain and Europe or is it a headwind? Because relative to, I realize that FX, like the hedging gains issue, I'm sort of excluding that just in the context of the pound's collapsed, euro's down. It's not down that much. So all else equal, is this a net positive or a negative for 3M? And maybe you could put it in a context for us.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","John, it's about as close to a net neutral as you can imagine outside of FX. But from a standpoint we make some things in UK that we export, we also import things to UK. So it's very close to net neutral. Just having the pound devalue, that of course has a negative impact, but I think you're asking more the underlying and we're not a gainer or a loser in that.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So you're fairly agnostic to the pound, like if the pound goes to parity, you're going to be really agnostic to that scenario.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","So from a pound perspective, if for a 5% move in the pound, that would be about a $0.015 negative impact on us, just taking the FX impact of our UK. It's about 3% of our total global business. So just to size it up, how the pound movement impacts our total earnings per share.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yes.","Inge G.

Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, gents.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","First of all, Nick, helpful color on the 2017 puts and takes. I'm going to ask you to maybe comment on top line a little bit, because quite a few of your peer group companies are sort of starting to opine on 2017. And I'm wondering, you mentioned the macro sort of sideways which I think is probably in line with expectations. What sort of growth rates do you think 3M can generate in another flat year? And I'm asking in the context of a 3% organic consensus expectation for next year. Is 3% even in play here? Or any comments there would be helpful.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. Nigel, I'll have to ask you to wait until December 13 for more specific numbers on that. But directionally, my comments about the external economy continuing to go sideways, I think that's a fair representation about how we're planning right now. And then incrementally that we see better improved growth in both Industrial and Electronics & Energy. But the actual numbers, let's wait until December 13 to talk about those.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. No, it's worth a try I guess. And then on pricing, I was quite surprised to see Latin America\/Canada still above 5% given that the currency movements are starting to level off year-over-year. So I'm wondering, is that more of an inflationary type of impact that we're seeing with our pricing? And therefore, would that be stickier going forward?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. Nigel, when I look at Latin America and our price growth there, yes. As we saw the real strengthen quite a bit in recent months, but we're still seeing high inflation in the economy in Brazil which is giving us the opportunity to be having price growth that's matching what's going on in the economy. So yes, it's much more around inflation than it is around FX right now.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So plus 5% you think is sustainable going forward?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Sustainable going forward, I probably wouldn't go that far to call that sustainable. A lot depends on what the inflation rate continues to be, and I think that will be influenced by what happens with FX rates in the coming quarters.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So I guess the first question I would have is, given the prospect for sideways growth, which isn't particularly surprising given the macro backdrop we've seen over the past couple of years, does that allow you to do anything differently in terms of your execution of global excellence or SKU rationalization in terms of picking up the pace anywhere? Or do you think it's just kind of steady-state? I mean, does the environment that's presented to you create more opportunities in general on structural restructuring, business transformation or cost take-out to accelerate some actions that you otherwise wouldn't take given the demand environment?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. Well, I think first of all, it's \u2013 I don't think we're in a situation that we were in 2008 or 2009 where really everyone was pushed to do extraordinary things in order to improve the operations because there was no choice. I think we are in a situation now where we can work a model of do it when we can versus when we must, and I think that's an important differentiation to think about it. And everything we are doing now with the type of centralization, if you like, even if it's on a regional base, will help us a lot. And we are, yes, marching forward on that, marching forward in order to make sure that we build an organization for the future for 3M that both can grow and is becoming even more effective relative to operational excellence in the company. So we will go as fast as we can, but we are not taking any risks relative to be able to serve our customers. I think that's the important element.","We are here to deliver to you what you expect, but we're also here of course to deliver to our customers. So I think you have this balance always when you implement new initiatives that you would like to go fast, but you have to make sure that you really understand the implication with the customers. So I think that's the answer to your question, that I and the team here, we are pushing as hard as we can to come as fast as possible to the most effective model, but you have always to think about customer first when you make those changes. But by definition, when you think about what we do in West Europe now, in terms of our inventories and so forth, yeah, of course it will be less SKUs because you consolidate inventories at fewer places et cetera. And that will roll out, and I'm sure that you have heard, and I know you have relative to our footprint initiatives that is, both in terms of manufacturing sites and in terms of distribution centers. So the answer is we are going as fast as we can, but we are not jeopardizing our service level to the customers.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that, and just one brief follow-up. I guess in terms of the growth for sideways for 2017, it is what it is and we're going to get more color on that on the December 13 Analyst Day. However, are there \u2013 going in terms of the setup for your portfolio right now and kind of dovetailing the comments you made in your prepared remarks, are there certain segments that you think you can significantly outgrow the end markets that present themselves through product introductions? Is there a set of cards that you like with respect to your portfolio, specifically to 2017 or 2018 where you think you have capability for significant outgrowth?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. Well, you know, if you think about our business model, we have a proven model that we are able to outgrow IPI and\/or GDP by 1.5x IPI or GDP. That is of course not happening every year, so but if you look upon it for 10 years, we have been able to do that. With all initiatives that we have taken in the company relative to the portfolio, relative to improved commercialization processes, et cetera, we should be able to do slightly better than that as we move ahead. I don't make a distinction in between certain segments that some will outperform more than others. We should be able to outperform at least 1.5x, maybe 1.7x as we move ahead in every segment we compete in because that is the expectation. That's why we are there. If we don't do that, we are not relevant in that segment to our customers, and then we have to do something different. So the other comment I would like to make is we cannot predict when a turnaround is coming in the economy. We cannot predict that. I don't think anyone can. One thing I would like you to know, we are ready. We are ready with everything we have done the last couple of years in terms of the portfolio, terms of the structure, in terms of stepping up the investment in research and development from 5.5% closer to 6% and the supply chain model, enabled by business transformation that all start and end with the customers. We are ready. So when it comes, we are ready in the forefront to capitalize on that.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","Inge G.

But did you also repatriate as much cash as you had talked about last quarter?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. Deane, we've \u2013 as you know, we typically set a repatriation plan at the beginning of the year. We sometimes modify that if anything \u2013 well, it's gone up slightly of what we're repatriating from what our plans were at the beginning of the year. So it's eked up a little but not significantly, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it.

What segments were those addressing and do you plan to do more there?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. The strategic investments that we had in the third quarter, some of them touch multiple businesses including Health Care and Industrial in the third quarter. And in total, we're still expecting that we're going to accelerate that pace throughout the year in 2016. It's been ramping up each quarter.

Can you peel back a little bit what you're seeing in China in terms of end markets or your business lines which are getting better versus worse and how you're thinking about competitive pressure in the wake of ongoing SOE reform?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Laurence. Yeah. Well first of all, if you take our operation in China, we, ex-Electronic, we have 4% organic local currency growth in the quarter. If you take in Electronics into it which actually was down 11%, we were down 2 percentage for China. Now, if there is a clear improvement is what I will consider domestic-driven businesses. So if you take the five business groups for us in China, SGBG grew 18%, Consumer 12%, Health Care 8%, and Industrial 2%. And then Electronic & Energy was down. But if you think about that, we had four or five business groups in China growing. And it was very much in consumer healthcare, automotive aftermarket, automotive OEM, and personal safety.","So I think that what we have talked about for quite some time about, so it's not really a shift to try to grow out the domestic businesses. It's coming but on the other hand it's a little bit slower we think versus the original plan. But if you think about that whole business; if you take the electronic part which is very much in Asia and in China, we had a 4% growth in China. You will like it to be 12% but it's 4%, and it's the biggest subsidiary outside of United States for us. So I am slightly positive as we move ahead relative to China.","Now, that theme is driving productivity big-time. The model there today versus five years ago is different. Everything was about growth. We grew 15% to 20% year-over-year. We don't any longer. We grow 4%, so now productivity is a key element for us and I think that's important. We have good margins and we continue to expand margin there. So I hope that helps in terms of explaining China.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And just competitive pressure in any areas where you're seeing any real shift that matters?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","No, I think you have over year seen more domestic businesses or companies type of stepping up and I would say in all honesty, some segments which is maybe more commoditized, it could be a challenge. And for us, as you know, we work very much with technology conversion and with brand equity, so it's less impact for us. But of course there is this competition and I would say I would more relate that maybe to local companies that try to build coming into the market. Mostly, I would say in commodity-related businesses, meaning it's a price game, it's not a performance game and you have to ask yourself at the end of the day if you are 3M would you like to play in that area? Because as I said, in EEBG I'd rather fire some SKUs if I don't make money and have lower growth but better margin.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in at the end here.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Steve.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Hi. Good morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. So I didn't quite get the answer on electronics for next year, you said it's going to be better but does that mean growth?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah, Steve, I'm going to leave it just as we expect it to be better. We'll talk more in December 13 of what we see for the total growth range for Electronics & Energy in 2017.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's fair. What's going on in Health Care? 1.5% comp was a little bit lighter than I expected. Anything particular than tough comp to last year? Is it the Health Information Systems business that's maybe seeing a bit of hiccup after the strategic evaluation? What \u2013 would you point to anything in Health Care we should be watching over the next couple quarters?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","No. As I said earlier on the call, it's basically United States the type of temper itself for the quarter, so I wouldn't be overly concerned about that. As I said earlier, you had some developing market, like Brazil, I think we saw a slowdown as well, but more than that, it's I wouldn't be overly concerned about it and I am not. And I think that's maybe the best piece for me to be in it, that I'm not overly concerned. But as I said, maybe in Q4 we will see equal quarter to Q3 until some uncertainty is in place.","But as you see, we continue to invest. I told you about we did one acquisition in Switzerland for Health Information System, and then we also signed a partnership with Verily, both Verily and 3M, two very creative dynamic companies that are building out platforms. So we look very, very positively to not only Health Information System but all businesses in that business group.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","One last quick one just on Q4. Nick, I think the implied price cost margin tailwind is about 40 basis points if I back into the 100 basis points you're guiding to for the year given you've been above that so far for the year. Is that about the right number for the fourth quarter? Is that just conservatism or is that kind of a new solid run rate to expect going forward, just trying to split the goalpost there a little bit?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah, Steve, we have been seeing the benefits from raw materials slipping as we move from quarter to quarter. The 40 basis points where you're doing the math of coming out with 100 basis points, I'd call that more just a function of rounding where the actual math might come out a little higher than that and we're just rounding it to approximately 100 basis points. I wouldn't over read that Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. That makes sense. That's sort of our job to over read everything, sorry. Thanks. Talk to you soon.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Thanks.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing the 3M playbook and preparing our company for the future. As you know, we have done a lot of work over the last several years to adjust our portfolio, improve our cost structure, enhance our technology capabilities and make us even more relevant to customers. So while the macro environment is challenging at the moment, we are positioned well for when global growth conditions improve. This is true both for developed and developing markets where we have the experience, the market position and depth of capabilities to capitalize on the win as their economies recover.","With that, I think you for joining us this morning, and we're looking forward to see you in New York on December 13.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded Tuesday, July 26, 2016.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2016 Business Review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and CEO, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments and then we'll take your questions.","As a reminder, please mark your calendars for upcoming earnings call dates, October 25 and January 24. Also take note of our next Investor Meeting, scheduled for December 13. More details will be available as we get closer to that date.","Today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important Risk Factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please turn to slide three and I'll hand it off to Inge.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, marked by our highest quarterly earnings per share in 3M history, driven by increased margins. At the same time, we were active in deploying capital to both invest in the long-term success of our enterprise and return cash to our shareholders.","Looking at the numbers, earnings were $2.08 per share, up 3% year over year. Organic sales were down slightly, at minus 20 basis points. Our two domestic-driven businesses once again paced our company's organic growth in the quarter. Health Care posted 5% growth, with positive growth in all businesses and geographic areas. And Consumer grew 3%, driven by strong performance in our Command, Filtrete, and Post-it products. Safety & Graphics also delivered solid growth, while Industrial was down slight, low-single digits.","Organic growth in Electronics & Energy declined in the high-single digits, as we communicated during the second quarter. That business continues to be impacted by weaker demand and elevated channel inventories in the consumer electronics market. Acquisitions net of divestitures added more than 1 percentage point to our sales, while the strong U.S. dollar reduced sales by similar amount. As a result, we delivered total sales of $7.7 billion in the quarter.","In a global environment that remains uncertain, our team continues to focus on driving efficient growth and premium returns. In the second quarter, we delivered healthy margins of 24.4%, up 50 basis points year over year. Four of our five business groups posted margins above 23%, including Health Care at 33% and Safety & Graphics at 27%, demonstrating the breadth of our strength.","Our ability to generate premium returns along with strong free cash flow enables us to consistently invest in the business while also returning cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we invested 10% of sales into the combination of research and development and capital expenditure, which is important to our business model and bolsters our foundation for the future. Also with an eye on the future, we continued to make good progress on Business Transformation, which is one of our three key levers.","At our Investor Day in March, you heard me talk about Customer First, an initiative that is ingrained in everything we do, including Business Transformation. It is all about making it easier and quicker for our customers to do business with us everywhere around the world. To-date, we have deployed our ERP system, which is the backbone of our Business Transformation, in a dozen countries as well as in four of our largest European distribution centers.","Most recently, in the second quarter we had two successful rollouts in West Europe, specifically in our operations in Austria and Switzerland. We have also expanded the scale and impact of our three Global Service Centers located in Costa Rica, Poland, and Philippines. Through these centers, we are building a platform for operational efficiencies today and into the future.","Business Transformation is strengthening our company; it starts and ends with our customers and has significant long-term benefits. We expect to result at $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and $0.5 billion reduction in working capital. In summary, we had a good performance in the second quarter in terms of increased margins, strong earnings and investments in the business while also returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","With that, I will turn the call over to Nick, who will take you through more of the details. Nick?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments on slide four with a summary of our Q2 sales performance. Organic local currency sales declined 0.2% in the second quarter, with volumes down 1.3% and selling prices up 1.1%. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.4 percentage points to our sales. This includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana, net of three small divestitures. Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.5%. In dollar terms, worldwide sales declined 0.3% versus the second quarter of 2015.","Organic growth in the United States was up 0.4%, with solid performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely, Health Care and Consumer, as well as in Safety & Graphics. Similar to first quarter, U.S. manufacturing activity remained soft in Q2. This, combined with continued weakness in the oil and gas end market, impacted portions of our Industrial business.","In Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 5.4%. Strong growth from our Health Care and Consumer businesses was more than offset by a double-digit decline in Electronics & Energy as we continued to experience soft end-market demand and channel inventory adjustments in consumer electronics. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 1% in Japan and 7% in China\/Hong Kong. Excluding our electronics-related businesses, Japan was up 2% and China\/Hong Kong down 2%.","Moving to EMEA. We posted organic growth of 3% in the quarter, led by West Europe. We delivered growth across all businesses in West Europe. From a country perspective, growth was led by Germany and France. Finally, organic growth in Latin America\/Canada increased 4.8%, with Canada up 6% and Mexico up 5%, while Brazil declined 2%.","Please turn to slide five for the second quarter P&L highlights. Second quarter sales were $7.7 billion and earnings were $2.08 per share. Operating margins improved by 50 basis points year on year to 24.4%, an all-time record margin for the second quarter. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices contributed 130 basis points to our margin improvement, while lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by another 110 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year's fourth quarter restructuring expanded margins by an additional 40 basis points.","Lower year-on-year organic volumes, inventory declines and related utilization impacts reduced margins by 110 basis points. The lower utilization was most pronounced in Electronics and, to a lesser extent, Industrial. Foreign currency translation impacts net of hedge gains decreased margins by 30 basis points. Strategic investments also reduced margins by 30 basis points, as we accelerated growth investments and took actions to further optimize our manufacturing footprint. As a reminder, we expect the impact of strategic investments to increase in the second half of the year.","Finally, legal and other factors reduced margins by 60 basis points in the quarter, 50 basis points of which related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on a long-standing insurance claim. For reference, our Q2 corporate and unallocated expense was up $47 million sequentially, primarily due to this unfavorable arbitration ruling. For the full year, we expect corporate and unallocated expense to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million.","Let's now turn to slide six for a look at EPS. We posted earnings of $2.08 per share in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year. Margin expansion net of organic sales declines contributed $0.04 to our earnings per share improvement. First year acquisitions and divestitures added another $0.03 to earnings, driven by solid performances from both Capital Safety and Membrana.","Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pre-tax earnings by $40 million, or the equivalent of $0.04 a share. The second quarter tax rate was 29.6% versus 28.1% in last year's comparable quarter, which decreased Q2 earnings by $0.04. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year on year, which added $0.07 to second quarter EPS.","Please turn to slide seven for a look at our cash flow performance. Operating cash flow was $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Our strong cash flow enables us to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. CapEx investments in Q2 totaled $323 million, and we continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. These investments drive organic growth, strengthen our manufacturing technologies and support business transformation.","Free cash flow conversion was 75% in the quarter, similar to last year. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders, including $672 million in dividends, up $26 million year on year. We also returned $828 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases. Through the first half of 2016, we have repurchased $2.1 billion of our own shares. We continue to anticipate full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion.","Let's now review each of our business groups, starting on slide eight. Our Industrial business group posted sales of $2.6 billion in the second quarter. Organic growth was down 1.4%, reflecting the continued economic challenges in the global industrial sector. Positive Q2 growth in Latin America\/Canada and EMEA was more than offset by declines in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. As mentioned earlier, manufacturing activity in the U.S. remained soft in Q2, which impacted parts of our Industrial business.","Looking across our Industrial business group, our automotive OEM business grew high single digits again this quarter and continued to outpace global car and light truck builds. We also posted mid-single digit organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business, which is gaining share in the collision and auto care markets. Advanced materials declined year on year, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market. On a related positive note, this business was recently awarded a $93 million body armor contract from the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to be realized over the next 18 months.","Acquisitions net of divestitures added 2.6% to Industrial sales growth in the quarter. This figure represents the Membrana acquisition net of the recent Polyfoam divestiture. Membrana continues to deliver strong results, exceeding its financial objectives since acquisition. The business continues to expand its geographic presence, which includes recent contract wins with two life science customers in China. Finally, our Industrial business delivered operating income of $615 million in Q2 and margins rose 30 basis points to 23.4%.","Please turn to slide nine. Safety & Graphics delivered a solid quarter, with sales of $1.5 billion and organic growth of 2.3%. Our roofing granules business posted another strong quarter of double-digit organic growth, as demand increased in the replacement shingle market. Commercial solutions also delivered a solid quarter, with notable strength in EMEA and the U.S. Within this business, new product sales in architectural markets and floor care products boosted the organic growth.","Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.6% to sales growth in the quarter. This figure includes Capital Safety net of two small divestitures. The Capital Safety business is already benefiting from access to our company's 46 core technology platforms. For example, the team recently leveraged two of those platforms to create and launch a new detachable self-rescue fall protection device.","On a geographic basis, organic growth in Safety & Graphics was led by Latin America\/Canada and the U.S. at mid-single digits, while Asia-Pacific declined year on year. Operating income was $411 million and operating margins increased 2 percentage points to 27.4%. Profits in this business continued to be boosted by recent portfolio management actions along with solid productivity efforts.","Please turn to slide 10. Our Health Care business delivered another strong quarter across the entire portfolio. Sales increased 3% to $1.4 billion and organic growth was 4.9%, which once again led the company. As Inge mentioned, organic growth was broad based, with all businesses and geographic areas up year on year.","By geography, Latin America\/Canada and Asia-Pacific each posted high-single digit growth in the quarter. Health Care also generated high-single digit organic growth in developing countries, with strong contributions from China\/Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. Looking by business, organic growth was led by food safety, health information systems, and medical consumables. Operating income was $460 million, up 4.3% year over year and margins remain strong, at 32.7%.","Next I will cover Electronics & Energy on slide 11. Second quarter sales in Electronics & Energy were $1.2 billion, down 9.1% organically. Organic sales on the Electronics side of the business were down 14%. We continue to be impacted by weak end-market demand across most consumer electronics applications. At the same time, channel inventories continue to adjust and we expect these challenges to persist into the second half of the year.","Our Energy-related businesses declined 2% organically, with growth in Telecom being more than offset by declines in electrical markets and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double digits in Asia-Pacific, impacted by the declines in electronics.","Second quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $229 million, with margins of 19.3%. As mentioned earlier, during Q2 we took actions within Electronics & Energy to better position the business going forward. These actions reduced Q2 margins in this business by 80 basis points. Adjusting for these actions, underlying margins were 20.1%. In light of continued end-market challenges, we now expect full year 2016 organic sales in Electronics & Energy to decline by high-single digits.","Please turn to slide 12, where I will cover our Consumer business. Consumer had another solid quarter, with sales of $1.1 billion and organic growth of 2.7%. Organic sales growth was led by our home improvement and consumer health care businesses. Recent accelerated growth investments in Command damage-free mounting products and ScotchBlue painter's tape continue to pay off, driving strong double-digit organic growth in both cases. Filtrete filters continued to gain share and delivered strong growth in the quarter.","In our Consumer Health Care business, we're driving strong growth in our FUTURO line of compression solutions, health braces, and supports. The back-to-school season got off to a good start in the second quarter, led by strong sales of Post-it and Command solutions. Geographically, Consumer's organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific along with solid growth in the U.S. Operating income was $281 million, with operating margins of 24.9%. Solid organic growth, prioritization of investments and productivity efforts contributed to strong margin performance in the quarter.","That wraps up my formal comments. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge. Inge?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Nick. As I look across our enterprise, each of our businesses is facing slightly different market realities, yet all of them are executing very well. Six months into the year, four of our five business groups are growing in line with our expectations entering the year. And for reasons we have stated, Electronics & Energy is growing below those expectations.","As a result, today we're updating our planning estimates for 2016. Organic growth is now estimated to be 0% to 1% against previous guidance of 1% to 3%. With respect to earnings per share, we are raising the low end of our guidance from $8.10 to $8.15 and adjusting the high end from $8.45 to $8.30, resulting in an expected increase of 8% to 10% year on year.","We anticipate foreign currency to reduce 2016 sales by 1% to 2% versus the prior estimate reduction of 1% to 3%. And our full year tax rate is now expected to be 29% to 29.5% versus the previous range of 29.5% to 30.5%. Finally, there is no change to our free cash flow conversion range, which remains 95% to 105%.","With that, I thank you for your attention. And we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. One moment, please, while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Andrew.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So your price versus raw materials actually went up in 2Q to 1.3% from 1.1% in 1Q. We know you've talked about your benefit from price versus raw materials actually being front-half loaded this year, but pricing's been trending a little higher than you thought. Raw materials, have they still been a little lower than you thought? You did get positive pricing in the U.S. after nothing last quarter and really after you spoke about increased competitive environment in the U.S. So did you see an improvement in the pricing environment in the U.S. in particular?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Andy, there's several things you're asking there. For the second quarter and then I'll expand it to talk about the total year for price raw materials, we, as I said earlier, saw 130 basis points of margin expansion from that, up slightly from where we were in the first quarter. Of that 130 basis points, 90 basis points is related to lower year-on-year commodity prices and the other 40 basis points is coming from our pricing growth that we see not related to FX movement.","Our total price growth that we posted this year, we still see the majority of that coming from adjustments we're making in pricing related to FX movement. But once we strip that out, we still see 40 basis points of core price growth that we're seeing in our business and we don't see a reason for that to change as we look into the second half. If you remember, Andrew, over a long period of time, we see our range for that core price growth being between 30 basis points and 50 basis points.","So as I look at this for the total year, we now expect the combination of price raw materials to be benefiting our margin by approximately 100 basis points. Six months ago I was saying I expected it to be about 50 basis points, but we're seeing some improvement in commodity prices from what we were anticipating for the second half of the year and pricing is slightly better than what we had expected.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful, Nick. And, Inge, when you look at the goals that you set out at the Analyst Day, the 2% to 5% organic growth over the next several years, $500 million to $700 million in business transformation, $125 million to $175 million of factory optimization, then you think about the current environment where you may record pretty marginal organic growth this year, does it change your urgency at all around your cost-out initiatives? Can you accelerate these initiatives at all or find more cost out if we're in a lower for longer growth environment?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we are focusing on that the whole time, as you know. And answer to it, yes, of course, we have to do it if that is what will be demanded. Now, we are very early, as you know, into that five-year plan. Basically two quarters. But I think we have to look upon it as we roll out if there's something that needs to be done in specific segments or pockets. And if you look upon it today, four of our five business groups are, at this point in time, just in line with the expectation we had for this year.","The one that have a challenge based on end markets is Electronics & Energy. And we have done a lot in that business group the last couple of years. So it's like \u2013 it's not a surprise for us that there are changes in that market. We have addressed it the whole time. And we will do that everywhere as we go ahead. But when I look upon it in terms of how solid the four business groups are executing the plan at this point in time, I hope that we don't need to take drastic action in those businesses.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Inge.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Joe.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Inge, maybe just touch on China for a second. Excluding Electronics, China\/Hong Kong was down 2% this quarter. So it seems like you're seeing some weakness across some of your other businesses. So maybe talk a little bit about that. And also across the portfolio, if you can just touch on touch on trends, whether trends got better or worse as the quarter progressed.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think, first of all, in total China, in our portfolio there based on how that has been built over the years based on the China market, which was, I would say, very much related initially to export for them, we have a bigger portion there which is Electronics and Industrial. And for reasons that we know relative to that market have been slower, maybe the last two years now when we start to look upon it, nothing's changed there by definition this quarter more than more pressure in Electronics.","Consumer and Health Care is doing very well for us. So when you look into that, Consumer had 9% growth, and Health Care, 11% growth. So if you look upon that, it's like 9% to 11% growth in domestic businesses. That's very good. Also when you look upon Industrial, Industrial improved a little bit. But to be honest, I'm not happy with the growth rate we see for Industrial in China. So we need to see more from Industrial, and I think it's coming as we move ahead.","China for us, and I talk for 3M now, we have been very, very precisely driving our productivity improvement there for the last, I would say, for six quarters we have focused a lot on productivity improvements. So underlining results in China is good for us. We need to get more growth as that market turns around. The encouraging thing is that domestic businesses is going very, very well for us at this point in time.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the underlying trends, did things get better or worse as the quarter progressed?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't know about the quarter specifically. But in my view, we will see, based on comp as well, we will see China do slightly better as we move ahead. But think about China for the year flat as we end up the year.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then maybe, Nick, one follow-up. I just want to make sure I understand all the puts and takes, especially as we get into 4Q on the margin side. It looks like your margins can be up at least 250 basis points, 300 basis points because you did all those restructuring actions in 4Q of last year. So maybe step us through the puts and takes for 4Q. I just want to make sure I have them straight.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Oh, for just fourth quarter? Yeah. The biggest put and take in the fourth quarter will be the comparison to fourth quarter last year, which had a restructuring. Other puts and takes will continue to be getting benefits from price raw materials. Strategic investments, as I've mentioned earlier, will be larger in the second half than it was in the first half, so that'll be part of the puts and takes. But the biggest driver that's going to change is going to be the year-on-year impact of not repeating the restructuring that we had in fourth quarter of 2015.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And we can go through the color offline. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob McCarthy of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Rob.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning, Rob.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, a couple questions specifically on your European exposure. Obviously, you had very strong results, particularly led by Western Europe in the quarter. But given recent geopolitical events, Brexit, et cetera, could you speak as to what you've been seeing in your shorter cycle businesses there?","And then the follow-up, and there won't be a follow-up from here so it will just be two parts and I will get off the phone, is just longer term, as you think about your ERP and other initiatives and potential SKU rationalization, do you have to rethink that in the context of an extended break-up of the eurozone? In other words, will you have to change your long-term strategy there? Because there is a strategy for further cost take-out, but I think the tacit assumption is continued economic integration of the eurozone.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, this is Inge. So, first of all, UK for us is less than 3% as an enterprise in terms of revenue. And we had a very good result this quarter in West Europe, as you saw, with 3% organic local currency growth with all business groups growing, which is very, very nice to see, to be honest. So we had Industrial at 3%, we had SGBG 2%, we had Health Care, 5%, we had EEBG 5%, and we had Consumer 2%. If you think about Europe and put that in perspective with what we have to do, there's no reason for us to change strategy around Europe.","Our strategy has always been to have localization in terms of execution based on languages. And, number two, build up a very strong backbone relative to resources what we now do with ERP. And we have worked for long time in order to reduce the layers in organization and management groups. And we have regionalized Europe over three years ago. So we don't have subsidiaries in every country any longer. We work on regions. So we have reduced the cost very much in terms of administration, helping the businesses with execution centrally and then execute locally with the teams in every country.","There is no reason for us to change the strategy in Europe based on the outcome of the Brexit. No reason for us to do that. The other thing that is very nice for us to see is the margin expansion that is coming for us in West Europe as well. And as I said before, when some of you have asked around which business group can add more margin expansion to you as we move forward, the answer has always been all of them, because all of them are part of West Europe. And West Europe's margins are now starting to increase in a nice way. So we're very pleased with the performance there.","There is issues in Europe. But you know what? There's issues everywhere around the world. And you have just to stay the course and adjust if you need. But the Brexit short-term for us doesn't mean anything, to be honest, based on our operation. And I don't see a reason at this point in time to change the laid-out plan we have for Europe.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you very much.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Just on the buyback, as you said, I think you spent around $2 billion in the first half. I see you're running at sort of the low end of the full year placeholder. Is there anything interesting in that? Or is it the fact that the share price obviously bounced a decent amount from where you were buying in Q1? Should we read anything into your M&A appetite? And maybe just touch on how you're thinking about M&A right now, because it's been a while since things like Capital Safety were enacted.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Julian, I don't think you should over-read it. We started the year and we continue to have a range of $4 billion to $6 billion. And with $2.1 billion through the first half of the year, we're currently tracking to the low end of the range.","The pace and the amount of the repurchases is dependent on demands of capital, such as for M&A, and it's also dependent on the relative value we see in the stock price. Our model is sensitive to share price. And the range that we put out allows flexibility with our capital allocation decisions.","So in short, I'd say, Julian, don't over-read anything in our $4 billion to $6 billion range. We're just holding to that right now partly because there's a lot of uncertainties that can happen in the second half of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then my follow-up would just be on the margin guide for the year. Apologies if I missed it. But are you still guiding for about 150 bps of increase for the year? And then just a quick corollary of that would be should we think that Q2's increase of 50 bps year-on-year is the low point in terms of margin increase and Q3 should see a bigger increase year-on-year?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Julian, for the year, we're in the range of 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin expansion. Some puts and takes in there. The price raw materials we're seeing is slightly better than we did at the beginning of the year. And the lower volume and related lower utilization of assets is the negative impacting that margin. So 100 basis points to 150 basis points for the year. We consider the first and the fourth quarter to be the quarters with the most margin expansion and second and third quarter to be the two lower quarters of margin expansion.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, gents.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. So obviously the biggest delta on full year guidance at the top line is due to E&E. I think I understand that. I think, Inge, you mentioned that all of the four segments are tracking in line with plan. Obviously, Industrial's tracking a bit lower than the 0% to 3% year-to-date. Do you still see a credible path back to positive growth in Industrial in the back half of the year?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yes, I do. And part of that is, of course, how we will be compared to last year. But we see us performing better in the second half of the year in Industrial versus we have done in the first part of the year. We had a challenge this quarter specifically in United States for Industrial, and that will come back as we move forward into Q3 and Q4.","When you look upon the guidance in total, we see Health Care and Consumer continue to perform very well. The same with Safety & Graphics, which I've talked about earlier, is the business that will be the next breakout business. And I think we saw it this quarter that it's now coming full speed. And then Electronics & Energy, as we have talked about, will be, as Nick said and I said as well, we will see decline for the year in that business to high single digits. And then Industrial, I think due to the comparison, will do slightly better for us.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, the comp will get easier in 4Q for sure.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But we have put the guidance now 0% to 1% for the company. It's very much related to Electric & Energy (sic) [Electronics & Energy] (41:12).","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. And then for Nick, UTX just sort of softly cautioned on pension for next year based on where those current rates are today. You're obviously very pension sensitive as well. I'm just wondering if you snap a line today on discount rates, what sort of pension headwind could we be looking at next year?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, for our pension expense, if we snapped the rates right now, it would become a headwind for us in 2017. It's really too early with five and a half more months to go before that gets set, so I'm not going to comment on the magnitude of it. But if we stopped right now, it would be a headwind for us in 2017.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. And good morning, all.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Steven.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just to put a finer point on the answer to Nigel's question. I guess this is the third quarter of negative organic growth. Do you actually \u2013 if you think about next quarter versus the fourth quarter, are you expecting growth to at least \u2013 organic local currency growth to go positive in the third quarter still?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Steven, let me take that one. As we progress through the year, third quarter, we could be similar to what we saw in the second quarter for organic growth to slightly better. We'll see, as Inge mentioned, improving trends in Industrial more driven by comps. But we will continue to see declines in our Electronics & Energy business.","The fourth quarter, based in our view right now, is where we'll see the most significant year-on-year comp benefits for our organic growth, which will propel us into the 0% to 1% range. But the third quarter I wouldn't be looking for a dramatic turnaround from the growth rates that we've seen in the second quarter.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful. And then just one detail point. How much did you actually end up spending then on restructuring compared to that $20 million placeholder you had talked about?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, three months ago I said that we expected that expense to be approximately $20 million. As we progressed through the quarter, we executed on all the actions we planned, the price tag for that came in closer to $10 million than to $20 million. We found some ways to do it more efficiently so it ended up being a slight benefit from what we were thinking.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But with the same payback dollars?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Exact same payback that we're expecting. This will pay for itself this year.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi. Good morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just remind us where you guys stand on the foreign exchange hedging. I know that there's a bit of a carryover some years. If you just held the line at $1.10, would you have any kind of carryover from hedging next year?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","As we go into next year, Steve, if things just stayed where they were, the biggest impact we'd have on our earnings in 2017 would be the diminishment of our hedging gains. So we're experiencing hedging gains this year of approximately $100 million. If FX did not move, that $100 million would drop substantially. There'd still be slight gains in 2017, but minimal.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just on the pension, just remind us what the sensitivity is. You don't have to give us a number for next year. But just every 25 bps, what's the expense headwind?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is a little dated, Steve. But at one time, the sensitivity was about $1 million for every basis point.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. On the Safety & Graphics margins, a lot going your way this quarter. Capital Safety, looked like roofing granules had a good quarter. But you talked about it as the next breakout business, too, Inge. So I'm just trying to figure out with margins up here 27% plus, is this a particularly favorable quarter mix-wise in other things? Or is this a ramp that we expect to continue?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, first of all, we have done a lot in that business relative to the portfolio. And it's an ongoing process. And I think that is now what we see the benefit on. When we started that process quite some years back when we start really to look upon what we call underperforming businesses, which is the standard is very high, as you know, inside of 3M when you're running at those type of margins. I think the guys have done a fantastic job relative to sort out low margin businesses that were inside of certain division in that group.","And we also, as you know, we divested some businesses, which was a converter business in France relative to license plates that was not strategically important. And, by the way, we are not a converter in that industry. So I think that when you start to add things together with building out the strength in position with addition of Capital Safety to our Personal Safety business and then you look upon the whole Graphics side and the Transportation side in terms of the work they have done in order to work on the mix, that is the outcome of the result.","We expect this business to continue to grow and accelerate growth, in fact. And we should be able to run the margins around this area at this point in time as we move forward. And, please \u2013 our leader there, Frank Little, he had told me that he's very confident that he can do that.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then on Electronics. So the weak volumes and the excess inventory has been going on for a long time. Looks like they're going to continue. And when do you expect Electronics to return to growth? And are you still comfortable with the strategic positioning there beyond the near-term volume challenges?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, to start with your last question, the answer is yes. And the Electronic business is a good business for us to be in. We're a material science company and the strengths of our capabilities in that market is very, very strong. So from a strategic perspective, there is no question mark for me.","And when you look upon the four fundamentals that we have in the company in terms of technology, manufacturing capabilities and geographical reach plus brand equity, it's very, very good for us. And as we all know, in terms of Electronics, it's growing generally speaking. And we are all touched by it every day in what we do. So that is what 3M should be.","So the answer to that question is, yes, it is a place for us to be. And as you have seen, we have adjusted our structure the whole time as that market is a little bit volatile. But as you know, volatility also has an upside and we will be there to capitalize on that when it comes. I don't think we will see anything this year in terms of change. So I think we have to wait until some time in 2017 before we will see growth, specifically in consumer electronic taking place.","Now, there is something called automotive electronics that is accelerating more and more. We make specific investment there in order to capture that as we move ahead. So I will say that it's a volatile market as we speak. The team is doing an outstanding job. And you saw again here, we had 80 basis points in terms of restructuring for the quarter. You take that out, they were running over 20% again in the quarter.","So despite pressure on volume, the structure is done now to be able to deliver around 20% of operating income for the company. For me, that's good. So I compliment their team for what they are doing in terms of efficiency in a tougher situation. And they're all preparing for when the upturn is coming. And I would like it to come soon, but I don't think we can see it 2016. But 2017 will soon be here anyhow.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. If I look at your margin walk, organic volume was a big drag. And as I look historically, I think it's the biggest one I have in a while. Can you just talk about the fact that given the organic growth was close to zero, why the volume drag was so big? I would imagine it relates to the consumer electronics business in Asia. But is that what we should expect going forward, the disproportionate impact?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Andrew. I'll take that. As you look at our margin walk for Q2, what we're calling that is organic volume and utilization. And that's a little different from how it was last quarter where we had those two separated out. So what's driving the utilization negative impact? First of all, having the organic growth down 20 basis points. That's part of that.","We also saw \u2013 we reduced our inventories in the second quarter, which has little lower throughput through our manufacturing facilities. And then the third and probably most significant of these is lower asset utilization in our Electronics business and, to a lesser extent, in our Industrial business. Those are the main things going on.","During the second half, we expect the asset utilization to improve, but not necessarily to be positive impact on the margin. It will improve, and that's aligned with our expectation full year operating margin expansion for the year being between 100 basis points and 150 basis points.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a follow-up question on Health Care. You're posting 5% organic growth. Can you just talk about your internal efforts to dedicate more resources internally to Health Care? How sustainable is this growth? If there is a structural change in the rate of growth now that you dedicate more assets internally? And is there ability to dedicate even more resources to accelerate this growth?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, this is Inge. We had made a commitment many years back to accelerate the investment in Health Care. And that is what is paying off. And when I look across every geographical area in every sense we are growing \u2013 when I look up on the sheet that I have in front of me for Health Care, we are growing every place around the world except for in Brazil. And it's very remarkable in a way that the way we're able to take market share and grow in most of the segments. And, again, food safety led the growth with 12% in the quarter and it's broad based. And the same is going for the oral care business, it's growing very well.","So there's a broad base for us in terms of growth. And we are, as you'll recall, we decided to not only keep Health Information Systems, but also accelerate investment into that business. So it's a very high priority for us. And we are making investment in most, if not all, of the divisions there as we move ahead.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Deane.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Nick. Can we start with you on the tax expectation that you've lowered it slightly? Last quarter, we talked about tax would be actually higher in the back half of the year. You were going to do some repatriating of cash. Are you still doing that? Is this a net effect? And where does the cash repatriation stand today?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Deane, when I guided last quarter, our expectation for tax rate for the remaining quarters of the year and for the total year, it was also at a time that we had adopted the new accounting standard on the way tax benefits are treated on the income statement related to employee stock-based compensation. Our view at that time was the majority of that benefit would be coming in the first quarter and that with our cash repatriation plans we'd be seeing a higher tax rate in the second, third and fourth quarter.","As far as the cash movement, that continues according to our plan. The difference that we saw during the second quarter is due to the strong 3M stock performance, we saw increased benefit coming from that adoption of the accounting standards through increased employee stock option exercises. And that brought our tax rate down lower than what we were expecting for the second quarter. And that's the driver for why we lowered our tax rate guidance for the entire year.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. I'd call that a high-quality problem. And then for Inge. Maybe you can give us an update with a bit more specifics on Membrana. The slide called out you're exceeding financial expectations. Maybe a sense about how many businesses is Membrana expected to touch? You made a reference that Capital Safety is being rolled out to \u2013 there's 46 different product areas. I would imagine Membrana has probably higher potential to touch more 3M businesses. So maybe an update on Membrana, both from the financial standpoint and new products.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, first of all, the integration is going very well and we have, as you know, first of all, it's relative to the purification business where we tried it integrate that as fast as we can. And I think first things first, make sure we integrate it into 3M, make sure we can capitalize on what we can do together with purification business and then build it out as we go.","I will not give you an exact number relative to how many businesses because I think it's more relative to platforms where you can use it. And I think about specifically going into Health Care and all that area where I think is big opportunity. So you think about that, you should be able to use it in Industrial applications, but you should also be able to use it in application that is specifically into Health Care.","In terms of the growth rate, we grew that 5% in this quarter and we think it's like 8% plus for the year. And I think you will see the benefits in terms of all the synergy that we can drive. So I cannot give you exactly a number on divisions. But think about it as bigger platforms, both in Industrial and in Health Care specifically.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I got on a little late, Inge, so I apologize if you covered this. But I just wanted to touch on what's going on in auto. Can you give a little more color on your performance in the quarter? And can you scale for us the magnitude of the outgrowth that you're seeing in the business relative to production builds?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, first of all, automotive again did very well for us. And we had 7% growth versus auto car builds of 3%. So again, we outperformed.","And when I look upon it on a geographical base, we were strong everywhere. We were strong everywhere around the world. I think maybe a little bit versus comparison earlier, maybe down a little bit in Mexico versus what we have seen before. But more than that, we saw good growth everywhere, including Germany. Generally speaking, we had a very good quarter in Germany, and that's very encouraging. We grew 5% in Germany in the quarter as a total enterprise, and automotive was part of that as well.","So to answer your question, 7% up for automotive OEM versus car builds of 3%.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then if you look forward, Inge, based on production plans and content that you know you have in hand, would you expect that 4% type of differential to hold into the next year or two? Do you have visibility on that?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I expect that to hold as we move ahead. The advantage for us is that we can expand the application on the car. So we don't sell four tires. There's only four tires on a car and then maybe one spare tire. So if that's your model, you have a limitation. Our limitation is not there. So we can expand applications on the car. So I will say the penetration level that that group is driving for us is very impressive in the way I look upon it. And I expect good results from them as we move ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, everyone. Good morning.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Hey, Nick. So I want to go back to the ASU 2016-09. So you guys adopted this and it gave you a $0.10 benefit in the first quarter. And then you said you were going to repatriate cash to offset it. But then it looks like the lower tax rate's going to benefit you by $0.09 to $0.10. So I'm just trying to understand, what's the net of this? Is this basically the year? Is it that you're not repatriating any cash? Or you're repatriating less? Because obviously there's moving parts with respect to your stock price and other things. I'm just curious. Like what was the net benefit of these two impacts in the second quarter?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, John, I'll first talk about the total year and then I'll try to bring it into the quarter for you.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So for the year, at the time what I said three months ago is, yes, we're getting that benefit in the first quarter. But with our cash repatriation, it will end up being neutral for the year. We now for the year see a total benefit of approximately $0.10 net all-in, if we net the ASU, we net the cash repatriation. And the third piece that I'll remind you of is it also has impact on our share count. It increases our number of diluted shares outstanding, so the net impact we now see is approximately $0.10 for the total year.","For the second quarter, the roughly 150 basis points lower that we saw in our tax rate from what I had originally guided, all of that is coming from the increased employee stock options that we saw in the second quarter. Nothing has changed on our plans that we communicated for cash repatriation and cash movements around the world.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So if it was $0.10 positive in the first quarter and it's going to be neutral for the year, and it sounds like with the lower tax rate, it was still a positive in the second quarter, is this a drag in the back half? Except that your tax rate's coming down, so I guess you would expect (1:03:36).","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so in the second half of the year we're anticipating that we'll have lower employee stock options and there hence lower tax benefit from that in the second half of the year. That's built into our current guidance for the tax rate. But we'll continuing to be seeing the headwinds from our cash repatriation and cash movement actions that we're taking.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then you guys lowered the annual guide \u2013 I mean, there's obviously \u2013 you roll all this up, there's a lot of below-the-line moving parts, various levels of tax rate movement and swings and options and so forth. Is the implication that because you lowered your annual EPS guidance by $0.05 that there wasn't an ability to find some below-the-line items to provide that offset? Because the $0.05 isn't really that much. So I'm trying to understand if there's an implication that you're sort of saying, we've already underspent on our restructuring, we've already sort of maxed out this stock option, what was going to be a headwind turned into a bit of a tailwind or whatever versus expectations. Is that kind of the signaling here?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","John, the signaling I'd take from that is we continue to see very good investment opportunities for the company. Opportunities that we've talked about for strategic investments, investments in accelerating growth in Health Care as I think Jeff just asked about that. So I see it as commitment that we see opportunities and we want to keep investing in those, not we're running out of options of what we can do to deliver current quarter or year's earnings.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's fair. And then just lastly, what's the biggest driver of the delta for foreign currency? Is it the euro, or was there some other expectation baked in? I realize you say you don't have a lot of pound exposure. Was there some other fine-tuning of this?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The yen is part of that movement. That's probably the most significant deviation. The euro, I'd put very similar to what we've been expecting throughout the year.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe if I could squeeze one more in. You did really well in Canada. Companies like Granger and others have done poorly in Canada. Is there any other color you could add to that market? Because that economy's sort of \u2013 it's kind of very mixed, I think is the best way to put it. How did you guys do such a good job, so to your credit?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the team up there, yes, executed very well on the plan. And other thing that I think is important in that business for us up there, we have been there for long time. We have very good relation into the marketplace and our service level is very good. And one thing, Business Transformation starts and ends with the customer. Starts and end with the customer.","Canada was one of the first places we have implemented that program, which is now more than two years ago. And it's working well for us in Canada. And when you can provide in the marketplace product that is adding value and provide good service that is based on the demand from the customer going into all your ERP system, result is coming.","So there's a couple of things. Good growth, margin expansion. And I just think that team should be complimented for the way they operate today and the way they took on the ERP system as one of the first places for us on a global base to execute that and actually helped us a lot in terms of the rollout that you see now in Europe.","So, yeah, it's a very, very nice result. Is it surprise? No, it's not. It is not. It is based on very good relation with customers, total dedication through what we call Customer First and then the ERP system help the customer and us in order to lay out the demand plans and then for us is to deliver on it.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, and to your credit, you also cast a spotlight on companies that don't seem to know what they're doing there. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","In the vein of the business redesign, as you've been in a slow growth environment for a while, do you think returns on R&D and innovation are deteriorating or improving? That is, is innovation more differentiated in this kind of environment? Or are you seeing it get more challenging to get adequate returns?","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's an imperative for you in order to be successful. It's not either\/or. It's based on 3M's model where research and development is the heartbeat of the company and where we add value on very attractive price point and value point for our customers. That is helping them improve productivity and\/or adding value to their end products.","So for me, it's an imperative in order for you to be able to run a business like we are doing with very good return to our shareholders. It's becoming more and more important in my mind, if you would like to be successful long term, that you have a very robust research and development organization with good platforms that they can use. So you need technology platforms. And you need the brains and you need, equally important of course, input from your customers when you build those platforms.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.","Inge G. Thulin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. To wrap up, our team delivered another good performance in the second quarter as it relates to both financial results and building for long-term success. Going forward, we will remain focused on executing the 3M playbook, delivering efficient growth and continuing to create greater value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to talking with you soon again. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 24, 2012. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter business review. With me today are Inge Thulin, 3M President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to mention a few calendar items. We will announce our second quarter earnings on Thursday, July 26, and our third quarter earnings on Tuesday, October 23. In addition, we are planning to host our next Investor Day in St. Paul on Thursday, November 8. We'll provide more details out in the future. But for now, please hold these dates on your calendars. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2.","During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","So let's begin today's review, and I'll turn the program over to Inge. Please turn to Slide #3.","Inge G. Thulin","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. I'm very pleased to report that we're off to a good start this year, with positive sales, operating income and EPS growth. In fact, we achieved an all-time Q1 sales record of $7.5 billion. Industrial and Transportation, SS&PS, Health Care and Consumer and Office all performed well, while weakness in Electronics hurt Display and Graphics and Electro and Communications. As we said, we look for the electronics market to pick up as the year goes on. ","Geographically, for 3M, the Americas were strong. Asia Pacific was somewhat slower, and Western Europe held its own with very good operational discipline. For the company, operating margins improved to nearly 22%, with 5 out of 6 businesses above 20%. We executed well, and the result was a 7% increase in EPS to $1.59, including a $0.04 charge for a voluntary early retirement program and some miscellaneous restructuring. ","In February, we announced a 7% dividend increase, 3M's 54th consecutive annual increase. The first quarter dividend payment combined with Q1 share repurchases of over $500 million resulted in a first quarter return to shareholders of nearly $1 billion. So we're off to a good start, one that sets the right tone for the rest of the year and one that gives us confidence in our ability to deliver even against weak segments and regions and against an uncertain global economy. ","I thank the 3M team for their outstanding work that achieved these very good results. The quarter highlights their ability to manage 3M's embedded systems and tools to drive operational excellence, and I'm extremely pleased with the outcome. Now David will take you through the detail of the quarter. David?","David W. Meline","Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with sales. Please turn to Slide #4. First quarter sales were $7.5 billion, up 2.4% year-on-year. Organic local currency growth was 1.8% in the first quarter, with volumes up just slightly and selling prices up 1.7%. Acquisitions added 1.5% to sales in the quarter, and foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by nearly 1 percentage point. ","On a geographic basis, total growth was the strongest in the combined Latin America\/Canada region at more than 8%. Organic local currency growth was nearly 12% in the quarter, so our teams here continued to do an excellent job of building the business. Currency impacts reduced sales in the region by nearly 4%, largely due to weakness in the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. ","In the United States, sales grew 6.3% with double-digit increases in both Industrial and Transportation and in Safety, Security and Protection Services. The U.S. manufacturing sector remains quite robust and we are seeing some good growth as a result. Sales in Asia Pacific declined by 2% in the quarter, reflecting slower year-on-year demand in global consumer electronics, along with slower growth in China. Both were fully anticipated in our prior outlook, so no real surprises here.","On the electronics side, we continue to expect the market to turn positive around midyear. As for China, we are expecting below trend growth in the second quarter with better growth rates returning in the second half of the year. Sales in Europe were basically flat in Q1, with strength in Middle East Africa and Central East Europe offset by year-on-year declines in the West. In aggregate, the economies in Western Europe have stabilized at least for the moment, so things are not getting worse sequentially, but they are also not getting better. We built our 2012 plan on this basis, so thus far, things are progressing as expected.","Please turn to Slide 5 for a more detailed look at our income statement for the quarter. From an operating standpoint, we are quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter. As expected, the economy is not giving us much in terms of underlying growth, but we have a firm handle on discretionary spending and are off to a good start to 2012. Sales and gross profit both increased around 2.5% in the first quarter, operating income grew 3.5% and earnings per share rose 6.7%. Operating margins increased 20 basis points year-on-year to 21.8%.","Breaking down the margin change, first quarter selling price increases, net of raw material inflation, added 0.8 percentage points to operating margin, and other productivity added 0.3%. Foreign exchange impacts were a headwind of 0.3%, and the combination of higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense hurt operating margins by 0.6%. Again, operating margins improved by 20 basis points in total. Total SG&A increased $19 million in the quarter, largely related to the voluntary early retirement and restructuring actions mentioned by Inge, and R&D investment increased $13 million, about half of which related to these same events.","Earnings for the quarter rose 6.7% to $1.59 per share. The tax rate was 28.8% in the quarter, up just slightly versus last year. Average diluted shares outstanding were 706 million, down nearly 3% year-on-year, which added $0.04 of benefit in the quarter. On the whole, our businesses are executing very well in this period of softer economic growth.","Let's now review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis.","Please go to Slide #6. Industrial and Transportation had an excellent quarter, with sales growing at 9%. Sales increased in every region of the world, with the United States leading the way at 13% growth. As I mentioned, the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy is growing nicely. Europe and Latin America\/Canada grew at 6% and Asia Pacific grew 8%. We posted double-digit sales increases in a number of areas, including Industrial Abrasives and Automotive OEM. We also grew double digits in our fastest-growing Aerospace business. Aerospace has grown tremendously over the past few years and recently was elevated to become 3M's newest division. It's a great business poised for even faster growth. ","Organic local currency growth was 7% in the quarter. Acquisitions added over 3 points of growth, largely related to Winterthur in the abrasives market and Alpha Beta in industrial tapes, both of which are tracking well versus our expectations. Operating income was $600 million, up 16%, and we improved margins by 1.4 percentage points to 22.5%. The Industrial and Transportation team has done an outstanding job transforming what was once a low-growth to no-growth business into a true industrial powerhouse. ","Now let's move to the Health Care. Sales grew 2% to $1.3 billion, with broad-based organic growth across the majority of our portfolio. We drove strong double-digit sales growth in health information systems this quarter. This is an excellent growth business, and the industry leader in solutions for coding and classification of patient data. We work with more than 5,000 health care organizations worldwide, offering software solutions that improve productivity and enhance the accuracy of patient records. Earlier this month, we further strengthened this business by acquiring CodeRyte, a leader in clinical natural language processing technology and computer-assisted coding solutions for outpatient providers. We also posted mid-single-digit growth in Food Safety, Skin and Wound care and Infection Prevention, and oral care sales rose at a low single-digit rate. Sales declined in drug delivery systems against a challenging first quarter comp.","On a geographic basis, sales increased 11% in Asia Pacific, 9% in Latin America\/Canada and 3% in the United States. European sales declined 6% in the quarter due to economic softness and ongoing austerity measures in many countries. Developing markets remain a bright spot for Health Care with double-digit sales growth in the first quarter. The health care industry is just beginning to take off in many developing nations, and we plan to expand our investments here as 2012 progresses. Operating income in Health Care increased 9% to $402 million, a strong result in an industry with its share of challenges at the moment, and margins were 31.4%.","Now let's look at the Consumer and Office business. Sales again topped $1 billion this quarter, a 4% increase year-on-year. Our do-it-yourself business grew at a double-digit rate via a combination of acquired and organic growth. Recall that in October of 2011, we acquired the GPI Group, a French producer of tapes, hooks, insulation and floor protection products. GPI buys us speed and critical mass in the large European home improvement channels. ","On a geographic basis, Europe grew 16% in the first quarter, with positive gains from the GPI acquisition, offset in part by lower organic volumes. We drove 9% sales growth in the combined Latin America\/Canada region and 7% in Asia Pacific, while sales declined 1% in the U.S. Consumer and Office generated $234 million of operating income in the quarter, up 9% year-on-year, and margins improved by 90 basis points to 22.4%.","Let's move on to Safety, Security and Protection Services business. Sales were just shy of $1 billion in the first quarter, up 6% year-on-year. We drove high-single-digit sales growth in our Personal Safety business, influenced by strong manufacturing activity in many areas of the world. The outlook here remains very positive. Our Roofing Granules business also grew nicely in Q1, driven by warm weather conditions, as well as some inventory rebuild at the OEM level. First quarter sales declined in the Security Systems business against a tough comp year-on-year.","Looking geographically, sales rose 16% in Latin America\/Canada, 10% in the United States, 4% in Asia Pacific and sales declined 3% in Europe. Good unit growth and excellent factory efficiency drove a 16% increase in operating income for Safety, Security and Protection Services. Margins improved 2.2 percentage points to 23.6%. ","Now let's look at our Display and Graphics segment. Last year, first quarter was particularly strong for D&G, so we faced a tough comparison in Q1 of 2012. Sales were $832 million in Q1, down 12% year-on-year. Optical Systems sales fell 28% in the quarter, which was all LCD TV-related. Quarterly comparisons in Optical get easier as 2012 progresses. Sales grew nicely in both Architectural Markets and Commercial Graphics. Worldwide sales declined just slightly in traffic safety systems, although U.S. sales in this business were quite strong. On a regional basis, sales rose 9% in the United States, 7% in Latin America\/Canada. Sales declined 11% in Europe and 19% in Asia Pacific. Operating profits in Display and Graphics were $163 million, and margins were nearly 20% for the quarter.","Finally, let let's move to Electro and Communications. Sales were $808 million, down 3%. As expected, our electronics-related businesses posted sales declines in the first quarter, reflecting lower year-on-year customer production levels. Our 2012 plan called for an upturn in electronics sometime around midyear, and this remains our best estimate. We did see sequential sales improvement in Q1, so that is certainly a positive sign. ","In the Electrical Markets business, sales were up year-on-year, while telecommunications declined a few percentage points. On a geographic basis, sales increased 5% in the United States, 4% in Latin America\/Canada, but declined 7% in Asia Pacific and 6% in Europe. Operating income in Electro and Communications was $168 million in the first quarter, and margins were nearly 21%, a good result in a tough growth environment. This wraps up our business segment discussion. ","Please turn to Slide #7. Free cash flow for the quarter was $567 million, up $65 million year-on-year, so we're off to a very good start in 2012. Bear in mind also that this amount includes a voluntary $250 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit plan, something we've not done before in Q1. Therefore, the underlying increase is much higher. Our pension funded status is in good shape despite today's low interest rate environment, and we are continuing to stay ahead of the curve. Working capital was a net year-on-year benefit in the first quarter, as our businesses are doing a nice job of managing capital in this environment. Lower tax payments and higher income also boosted free cash flow. Capital expenditures were $261 million, up $30 million versus first quarter of last year, and we remain on track to invest $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion for 2012 in total.","First quarter pension and OPEB contributions totaled $337 million, which was $276 million higher than Q1 of last year. This was factored into our 2012 plan, and you may remember that we discussed it on last quarter's call. As you can see on the bottom of this slide, we expect to contribute a similar amount in the second quarter. For the full year, we anticipate contributions of about $1 billion to our pension and OPEB plans. ","Free cash flow conversion was 50%, a 4 point improvement versus the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted for pension and OPEB contributions, conversion was 80% this quarter versus 52% in Q1 of 2011. We returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders in Q1. Specifically, we paid $410 million in cash dividends in the quarter, and gross share repurchases were $524 million. That wraps up our discussion of the first quarter. Now I will turn the call back to Inge.","Inge G. Thulin","Thank you, David. So far today, we have been focused on the first quarter, but I would like to change the subject for a few minutes and address the topic that is generating a lot of enthusiasm and support with our employees and with our customers. That is our new vision for 3M. I sense that the vision for the entire company could really inspire our employees and position us positively with our customers. So we set out to capture the essence of 3M with a clear vision that is both timely and timeless. I shared this with my direct reports on my first day in office and with all employees worldwide a few days later. I introduced it earlier to connect immediately with employees and to send a very clear message about 3M's direction, purpose and future. Today, it's my pleasure to share it with you. ","Please turn to Slide 8. I believe this capture well the essence of 3M: technology, products and innovation. It reflects what we do for our customers every day, advance, enhance and improve. It sets a stretch goal for all of us, every company, every home and every life, all around the world. From a performance standpoint, if we can make good progress toward realize our vision, we can look forward to many more good quarters and many more years of increasing value for our shareholders. We have had a super response from our employees, very supportive and excited. It was very encouraging to me also to see how our customers have responded. Whenever we meet with our customer, we share the vision, and it resonates very, very well with them. ","Of course, a vision means very little if you don't perform. With that, let's turn to Slide 9 for our outlook for the rest of the year.","We believe our expectations about the global end market trends are still valid, and we are continuing to manage with them top of mind. Industrial markets continue to show strength, while Consumer and Health Care markets remain steady. We are seeing some early improvements in the semiconductor market, and we expect the electronics industry to pick up midyear. Geographically, the western hemisphere is doing well, with Latin America leading the way. Our teams there are doing a terrific job. Western Europe has stabilized, but at low levels. Growth in the Asia Pacific region is slow because of China, Japan and the electronic markets, but we still anticipate reacceleration in the second half of the year. ","As we are executing well and keeping the right balance between cost and investment, the Q1 results give us confidence to accelerate a number of targeted investment in technology, business building and emerging markets. Overall, we are looking at a range of $30 million to $50 million. This investment will support faster technology development in promising areas such as biotech and lighting. We will also invest to grow our Oil and Gas and Mining business, a segment with big potential. Of course, we know this market very well, and with added focus and investment, we will build a stronger position for 3M. Aerospace, as David mentioned, is another opportunity we will looking to build our strength. ","We will also invest more in emerging markets. For example, health care in Latin America and China, and in personal safety everywhere, another high-growth, high-potential space. So looking ahead, we believe the right outlook for the year is an earnings range of $6.35 to $6.50. We are raising the lower end of the range by $0.10. We continue to expect organic volume increases within the 2% to 5% range, and margins in the range of 21% to 22.5%. It's still early in the year, and as always, we'll continue to manage prudently even as we build for the future. So with that, we are now pleased to take your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just maybe starting with a little bit more picture around the inventory stocking dynamics that led to the 10 basis points of volume increase. What were the puts and takes especially around the Electronics side? Do you think you're through the destocking elements? Is it improving sequentially? And when might you think about or are you planning for a rebound on that front?","David W. Meline","Sure. So what I would say, Steve, is that inventory stock and destock was not a big feature of the results overall this quarter. We saw, certainly, last year, quite dramatic impacts on the business as we saw destocking take place. This quarter, we didn't really see anything significant in any of the segments. And that included Electronics. So Electronics remained weak, as we talked about, but we continue to believe that we'll see this uptick develop around midyear. So very much consistent with what we had expected previously.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on pricing power and particularly in Health Care, as a company, you've often talked about high 20s being kind of a sustainable run rate in Health Care margins. And clearly, you were back up over -- well over 30% this quarter. I mean, to what extent was that a function of something that's sustainable versus just taking down expenses for one quarter to help meet your commitments?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, you're right. We have said we would like to run that business in the high 20s, and that is our objective. And as I made some comments, we are now looking to accelerate our investments, specifically, in the emerging markets, where we have big opportunities. And it's very nice to see that the leverage is coming based on the investment we have done earlier in Health Care, specifically in emerging market, but also in Consumer and Office. So we have done investment there the last couple of years, and we now start to see the growth coming. It is a mix issue, which is positive for us due to the fact that many of the products that we are selling for Health Care, specifically into the developed economy, is adding a lot of value. Meaning that we're able to maintain very good margins as we penetrate more there. And in the emerging market now, we start to see that we take good market share, and the penetration is accelerating. China specifically, we will continue to make more investment as we go, and Latin America, as well as I called out on the call. But you are right, we would like to run it in the upper 20s. And by doing so, I think we will be able to really build out a good position on a global base.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Since the transition occurred during the quarter, this would be a good opportunity to hear from you, and maybe this would be better at a Analyst Day, but we don't have that luxury. But what areas are you focused on for the company in terms of why it might be different? And specifically, getting a lot of questions about your thoughts on the growth rate over the cycle, that 7% to 8% that had been set. So just a little bit more color in terms of what imprint we might expect over the near term and then very specifically, how you're feeling about that 7% to 8% growth target.","Inge G. Thulin","Well, thank you. First of all of all, my target and objective and focus is to deliver the plan for 2012. I was part of the team to build the plan here, and that's important for us. And this, as you know, is a volatile time, and we are absolutely focused to make sure that we deliver what we have promised you for this year. So that's initially what is very important for us. And it's not only important for me, it's important for the whole team, and the transition have gone very, very well. And it was a very solid and robust process that we had in place. And I think this is also a good time to thank George for everything he did in that transition, which was just extraordinary, at least for me and for the team here. Relative to the growth, first of all, this is an organization that is responding very well to stretch targets. And I think there is more elements to the business on a holistic way than just the top line growth. And at least, for me, 2 other very important metrics is margins and return of the invested capital. So we are focusing on that as well. So I would say that the 7% to 8% is a long-term target for 3M, and something that our organization really are responding very well to. And I would say the mindset in 3M today is changed versus many years ago, where we believe today that we can win and we have a capability to do so. So we are not at 7% to 8% as of yet, as we know, but it's a long-term target for us. And our organization, whatever we put out in terms of really tough stretch targets are responding very well.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then from a follow-up, it is interesting that there is a change that we've not seen previously, and that's you're talking -- calling out 2 end markets where you'd like to see growth, both oil and gas and aero. And just give us a sense what that competitive edge might be that 3M would bring to both of those end markets.","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. We have been in those markets for some time, but at least in my mind and the organization's mind here in total, we have not given full attention in terms of additional investment in order to accelerate our growth. So if you combine oil and gas and mining, that's a big market in total, which is, for us, where we can utilize many technology platforms in order to expand our presence into that market. So I think it's a -- in terms of integrated safety, protect and renew. It's also, for us, to go into water management and filtration, and make sure that we add services into the whole environment. So that's a business that, I believe and we believe here, by combining them and make sure that we make additional investments into research and development and a strong front, then, in terms of commercialization, really can move forward into and expand and accelerate. And we will call that business the natural resource management and extraction division that will be formed. Relative to aerospace, for us, if you think about our technology platforms there, which is everything from composites films, abrasive, masking product and personal protection, with all platforms there, that's a good opportunity for us to enabling lighter, safer, quieter aircraft constructed faster. So that's a business that is growing fast for us as we speak, but we believe with additional technologies that we can accelerate that even more. So we're very excited about that. And as David said, we move that from a department to a division recently, meaning more focus and investment will go into that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal from FBR Capital Markets.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just maybe first on the pricing raw materials, very impressive positive contribution in the quarter. So maybe talk a little bit about what you saw on the raw material side. And then what's your expectation on pricing raw for the rest of the year?","David W. Meline","Right. So Ajay, in terms of price raw materials, we did see -- we continued to see some level of raw material cost increases in Q1 to the tune of about 2%. So if you may recall, last year, we had raw material cost inflation of a little bit over 4%. So obviously, we see some moderation, and we continue to believe 1% to 2% for the year in terms of raw material cost increases is going to take place. And then in terms of pricing, yes, we picked up 1.7% in the quarter, more than offsetting raw material cost. And that was basically a consequence of the carryover effect of the pricing actions that we took last year. So if you look at that through the year, of course, that will have less of an effect on a comparable basis as we move through the year. But we think it's reasonable. We had said 0% to 1% on price for the year. It's reasonable to think that we'll get to the top end of that range as we go through this year.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. And then on SG&A, looks like you exclude the restructuring, flattish year-over-year, so very impressive. Maybe talk about some of the initiatives that you have on cost control and then what are the expectation on SG&A for the rest of the year.","David W. Meline","Yes, right. So as we had said, as we had the meeting in New York in December, we really were posturing ourselves this year for a weaker growth environment in the first half. And frankly, unfortunately, that's developed as we expected. We expect that to be true again here in the second quarter, a pretty weak economic environment. And so we've taken a posture to really be carefully managing our discretionary spending. The other part we saw come through very positively in the first quarter, which we were pleased with, is really the factories were running very efficiently in the quarter. Lean Six Sigma is a key focus there, and that's certainly coming through, including in a lot of the newer locations that we've put in place around the world over recent years. So combination of carefully managing spending and also running the factories effectively. As we look forward, then, we expect, as we go into the second quarter here, to maintain a tight rein on spending. And then secondly, as Inge mentioned, we are more confident now of the outlook for the year, and we believe it appropriate to continue to selectively look as to where we can target some additional investments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A few quick questions on M&A. One, could you provide an update on the pending Avery Dennison Office and Consumer acquisition and what sort of timing you're looking at to close that transaction?","Inge G. Thulin","Yes. We are still in that regulatory process as we have talked to you about before. But our expectation is to close that in the second part of this year.","Matt Ginter","And Abhi, this is Matt. To be clear, just as we said last quarter, we have not yet factored in any financial impact from Avery into our guidance. It is not in those numbers yet.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up, just a general M&A question. Could you talk a little bit about the health of the M&A pipeline overall, as well as which businesses are the primary areas of focus for potential add-ons through the course of the year?","David W. Meline","Sure. Yes. So if you look at the pipeline right now, it looks very similar and healthy compared to where we've been over the last couple of years, at least. We've announced a couple of transactions thus far here in the first quarter, the one being the Avery and the other one being this CodeRyte business that we are bolting on to the health information systems business, which we think is a very good opportunity for us. And we foresee, going forward, a combination of acquisitions that have good growth characteristics, as well as from time to time, doing transactions that give us scale and leverage similar to Avery. So as you might know, we look across the business. We look for opportunities where we can fill in gaps in existing businesses or adjacencies that we think we can bring our own capabilities to bear, whether that be our global reach or whether that be technology combinations that we can really drive businesses with.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Inge, I'm wondering if you could -- just following up on Deane's line of questioning about potential changes in the formula under your leadership. I'm wondering if you might address the idea that a lot of companies, not just multi-industry companies, but a lot of companies use divestitures of slower-growing businesses over time as a way to reinvest in higher-growing businesses. That hasn't been a big part of the 3M formula historically. I'm wondering if you're considering a change in that regard.","Inge G. Thulin","Well, I would say that, as you know, that both relative to organization and relative to businesses, it's always an evolution as you go. And first of all, as I said earlier, my initial focus here, together with the team, is to deliver this year plan. As we go into the strategic planning season in the middle of the year, I'm sure that as we always do, we will have those type of discussions in terms of performance of businesses, where [ph] they fit into our overall direction as we move ahead and make those calls. But it's not top of mind on my agenda at this point in time. As I said, very focused on this year, and then we will evaluate it as we go. I see it that we have a broad-base business opportunity for us with 6 businesses, and the way we are spreading ourself geographically with execution capabilities. So at this point in time, it's not top of mind of me. Top of mind for me is to deliver this year plan.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Dave, I'm wondering if you might be able to calibrate the organic volume assumption for the year up 2 to 5, first quarter close to flat. Maybe a little color around how the full year expectations may have changed for the various segments relative to the 2 to 5 and how you're seeing the second quarter within that range.","David W. Meline","Sure. So first of all, if you look at the full year expectations by segment, right now, we continue to believe that the ranges that we set out are still very good. So we don't see any change in terms of the prospects for growth across those segments. If you might recall, we had the highest expectations for growth for the year around our industrial-oriented businesses, that being Industrial and Transportation and Safety and Security. That continues to be our view. And the toughest segments, obviously, D&G and the Electronics business, again, we don't see any change. We had 0 to 5 for the year on Electronics and a negative growth rate on D&G. And we think that's going to be the case. What is also true, as you work through the year, second quarter we think will continue to be relatively modest in terms of the growth opportunities. And then we're expecting a pickup in the second half still, which is a combination of improving trends, for example, in the Electronics business, as well as the fact that the comps get easier for us as we work through the year.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on the cost-cutting narrative, Dave, that you've talked about in the past, you had SG&A pretty much flat on a year-over-year basis and there was an indication that you would modulate that as you move through 2012 based on how you saw the growth and risk around the business. Sounds like you're seeing things pretty much spot on. So cost cutting, essentially, the same message as we had before, not stepping that up, not stepping that down to fund additional growth. Maybe just refresh us there.","David W. Meline","Yes. No, that's -- I think you put it well, which is, if you look now, kind of looking back at Q1, we feel very good about what we were able to achieve here. And we also feel very good about our ability to deliver for the year having got off with quite reasonable results despite pretty weak growth. So we'll continue to run with that posture here into the second quarter and looking for that growth upturn, which is yet to be validated. So we're going to be pretty careful in terms of how we're managing on the cost side in the near term. But again, as both Inge and I have mentioned, we do need to be very clear and continue to focus on where we're investing for the future because we need to get the right balance there. And we have the capability to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","To David's point, you guys are off to a good start. But, Inge, your comment that the focus is really to execute on this year's plan. I mean, obviously, you don't have control of the end markets. What, in your view, is kind of the biggest challenge, if you will, as you think about the remainder of the year? Is there execution within a certain division you're focused on? Is it cost? Is it restructuring? What, if anything, is really kind of taking the majority of your attention here near term?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, first of all, it's important for us to see growth coming. And as you know, one of the challenge is, which is not a 3M challenge by definition, is the global economy. So, of course, Asia, with China being slower than we have seen before and Japan, also, has a recovery that is slightly slower than people expected. And then you have West Europe. So I think those are the 3 things that is top of mind for me that I would like to see us coming back and materialize the growth that we've laid out in the plan. I think that's important. Now if you think about China for a second, we talked about that on the last call, there were 3 things that impacted China growth. One was domestic growth due to government management of spending there. It is export to West Europe, and it's electronics. We said at that time, and we still believe it's correct, that export to West Europe will probably not come back this year. But we see an uptick in electronics, and we also see a slight uptick on the domestic market there. So our business, in fact, last quarter or this quarter, Q1, we had a 20% sequential growth versus Q4, and it was an all-time high in China, meaning our base business grew 8%-plus, our Infrastructure business was flat and the Electronic business was down around 16%. But as I said, as we see the semiconductor business type of -- get a pickup in terms of utilization in factories, we believe that will come back. So I think that's -- we see that coming. That's a big point. That's my biggest concern at this point in time. I think in West Europe, that, that have stabilized, but at a lower level. And we have a very good business model and a very mature team in place there. I think we will be able to deliver the plan. But still, I hope that we can capitalize and take some market shares there. So I think it's very much to make sure we continue a very controlled management relative to our investment. Let out some of them, as we talked about, in oil and gas and mining, aerospace, emerging market specifically for Health Care and for Personal Protection. And when we see that coming and Electronics start to pick up and we see them materializing in terms of real growth midyear, then I think we are -- I see more positive on the outlook. But I just would like to make sure that I see it before we move forward full time.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","That's good color. And just a little more on China, if you could. How different from normal sequential patterns was that lift from Q4 to Q1 that you saw with...","Inge G. Thulin","Very similar. Very similar to the past in terms of the sequential. And we see Q2 still be tougher in China. But then as we go in the second part of the year, I call it, to the plan, we will start to see the growth coming. So very similar, that's the answer to your question. But the good sign, I think the good sign, all-time high in terms of growth in China first quarter was -- which I personally see very positive.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Right. And then just on Optical. Can you give us where your plug-in versus battery mix is now?","David W. Meline","Yes. So in the first quarter, as you might recall, we exited the year, fourth quarter, battery was 58% of the sales of the Optical Systems division, so that being handheld devices in particular. In the first quarter, we were a little higher than that. It was, I think, 64%. So we had said about 2\/3 of the sales this year we expected to be battery and 1\/3 plug-in. And it looks very much in line, what we're seeing in Optical division to that plan. And likewise, very tough comp in the first quarter, not a surprise to us, the result here. And we expect to be up modestly, sequentially, on Optical Systems. But still on a year-over-year in Q2, it'll be down quite substantially again.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Capital.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can I just get a little more clarification on that China comment in terms of, as you said, still tough in 2Q, but yet you've got this sequential recovery in 1Q. Do you mean that it -- I mean, does the sequential recovery continue into 2Q and you're just at a tough year-over-year spot? Can you just maybe give us what you're looking for on a year-over-year basis for those quarters?","David W. Meline","Yes. So as Inge said, the sequential performance we saw in Q1 was typical of past performance, which gave us some comfort that we're not seeing a further decline. So as you might recall, in the second half of last year, x Electronics, we were running now in around high-single digits to low-double-digit growth. We expect, then, as we move through the year in China, that we will see modest sequential growth on an absolute revenue basis continuing through the year. And therefore, on a year-over-year comp basis, that'll be a rising percentage comp as we move through the year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And so far, it sounds like the Electronics side of things is where you've seen the pickup. I mean, have you seen anything on, I guess, more of the industrial business or the infrastructure-related businesses? Can you maybe break it by the pieces?","David W. Meline","Yes. So Electronics, sequentially, was up. But if you look on a year-over-year basis, not yet. So it was following a typical seasonal pattern. Industrial was modestly growing, but at a similar level to what we saw in the second half of last year, and infrastructure as well. So really, no big changes in terms of the individual segments in the first quarter.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And just on the $30 million to $50 million of increased investment, is that just going to kind of spread evenly now? Or are you going to do it all at once? How does that kind of flow out?","David W. Meline","Yes. So that you can expect will spread through the year. What we're doing is, in a number of cases, we were managing very tightly spending. And so to some extent, we're loosening up on that as we see specific areas where we have opportunities. In others, we're taking the opportunity to devote more focus in resources such as these couple of divisions that Inge talked about. So I think fair to say, you can think about that being timed throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Inge, on Slide 9, you indicated Japan along with the other areas that were slow. Don't you have pretty easy comps in Japan right now against the earthquake impacted year-ago results?","Inge G. Thulin","I think we will start to see that in the second quarter. And that's, I think, that's where you will see the comparison becoming a little bit easier. So when I talk about it, it is to say that it take a little bit longer time for the investment back in Japan in the country in order to recover. And I think, as we have a broad-based business there, which in fact is one of our biggest subsidiaries in the world, as you know, take us a little bit longer time to see the growth coming as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So David, you mentioned that you still feel pretty good about the full year guidance by segment. But can you maybe just spin back to 1Q, and which businesses saw -- geographic areas exceeded your plan, your internal plan? Obviously, you don't publish guidance, but internally, which businesses came in stronger?","David W. Meline","If I think about it by segment in the first quarter, what I would say, Nigel, is actually -- you look at it, first of all, 0 growth on an organic basis is nothing that we get too excited about at all. But if you walk through the segments, again, we are pleased with the momentum we continue to see in the industrial-related businesses. I mean, you look at Industrial and Transportation, both good growth, around 9%, and a quite a substantial margin pickup to 22.5%. If you look at Safety and Security business, again, good growth, 5.5% and a nice margin pickup, including sequentially. So we feel good about those businesses continuing to run. But of course, we had them pegged for the highest growth through the year. If you think about Health Care and Consumer, I would say very much in line with what we expected here in the first part of the year. Consumer retail is -- in the mature markets, in particular, continues to be quite soft, although we were pleased with our own performance in the U.S., which was indicating some pickup of share. And certainly, in the case of Health Care, with the exception of the Drug Delivery business, all of those businesses ran quite nicely in mid-single digits to double digits in the case of health information systems. So tougher environment for those couple of businesses. Both performed in terms of managing the margin and growth question. And then finally, Electronics segments, including Display and Graphics and Electro and Communications, were very much in line. I mean, very, very much in line with what we were expecting. And as we've discussed, we continue to expect to see that recovery develop. And there are some indications, such as in semiconductor that, that's on the horizon.","Inge G. Thulin","This is Inge. And one thing to add to that is also our performance in Latin America, that is very strong. And this has been going on for multiple years now and, yes, continuing. And that's a very, very good sign for us. It's a part of the world where our brand equity is very high. We have a incredible, solid organization there that is both able to execute with [ph] operational excellence and are able to grow in most segments that we are in there. So we're very, very pleased with Latin America. And as I said earlier, there will be some additional investment there to some businesses. But we are very, very pleased with them. And I would just like to highlight that in addition to what David said as well.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then Inge, on your comment about that you feel more confident in the growth environment or maybe the 2012 plan. Can you maybe just go through how you think in terms of managing discretionary costs versus growth investments? And are we now in a slightly more of a bias towards growth investments versus discretionary cost management? And does that mean that maybe we've got a bias towards a higher revenue number and perhaps a slightly lower margin number?","Inge G. Thulin","Well, it's not either\/or. It's always a balance, as you know. And I'm not there yet to say that I'm confident that the growth is on the bag. So that's why we're holding also the $6.50 on the top of our guidance range because we would like to see it really coming through. But as I said, we are letting out for the year here. As a first step, $30 million to $50 million in very targeted investment for growth. And that's the starting point for us. And as I said, it's not either\/or. We are committed to the commitment to you, and that's what we would deliver. But I think the areas that we now have identified for additional investment based on the platforms we have and the presence, and specifically around global customers, plays very well for us. So the businesses we talked about earlier, which is aerospace, oil and gas and mining, et cetera, the global customers, and we can serve them very well, and not only with solution from a technology perspective, but also with a geographical reach as we have subsidiaries all over the world. So this is a perfect space for us, but we're rolling it out carefully. And I would like to see growth materialize and feel more confident before we make a even bigger investment.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then quickly, David, do you have the book-to-bill ratio for Electro this quarter?","David W. Meline","Could you repeat that?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Do you have the book-to-bill ratio for Electro, the Electro segment?","David W. Meline","We don't, in fact.","Matt Ginter","Yes. That's not a number we monitor, Nigel, book-to-bill explicitly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So can you just help me reconcile how -- the leverage, obviously, this quarter was phenomenal. Maybe that was price cost. But you guys have said pretty consistently that your emerging markets or Asia business has -- is kind of accretive to margins, yet this seemed to be more of a developed markets kind of quarter. So is it just that price cost dynamic that's throwing that off? Or -- I'm just trying to kind of reconcile those comments.","David W. Meline","Sure. Yes. So what I would say, Steve, first of all, is we did see very good performance not only in the mature markets -- for example, in the U.S., we're up over 1 point in margin. But also developing markets continue to deliver on margin despite what was a weaker growth environment. So we don't see any big shift as between kind of those sources of income for the business right now because we've been managing into what we expected to be a softer growth environment. And that's true, really, across the globe for us and across our businesses. And I think as you look at the margins, certainly, as you can see it by sector, and I would tell you that's not dissimilar geographically to what we traditionally deliver on.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just on Health Care, another blowout margin there. Can you maybe get into what was the key driver of that margin number and then how do we think about that margin going forward? You guys have said it's high 20s. You're now kind of comfortably above 30. Maybe talk about that.","David W. Meline","Yes. Yes, what I would say is, what particularly was encouraging for us is the factories are really running efficiently right now in Health Care, which had a material contribution to the margin this quarter. We've also been able to offset what were raw material cost increases that came through, particularly last year. And then finally, we've been continuing to invest to grow that business. And typically, with the increasing product portfolio, that enables us to hold and to increase margin over time. And we're encouraged by the results of those investment efforts that are also, we believe, coming through to the results.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What's your most favorable division there, from a profitability perspective?","David W. Meline","Well, honestly, they're all very, very strong businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So 2 quick questions. Can you parse the growth that you're seeing in Latin America and the trends that you're seeing in terms of how much is underlying demand versus market share gains? And then on the CNG agreement with Chesapeake, if you look out 5, 6 years, what kind of market opportunity or size business could this be for 3M?","David W. Meline","Yes. So in terms of Latin America, the growth that we saw, it was actually very impressive. So if you look at across our 6 business sectors, with the exception of one that was -- ran at 9% growth, the others all had double-digit growth in the first quarter. So it was a very broad-based growth pattern we saw in Latin America, which is nothing new for us, and obviously quite encouraging as we look across our businesses. So answer is, in fact, yes, we're picking up share across those businesses. As Latin America, while economic growth was reasonable, certainly in particular in Brazil, if you look at the data, it looked quite weak in the first quarter, and frankly, we had some concerns going into the year. But the team did a really nice job in our biggest markets, Brazil and Mexico. And also importantly, the smaller markets, the guys have done a great job across the business.","Matt Ginter","Laurence, your second question didn't come through. What was that?","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So on the compressed natural gas announcement with Chesapeake, if you looked out at 5, 7 years, what you think the possible business size could be for 3M?","David W. Meline","Yes. We actually haven't put a number on it, Laurence. The guys are really excited, because if you look at the nature of these CNG containers that we're partnering with them on, we think it's a very significant opportunity for the company. But to be honest, we haven't put a number on it yet.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.","Matt Ginter","Good. Well, thanks for joining us this morning. The questions were very good. We appreciate your spending time with us, and we'll look forward to talking here as the next quarter progresses. So bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 28, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 business review and 2020 outlook. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions.","Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","Please turn to Slide 2. Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our 2020 quarterly earnings conference calls, which will be held on April 28, July 28 and October 27. Also note, we are planning to host an Investor Meeting in 2020. We will update you once we have finalized the date for the meeting.","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Finally, please note that throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today's presentation and press release.","Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll hand it off to Mike. Mike?","Mike Roman","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team executed well in the fourth quarter and delivered results that were in line with our expectations. Although we continue to face growth challenges in certain end markets, our focus on productivity and cost management helped generate solid underlying margins and robust cash flow with a conversion rate of 186%. We also continue to build, invest, and transform for the long-term success of 3M.","Earlier today, we issued a press release on the next big phase of our transformation journey, a new global operating model and streamlined organizational structure, which I will discuss in more detail. Today, I will also provide an update on our ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, including PFAS. Later in the call, I will come back to discuss our full year performance, including record cash flow and good progress on our strategic priorities along with our outlook for 2020 where we expect to return to growth.","Please turn to Slide 5, where I will begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results. Organic growth company-wide in the fourth quarter was minus 2.6%, in line with our guidance. We continue to face softness in certain end markets, namely China, automotive, and electronics, which impacted overall growth.","We delivered adjusted earnings of $1.95 per share, which includes a $0.20 Q4 restructuring charge that I will discuss shortly. Excluding that charge, we delivered EPS of $2.15 at the high end of our guidance. Finally, we generated underlying margins of 20.7%, which includes a 140 basis point impact from the Acelity acquisition, while reducing inventory levels by $115 million. Overall, I'm pleased with our team's execution and our ongoing progress in driving operational improvements.","Please turn to Slide 6. I have talked to you often about the strength and vitality of the 3M value model. We have deep competitive advantages, unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, leading brands, and global capabilities, all of which make 3M greater than the sum of our parts. At the same time, we constantly evolve and build on our foundation, which we are doing through our four strategic priorities, including transformation. Over the last several years, we have been on a journey to transform how we serve our customers, how we work, and how we compete.","The deployment of our ERP system has enabled new standardized business processes, new service models, and new digitalization capabilities across 3M. In EMEA and Canada, where we are furthest along in our transformation, we are seeing enhanced customer service, improved margins, better use of data analytics, and lower inventories. We are starting to see the same improvements in service, analytics, and inventories in the U.S. as well, which gives us continued confidence in our transformation journey.","Importantly, our progress has enabled us to realign the company and further leverage our transformation capabilities. As you know, in April of last year, we moved from five to four business groups to better align around our customers and our four go-to-market models. This was the first step in our realignment. Since then, we have been working on reorganizing the entire company around our new business groups to take full advantage of our new capabilities.","On January 1, we implemented a new streamlined global operating model designed to improve growth and operational efficiency. In the new model, our business groups now have full responsibility for all facets of strategy, portfolio and resource prioritization across our entire global operations. Under the prior model, area and country teams had responsibility for setting priorities in their respective regions, part of a distinct international organization.","Now all of our international people report directly into the business groups and functions that they are part of, and there is no longer a separate international team. This new model has clear benefits to both 3M and our customers. First, it will drive more accountability to our business groups to strengthen performance and serve both global and local customers. Second, it will enable stronger customer insights in order to drive more powerful innovation. Third, it will empower our people with more freedom to make decisions and increase speed and service to our customers. Fourth, it will make us more efficient and help us continue to drive margin expansion by reducing layers, streamlining structure, and simplifying reporting lines.","Finally, it will allow us to leverage similarities across markets, while maintaining the robust local capabilities and expertise that help differentiate 3M. 3M has both experience and success operating in a global model such as this. For several years, our electronics and auto OEM businesses have operated in a global model, and we've seen stronger customer alignment along with better service, innovation, and efficiency.","In addition to our new model, we also made changes in 2019 to the way we support our business groups. To optimize the customer experience in each of our go-to-market models, we consolidated manufacturing, supply chain, and customer operations into a seamless end-to-end enterprise operations organization. This team plays a critical role in tailoring service and expertise to the needs of our customers and has been a key driver in enabling us to reduce inventory levels. We also brought together key capabilities around the world as part of a new global corporate affairs organization in order to advance our brand and reputation and build on our history as one of the best places to work around the world.","As a result of these actions, today we are announcing a restructuring charge as we move quickly to our new alignment. The restructuring includes streamlining our organization by reducing approximately 1,500 positions spanning all business groups, functions, and geographies. On a pretax basis, we took a restructuring charge of $134 million in Q4, and we expect annual pretax savings of $110 million to $120 million, with $40 million to $50 million in 2020. In our new structure, we will also report geographic results under three areas beginning in Q1 2020: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, Africa; and Asia Pacific, with the same level of detail and transparency as we always have.","Ultimately, as I've communicated to all 3M\u2019ers, this is a defining moment for our enterprise. We are modernizing how we run our business and building an organization for the future, and I'm more confident than ever in our journey to transform into a more agile, more efficient, and more competitive enterprise. ","Please turn to Slide 7. Being a leader in sustainability and environmental stewardship is core to 3M and is a value that matters deeply to our employees, our stakeholders and to me personally. We started our groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays program more than 40 years ago, and we have continued to step up our leadership to address climate and environmental challenges.","Last year, we moved our St. Paul headquarters to 100% renewable electricity while committing to move our entire global operations to renewable energy by 2050. 3M also produces a broad range of solutions that help our customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from our smog-reducing roofing granules to our films that make homes, electronics and automobiles more energy-efficient.","From a governance perspective, we are also strengthening oversight of strategies related to sustainability, R&D and commercialization. In November, our Board established a Science, Technology and Sustainability Committee to ensure we are building on our strong innovation capabilities while advancing our already high standards for product and environmental stewardship. This commitment to sustainability includes stewardship of water, one of our most precious resources. As part of our responsibility, we are proactively managing PFAS, guided by the principles of sound science, corporate responsibility and transparency.","We are committed to being part of the solution to ensure communities have confidence in their water. This includes addressing contamination at sites where we produced or disposed of PFAS. In addition, we will work with our customers and our other stakeholders in connection with other sites where PFAS concerns exist. Our efforts under these commitments led to a litigation-related pretax charge of $214 million in the fourth quarter, split roughly equally between the following two items: First, we updated our assessment of environmental matters and litigation related to our manufacture and disposal of PFAS, which included expanding our evaluation to other 3M sites that may have used certain PFAS material.","Second, we updated our assessment of customer-related litigation based on ongoing settlement discussions. At the same time, we continue to work with the EPA and other authorities to ensure we are fulfilling our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship. As previously disclosed, in 2019, 3M discovered and voluntarily informed the EPA and appropriate state authorities that discharges from our Decatur, Alabama facility may not have complied with permit requirements.","We immediately idled the relevant processes and took steps to address these issues. In connection with our Decatur disclosures, 3M received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Alabama in late December 2019, and we are cooperating with this inquiry. In addition, in Q4 of 2019, as part of our compliance assessment of similar sites, we identified and also disclosed to the EPA and appropriate state authorities similar discharge issues at our Cordova, Illinois facility.","We continue to support the EPA and the Alabama and Illinois state environmental authorities to help resolve these matters. We have a strong cross-functional team in place that is actively managing our environmental stewardship and PFAS. And moving forward, we will continue to update you as developments unfold. If you haven't already, I encourage you to visit our PFAS stewardship website, which can be found on our Investor Relations site under the heading About 3M. That wraps up my opening remarks. I will come back to discuss our full year performance along with our 2020 guidance after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8 with a recap of our fourth quarter sales performance. Fourth quarter organic sales declined 2.6%. Volumes were down 340 basis points, while selling prices were up 80 basis points. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 5.1 percentage points, while foreign currency translation was a 40 basis point headwind to sales. All-in fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars grew 2.1% versus last year.","Looking at growth geographically. U.S. organic growth declined 3%, primarily due to declines in the Transportation and Electronics and Safety and Industrial businesses. Asia-Pacific declined 3% in Q4 with Japan down 7%, primarily due to a decline in our Electronics business. Organic growth was up 1% in China. This result is primarily due to last year's easier comparison. EMEA declined 3% while Latin America, Canada was flat.","Please turn to Slide 9 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide fourth quarter sales were $8.1 billion with adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating margins were 19%, which included a negative 170 basis point impact from restructuring. Considering this impact fourth quarter operating margins were right in line with our expectations.","On the right hand side of this slide, you see the components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter. Lower organic volumes and our continued efforts to reduce inventories to improve cash flow were both headwinds to margins year-over-year. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from our Q2 restructuring actions. In total, these factors resulted in 110 basis point reduction to margins versus last year's fourth quarter.","Acquisitions and divestitures combined reduced margins by 140 basis points mainly related to our acquisition of Acelity. Higher selling prices along with slightly lower raw material costs contributed 70 basis points to fourth quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 10 basis points.","Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $1.95 per share and as Mike noted included a $0.20 impact from our Q4 restructuring, which was not factored into our prior guidance. Accounting for this item, earnings were $2.15 per share, right in line with the high end of our guidance range.","Looking at the components of our year-on-year earnings performance. The net impact of organic growth, inventory reductions and other items I covered on the prior slide reduced fourth quarter per share earnings by $0.13. Acquisitions and divestitures combined, reduced fourth quarter earnings by $0.11 per share versus last year, primarily due to Acelity. Please note that this result includes the impacts of both financing and tax costs. While early, Acelity is off to a good start as our team delivered results better than expected.","Turning to tax rate. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 20.3% versus 20.5% last year. As noted with acquisitions, M&A and restructuring categories in this table include their own year-on-year tax impacts with the remaining impact of $0.05 reflected in this line. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined 1.7% versus Q4 last year, adding $0.03 to per share earnings.","Please turn to Slide 11 for a look at our cash flow performance. As Mike noted, we delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with fourth quarter free cash flow of $1.8 billion. For the full year, free cash flow increased 10% to $5.4 billion as our teams delivered strong working capital management throughout 2019. Fourth quarter conversion was 186%, which included a 27 percentage point benefit from the significant litigation-related charges. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $538 million, with the full year totaling $1.7 billion. Also during the fourth quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases. And for the full year, we returned $4.7 billion.","Please turn to Slide 12, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q4. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which declined 2.8% organically in the quarter. Our Personal Safety and Industrial Minerals businesses delivered mid single-digit organic growth in the quarter, while the balance of the portfolio declined. Looking geographically, organic growth increased in Latin America, Canada while Asia-Pacific, the U.S. and EMEA each declined. Safety and Industrial's fourth quarter operating margins were 20.9%. Overall, margins continued to be solid when considering negative organic growth, inventory reductions and restructuring impacts.","Moving to Transportation and Electronics. As expected, fourth quarter sales were down 5.9% organically compared to last year, impacted by end market softness worldwide. Our electronics-related businesses showed sequential improvement, despite year-over-year being down mid-single digits organically as demand remained soft in consumer electronics and factory automation end markets.","Our automotive OEM business was down 5%, a bit better than fourth quarter global car and light truck builds, which were down 6%. Transportation and Electronics fourth quarter operating margins were 20.8%. Similar to Safety and Industrial, margins were impacted by lower sales, inventory reductions and restructuring.","Turning to our Health Care business. Organic growth was flat year-over-year against last year's strong comparison. Growth was led by mid single-digit increases in health information systems and food safety. Medical Solutions, our largest business was up slightly, while oral care declined low single-digits in the quarter. Looking geographically, growth was led by Latin America, Canada and EMEA, while the U.S. declined.","Health Care fourth quarter operating margins were 21.3%, impacted by nearly 8 percentage points from the combination of the M*Modal and Acelity acquisitions along with restructuring. Taking these factors into account, margins were up 100 basis points year-over-year.","Lastly, fourth quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was flat. Sales were led by mid-single-digit growth in home improvement and low single-digit growth in home care, while stationery and office and consumer declined. Looking at Consumer geographically, Latin America\/Canada grew mid-single digits. The U.S. was up nearly 1%, while EMEA and Asia Pacific declined. Consumer's operating margins were a strong 23.4%, up 3 percentage point year-over-year, driven by portfolio and footprint actions we have been executing in this business.","That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 13, and I'll hand it back over to Mike. Mike?","Mike Roman","Thank you, Nick. As I look at 2019, I'm encouraged how our team responded to the challenges we faced in our end markets: stepping up our execution, improving operations and driving strong cash flow as we move through the year. We finalized the restructuring we announced in April, effectively managed costs and reduced inventory levels by $370 million. With respect to the full year numbers, organic growth company-wide was minus 1.5%. We posted adjusted earnings of $9.10 per share, which included a $0.21 benefit from the divestiture of our gas and flame detection business.","We increased cash flow by 10% year-over-year to $5.4 billion, an all-time high for our enterprise, while delivering a strong conversion rate of 118%. Additionally, we posted a good return on invested capital of 18%, including the impact of acquisitions. In 2019, we also returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And last year marked our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases.","Please turn to Slide 14. Beyond financial results, I view 2019 as a fundamentally significant year for 3M as we implemented major change to position us well for the future. Earlier, I talked about how we are accelerating the pace of our transformation, and we also made significant progress on our other three priorities for long-term growth and value creation. I'll make a few comments on each, starting with portfolio. The ongoing review and reshaping of our portfolio is critical to maximizing value across our company. Since 2012, we have moved from 40 businesses to 23, while completing more than 10 divestitures and 14 acquisitions.","In 2019, we continued portfolio, with particular progress in strengthening our Health Care business. We acquired Acelity, which accelerates 3M as a leader in advanced wound care, along with MModal's technology business, an ideal fit within our health information systems business. The integration of Acelity is going well, and the business is off to a good start. And M*Modal is outperforming our expectations for both growth and income. We also announced that we will divest our drug delivery business, which will enable us to focus more resources on our core Health Care portfolio.","Beyond our efforts in Health Care, last year, we sold our gas and flame detection business. And earlier this month, we finalized the sale of our ballistic-protection business. Managing our portfolio is an ongoing process, and we'll continue to act on opportunities to maximize value across 3M. Our next priority is innovation, which is the heart of our enterprise. It differentiates 3M in the marketplace and supports organic growth and our long track record of delivering premium margins and return on invested capital.","In 2019, we invested $3.6 billion in the combination of R&D and CapEx. These investments enable us to invent unique products and solutions and then deliver them efficiently to our customers through our disruptive manufacturing process technologies. That it is more than the breadth of our technology that sets us apart. It's also our ability to share, combine and apply our technologies across 3M businesses.","Our adhesives, for example, are in cars and airplanes, electronics and medical tapes and in the products you're most familiar with, such as Command strips and Post-it notes. And as the needs of our customers evolve, we constantly develop new capabilities and applications to stay at the forefront of innovation. Last year, we expanded our periodic table to 51 technology platforms as we further refined our expertise in areas like meta-materials, computer vision and advanced robotics. We also continue to see strong returns from investments in our priority growth platforms, which serve emerging and fast-growing markets.","For the full year, these platforms grew 10% as we create differentiated solutions for customers around health care, transportation, safety and infrastructure. For example, automotive electrification grew 9% as we continue to drive good penetration, with particular strength in automotive displays and lightweighting solutions. Going forward, we will continue to use 3M innovation to solve tough problems for our customers, improve people's lives and help create a more sustainable world.","Turning now to people and culture, which is foundational to each of our other priorities. In 2019, we took significant action to develop our people and invigorate our culture, and the transformation initiatives I discussed earlier are at the center of our efforts. Our transformation journey is as much a cultural change as it is a technology change. We are simplifying workflows, equipping our people with new systems and tools and empowering them with more autonomy to make faster decisions.","Given the level of transformation within 3M, a key focus of our development is managing change, and I am pleased how our team is stepping up to embrace these changes. At the same time, we are deepening our commitment to 3M's core values, including diversity and inclusion, 60% of our top 100 leaders are diverse, one-third of our corporate officers and Board members are women, and we are doing more to integrate inclusion into our daily life. Of course, underpinning everything we do is our code of conduct. And last year, 3M again was named one of the world's most ethical companies.","Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we made against each of our strategic priorities in 2019, and I am confident in how we are positioned heading into 2020. Please turn to Slide 15. As a result of our work, we are well positioned to return to growth in 2020. Our plan reflects our improved performance and expectation for low but positive global macroeconomic growth. We anticipate organic growth of flat to 2%, along with earnings of $9.30 to $9.75 per share. We expect another year of robust cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 105%.","Finally, we anticipate a strong return on invested capital of 18% to 21%. In the appendix of our slide presentation, you will find additional details on our guidance, including a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth by business group and area.","Before turning to Q&A, I have one additional announcement. Our Executive Vice President of International, Julie Bushman, has informed us of her intent to retire in April. Throughout her 36 years at 3M, Julie has been an exceptional leader and has created tremendous value for our company and our shareholders. Julie's leadership has been invaluable throughout her time leading our international team, including her role and working closely with me to lead the transformation announcements we discussed today. I thank Julie for her many years of service and many contributions. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Davis","Hey good morning guys.","Mike Roman","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","As far as the \u2013 I mean, there's some noise out there with this virus in China and stuff, and you sell a fair amount of products into \u2013 that benefit, but at the same time, there's some offsets and slower growth in China overall. But when you think about, Mike, the cadence of returning growth in 2020, is there a sense of when? Is it 1Q as you start to get into some easier comps or is it more towards the back end of the year?","Mike Roman","So Scott, I would start with the model for returning growth in 2020 is based on that broader macro, that outlook for the broader macro. It also is looking at some of those key markets that we talked about that were challenges for us in 2019. China, for example, one of the challenges in 2019. We see that in our model for 2020 returning to low-to-mid single-digit growth for the total year. In both cases, I would say, we see growth strengthening as we move through the year.","So Q1, positive growth for the overall enterprise in the middle range \u2013 middle of the overall guidance of the range, maybe a little slightly lower end of the guidance of the range. And China, in particular, before we got to the last couple of weeks with the coronavirus really becoming the focus, we were looking at a sluggish start to China in first quarter really based on automotive, and the build rate's expected to be down mid-single digits and maybe even high-single digits.","And so it's \u2013 that was kind of our pacing. Now coronavirus, it's kind of changing things as we go and we're seeing what you're seeing. We're seeing increased demand for our respiratory protection products, and we're ramping up our production worldwide, in China, around the world to meet that demand. At the same time, we're seeing what everybody else is seeing, that there's \u2013 the businesses are shutting down, extending their shutdown beyond Lunar New Year. So, we're really watching day to day what that's going to mean for our outlook for China, but I'll give you kind of the frame we had and then how we're kind of looking at it as we see the updates day by day.","Scott Davis","Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And just as a quick follow-up. Will Acelity be accretive to your growth rate in 2020? Will that be above your guidance range in your view?","Nick Gangestad","So Scott, this is Nick. We \u2013 Acelity is, of course, incorporated in the guidance that we're giving there. Throughout the year, most of its growth will be coming through what we report for acquisitions versus organic growth, but when we compare it to the underlying growth that was a revenue that was there before we acquired it, we see its growth as accretive to the overall 3M growth rate that we're projecting.","Scott Davis","Okay, super helpful. Thanks, good luck guys.","Mike Roman","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, good morning.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Hey, so just wanted to touch on the additional PFAS charge here. I mean I think I understand the Alabama and Illinois plant issues, but what's the trigger for the customer litigation charge? I mean, obviously, there has to be a trigger to get you to recognize that charge. Maybe just touch on \u2013 there's obviously a speculation about EPA regulation. Where do you stand on that issue?","Mike Roman","Yes. So maybe I'll take the charge first, Nigel. So, we played out in the prepared remarks that there are two aspects to the charge. One is our ongoing commitment to resolve the issues where we manufacture and dispose the PFAS. The other part of the charge is related to really ongoing negotiations with customers. As part of our commitment is to do our part to help customers address the PFAS issues they face, and we've got our negotiations and mediation as far enough along that we can identify what's probable and estimable around a group of customers. It's multiple customers. It does account for the Wolverine cases that we've been \u2013 we've talked about in the past, but it's multiple customers, and really the next step of what we can understand is probable and estimable.","So then in working with \u2013 one of the commitments we did make in last fall is to work in support of the EPA as we move forward with their regulatory plan around PFAS. They've got a \u2013 they've laid out a plan to move forward. We are working to support that with our investment in research and understanding \u2013 helping the understanding of PFAS, providing our data and really doing things like helping to provide a clearinghouse for all of the information and data around PFAS.","And so, we continue to be working in support of the EPA in our work on our resolving, our manufacturing disposal sites, and then also on moving the regulatory standards forward.","Nigel Coe","Thank you. A quick follow-on on the 2020 guidance. On the cash flow, the $5.3 billion to $6 billion of free cash, are you simply assuming delevering of the balance sheet in the bridge?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. Nigel, we\u2019re not \u2013 as we ended 2019, we had debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly \u2013 just a little over 2.5 times. We see that coming down probably about 50 basis points to be two or just slightly over two times debt to EBITDA, so that's part of our overall capital structure planning in 2020.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Mike Roman","Good morning, Joe. ","Joe Ritchie","Hey, Mike, can you expand a little bit on the commentary on this, the new restructuring initiatives that you have in place and how that differs from business transformation, fully recognizing that it sounds like you're streamlining the organization as well? But any additional color you can provide there would be helpful. (Auidt End)","Mike Roman","Yes. And Joe, what I laid out is really the next phase of our transformation journey, and it's taking advantage of everything that we've done, deploying the ERP, the ecosystem around it, the service models that we put in place, the capabilities, the technical capabilities to really manage our business, digitize a lot of what we do to manage our operations and our business processes. And so it became clear that we could take full advantage of that with how we operate our businesses globally.","And last spring, we announced moving from five to four businesses. At the time, it was \u2013 it looked like a realignment of the company, but where does it go? And this is really the next part of the story. We aligned around our customers and our go-to-market models. And with the launch in the new year of the new model, we are going to operate globally around those go-to-market models. And that includes how we operate our businesses everywhere around the world. It includes taking advantage of the capabilities we put in place with business transformation, and then It also includes this really consolidation of our manufacturing, supply chain and customer operations end-to-end to really optimize for those go-to-market models.","So it's a significant change in really how we align the customers, how we bring our innovation to market, how we streamline and simplify 3M around the world. It is taking advantage of business transformation, but it's really transformation, but it's really multiplying that impact as we move ahead.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, thank you. And then maybe just my follow-on, focused on the Transportation and Electronics segment. Clearly, that's a segment that has \u2013 had a tough 2019, and I think that there's some optimism in 2020 that we'll potentially start to see a rebound, particularly in the electronics side of things. And so if we were to start to see better growth, what kind of operating leverage would you guys expect to see out of that business? And in your commentary, Mike, earlier around positive organic growth in the first quarter, is this a segment that is also going to be positive in Q1?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. Joe, let me take that one. First of all from \u2013 to the second part of your question, Transportation and Electronics, for the year we've guided that negative 2% to positive 2% organic growth. Our view right now, as we see all four quarters in that range. Right now, and just to go a little off track, the Safety and Industrial business is the only one that we see a potential that that one would be below its range in the first quarter and then in the next three quarters within the range that we've guided.","As far as leverage that we expect in Transportation and Electronics, this is one of the businesses where as we see us returning to growth in that, that this would be accretive and would be adding to our leverage that we see that. A specific percentage, we typically don't put out, but it would be beneficial and we'd see the margins, the accretive margins there very similar to what we see for the total company, that as we rebuild the revenue there that we would be seeing that maybe an extra 10% going to increasing the margin as that \u2013 as the revenue improves there.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Thank you both.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","David Ridley-Lane","Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew.","Mike Roman","Good morning, David.","David Ridley-Lane","Good morning. Can you provide details on how your core gross margin will trend in 2020 given the unusual inventory related effect in 2019?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. The gross margins and our overall margins, but a part of \u2013 a big part of it will be our \u2013 through our gross margin improvement. We see overall operating margins improving 50 basis points to 100 basis points in 2020. And in the first quarter, we expect them to be roughly flat prior to the impact of Acelity.","Acelity, we again \u2013 we \u2013 because that was not part of our base in the first quarter, we expect that will be a negative impact to our total company margins of about 100 basis points in the first quarter, and will impact Health Care's margins by 400 basis points to 500 basis points in the first quarter. But the underlying margins in first quarter, excluding that we see roughly flat and then some expansion, because our primary inventory reductions that we were executing were occurring in the second, third and fourth quarter. And as we move into that that range then we \u2013 that's when we expect to be seen margin expansion, particularly gross margin expansion in 2020.","David Ridley-Lane","Got it. And for the follow-up, what are the sort of tailwinds do you see within Health Care? And do you see potential upside to the 2% to 4% organic guidance for the full year as you get to the second half of the year? Thank you.","Mike Roman","Yes. If you look at 2020 David, Health Care is going to be a leader for growth for us and that is really on some of the strengths that we saw coming out of 2019. We see continued strength in health information systems and with the M*Modal addition being part of that in our food-safety business.","Our medical solutions business, we see that benefiting from the strong market \u2013 outlook for market growth in Health Care. And so we see, and I would say, continued strength in developing markets helping to lead that growth forward. So it's some of the areas that we saw strengths in 2019 and then some of the things that we've been able to build upon with our acquisitions and leverage even stronger positions against a good macroeconomic outlook.","David Ridley-Lane","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.","John Inch","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Nick Gangestad","Hey, John.","Mike Roman","Good morning John.","John Inch","Good morning guys. Nick, can we start on the EPS road map, Slide 27? So you've dialed in minus $0.25 for 2019 headwinds. I think it's interesting. It's not a range. It's an exact precise number. What exactly is in that? For example, like our compensation headwinds, so having to pay people more money, is that in there? And anything you could say on that? Was there flex around it? What is going on there?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, John, there's two precise things in there, which is why it's not a range. About one-third of that is from gains we took in 2019 on disposal of certain properties, certain assets we had, that I talked about during our third quarter earnings call. The other two-thirds of that, John, is coming from variable compensation. With our results that were delivering \u2013 delivered in 2019, our variable comp is below our planned variable comp level. And we've built our plan for 2020 that we would be returning to planned variable comp. And that's why we're calling that out as a 2019 headwind.","John Inch","And can I ask you, Nick why is that fixed? For instance, let's just say the economy got better as 2020 progressed and you did much better than your zero to 2% core growth. Does that variable number also not dial up? Or is it kind of a fixed bonus? Like, why wouldn't the $0.25 possibly dial a little bit higher as a drag?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. So in 2020, if we start to see our compensation being different than that, then our normal practice would be that becomes part of productivity. So if we are paying more than our planned variable comp that would become a headwind to our productivity that we're projecting in 2020.","John Inch","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, Nick, can you remind us what's going on \u2013 or Mike. What's going on in Europe? I had in my notes \u2013 I thought that you were sort of on deck to maybe downsize your European footprint, I think pro forma, like about a third of production facilities, with a lot of this happening in the back half of 2019. Where do we stand on that? And I noticed that, for instance, Europe, on the core sequentially got worse. Was that actually \u2013 was that self-inflicted because of this associated internal disruption or actions? Or is there something else? Just is it just macro in Europe? Just where do we stand in Europe overall and the runway even to your 20% plus margins that you talked about at the last Analyst Meeting, Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. John thanks for asking that question. And there are several moving parts in there. First, let me talk to the margin, and then I'll talk to the growth. 2019 was a very good year of progress for us with our operating income margins again expanding in Europe to approximately 19%, very much along the trajectory that we were projecting that we would be on to be moving this to a 20% operating income margin by 2020. As part of that, we've been taking a number of action over the last few years. Some of them had been footprint actions, and we are starting to see some of that benefit manifest in our 2019 results going forward into 2020.","Also, there's been some portfolio adjustments, where there are certain product lines where we've been going through and prioritizing and deciding either to exit or to de-prioritize and de-resource. And as we look at our organic growth in 2019 as well as, in particular, you're asking about fourth quarter of 2019, that's been impacted, impacted by 50 basis points to 100 basis points of organic growth by some of our \u2013 what we have planned and done from a portfolio standpoint as part of our move to shift our portfolio in Europe. Much of the rest has been macro of what we're seeing. Plus, a little bit right now what we're seeing in the fourth quarter is a comparison that we're going against fourth quarter last year in Europe. This was very much in the range we're expecting. But macro, we're continuing to see auto builds down in Europe, and that does impact our overall EMEA results.","John Inch","But EMEA is up. Do you think it hits your 20% target in 2020 or maybe even a little bit better?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. We see ourselves very much in-line to be hitting that. Could be a little ahead, but I wouldn't get too far ahead on that. We see ourselves right in line to be hitting that.","John Inch","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Nick Gangestad","Hi, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, Mike, I was hoping to circle back on the restructuring announcement today, and I wanted to put it in context with what we're seeing across the multi-industry sector, where a number of companies are pursuing simplification via larger spinouts, bigger, bolder moves versus kind of what I would characterize, 3M has been more surgical. Have you looked \u2013 as a result, you look more like an outlier in terms of your simplification approach. Is it \u2013 what's your response there? Is it really company-specific? Are there opportunities to do something bigger? Is that \u2013 might be another next phase? But if you could give us some color there, that would be helpful.","Mike Roman","Yes, Deane. We \u2013 what I framed it up is this is part of our transformation journey. And if you look back, even back to the Investor Day in November of 2018, we laid out a plan for margin improvement over the coming years, and a big part of that was from transformation. So there was a plan by us to really keep moving forward in this. This announcement today is the next phase of that plan to move forward with an alignment around those four go-to-market models, our customers, better leverage all the business transformation investments we put in place. And we are optimizing as we go. We're building on the capabilities we've put in place.","You saw that in 2019 start to come through our EMEA and Canada results in terms of margins and service and inventory management improving there. We \u2013 it was part of getting on top of inventory in North America, too, as we deployed the new capabilities. And so I wouldn't call it a \u2013 I wouldn't think of it as a one-step in the middle of this. It's part of our transformation journey. And so we'll continue to optimize off of this. This is \u2013 enables \u2013 the charge that we took in Q4 enables us to move quickly to the alignment, get the full benefit of it as we go forward. It's really, we think, going to be an important part of what positions us to deliver growth and better efficiency as we go through 2020 and beyond.","Deane Dray","That\u2019s helpful. And then just staying on the restructuring, the payback for 2019, did \u2013 that's $40 million to $50 million in savings. Just based upon the size of the restructuring that seems a slower payback, does that have more to do with the timing of how you'll do these reductions?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Deane, that really is a function of this. As we move to streamline the \u2013 our operations there, not all of it is happening right away. There's parts of it that phase in over the course of the year, and that's why it's only having a $40 million to $50 million impact. Some of it, a minority position, part of that will come in the first half of the year. The vast majority of that $40 million to $50 million comes in the second half of the year.","Deane Dray","Got it. Thanks helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","John Walsh","Yes, good morning.","Mike Roman","Hey John.","Nick Gangestad","Hey John.","John Walsh","Wanted to talk about the price performance in the quarter and specific to the U.S., but happy if you want to broaden it out. As we think about that 1.7% price increase, that's a higher number than we've seen here in the past. Is that priced because of innovation and sustainable? Or did you hold price, and that was kind of impacting why the volume was down in the U.S.?","Nick Gangestad","John, the price growth \u2013 first of all, let me expand it to the full year for U.S. price growth. With that 1.7%, that brings our full year price growth to 80 basis points. John, I think that's the more helpful number for you to look at and focus on. Often in a quarter-to-quarter basis, there's going to be what is it comparing to in the quarter in the prior year. So I won't overreact to the 1.7%. Our view is the 80 basis points that we did in the U.S. in total 2019, that's indicative of what we're doing. And to the first premise of your question, what we overall see in price growth is a function of the value we are creating. It's the innovation we have in our products and continuing to update the product lines and the products that we offer there. And that is a big driver of that. But I won't focus on the 1.7%. I'd focus more on the full year, the 80 basis points.","John Walsh","Got you. And then maybe coming at the flat to up 2% organic just a different way. If we think about 2019, particularly on the automotive side, you did have some impact from channel inventory destocking. I don't know if it's possible, but have you thought about what the growth rate would look like just with the absence of those headwinds? And how much of that kind of flat to 2% is just a normalization versus the macro getting any better?","Mike Roman","John, the return to growth of zero to 2% that is really reflecting both the macro and then I think a closer look at the markets that we've been challenged within 2019. So electronics, automotive, China. And in 2019, as you noted, there was an impact from channel reactions. As they saw the decline in those markets, they reacted, took out inventory. So part of the year-over-year, in those markets, comparison is going to be a more stable channel. We do see more balanced inventory in those channels.","I would say electronics; we're seeing the early signs of maybe some encouraging outlook in areas like semiconductor, fabrication and data centers. In automotive, the outlook for the year is still negative build rates. Slightly negative, I think, is the broader economic view. We're a little more conservative than that in a slower start to the year. But again, I would say our view is \u2013 also has that idea of balanced inventory in the face of those outlooks.","John Walsh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Mike Roman","Good morning, Andy.","Nick Gangestad","Hey Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike, can we go back to Health Care for a second? I know that you changed the reporting last year and put separation and purification, and that's continuing the growth a little bit. But you, I'm sure, recall that Health Care was supposed to be a 2% to 4% grower in 2019 and reported a little under 2% and the 4% to 6% through 2023. So I know you're saying 2% to 4% for 2020. Has the impact on Health Care just been, I guess, unexpected cyclicality? Or have you sort of reassessed the long-term growth of the business? And is there any sort of thought about accelerating portfolio optimization in that particular business beyond selling drug delivery?","Mike Roman","Well, Andy, I would say, as I highlighted in my speech, we have been focused with our portfolio actions on Health Care. As you mentioned, drug delivery and the plan to divest that, adding Acelity, adding M*Modal into our health information systems. And if you go back to Q4, the growth \u2013 organic growth in Q4 was positive across most of the portfolio. It was led by mid-single-digit growth in health information systems and food safety. Medical solutions was up slightly in the quarter. Oral care declined in the low single digits.","And so that was maybe the focus of the softer growth in Q4. We did see strong growth geographically in areas like China and other parts of the world. So that's kind of what we carry into 2020. And we see medical solutions improving. The market outlook there is strong, and our position is strong. We see health information, food safety continuing. We see separation and purification getting a little better. And so we \u2013 all of that together positions us in a stronger growth for the outlook for the total year.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike, that's helpful. And then, Nick, just looking at the walk for 2020 again. Do you still see the potential for additional property sales? So there may be an element of conservatism in that item. And then you talked about a pretty wide range for this year in terms of productivity impacts from zero to $0.25. It seems that's like a little higher than usual. Is productivity more dependent on what organic growth is this year and that's why it's a little hard to pin down in 2020?","Nick Gangestad","Andy, I just want to make sure you asked, where the potential for other property sales and if that's what you said, no, we're not anticipating anything of any material magnitude on gains or losses from property sales in 2020. In terms of the range that we have for productivity between zero and 25% \u2013 $0.25, that's might be a little wider than normal.","And I think it does reflect as we're coming off a year where our margins were declining as we were having noticeable drops in inventory as well as we're going through the transformation and the restructuring charges we've called out and isolated the restructuring charges, but that's also a driver of our productivity and we're isolating that, and just the interplay of that adds a little more complexity for that. And we see the zero to $0.25 is like our best estimate right now. And of course we're going to be striving to be on the higher end of that, but it's where we are building our plans right now.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks for that Nick.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi. Good morning guys.","Mike Roman","Good morning Josh.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just a follow-up on Andy's question a little bit on productivity, maybe slightly a different way. I guess Nick, how does zero end up in the range? You mentioned kind of the under-absorption and destocking issues, which I think caught you by surprise in the first quarter of last year, in particular on the volume drop. What would be the driver of the lower end of that range? Is it \u2013 if demand is better and like you said the incentive comp is a hit to productivity? Just trying to understand what the downside could be or what even drive the pressures to that?","Nick Gangestad","Josh a couple of things. First of all, as would typically be the expectation if our growth is on the lower end of our range, I think that puts a little pressure to us on the lower end of the productivity range that we've laid out here, and included in that productivity range there's positive things that we're doing such as where we're seeing where the utilization of our factories in comparison to 2019. But it's also \u2013 we're also facing into as we do every year wage inflation so offsetting wage inflation is part of that.","We also have other things that are impacted in there. For example, what we've called out under other and other pension expense that hits the non-offline is being flat year-on-year. Included in our productivity there is a between $0.06 and $0.07 headwind for increased pension expenses, that's part of that productivity number. So there is a negative headwind \u2013 there is headwinds we're facing and there as we face a zero to 25%.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the demand outlook. I think clearly there is an expectation maybe a few months ago that we were on this kind of linear recovery and maybe a mid-year bigger inflection in demand across the industrial universe. It seems like January has been a little slower for everyone. If you guys had a snap the line today versus some of the potential may be green shoots you could have been seeing 30 days or 60 days ago, as anything seen pushed out or off track or is this just kind of a timing issue and we shouldn't read anything into January?","Mike Roman","Josh, I think you laid it out. The way we looked at that low growth macroeconomic especially in industrial, industrial production index kind of view of that it was getting better as we went through the year. That's the way we built our outlook for the year, our plan. I would say the biggest change since that has been what's going on in China. And it's \u2013 that will be the \u2013 have the biggest impact on how the first quarter plays out and then how we move further into the year. So I think that's the most important thing to be watching out.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Nick Gangestad","Hey, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Just a quick question following up on inventories. I think Nick or Mike; you'd said that you had a $370 million drawdown in 2019 overall. Maybe just help us understand what the margin impact of that drawdown was for the full year 2019. And also, as you sit here today, do you view your channel inventories that your customers and partners as being fairly normal? Or is there a bit more to go of destock in Q1? And then, switching back to 3M itself on inventory, do you have that old medium-term goal of a $500 million reduction, where do we stand on that?","Nick Gangestad","Julian, several questions all at once. So first of all, on the $370 million of inventory reduction, our estimate that that's negatively impacted our operating margins or our gross margins in 2019 by 50 basis points to 100 basis points. That's true both for the fourth quarter and also true for the full year about 50 basis points to 100 basis points. And we see that flipping to be part \u2013 that's part of our guidance of the margin improvement in 2020 is having that headwind behind us.","As far as channel inventories, there's always some puts and takes. I'd say we're seeing nothing abnormal right now with channel inventories. We have, of course as we've said throughout the year we've seen some reductions in our inventory \u2013 channel held inventories, but right now, I'd characterize it is fairly normal where we stand with inventories. And then we \u2013 in 2020 we do anticipate that we will bring down inventories a bit more, nothing on the magnitude of the $370 million that we did in 2019, but we expect we will be \u2013 we'll continue our progress of taking down our inventories slightly in 2020.","As far as the guidance we had given prior of $500 million. We see the progress that we made in 2019 as most of that reduction getting us back to where we were when we first said that and some of that starting to make progress on that $500 million. We still see opportunities in the coming years for us to operate our supply chain even more efficiently and gather even more of that $500 million inventory reduction through our cash flow in the coming years. We've made some progress in 2019, we'll make more in 2020 and we'll make more in 2021.","Julian Mitchell","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.","Mike Roman","To wrap up. In the fourth quarter, we leveraged the strengths of the 3M business model to navigate market conditions while delivering strong cash flow and solid margins. We also continue to make significant progress on our transformation journey with the rollout of our new operating model. We enter 2020 in a strong strategic and financial position poised to return to growth and deliver value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 27, 2015. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 business review. Let me kick off with the remainder of our upcoming 2015 earnings call dates. April 23rd, July 23rd and October 22nd. Also, mark your calendars for our next Investor Meeting schedule for December 15th. More details will be available as we get closer to that date.","Today\u2019s earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two.","During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Now if you please turn to slide three and I\u2019ll hand off to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. 3M finished the year strong, delivered both record sales and record earnings in the fourth quarter. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we posted organic growth everywhere, in all business groups and in all geographic areas. We did that while expanding margins, increasing profits and investing in our future. I\u2019ll take you through a few numbers.","Earnings per share rose to $1.81, up 11.7% year-over-year, sales was $7.7 billion, the fourth quarter record, organic growth companywide was 6%, paced by Safety and Graphics at 9%. Our other four business groups, Healthcare, Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Consumer each grew a solid 6%.","We saw organic growth in every geographic area. Both APAC and United States grew 7%. For the United States that marked its strongest growth of the year. Latin America, Canada grew 9%, while Europe, Middle East, Africa grew 3%.","Our team is clearly capable of executing in tough environments and fighting through tough headwinds. That includes a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced fourth quarter sales by more than 4%. Yet, we still delivered good top and bottomline growth.","Operating margins remained healthy at 21.5%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. We again generated strong cash flow with the conversion rate of 144%. This allowed us to invest in the business and continue rewarding shareholders.","We returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and in December, we announced the 20% per share increase in our Q1 dividend for 2015 on top of a 35% increase in 2014. Overall, we finished the year strong and I thank entire 3M team for their hard work and execution.","Nick will now go through the details. Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide four, where I'll review the components of our fourth quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 6.3%, with volumes up 5.6% and selling prices up 0.7%. This was our strongest quarterly organic growth since Q1 2011. The Treo acquisition added 10 basis points to growth and the stronger dollar reduced sales by 4.4%. All-in, sales rose 2% versus fourth quarter of 2013.","Leading the way with 9% organic growth was Latin America, Canada, where Electronics and Energy, Healthcare and Safety and Graphics all grew double digits. Mexico delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter and Brazil was up slightly. Asia-Pacific grew 6.9%, Safety and Graphics and Healthcare led the way with growth of 12% and 9%, respectively.","Organic growth was 9% in Japan or 4% excluding Electronics. China, Hong Kong grew 4% or 6% excluding Electronics. The United States grew 6.6%, led by Industrial at 10%, Healthcare, Consumer and Safety and Graphics all grew 7%.","EMEA posted organic growth of 3.3% in the quarter. Central East Europe and Middle East Africa each grew double digits, while West Europe grew 1%. EMEA economies remained soft, but our teams are managing the situation well by growing our market positions and driving continuous productivity across the region. Organic growth within EMEA was positive in four of our by businesses, led by Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy. Consumer was down slightly in the quarter.","Turn to slide five for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Fourth quarter sales were $7.7 billion, up 2% year-on-year, with 6% organic growth more than offsetting the stronger dollar.","Operating income rose 5% to $1.7 billion and earnings per share rose 12% year-on-year. We increased operating margins by 60 basis points year-on-year, while continuing to invest for the future. I'll now go into more details on our margin improvement.","Organic volume leverage added 40 basis points to operating margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 60 basis points. Selling prices increased year-on-year across many of our businesses supported by technology innovation, brand and strong new product flow.","Raw materials were again lower versus last year's comparable quarter, commodity prices declined as we close out Q4 and we expect these tailwinds to accelerate in 2015. Lower pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to margins.","Strategic investments reduced margins by 80 basis points. This includes increases in disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP costs, and restructuring. During Q4, we took portfolio actions totaling $30 million spread across the United States, Western Europe and Asia-Pacific.","Foreign currency exchange reduced margins by 10 basis points and the Treo acquisition was just slightly dilutive. Finally, productivity, resulting in a benefit of 10 basis points to margins year-on-year.","Earnings were $1.81 per share, an increase of 12%. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced earnings by $0.05 a share, given the broad based strength of the dollar. A lower year-on-year tax rate added a penny to per share earnings and average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's fourth quarter, which added $0.08 to fourth quarter earnings per share.","Now I will review cash flow performance on slide #6. Free cash flow was strong in Q4 with 144% conversion versus 131% in last year's fourth quarter. Operating cash flow increased $190 million driven by multiple factors, including higher net income and improved fixed and working capital efficiencies. For the year, we delivered 104% free cash flow conversion.","We continue to manage toward a better optimized capital structure by adding balance sheet leverage which we are using for two purposes; first, to invest in our businesses and second, to increase cash returns to shareholders. Full year capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, an important element as we continue to expand the business organically.","We paid $2.2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends during 2014, up $486 million versus 2013. As a reminder, on December 16th, we communicated a Q1 2015 dividend increase of 20% per share. And in terms of buybacks, gross share repurchases in 2014 were $5.7 billion, up $440 million year-on-year. Net debt at the end of December was $3.5 billion, up $2.3 billion from year end 2013.","Next, I'll go through the results of our business groups starting with industrial on slide seven. Industrial with sales of $2.6 billion delivered strong organic local currency growth of nearly 6% in the quarter. Advanced Materials led the way with double-digit growth. Our Aerospace and Commercial Transportation business generated high single-digit growth and we also saw strong growth in Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Automotive Aftermarket and Auto OEM.","All regions delivered growth for Industrial paced again by the U.S. at 10%. The U.S. growth was broad based with notable performances in the three industrial heartland businesses, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Automotive Aftermarket and Abrasives. Latin America\/Canada grew 6%, followed by Asia Pacific at 5% and EMEA at 1%.","Operating income was $538 million and operating margins were 20.5% down 90 basis points versus last year's all-time Q4 record margin, which was driven by very strong productivity. Investments were higher year-on-year including efforts to better optimize elements of our U.S. supply chain. Fourth quarter 2014 operating margins were in line with normal seasonal trends and for the full year, margins were a solid 21.7%, up 10 basis points versus 2013.","Let's now look at Healthcare on slide eight. Healthcare delivered another very good quarter with sales of $1.4 billion in organic growth of over 6%. Every Healthcare business posted positive organic growth. Our large core medical businesses, namely infection prevention and critical and chronic care posted strong growth in the quarter.","Health Information Systems and Food Safety, each grew double digits. Healthcare grew organically in all geographic areas led by Latin American\/Canada at 12% and Asia Pacific at 9%. The U.S. grew 7% and EMEA grew 3%. In developing markets, Healthcare grew 15% organically marking the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This has been a high priority investment area of ours for some time and these investments are paying off.","We continue to build our capability to expand even further into the future. Operating income was $431 million and margins remained strong at 31%, which includes 30 basis points of dilution from the Treo acquisition. Integration efforts are tracking to our expectations and the business continues to exceed sales and profit objectives.","Please turn to slide nine. Electronics and Energy continue to build momentum with strong fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.4 billion with organic growth over 6%. Operating income was $257 million and margins increased 2 percentage points year-over-year to 18.7%.","Recent portfolio management actions are enhancing our relevance with customers and generating operational efficiencies, which contributed to the growth and margin improvement in the quarter and for the year. Organic local currency sales grew 9% in our electronics related businesses as we continue to see strong and customer demand, enhanced by spec-end wins at several OEMs.","In our energy related businesses, organic local currency sales increased 2%. The electrical markets business was up high-single digits while renewable energy and telecom both declined year-on-year. On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 13% in Latin America\/Canada, 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in EMEA. The United States was flat year-on-year.","Please turn to slide 10. Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, up a robust 9% organically. Personal Safety grew double digits as we continue to see strong demand for 3M safety solutions in the manufacturing sector. In addition, our respiratory products are selling well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern.","We also saw a pickup in sales related to Ebola in the quarter. We estimate this added approximately $30 million to Q4 sales. Elsewhere in Safety and Graphics, Commercial Solutions grew mid-single digits and organic sales declined slightly in roofing granules and traffic safety and security. Asia-Pacific delivered 12% growth for Safety and Graphics led by personal safety.","Growth was 10% in Latin America, Canada, 9% in EMEA and 7% in United States. Operating income was $285 million and operating margins increased 1.6 percentage points to 20.8%. This result was driven by strong organic growth and productivity.","I will finish with the Consumer business group found on slide 11. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion, with organic growth of nearly 6%. All four businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by a double-digit increase in do-it-yourself. This business continues to win in the marketplace, with leading brands such as Filtrete filters and Command adhesives.","We also saw good growth in Consumer, Healthcare, with notable strength in our FUTURO branded health supports. Looking by geography, U.S. organic growth was 7%, boosted by strong holiday selling of Scotch and other 3M branded products. Elsewhere, organic growth was 8% in Latin America, Canada and 5% in Asia-Pacific. EMEA declined 1% year-on-year.","Operating income increased 12% to $254 million and margins were 22.5%. Margins rose 2.1 percentage points year-over-year. The combination of strong organic growth, productivity and portfolio prioritization continue to drive efficiencies across the business.","That wraps up my review of the quarter. I will hand it back to Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2014, we deliver a record $32 billion in sales. We grew organically in each business group and geographic area, with a good balance between developed and developing markets.","We expanded margins and returned a record $7.9 billion to shareholders. We also made good progress on each of our long-term financial objectives, which I laid out at our investor meeting here in St. Paul on November 8, 2012. On earnings-per-share, our target is 9% to 11% average growth. In 2014, we grew EPS at 11.5%.","On organic growth, our target is 4% to 6%. We grew 4.9% organically for the year. For return on invested capital, our target is 20%. In 2014, we achieved 22%. Finally, on free cash flow conversion, our target is 100%. For the year, we hit 104%.","Driving our success is the scale of our people and the strings of our business model, which includes three key levers. The first is portfolio management. Since 2012, we have realigned our portfolio from six sectors to five business groups and for 40 businesses to 27.","In 2014, we combined businesses within three of our business groups, Electronics and Energy, Safety and Graphics and Industrial. All in, we invested $19 million in 2014 in portfolio actions to position us for greater future success. We also look to enhance our portfolio and complement organic growth through M&A.","In 2014, we invested $1 billion in acquisitions, including the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary, one of 3M's most successful businesses. We also just recently divested our static control business. Active portfolio management is delivering significant benefit for 3M, including greater customer relevance, scale and productivity.","Investing in innovation is our second lever. 3M\u2019s primary growth strategy is organic and we strive to develop unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for customers. This is why research and development is the heartbeat of our company.","In 2014, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. The strings of our innovation engine helped drive organic growth of nearly 5% in the year. 3M also earned more than 3,000 patents in 2014. In our history, we have now earned more than 100,000 patents globally.","The third lever is business transformation. At our investor meeting in December, I laid out our path forward, which includes implementation of global ERP system. This will create a more ideal and efficient 3M, and allow us to better serve customers around the world.","Looking at our 2014 performance, I see clear evidence that our playbook includes these three levers, is continuing to drive strong results and value creation. We expect to continue that momentum in 2015.","Please turn to slide 13 and I will review our outlook for the year. EPS guidance remains unchanged at $8 to $8.30. Organic growth is still expected to be 3% to 6% in the range. Given the strength in U.S. dollar, we are seeing stronger currency headwinds than expected in December. We now estimate FX to reduce sales by 4% to 5% versus previous guidance of minus 2% to minus 3%.","However, as evident in our fourth quarter and full year results, we know how to operate in this environment. In addition, we see input costs lower versus one month ago and our sourcing teams are focused on maximizing those benefits. Our tax rate estimates remain to 28% to 29%, with free cash conversion of 90% to 100%.","As you can see, we look forward to another strong and successful year. And with that, I thank you for your attention and we now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your question.","Ajay Kejriwal","Thank you. Good morning.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Ajay.","Ajay Kejriwal","And congratulations. Very nice results. So if I just look at the organic growth, to me it seems like to defining all the negatives macro headlines out there, imagine a lot of what you are seeing, what you are doing there, looks like share gains. But just maybe a couple on that, a big shoe is one, just on your take on what the macro is. What you are seeing by geography and then second, if you are able to identify a path to some of the markets that you are seeing share gains without imaging some of this as share gains in terms of the growth of those markets?","Inge Thulin","Well, thank you. First of all, we are pleased to see the momentum that has build over many quarters now relative to organic local currency growth. And for me specifically why that is very encouraging is that we have made a lot of efforts relative to our organization structure, both in United States but also outside of United States to make sure we are becoming more efficient and effective and more relevant to our customers. And I think that is what we see paying off. And it\u2019s broad-based.","And I think that is also related to -- we have a very diversified portfolio as a company. If you think about the five business groups, we are very diversified from a business group perspective and we are very diversified geographically as well, with United States as the biggest geographical area for us and type of a homeland. So it\u2019s very nice to see it all coming together for us.","When we looked up on the result for the quarter and then look out to the range for 2015, they\u2019re not changing the range for us. We still believe -- we had a United States, we have a 7% organic growth for the quarter. We have said for '15 3% to 6% in the range. We believe that will be on the high end of that range in my mind as we see it here today doing very, very well.","APAC, we had another 7% in the quarter and we have seen businesses coming back a little bit both in China for us and in Southeast Asia. And Japan had a very good year as well for us. But when you look upon that in terms of a range for the year, we believe Asia is 3% to 7%, China is probably 4% to 10%, and Japan a little bit lower. So there is a good market condition for us in order to be able to grow.","Latin America, as you saw, came back -- and Latin America and Canada came back this quarter. And we talked about that in the last call where we said see 5% to 8% for them as we roll into the year. And we are still sticking with that. Brazil was slightly positive. Mexico did very, very well.","So I think when you look upon North America; U.S., Canada, Mexico has a very good growth momentum for us. And then West Europe, we have -- we\u2019d say, as we said before, a little bit of question mark. We\u2019ve had that in the range of minus 2% to plus 2% for the year. We had growth of 1 percentage point in West Europe -- Europe, Middle East, Africa 3% for the quarter. And as we produce quite a bit in those countries, in terms of export that should not be too negative for us as we move ahead.","And as you know, it\u2019s not only that research and development, which is driving organic local currency growth by the way, but also the strategy we\u2019ve had around domestic business model should play for us here. So -- and when you ask about market share and so forth, we have many businesses, so it\u2019s difficult to go through all of them. But when I look upon, it is clear that we take market share in many of our businesses.","Ajay Kejriwal","Excellent. That\u2019s very helpful. And then quick one for Nick. Maybe on the currency exposures, Nick, any color on how you positioned in terms of hedging both natural and through contract? And then maybe any comments on your Swiss franc exposure, please? Thank you.","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Ajay, if we go back to the December 16th earnings outlook meeting, at that time we shared that we expected FX to impact our earnings per share negatively in 2015 by $0.10 to $0.20. With the movement in the foreign exchange rates that we\u2019ve seen in the last month, we now put ourselves right at the high end of that range as that is hurting 3M\u2019s earnings per share by $0.20 year-on-year.","Our approach in managing that is really unchanged and it\u2019s on several fronts. First of all, we have a strong management team that knows how to manage through foreign currency exchanges, and that\u2019s been demonstrated time and after time. We also have a hedging strategy where we hedge approximately 50% of our economic or P&L exposure and we hedge that out in the past for 12 months. As we noted in the middle of 2014, we extended that tenor out to 24 months for some of the currencies in developed -- some of the developed countries we are in such as euro and yen.","And then operationally, some of the things we do to manage that exposure is looking for opportunities and sources of supply and in some cases, raising prices to offset that currency or pegging our selling prices to a hard currency, such as the U.S. dollar. And that\u2019s much of the story we\u2019ve had in the past and it remains the same in 2015.","As far as your question on Switzerland, we have minimal cost exposure there and that will have a immaterial impact on our results in 2015.","Ajay Kejriwal","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis, Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis","Thanks. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","I wanted to follow up on the question on currency a bit. And just how do you guys think about adjusting production or changing how think about your -- how you supply the marketplace, just given the fairly violent swings we\u2019ve had in currency? And like, for example if Canadian dollar is falling as dramatically as it has, does it make sense to produce in that country and export into U.S.? Are there other things that you can do that could help mitigate the impact?","Nick Gangestad","Scott, that\u2019s a good and interesting question. And I will just put it in a short-term and long-term perspective. From a short-term perspective, this isn\u2019t the type of thing that week to week, month to month that we fluctuate are production from one part of the world to the next. Our number one focus is how are we going to serve our customers locally? And then from there we then focus on, are there opportunities? So I will use the eurozone right now where we have a European Center of Excellence, that\u2019s looking at what kind of opportunities do we have with the current FX rates on the euro.","Looking at our material costs, are there potentials to renegotiate purchase prices, material localization? Does it create new opportunities for us to source something from a new supplier at a different FX exchange rate to our advantage? In times like this, it also causes to manage our spending, probably more tightly in some parts of the world. And then to what you\u2019re talking, that\u2019s a little longer-term, looking at regional sales sufficiency. We do have manufacturing capability to manufacture products that has spread around the world, and then we use movements like this to look for those opportunities. That\u2019s going on constantly, and it\u2019s a heightened case for us right now, Scott.","Scott Davis","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then when you look at our CapEx budget for 2015, I am just trying to get a sense of where the priorities, where do you -- where are you investing? And once -- I mean, this question asked a couple years ago would have been all China or I mean other emerging markets. And has that shifted at all back to more developing nations? Or just give us a sense of, maybe think about the priorities for the 1.5 billion where you\u2019re going to spend money?","Nick Gangestad","Scott, I characterize our priorities as fairly balanced and not changing in 2015. And there is couple dimensions to talk about that. First of all, we tried to have a nice balance of where we are investing in growth, expanding our capabilities and our capacity to meet local customer requirements.","Second, we are also investing in increasing our competitiveness, often that\u2019s in renewal or enhancements to existing manufacturing sites we have.","And then third, there are some strategic investments we\u2019re making where it might be expanding in a new geography or one of our significant strategic investments is our investment in business transformation and ERP.","Geographically, we continue to see a nice balance of where that's going. It\u2019s not skewing more to developing markets, right now. In 2015, we see it bounce very close to what we've had in the last two year.","Scott Davis","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Okay. Great job, guys. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Nick Gangestad","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Andrew.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question, in terms of restructuring in the quarter, it seems like strategic investments reaccelerated versus the third quarter. So the first thing, can you just -- you mentioned $30 million for restructuring in Q4, what was the 3Q number if you could remind us?","And then, if you could just talk about the balance of strategic investments and restructuring versus the benefit, because last quarter they turned positive and we're back to being negative. Just how should I think about the benefits of restructuring going forward?","Nick Gangestad","Yeah. Andrew, a couple points on that. Yes, our $30 million that was restructuring portfolio actions that we took in a few of our business, in electronics, in energy, safety and graphics, and healthcare. And as I said earlier spread geographically, but most heavily concentrated in Western Europe for a total of $30 million. And that was very close to zero in Q3 of 2014.","So an up-tick from the level we saw one quarter before. Returns that we see on this will vary by geography. The restructuring actions we\u2019re taking in United States we see paybacks occurring within the next calendar year or less than 12 months. The paybacks that we see on our Western European portfolio actions typically take longer, and we see paybacks that can take two or three years on those investments.","Andrew Obin","But just as we're thinking about the paybacks, right, because obviously you've been reinvesting for a couple of years now. And as I said, just going back last quarter you had a pretty positive tailwind from the benefits. And this quarter I think it was relatively flat. How should I think about that going forward?","Nick Gangestad","Yeah. Thinking about that going forward Andrew, part of what I laid out for 2015 is that we\u2019re expecting $0.10 to $0.20 of productivity benefits and part of our margin expansion in 2015 versus 2014, a portion of that productivity benefit. And I will roughly attribute one-third of that productivity benefit is coming from past restructuring activities that 3M is invested in.","Andrew Obin","Got you. That's great. And just a small follow-up. What's your assumption for oil price, that's baked into your forecast for the year?","Nick Gangestad","Andrew, for the year, we are estimating that oil prices are going to average $50 a barrel. And while you're on the subject in the December 16th earnings call part of my outlook at that time was that raw materials we expected to benefit, our earnings per share in 2015 by $0.15 to $0.25. With our latest assumption on oil prices, we\u2019re now right at the high end of that estimate. We\u2019re still in the estimate but now at the very high end of it.","Andrew Obin","Thank you very much.","Nick Gangestad","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","And a nice quarter.","Nick Gangestad","Thank you.","Joe Ritchie","Just my first question is on price cost. Nick, you've been talking for a while that we're going to start to see a lower benefit from price cost, and historically over the past year you've done closer to about 100 basis points, and you\u2019ve got 60 basis points this quarter. Could you just talk to us a little bit about the dynamic this quarter, was it because you lap some pricing increases, and how should we think about pricing in '15?","Nick Gangestad","Yeah. Joe, yes it did come through almost exactly like as we were describing. The components of what we\u2019re seen there, we did have significant price growth in 2013 and there is a bit of lapping occurring there. We do continue to still see strength of the 3M product innovation flow, the strength of the 3M brand, and the impact that has on pricing. FX in the first part of 2014 had a more pronounced impact on our pricing growth and that abated some in the fourth quarter.","Party of the mix of where the FX movements have been occurring, it\u2019s much more in developed markets in currency such as the Europe. And then going forward, we continue to expect low price growth of all of our organic growth, the 3% to 6% that we\u2019re projecting for 2015. We\u2019re expecting the vast majority of that to be in volume growth and not price growth.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And maybe one follow-up for Inge. Inge, you mentioned earlier on M&A, you mentioned Sumitomo. I was just wondering whether the environment recently with the evaluations coming down in certain end markets, whether things have gotten anymore attractive in terms of the pipeline from an M&A standpoint.","Inge Thulin","Are you talking overall M&A pipeline? You don\u2019t talk specifically Japan but you talk overall.","Joe Ritchie","Right now, overall.","Inge Thulin","Overall, yes, our pipeline is robust and we are working at constantly. And as I said earlier, I feel that we\u2019re on a much better position now to really identify the most attractive pieces for us as we have better -- much better understanding today versus two, three years ago of positions in our portfolio in between the different businesses. And also when we now have identified the real fundamental strengths of 3M which is for us, which around the technology, manufacturing a global capability and brand equity.","So we say that we are in a much better position today in order to be able to look upon them and identify them et cetera. So that's good. And we have as I said earlier from my move from a more of a bottom-up approach, we have complement that that with the top-down approach as well in order to make sure that we can identify and find something that can be used more broad based in the organization.","Ceradyne was probably the first one around those acquisitions, and is working out very well and again had a very good quarter for us at this quarter end. So think about it in that respect, we find that that\u2019s very attractive with us, that there is both sustainable end market that is interesting but also some technology for us that we can expand into our auto platforms which is an important thing for us. And technology innovation for us is important for us in order to create more value for customers and for our shareholder. So it\u2019s an important element.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks for the color and nice quarter.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker","Thanks, and good morning all. I wondered if we could dig in a little more in that pricing point, specifically around your ability to price versus translation and other currency effects competitively in Europe and Latin America. So to what extent is there a lag here and those pricing actions being taken? So when I looked at that 1.4% on price in EMEA and 3% Latin America, Canada versus minus 9.79%, should we count on that catching up a bit in the next quarter or two? And then Inge, just strategically as you think about this going forward, any competitive dynamics that change as a result of that currency fluctuation? ","Nick Gangestad","Yeah, Steven, in the past you\u2019ve witnessed for price growth when it\u2019s driven by FX reductions in the last couple of years primarily in developing markets, you\u2019ve seen a pretty significant amount of that recaptured in price. If I were you modeling, I would not be modeling that same ratio of pricing actions to offset that. The businesses are out there engaged, working on where the opportunities are for offsetting some of that FX in price but the ratios that we've experienced in the past are not going to be the same as what we're going to see in Western Europe.","There are some parts of EMEA though where we are changing our pricing to be U.S. dollar priced, which will bolster our price growth there. But the guidance I gave Steve is tamper that ratio that you\u2019ve historically seen.","Inge Thulin","Yeah, and coming back Steve, if I may on your question. I think, one important thing is to just recognize the investments that we have done over years under the umbrella of domestic demand and domestic manufacturing, which is helping you a lot relative to issues like this. I think the other thing is the technology innovation will by definition in most businesses help you.","And the way we look upon all business, we have one that I will describe as a design and spec-end business and then you have one on consumables. On design and spec-end businesses where you provide technology innovation that is coming on platforms, that's a big advantage for us because the technology is there and in most cases, we are able to produce locally.","So another thing is over one-third of our businesses in United States. And as I\u2019ve said before, 3M never left United States, we stayed here. In fact, I\u2019ve also invested this year in more capacity specifically, in our Healthcare business. So I see in terms of some competitive moves -- from time to time that can be in my view in smaller countries around the world, maybe some push in the low end of the portfolio from some local competitors.","But I think, that\u2019s not what 3M is all about based on our business model, generally speaking. So we should be able to hold in there. And as I said, probably gain market share as we move ahead, like I am generally speaking very, very pleased with execution relative to our commercialization capabilities in the company. And I\u2019m very pleased to see how that momentum had built now for five, six quarters, slightly stronger every quarter, so that's good.","Steven Winoker","3M use to quote a percentage of regional production for regional consumption or supply, which you refer to several times now to this call. You have a sense for how high that is these days?","Inge Thulin","It depends on the region by definition and it\u2019s slightly higher in West Europe and United States versus in APAC and Central East Europe and Middle East Africa. But we are pushing that I would say, as we move ahead, but also being thoughtful relative, so we do not build too much capacity and duplicate efforts.","So it\u2019s I think have been a big effort and as you remember that we talked in the past about slightly complicated supply chain operation. And as maybe I said to many of you is that that\u2019s a big thing now that we go after as we move into \u201815 as to make sure we get much more streamlined supply chain and better cost of good sold and better inventory management and so forth.","Steven Winoker","And was wage inflation, anything unusual in the quarter at all and then when you did a productivity 10 basis point number, I assume that net of wage inflation?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. That is net of wage. And no, we're not seeing anything unusual in wage inflation or wage pressures, very normal trends for us.","Steven Winoker","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Shannon.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey. Can you just dig a little bit more into this U.S. Industrial strength? You said it was up 10% in the quarter and I think, the -- you mentioned the Safety business was also strong in manufacturing? What\u2019s sort of strongest thing you're seeing there and your confidence level what\u2019s -- where you see changing?","Inge Thulin","Well, yeah, so first of all, the two businesses as you talked about Industrial by definition, core Industrial and Personal Safety, they often growing hand by hand, right. So we saw good growth there.","So for us, we saw Aerospace and Transportation in high single-digit growth and if you take the core business, which is, I will categorize as adhesives and tape and abrasives, we saw very good growth. We saw adhesives and tape that this is our biggest division. We saw that at 8% growth in the quarter and we also saw automotive at 5%.","So I would say it was broad-based in United States in those businesses. And as I said earlier, you think about at for us as a design and spec-in, where you have coming in on products and platforms, and then you have the consumables where you\u2019re using our products in your manufacturing operation and so forth.","So I would say it was broad-based and when I looked upon the growth for the businesses in Industrial, they -- we were around 5 plus for every business in United State. So very strong and as you said, Personal Safety was even higher than that. So it looks good for us and the team is executing well. So it\u2019s good.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. And then, 3M is pretty interesting view into how the impact of lower oil prices is actually going to impact, demand in the economy and sort of the positives and the negatives of that? Do you have any kind of early read on that or anything your sense in your businesses or seem talking your business leaders or a view of how this might play out?","Nick Gangestad","Yeah. Shannon, the impact on the business and our ability to organic growth, I really don't have any insight to share there of anything changing in the market as a result. The primary impact we are seeing is what's coming out us with commodity prices. And what we\u2019ve been seen in what we\u2019re paying for commodities so far this year and why I'm saying that we\u2019re now on the high-end of our $0.15 to $0.25 benefit from raw material prices.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Do you have any sense sort of an early pickup and better consumer spending in your businesses because consumers have more discretionary?","Nick Gangestad","Yeah. We haven't seen that yet, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","My first question was on R&D and Inge, I know that there is a plan to ramp up R&D to a 6% level? But it didn\u2019t look like it started to happen this quarter, actually declined year-over-year? I know it probably shouldn\u2019t be a linear process, but maybe if you could comment on R&D spending over the next couple of quarters?","Inge Thulin","Yeah. Well, first of all, it\u2019s -- we see improved productivity coming out of the laboratories, which we are very pleased about. If I give you some facts relative to that additional 5% of -- from 5.5% to 6% increase in spending is around disruptive technologies and this is now going into the third year.","So, overall, we have 30 programs that are funded, 19 of them came on in 2013, seven in 2014 and we are looking for another four here in 2015. So the investment of it over the years have been 82 in \u201914 and was 40 in \u201813 and we plan for another 70 plus this year.","Seven of the programs are now in early stage of commercialization and that's in Healthcare, Infrastructure and Transportation, Electronics and Consumer markets. So we had sales from those investments in 2014 for around $150 million and we are looking, as I said, in New York for around $250 million as we go ahead.","So we will continue to invest and our -- as we have talked about in the past, our new product Vitality Index is robust 32%, 33%, that's a good place for us to be and we are continuing to invest in.","Now that -- it's -- the investment going into it is important, but equally important for me is to see the outcome. And I'm pleased by that because as you see, we are running in the middle of a range of 4 to 6. Now, we are running around 5, in fact, this quarter on the high-end of that range so.","And that is clear evidence that new programs have been introduced as we go. And we had quite a number of new products introduced in 2014, have hit the market. So it was $10.4 billion of new products hitting the market from 3M 2014. So, I'm not -- we continue to invest, but they are not excluded from productivity improvements.","Deane Dray","That\u2019s great color. And then my second question, I want to go back to the hedging practices to Nick for a moment. And it was interesting to hear that your response has been to extend the duration of your hedges from 12 months to 24 months. And we are seeing companies in both new hedging practices. We saw GE doing that. Honeywell has done that .So you\u2019ve extended the duration. But I was curious why would you not increase the percent of your current hedges from 50%, or let's say, 75%? Did you look at that what the costs are there?","Nick Gangestad","Yeah. Dean thanks for asking and clarifying a question on that. One of the constraints or governs our ability to hedge is qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. And if we go over a 50% in most cases, we would then be subject to mark-to-market accounting and therefore defeat the purpose of what we're trying to do with our hedging processing. In fact, we\u2019d probably add more volatility if we did that.","So that's the upper limit constraint on what we can. And part of our approach, if I go back over a decade, is not to eliminate all the risks there. Our approach is to give the business some time to react and adjust to the changing business conditions and that's consistent with our 50% strategy.","Deane Dray","Great. Nick, that clarification was real helpful. We would rather not see you go through the currency mark-to-market gyrations. So we\u2019ll live with the 50% then. Thanks.","Nick Gangestad","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Tusa","Hey. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","What you guys seeing in Europe, specifically maybe in some of your Industrial verticals?","Inge Thulin","Well. First of all it\u2019s -- I would say, as you saw relative to the growth for the quarter for us in Europe, it was okay I would say. And I would say that specifically, we had a good growth in some of the businesses that specific around automotive and so forth, which is a big portion in Europe. We also saw very good growth in personal safety, which is very much related into the Industrial space.","So it\u2019s still a slow growth, generally speaking over there. But I think personally with the trend relative to the currency, that we would see more export coming out of Europe. And our position in Europe is very strong. I would say in all Industrial position and in Healthcare. We are weaker in the Consumer space in Europe based on historical position.","So, I think as export will increase as we go, I think that we\u2019ll have 3M as we go ahead. I think the other thing relative to Europe is to say that we have been on West Europe specifically now for many years. I think four years relative to the structure over there. So, I think one of the thing that -- sometime it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly the outcome of the growth.","But I think one thing that you need to do as an enterprise is to address your structure constantly. And as we have talked about earlier, we have addressed that big time in terms of going from a subsidiary structure to regional structure and taking all out, quite a bit of layers and management into organization, while we kept the front-end of the organization in terms of execution.","So let\u2019s say, I think we are in a good place in Europe, but it\u2019s not an easy environment as we all know. But there is no disadvantage for us by definition. And as I said, the portfolio for us is strong in Industrial, Healthcare and Safety and Graphics. Those businesses are the strongest for us, our Electronic and Energy and Consumer businesses as a smaller big mix in Europe. And I would say specifically Consumer, Electronics is very small in Europe. We are strong in energy. Consumer retail is by definition a small portion for us so, and I think in that segment also where you will see a lot of pressure maybe as we go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Thanks. Just one last question. I know this is a dumb question for you guys. But is there any quantification of what you guys sell in and around the oil and gas markets? Is there any quantification of whether it's 2% to 3%, or do you guys have visibility on what you may sell in and around those markets, whether it\u2019s adhesives or anything like that\u2019s going to those economies?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. Steve, yeah, we do look at this and approximately 3% of our revenue is into the oil and gas industry.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Great. Thank you. Very helpful.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Jermaine Brown of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jermaine Brown","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Jermaine.","Jermaine Brown","Most of my questions have already been answered already. So real quick. Over the course of the year, how do you expect the raw material tailwinds to flow through your income statement given the moving crude oil prices?","Nick Gangestad","Yeah. With the move, we expect it to be mostly balanced through the year. If there's going to be a slight bias, it\u2019s going to be slightly backend loaded but not markedly so.","Jermaine Brown","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call.

Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please turn to Slide 3 and I will hand it off to Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us again. We had opportunity to see many of you last month at our Investor Day, where we laid out 3M\u2019s new 5-year plan. We also updated you on the 3M playbook and how it is being executed across our enterprise to deliver efficient growth both today and into the future. In the first quarter, the 3M team continued to execute our playbook and delivered another strong operational performance. We increased margins more than a full percentage point and improved our cash flow generation by 20% year-over-year. At the same time, we continue to invest in the business, including opening a new world class laboratory in the United States while also returning cash to our shareholders.","Looking at the numbers, we posted first quarter earnings of $2.05 per share, which is an increase of 11% year-over-year. Please note that this includes a $0.10 earnings benefit related to a new accounting standard that 3M adopted in the first quarter and Nick will provide more details during his comments. Adjusting for this impact, we delivered Q1 earnings of $1.95 per share. Company-wide, organic growth was down slightly at minus 1%. Three of our business groups grew organically in the quarter led by healthcare at 6%, with strong organic growth across all its businesses.","Our Consumer business, which is the home to some of 3M\u2019s most iconic brands also delivered a good quarter of organic growth. I am very pleased that our two domestic-driven businesses, Health Care and Consumer, continue to do well and are off to a very good start in 2016. Safety and Graphics also posted solid organic growth with particular strengths in commercial solutions and personal safety. Organic growth in our industrial business was down low single-digits, which was similar to last quarter. And as expected, Electronics and Energy declined low double-digits. Electronics and Energy continued to be impacted by softness in the consumer electronics markets, which we expect to persist through the first half of the year.","Acquisitions net of divestitures added 2 percentage points to first quarter sales, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 3%. As a result, our company total sales, was $7.4 billion, down 2% year-on-year. Our ability to consistently deliver premium margins remains a hallmark of 3M and is an important element of our focus on driving efficient growth. In the first quarter, we posted margins of 24%, up more than a full percentage point versus last year. Without the impact from last year\u2019s fourth quarter restructuring, we have expanded margins year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters. Also in the quarter, we have returned nearly $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This includes an 8% increase in our first quarter dividend which marks 3M\u2019s 58th consecutive year of dividend increases. All-in-all, we had a good start to the year with results that were in line with our expectations.","Please turn to Slide 4. In addition to a strong financial performance in the quarter, we also made good progress on our three key levers starting with portfolio management. After strategic review of our Health Information Systems business, we decided that we could create the greatest value by retaining and further invest in that business. In fact, we plan to accelerate the investment across our entire global Health Care business, in research and development, health economics and commercialization capabilities to build strings on strings in both developed and developing markets. In February, we saw the Polyfoam business, which was a small non-core segment, within our industrial business group.","Earlier, I mentioned the ongoing softness in the electronics markets. As you know, over the last few years, we have consolidated a number of businesses within Electronics and Energy, which has made us more relevant to our customers, more agile and more efficient. Today, we are announcing further actions to build upon that work. This action will reduce 250 positions worldwide with the majority of reductions on the electronics side of the business and result in an estimated Q2 charge of $20 million. This will further position Electronics and Energy for long-term success. And going forward, this business will continue to stay close to customers, advance its technology capabilities and increase productivity. Investing in innovation is the second lever and in the first quarter, we invested nearly $0.5 billion in research and development.","Research and development supports organic growth and premium returns. And as you recall, we continued to step up investments in R&D from 5.5% of sales closer to 6%. In March, we also opened our new laboratory in the United States, which many of you had opportunity to see at our Investor Day. It will house 750 off-scientists who will leverage our 46 technology platforms to create unique cutting-edge solutions for our customers. Finally, in the first quarter, we continued to march forward with business transformation, which is our third lever. We had a successful ERP deployment in Germany and remain focused on executing the rollout plan across West Europe. Business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers, is important for our future especially as it relates to efficient growth. We expect these efforts to result in the $500 million to $700 million in annual operational savings by 2020 and another $0.5 billion in working capital improvement. Overall, as I look at the quarter, we continue to execute the 3M playbook and deliver the strong performance in terms of both financial results and building our enterprise for the future.","With that, I will turn the call over to Nick who will take you through the details. Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Thanks, Inge and good morning everyone. I will start on Slide 5 with a recap of our first quarter sales change. Organic local currency sales declined 0.8% in the first quarter, with volumes down 1.7%, partially offset by a 0.9% increase in selling prices. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 1.6 percentage points to sales. This impact includes the acquisitions of Capital Safety, Membrana and Ivera Medical, along with the divestitures of Library Systems, Polyfoam and the license plate converting business in France.","Finally, foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3%. In U.S. dollars, total sales declined 2.2% versus the first quarter of 2015. In the United States, organic growth was up 0.3% with strong performances in our domestic-oriented businesses, namely Health Care and Consumer. Industrial production in the U.S. declined 1.3% in Q1, which impacted the growth in parts of our Industrial business. Organic growth in Asia-Pacific was down 5.6%. Three of five business groups posted positive growth in the region again led by Health Care and Consumer. Soft end market demand and excess channel inventories in Consumer Electronics resulted in a double-digit organic growth decline in Electronics and Energy. Within Asia-Pacific, organic growth was down 4% in China\/Hong Kong and declined 8% in Japan. Excluding our Electronics business, Japan and China\/Hong Kong were both flat.","Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 1.7%, West Europe was up slightly, and the combination of Central\/East Europe and Middle East\/Africa was up high single-digits. Finally, organic growth in Latin America\/Canada increased 4.2%. Mexico again had a strong quarter, with 10% organic growth and Brazil also posted positive organic growth of 2%.","Please turn to Slide 6 for the first quarter P&L highlights. First quarter sales were $7.4 billion. Operating income increased more than 3% to $1.8 billion and earnings rose 10.8% to $2.05 per share. As Inge mentioned, we had another strong margin performance in the first quarter, up 130 basis points to 24.1%. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the first quarter margin improvement. The combination of lower raw materials and higher selling prices added 110 basis points to first quarter margins. We continue to benefit from both lower commodity prices and from our global sourcing team\u2019s ongoing efforts to reduce costs. Lower pension and OPEB expense increased margins by 100 basis points. Productivity gains related to last year\u2019s fourth quarter restructuring contributed 40 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins 10 basis points as we began to take actions on our manufacturing footprint and increased growth investments. Foreign currency net of hedge gains brought margins down another 10 basis points and first year acquisitions reduced margins by 20 basis points. The year-on-year decline in organic volume reduced margins by 30 basis points.","And finally, utilization and other was a net 50 basis point headwind to margins. This included the impact of lower asset utilization, particularly in our Electronics and Industrial businesses, which was partially offset by divestiture gains in the quarter. Also, we continue to increase investments across the business to drive growth and strengthen our competitiveness going forward. All-in, we have started the year on a positive note with respect to margins and continued to expect approximately 150 basis points of margin improvement for the full year, which reflects our focus on delivering efficient growth.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look of earnings per share. As stated earlier, earnings for the first quarter were $2.05 per share, an increase of 10.8%. Margin expansion net of organic sales declines contributed $0.04 to earnings in the quarter. First year acquisitions and divestitures added $0.07 to earnings per share. This result was driven by solid performances from Membrana, Capital Safety and Ivera along with divestiture gains in the quarter. Foreign currency impacts net of hedging reduced pretax earnings by $48 million or the equivalent of $0.05 a share. Higher balance sheet leverage led to an increase in net interest expense year-on-year, reducing per share earnings by $0.02. The first quarter tax rate was 26.8% versus 29.5% in the comparable quarter, which increased Q1 earnings by $0.07 per share. The lower Q1 tax rate includes the adoption of a new FASB accounting standard, which I will walk through in a moment. Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4% year-on-year, which added $0.09 to first quarter earnings per share.","Please turn to Slide 8. On March 30 of this year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards\u2019 update related to employee share based payments. This new standard changes the recording of additional tax savings or charges when employees realize benefits from stock based compensation. The additional tax impact is a result of the change in the value of stock based compensation, from the time it is granted to an employee to the time it is realized by the employee. Previously these additional tax impacts were recognized in the equity section on the balance sheet. Going forward, it will be recognized on the income statement. All U.S. public companies are required to adopt the new accounting standard no later than the 2017 fiscal year. We chose to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2016, which created a first quarter tax benefit of $0.10 per share, net of tax costs related to global cash optimization actions. For the full year, we expect no impact to our tax rate and earnings per share guidance as additional actions we chose to implement to further optimize our global cash position will increase our tax expense in the last three quarters of the year.","Let\u2019s now turn to our first quarter cash flow performance on Slide 9. Overall, we posted another solid cash flow performance in Q1. Free cash flow conversion was 74%, up 8 percentage points versus the same period last year. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, $180 million increase versus Q1 in 2015. The primary drivers of the increase were improved inventories and accounts receivable, along with lower cash taxes. Capital expenditures were $314 million as we continued to invest in the business to drive efficient growth. For the full year, we expect CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. The strength of our business model allows us to invest in growth and also return cash to shareholders. As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 8%, which increased our payout to $672 million in the quarter. In addition to dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through gross share repurchases.","Let\u2019s now review our first quarter performance on a business by business basis. Please go to Slide 10. Our Industrial business group posted quarterly sales of $2.6 billion. First quarter organic growth in our Industrial business was down 1.9%, with mid single-digit declines in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. As mentioned earlier, the U.S. Industrial production index was down 1.3% in the first quarter, which impacted parts of our Industrial business. Our advanced materials business declined low double-digits, impacted by ongoing weakness in the oil and gas end market. Conversely, our automotive OEM business grew high single-digits, continuing its strong track record of outpacing global car and light truck builds. We also posted positive organic growth in our automotive aftermarket business in the quarter. The acquisition of Membrana net of the Polyfoam divestiture, added 1.9% to Industrial sales growth. We are pleased with the smooth integration of Membrana into 3M and the business continues to exceed its financial performance objectives. Industrial increased its margins 150 basis points to 23.9%, posting operating income of $617 million.","Please turn to Slide 11. First quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were up 2.4% organically to $1.4 billion. Commercial solutions delivered solid organic growth with particular strength in Latin America and the U.S. Personal safety, one of our Heartland businesses also had a good quarter of organic growth led by EMEA and Asia Pacific. Our roofing granules business also posted strong growth in the quarter. Acquisitions net of divestitures added 4.5 percentage points to sales growth in the quarter. This result includes Capital Safety, along with the impact from the divestitures of library systems and the license plate converting business in France. Geographically, organic growth in Safety and Graphics was broad based, paced by a mid single-digit increase in Asia Pacific. Operating income for the business was $345 million and operating margins were a solid 24.5%.","Please turn to Slide 12. Our Health Care business delivered an outstanding quarter from top to bottom. The business generated sales of $1.4 billion and led our company\u2019s organic growth at 6.2%. Growth was broad based, with all businesses and geographic areas up mid single-digits or greater year-on-year. Health Information Systems and Food Safety both posted strong double-digit growth in the quarter and our medical consumables and oral care businesses each delivered solid mid single-digit growth in Q1. The Ivera Medical acquisition added 90 basis points to first quarter sales growth year-on-year. This business is performing very well and exceeding its financial performance objectives. Our Health Care business delivered 13% organic growth in developing markets in the quarter, with particular strength in China-Hong Kong, Mexico and Russia. Operating income was $455 million, up 12% versus last year\u2019s first quarter and margins were strong at 32.9%. As you can see from this quarter\u2019s results, our Health Care business continued its track record of strong performance. And as Inge mentioned we are increasing investments across the business to drive efficient growth into the future.","Next, let\u2019s cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13. First quarter sales in Electronics and Energy were $1.1 billion, down 11.7% organically and in line with what we communicated at our March Investor Day. On the electronics side of the business, organic sales were down 18%. The decline was due to a combination of factors including soft end market demand, elevated channel inventory and a challenging year-on-year comparison. Our team remains focused on increasing relevance with customers and driving spec-in wins to deliver organic growth as the industry improves. Our energy related businesses were down 1% organically, with growth in electrical markets being offset by declines in Telcom as well as Renewable Energy. As a reminder, in last year\u2019s Q4, we took portfolio actions within the Renewable Energy business. These actions negatively impacted Q1 organic growth, but have improved profitability in this business. Within Electrical Markets, our ACCR overhead conductor business posted strong double-digit growth. On a geographic basis, organic growth was down double-digits in Asia-Pacific, where our Electronics business is concentrated. First quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $208 million, with margins of 18.2%, down 330 basis points largely volume-related. Looking towards the full year, we now expect Electronics and Energy to decline organically in the low to mid single-digit range. As Inge mentioned, we are taking actions in the second quarter to further position the business for long-term success.","I will finish with our consumer business on Slide 14. Consumer had another solid quarter, with sales of $1 billion and organic growth increasing 2.8% year-on-year. Sales grew organically in three of our four businesses led by Home Improvement and Consumer Health Care. Across the bottom of this slide, you see just a few of the market leading brands that are powering our consumer portfolio. Within the Home Improvement business, our Command Damage Free mounting products posted strong double-digit growth as accelerated investments continue to payoff. ScotchBlue Painter\u2019s Tape and Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter. Our Consumer Health Care business posted solid first quarter organic growth as the growing trend of active lifestyles continue to drive strong demand for our ACE and FUTURO braces and support products. Geographically, organic growth was paced by Asia-Pacific, driven by double-digit growth in China\/Hong Kong, along with solid mid single-digit growth in the U.S. Operating income was $238 million, with operating margins of 22.7% both similar to last year\u2019s first quarter.","On Slide 15, we are reaffirming our 2016 planning estimates. We estimate earnings in the range of $8.10 to $8.45 per share, an increase of 7% to 11% year-over-year. Organic growth is expected to be up 1% to 3%, with acquisitions net of divestitures adding 1% of sales. We estimate that foreign currency translation will reduce sales by 1% to 3%. Finally, our tax rate is still expected to be 29.5% to 30.5%, with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%.","With that, I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Joe.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Maybe let\u2019s \u2013 maybe just starting off on Electronics since that seemed to be like the biggest, I guess, surprise in the quarter at least from our perspective. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations and the cadence for the remainder of the year just particularly in light of some of the commentary regarding slower smartphone shipments? So, that\u2019s kind of the near-term question. And the longer term question is maybe we can talk about this in the context of your portfolio, Inge, you have done a lot to restructure your portfolio since you took over. I am just curious like whether this is a business that you are going to continue to reevaluate as we move forward?","Inge Thulin","Well, good morning, Joe. Well, first of all, it was a little bit \u2013 the slowest business for us in the quarter, but not much of a surprise if you go back and think about our Investor Day when we talked about it in terms of what we expected for the first quarter. Now the electronic part was down 18%, which was I would say is all based on a weaker near-term demand in terms of consumer electronics. So, from that perspective not a surprise for us, but I think as we look out for the next quarter, we have to expect in the second quarter mid to high single growth down. And I think for the year, low to mid single. So, I think that\u2019s how you have to think about the business group. And I will say that in terms of the portfolio, this is a very, very good business for us, because we have all the components in order for us to be competitive in this marketplace and we have worked on that business in order to be more relevant now for 4 years. And as you can see, here in this quarter, we take some more actions in order to line up our business model versus what is required in that business. So, I will say, first of all, all businesses, portfolio management is an ongoing process. We look upon that the whole time. But the fundamentals for us to be in this business is very, very good and very, very strong is just that we have to adjust as we go and on the fly and I think that\u2019s what we are doing here again, right. But for me and for us, it\u2019s more a near-term weaker demand in consumer electronics as we speak.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, fair enough. And maybe my second question and turning it to the Health Care group where you saw accelerating organic growth, the margin is now approaching 33%. Maybe talk a little bit about the expectations for that business now. Have they been ratcheted up at all as we progress through the year and should we start thinking about this business as being a 32% to 33% type margin business moving forward?","Inge Thulin","Well, first of all, you are correct relative to the performance of Health Care over many, many years, right. This is a very good business for us and very solid fundamentals. And I think it\u2019s very much based on the value creation for both the providers and the patient in that market. We will \u2013 you saw this quarter again very solid organic local currency growth, margin expansion, and is broad-based. It\u2019s both in developed and developing markets and you have seen all businesses. And we will now continue to accelerate that investment as we move ahead. So, it\u2019s not only health information systems that we decided to keep in our portfolio investing is we will invest in all the businesses. And as I laid out, it is around research and development, it\u2019s about health economics, and it\u2019s about commercialization capabilities. Those three things in the combination is very, very powerful for us. And think about it as well in terms of developed versus developing. Our position is very strong in the developed world and we continue to take market share and we penetrate even deeper there. In developing, the field starts to open up for us, because key opinion leaders are recommending our protocols, including our products around the world. So, we have a very strong position there. And you can think about this in terms of our fastest growing business with the highest margin and we are pleased with the margins, but we are not \u2013 we will accelerate the investment there to get growth up even further.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, great. Thanks, Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Just a question firstly on Industrial and Safety and Graphics, if you have seen any change in demand trends as you went through the quarter in China and in developed markets?","Nick Gangestad","Julian, good morning. For both China and in U.S. and in Europe, as the quarter went on, we saw no discernible change in the trends. It was a pretty consistent performance throughout the quarter.","Julian Mitchell","Got it. Thank you very much.","Inge Thulin","Yes, the comment on China, we saw again both Consumer and Health Care with very solid growth in China in this quarter. So, that\u2019s again a good indication relative to what is happening in those markets as they are type of expanding their businesses specifically in China. They are not shifting, but they are expanding into more domestic driven businesses. And we saw terrific growth, both in consumer and Health Care in China.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then just my second moment beyond Electronics and Energy, if you are seeing any price pressure there or it\u2019s all just volume declines. And also you talked about some portfolio changes recently, should we expect therefore that the energy related business could grow this year, actually within that segment?","Nick Gangestad","Julian, first on the price front, we haven\u2019t seen any change in the trajectory on pricing. It\u2019s been pretty flat as it was last year and into this year. No real changes on the pricing, selling price environment that we are seeing on the electronics side. In regards to portfolio movement actions, as I said on the energy side, we took a portfolio action within our renewable energy business in the fourth quarter, which is having a negative impact on our first quarter organic growth. That negative impact will continue throughout all four quarters of 2016 and it\u2019s incorporated into our guidance for the total business and the company.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning all.","Inge Thulin","Thanks Steven.","Steven Winoker","Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the pricing raw material dynamic in terms of how that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s still huge even though it\u2019s diminishing, what are your expectations for that going forward and as part of that, how much of that pricing was currency related this quarter?","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Steve. For the first quarter the combination of price raw material, that benefited our margin by 110 basis points. The vast majority of that coming from lower raw material prices. And on the raw materials side, we are continuing to expect our tailwinds, driven by lower commodity prices and with a heavier weighting to the first half of the year than the second half. Regarding selling prices, we have traditionally been able to achieve about 30 basis points of underlying price growth when we strip out FX. We continue to see that as our capability and we project that we will be at that type of core price growth in our company for the year. If I look at the price growth that we had in the first quarter of 90 basis points, all of that came in our international operations and the majority of that 90 basis points was in response to our pricing actions in response to FX movements, the majority of that 90 basis points coming from FX reaction.","Steven Winoker","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of the M&A that you have done Capital Safety, etcetera, what was the organic growth of those businesses, what were they achieving from an organic basis?","Nick Gangestad","On an organic basis, well first of all, I will just level set the facts here that what they are adding to 3M\u2019s total growth, our total acquisitions before divestitures added 2.1% to 3M\u2019s growth and our divestitures reduced 3M\u2019s revenue by 50 basis points. So we had a net 160 basis points growth. Underlying that within our Capital Safety business organically, we continued to see strong revenue performance across the board for that business, with the exception of the oil and gas market that the Capital Safety market serves. In our Membrana business, that business continues to perform well. But from an organic basis, we typically start measuring the organic once we lapped ourselves 12 months after we acquired it, Steve.","Steven Winoker","No, I know. I am just looking for what the actual \u2013 what they are running at organically so that when they do lap 12 months, which should be in the third quarter, how much it\u2019s going to add, that\u2019s we are going to trying get to?","Nick Gangestad","Low single-digits would be our best estimate right now.","Steven Winoker","Okay, fantastic. And if I could just one last, you guys holding the 1% to 3%, what are you actually taking up since Electronics and Energy are down?","Inge Thulin","We are not changing our guidance at this point in time.","Steven Winoker","Right, so there must be some other business that\u2019s higher, I guess?","Inge Thulin","Yes, correct.","Nick Gangestad","Yes. Steve, we continue to see our other four businesses solidly in the range that we laid out in December and they will help propel our company to the guidance we put out of 1% to 3%.","Steven Winoker","Fantastic. Thank you.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning Scott.","Scott Davis","Can you give us a sense, I mean Inge you talked about China a little bit, but can you walk around the world and just talk about what\u2019s getting better or what\u2019s getting worse out there and geographically?","Inge Thulin","I don\u2019t think since we met at Investor Day that there being any big changes in the marketplaces. With maybe one slight exception which is Europe, Middle East, Africa. I think that\u2019s, honestly was a little bit of surprise that we saw slightly better growth there than we had expected. I think that\u2019s the change that from a material perspective, if you like, that have changed. That on the positive side, because I think we have to look for positive sides within Latin America, we had \u2013 we continue very good growth in Mexico, but we were positive in Brazil as well. So I think Brazil then by definition is one country. I think that\u2019s something that we could see changing. But more than that, I don\u2019t see any change. Central Europe, East Europe is doing well. West Europe was actually, as I have said a slight surprise. Nothing changed in Asia, nothing changed for us in the United States either. So I think it was very solid and no absolute downs in terms of, I think specifically that was negative that came after as I see it, there were some slight positives, if you like.","Scott Davis","Okay. I know this is hard to dial down to this kind of detail, but when you think about the 150 basis points full year guide on margins, how much of that are you guys thinking as price cost?","Nick Gangestad","Price for raw materials Scott, we for the year, we have been expecting that to be 50 basis points and we still see ourselves lining up closely with that.","Scott Davis","Okay. And just a quick one, is your price now fully caught up to currency dislocations in 3M?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. Going forward, where the dollar is right now, I think the majority of our price increases due to FX are behind us especially as the dollar stays where it is.","Scott Davis","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you, guys.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","John Inch","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Inge Thulin","Good morning John.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning John.","John Inch","Good morning guys. Hi Inge, your history of being able to raise pricing 30 basis points a year may not help you much if these raw costs, metals, gas, oil keep climbing the way they do, you put up very impressive margins, I am just \u2013 what\u2019s your play book for offsetting a potential margin squeeze if you could draw on history and your own thoughts towards being able to raise pricing more than you have in your history to offset some of these cost increases that seem to be about to hit us all?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. John, I will take that one. The 30 basis points is when we look over a long period of time of what our capability has been. And it\u2019s been fairly sustainable. In times of commodity price increases that tends to go up slightly, in times of commodity price declines that tends to go down. But it\u2019s fairly constant within 3M. To answer your question John, I would like to take you back to our Investor Day. As we look to the next few years of where we will be driving our efficient growth and potential for margin expansion, we are really driving many of our initiatives to be able to do that. Our initiatives around business transformation, one of our key levers, actions we are taking with our footprint to better optimize our efficiency and effectiveness of our manufacturing supply chain. That I see is the heart of what we will be doing in the coming years to continue our ability to grow efficiently and part of that involves margin expansion.","John Inch","Okay. So you basically, Nick, are saying that it\u2019s highly probable you are going to get behind on raw costs versus price increases, but there is just ample productivity within 3M and you are taking more restructuring obviously in E&E that you feel good about just being able to offset it. Is that kind of it?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, I am not \u2013 I think I am not ready to say and I don\u2019t think it would be accurate to say that we see ourselves flipping over to the negative on the price raws, but it has been a noticeable benefit to us for the last 2 plus years. We are not planning for it to be as positive for us as it has been and we are relying more on other productivity initiatives to fuel our efficiency and our growth.","John Inch","That\u2019s fair. I am just trying to get ahead of this. Second question is really on your own guidance had, if I am not mistaken, assume that the economy generally, loosely defined I guess the industrial economy was going to meaningfully pick up in the second half? Your industrial and E&E numbers are not \u2013 is showing that. Parker\u2019s numbers are actually, their orders are worse. There is a very mixed reporting season in terms of the economy cadence, right. China is good, but I am talking kind of North America and other points. Inge, are you still holding to the fact that you think numbers can get better in the second half? I realize you got a lot of margin embedded, so that\u2019s I am not so worried about your numbers. I just want your commentary around your thoughts for the U.S. industrial economy?","Inge Thulin","Yes, we do. I think that we look upon our total portfolio, right. As I said earlier, this change we see is the weaker near-term demand in consumer electronics and maybe that it will persist a little bit longer than we thought. So, if you take that as a given that is the change, I would say, but we see in Industrial that, that model is still working for us and we are sticking to the plan as we go for the year. And three of that are businesses will compensate for what I will say a delay of the growth rate coming in the second part for electronics part of our business. So, there is no change down. I don\u2019t see that change coming either to be honest. I have not seen that as of yet. I see there is a slight strength, actually, coming both for Safety and Graphics, Consumer and Health Care and Industrial stay very much as we laid out as we met the last time and then it looked like that there will be a little bit longer persistent in the consumer electronic part as we thought just 2 months ago also.","John Inch","That\u2019s right. So, in other words, Industrial are flat and other businesses are doing a little bit better. One last thing, Nick, this accounting change, you say you are basically going to offset it with I am assuming cash repatriation on which you pay taxes. How does that \u2013 does that like you give a sense of how that\u2019s going to breakout over the next three quarters? And if you don\u2019t do that, have you actually given yourselves somewhat favorably a $0.10 tailwind? Well, I guess it\u2019s the accounting change, but does this accounting change create a $0.10 tailwind heading into \u201817 because you may not repatriate for whatever next year, so that\u2019s just how the math works?","Nick Gangestad","John, a couple of points on that. As far as the actions we are taking to optimize our global cash position, I don\u2019t want you to think of it as a one-time event. This is a continuation of ongoing efforts we do in our company to efficiently and effectively manage our cash positions. And as you look at our balance sheet, our amount of our global cash has been declining. And we are always looking for how we can move cash to improve our efficiency and effectiveness as well as reduce the risk in holding that cash. It\u2019s been an ongoing effort. We are going to continue to do it. It did give us an opportunity to take some actions and repatriation, John, as part of that. In terms of setting up another $0.10 tailwind into 2017, I think that would be going too far. I think it continues to position us well for \u201817, but I wouldn\u2019t think of it all as a tailwind going into \u201817.","John Inch","But is the $0.10 equally spread I know for the next three quarters in your tax line, Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, John, it is. Over the next three quarters, we expect to average approximately a 31% tax rate. But as you know and as you look at our results, there is fluctuation. Some quarters will be higher and some lower, but over the next three quarters, averaging around 31%.","John Inch","Okay, got it. Thanks very much.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Andrew.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So, if you look at your breakdown of price you look at the U.S. pricing, you didn\u2019t get any price in the U.S. this quarter. You got 0.6 last quarter and really you have averaged that usual 30 to 50 basis points over the last year in the U.S. Are you seeing any more competition in the U.S.? Is there any more of an issue in any particular segment in the U.S.? Did something change that it might get tougher to get your usual 30 to 50 basis points in the U.S.?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Andy, I will take that one. We are not seeing a big change. There are certain parts of our business in the U.S. where we continue to face good competition and we react with price, but I would call those pockets, not widespread. Sometimes with pricing, in particular in the U.S., we saw actions to capture more market share and adjust pricing. And that\u2019s part of what\u2019s leading to that 0% that we posted in price in the U.S. for the first quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Nick, do you think you could still average that 30 to 50 as you go over the next year or?","Nick Gangestad","Of underlying price capability...","Andrew Kaplowitz","Yes, in the U.S.","Nick Gangestad","We still see that 30 basis points as a good reflection of our underlying capability there.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it. And Inge, if I could ask you again about Safety and Graphics, I mean, it picked up nicely in 1Q in terms of growth versus 4Q, but we know you had a very difficult comp in 4Q. So, did you actually see a pickup in personal safety or was it mostly just easier comps working their magic and how do we look at this business going forward?","Inge Thulin","Yes. No, we saw a pickup in personal safety. So, I think you have to look upon it in a couple of ways. First of all, if you think about your position in the market, when you add an acquisition like Capital Safety, you will strengthen your position big time in that whole personal safety space. So, I will say that in my view this is only the beginning of something big that will come for us, because our relevance in that whole personal safety segmentation has increased very, very much. And so I will say there is clear evidence for us that we moved our positions forward and that \u2013 so it\u2019s not based on easier comp only. That was an easier comp. But we can also see we start to take better positions both for respirators and now for protection.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Inge, maybe its better market share even than better market, is that fair?","Inge Thulin","Sorry.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Is it better market than improved market, is that fair?","Inge Thulin","Market share, yes, market share, but you have also to look upon it in terms of segmentation that you expand with Capital Safety and as you expand for 3M, expand with Capital Safety, some \u2013 of course, all of our other product portfolios is going with that. So, we are becoming much stronger in that position totally. That business there in Safety and Graphics that is doing very, very well for us is Commercial Solutions that again showed 4% organic local currency growth and have now for many, many quarters, really, really performed well for us.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","For Nick, it seemed that the dollar is now beginning to be less of a headwind for you guys. Would you consider changing or ramping back your hedging plans? If I recall you had moved from a 12-month to a 24-month hedging maybe that\u2019s not as required at this stage, have you given that some thought?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Dean, thanks for the question. The short answer is no, but a little longer answer is our hedging philosophy is meant to help us reduce some of our volatility and allow time for the businesses to adjust to a sustained change in currencies. It\u2019s not to eliminate all the risk. And our objective there, we use oftentimes natural hedges and when we can\u2019t do that then we use financial hedges to offset some of that risk. Our strategy of using hedging and we hedge approximately 50% of that exposure, most currencies out 1 year and then a few selected currencies out second year and third year. That philosophy isn\u2019t changing. We are going to continue to do that. And it really lines up with our philosophy of how we think about hedging over time to help take some of that risk and give our businesses time to react.","Deane Dray","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And Nick were there be divestiture gains in the quarter?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, there were. There we \u2013 we divested of our Polyfoam business during the first quarter and of the $0.07 related to M&A, approximately one half of that $0.07 was coming from gains on divestitures.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then for the charge expected in the second quarter, that\u2019s all headcount related, the payback on that, what\u2019s the expected payback on that charge?","Nick Gangestad","We expect that charge to pay for itself by the end of this year.","Deane Dray","And do you contemplate other actions in electronics over the near-term?","Inge Thulin","No, not at this point in time, Deane.","Deane Dray","Okay. Thank you.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Just a quick follow-up on the sort of $0.03 Nick from gains, where did that land, was that in the segment?","Nick Gangestad","Nigel, the Polyfoam business is in our Industrial business. And that resulted in about half, approximately approaching half of that $0.07 benefit that we saw for the total company. By the way, it was also part of the overall guidance when we guided for the year, that we expected $0.10 of benefits from M&A. The sale of our Polyfoam business was included in that estimate.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that\u2019s very clear. Thanks. And then it seems that showed us to pick on margins just given the overall strength in margins, but they were down 20 bps and you have given the tailwinds from pension and growth, it does look and I see there is higher upsides in there, but is there mix there, is there the pricing, can you maybe add a bit more color on Consumer margins this quarter?","Nick Gangestad","Nigel, the primary thing you are seeing there is that we continue to see good opportunities in our consumer business. And we are investing for continued growth. So it\u2019s some key investments that we are choosing to make now that we think will propel this into even stronger position in the future.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then I know in the business you are giving quarterly guidance, but your comments around 1Q back in January were very helpful and getting our models balanced, so I am just wondering if maybe you could add some color on 2Q, how you see organic sales developing into 2Q?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. For the second quarter, we do see organic growth being slightly better than what we saw in Q1 for the total company. And we are also continuing to estimate that the second half is going to be stronger than the first half. In particular, in Electronics and Energy, we are expecting that second quarter organic growth is going to be a decline in the mid to high single-digits. So it will go from approximately 12% decline in the first quarter to a mid to high single-digit decline in the second quarter. And then for the year we are expecting Electronics and Energy to be down low to mid single-digits.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Inge Thulin","Good morning Jeff.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. Just a couple of really quick ones, just on tax planning, Nick, obviously you have had an aspiration to drive your tax rate down, my sense is a lot of that\u2019s been the hubs and [indiscernible] and other thing. But is there anything on what the Treasury recently pronounced that kind of thwarts your ambitions to bring the tax rate down over the next couple of years?","Nick Gangestad","Jeff no, the recent actions being taken there do not thwart our efforts to bring us to a 27% tax rate by 2020. We are continuing to evaluate those proposals and the impact they could have on 3M, but we don\u2019t contemplate that they would have a material impact on us at this time.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then just a quick one on Health Care, was R&D actually up in the quarter, I ask that in that R&D was actually down overall for the company, so the comments about increased investment, is that more about ambition and outlook for the rest of the year or does R&D actually moving up in Health Care in the first quarter?","Inge Thulin","Well, first of all, when we say we will accelerate our investments in terms of both R&D, hence economics and commercialization. That is when we move forward. Our intent on the company level in order to accelerate investment in R&D is happening, right. The 5.5% we are close to 6% at this point in time. So we are moving forward. And we are moving forward in all groups we say. So the answer is yes and acceleration will happen in Health Care specifically.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Good morning guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Hey, Inge, Health Care and consumer, two businesses you have been trying to grow more in developing market from their historic position, you highlighted both the growth in developing market for both in this quarter, I am just wondering if you feel like you are reaching some kind of a tipping point there or maybe just a little bit of what you are seeing going on there?","Inge Thulin","Tipping point in terms of more growth coming?","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","In terms of more developing market traction for consumer and Healthcare?","Inge Thulin","Yes. I think both are strengthening their positions. And the way we should think about this is in terms of the acceleration of growth, by definition will go faster in Health Care than in consumer. And the reason for that is everything you have to do around brand equity in consumer take a little bit longer time. So when you compare the two of them, we will see a faster acceleration for Health Care versus consumer. But both of them are growing very, very well. And I would not say that in terms of outcome, yes, we see both of them coming stronger now than versus a year ago. But we have been on this for quite some time. And it\u2019s often realization of change of brand equity position for consumer. And then it\u2019s a question about money availability for Health Care. So our solutions are very advanced and is very much driven based on health economics. And as countries get bigger budget and can spend more into Health Care, they are shifting from less advanced solution to solutions like 3M can provide. So that\u2019s what we believe, that both Health Care and consumer has great future for us in that part of the world. And as you look upon our mix, those are also two of our businesses that mix in the portfolio, that we have less penetration and less sales in developing versus developed market for those two businesses. So the future look good, it\u2019s up to us now to execute and do that as fast as possible.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Okay, great. And just maybe some comments on what the M&A pipeline looks like until we lacked anything of size this year?","Inge Thulin","It looks good. All business groups have a good pipeline. We are constantly looking into that. I would say that when you think about what we have done the last year that you saw we did fewer, but more sizable versus the past and very strategically relative to our portfolio, that is what you should expect from 3M going forward.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Okay, thanks.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning Steve.","Steve Tusa","So thanks for the revenue color on the second quarter there. I guess the moving parts kind of sequentially with tax going up obviously and then you have the charge I guess which is going to flow through Electronics and Energy, so a normal seasonality would get you to something in kind of a 2.10 to 2.15 range, I would assume that these items bring you perhaps a little bit lower than that given what you pulled into the first quarter, is that kind of the right way to think about it. And then just the margin, year-over-year margin, I guess another way to ask the question would be what are the major differences in the year-over-year margin bridge given that the utilization and other should probably still be with you, you have the extra restructuring. Just maybe a little bit of color on the bottom line dynamics to help size us for the second quarter?","Nick Gangestad","Okay. So, for the second quarter, Steve, I have shared much about the second quarter already. I would say about what we are expecting for total growth in Electronics and Energy, you noted the charge we are taking in our Electronics and Energy business. I think the only other thing on the margin I will point out is corporate and unallocated, I have guided that we expect that to be between $150 million and $200 million for the year first quarter right in line with that. As we look at the seasonality, we expect a corporate and unallocated for the year. We think that will stay right in that range. I do see Q2 as the highest quarter for our expense we will be incurring in corporate and unallocated and then moderating going into Q3 and Q4. In regards to margin for Q2, as it look Q2 and for the total year, Steve, FX and raw materials are a couple of things that are a little better than how we started the year thinking. And though I see those partially offsetting what we are seeing from lower utilization of our electronics and industrial assets in the first half of the year.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So year-over-year, a little bit of a better lift on margins in the second quarter is what you are saying?","Nick Gangestad","As I look at our total guidance for the year, we expect margins up about 150 basis points. We were at $130 million in the first quarter. As I look across the whole year, fourth quarter is, Steve, where we expect the most margin expansion where we had the restructuring charge in fourth quarter of last year. The second and third quarter I would put below the mean for the year for margin expansion.","Steve Tusa","Below the mean for the year. Okay, got it. So, can you get this, I mean, I think I am kind of walking these moving parts down. I mean, it seems like there is something roughly around $2. Is that kind of the right area for you guys?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. Steve, we give guidance for the year, $8.10 to $8.45 is the right guidance for the year. I am not going to try to guide the EPS for the quarter.","Steve Tusa","Okay, I had to try. Thanks a lot.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. I guess two longer term questions on the Electronics and Energy segment. Are you happy with the prospects for accelerating growth through better R&D the same way as you expressed on Health Care? And then related to that as you look at the longer term strategic options for those businesses, are your options constrained by the degree to which our R&D backbone across the business is integrated, so that you don\u2019t want to source an IP to exit the company that might affect the other segments?","Inge Thulin","Well, let\u2019s start with the first question. In a way, they are maybe related, right. So, you are talking about research and development, investment into that business and so forth. The advantage in that business is if you think about the Electronics, very much of that is spec-ins right. So, we work direct with our customers in order to make sure we find solutions for them. That\u2019s actually a very powerful model if you think about it. So, we have two processes in the company, one called Idea 2 Innovation, i2i, which is more for consumables and then you have customer inspired innovation, which is a model where you work direct with one specific customer. So, if that is in aerospace, that is in automotive, if that\u2019s consumer electronics or wherever that it is right into one specific customer. The strengths of that model is that you know exactly the outcome of that model. You don\u2019t work on something that is broad-based from a market perspective that eventually will take place. You know it will take place in this customer inspired innovation. And if you don\u2019t come to a solution, you kill it very early. So, I am very confident in that model and that is why that is a very good business from 3M, because we can provide through our technology platforms multiple solutions that will generate better and more competitive products for our customers. So, the answer to that is very confident in the research and development into that model. And we can adjust of course based on what they are requiring. So, that\u2019s an important element on the Electronic side.","On the Energy side, it\u2019s a model that we are using in the normal industrial production or in consumer, etcetera, where you have a bigger market space that you need to serve and when you get the input from customer panels, etcetera. So, the business is always built on research and development and that is the heartbeat of 3M. That is also why we are able to generate very good returns to our investors, because we are not commoditized. We don\u2019t work with those customers in order to replace something that is already in their devices today. We try to move it to the next level together with them. That is the power of it.","Laurence Alexander","Okay, thank you.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Inge Thulin for some closing comments.","Inge Thulin","To wrap up, we had a strong start to the year highlighted by good earnings, margins and cash flow. Going forward, we will continue to execute the 3M playbook to drive efficient growth and create even greater value for customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us and we look forward to talking to you very soon. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, July 24, 2014.","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Matt Ginter","Thank you, good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2014 business review.","I've a few brief announcements before we begin today\u2019s business discussion. We will hold our next investor meeting on Tuesday, December 16 at the Grant Hyatt Hotel in New York City. Please hold 8 AM to noon on your calendars. Also make note of our upcoming earnings call dates scheduled for Thursday, October 23 of this year and Thursday, January 29 and Thursday, April 23 of 2015.","Note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations Web site at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two.","During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Now please turn to slide three, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Matt. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. 3M performed strong in the second quarter, once again posting organic growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. Our team delivered record sales and rising margins and did so while continuing to build for the future.","Let me take you through a few highlights for the quarter. Earnings were $1.91 per share, up 11.7% year-over-year. Sales rose to $8.1 billion, which marks the highest quarterly sales in 3M history. Organic local currency sales growth was 4.8%, lead by electronics and energy at 6%. Health care, industrial, and safety and graphics, each grew 5%, and consumer grew 4%. Geographic growth was paced by Asia-Pacific at 7%. Europe Middle East Africa and United States both grew 5% followed by Latin America Canada at 3%.","Premium margins remain a hallmark for 3M. In the second quarter margins rose to nearly 23%, up 80 basis points from last year. I am pleased that all five business groups delivered margins greater than 20% demonstrating the breadth of our strength. As you know, we are managing toward a better optimized capital structure. This will enable us to invest more in the business and return more cash to shareholders.","During the second quarter, we returned 2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And as you see on slide four, last week we announced our plan to acquire the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary at the price of $885 million. This business is a leader in many of our industrial divisions plus electronics and energy. In addition, we see significant opportunities in Japan\u2019s addressable markets for healthcare, safety and graphics and consumer businesses. Upon closing of the deal, 3M will have full control of one of our largest and more successful subsidiaries. We look forward to growing this business even further in the future.","Now please turn to slide five. Today, we\u2019re reaffirming our earnings and organic growth outlook for the full year. We continue to expect earnings per share of $7.30 to $7.55 and organic sales growth of plus 3 to plus 6%. Currency impact should reduce full year sales by approximately 1%, and we still estimate the tax rate of 28% to 29% with free cash flow conversion at 90% to 100%. ","I'd like to mention a few other notable things from the second quarter. In April, 3M earned United States Environment Protection Agency\u2019s Energy Star Award for the 10th consecutive year. No other industrial company has been so recognized by the EPA. Research and development is the heartbeat of our company. And in May, we were pleased to receive our 100,000 patent.","And last month, we appointed Nick Gangestad, as our Chief Financial Officer. I would like to take this opportunity to thank David Meline for his contribution over six years including three years as CFO which followed three years as Chief Accounting Officer. Nick now became CFO also after serving three years as Chief Accounting Officer. Previously, Nick held key leadership positions in multiple business groups around the world and he's well prepared for this his new role. He is a 27-year veteran of 3M and I've personally known and worked with Nick for the last 10 of those years. He has worked directly with me on executing our financial and operational strategies and I am happy to have him as our CFO. ","And by that, I\u2019ll give the call over to Nick. Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Thank you, Inge, and good morning everyone. Let me just say that I am excited to lead 3M\u2019s finance team and to help the 3M leadership team create even greater value going forward. And to those of you on the line that I have yet to meet, I certainly look forward to meeting you in the future. Now, please turn to Slide 6 and I\u2019ll take you through our income statement.","The Company operated well in the second quarter with sales exceeding $8 billion for the first time in our history, compared to last year sales were up 5%, operating income up 9%, and earnings per share up 12%. Productivity was particularly strong this quarter, which helped fueled more investment in SG&A and R&D as we continue building for the future. And at the same time, we expanded operating margins by nearly 1 point. I'll go into a little more detail on the margin change. Leverage on organic volume added 30 basis points to second quarter operating margins and the combination of lower raw material cost and higher selling prices contributed 1.2% each points year-on-year.","Selling prices continue to be supported by technology innovation, which is a key fundamental strength of the Company and helps drive unique customer solutions and an increasing flow of new products. We also began raising prices in mid-2013 to help offset currency weakness in select developing countries. This will result in our price performance moderating in the second half of the year beginning in Q3. ","And on the raw material front, we are benefiting from lower market prices and from our sourcing teams' efforts to reduce cost even further. Reduced pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to second quarter margins.","Strategic investments this quarter reduced margins year-on-year by 40 basis points. This included increases in new disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP cost, and restructuring. Foreign exchange impacts excluding the positive price recovery I just mentioned reduced margins by 60 basis points. All in all second quarter earnings increased 12% to a $1.91 per share. Foreign currency impacts reduced earnings by $0.04 per share and the higher tax rate reduced earnings by another $0.05 per share. Average diluted shares outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's second quarter, which added $0.09 to second quarter earnings per share. All things considered, this was a good quarter for the Company.","Slide 7 outlines the details of our second quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 4.8% with volumes up 3.5% and selling prices up 1.3%. Our businesses have done a good job of executing under growth plans. Acquisitions added 10 basis points to sales growth and foreign exchange had no impact on the second quarter worldwide sales. On a total U.S. dollar basis sales rose 4.9% versus the second quarter of 2013.","As was the case in the first quarter, Organic sales growth was positive across all major geographic areas. Asia-Pacific organic growth was 6.6%. Organic growth was again broad-based with all five business groups growing led by our electronics and energy and consumer businesses. Organic growth was 7% in Japan or 2% ex-electronics. China, Hong Kong, grew 6% organically in Q2 with or 10% excluding electronics, which was an improvement versus the first quarter\u2019s underlying growth rate.","Organic growth in EMEA was 4.8% in the second quarter. West Europe grew 3.5%, Central\/East Europe grew high single-digits and Middle East\/Africa grew at a double digit pace. EMEA\u2019s growth was strongest in safety and graphics, electronics and energy and industrial. Our teams in EMEA are executing well in 2014. ","In the United States second quarter organic local currency growth was 4.5%, up from Q1 and led by healthcare and safety and graphics. ","Finally, Latin America\/Canada grew 2.7% organically with electronics and energy and healthcare leading the way. Mexico generated double-digit organic growth and Brazil was down slightly.","Organic local currency growth was 7% across all developing markets and 4% in developed markets. ","Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow, turn to slide number 8. Looking at first half 2014 results, free cash flow was 2.1 billion or 143 million above 2013 levels. Operating cash flow was up 59 million and capital expenditures were 84 million lower versus the prior year. We expect the full year CapEx to be approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion in 2014, down slightly versus a previous expectation of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion. We are encouraged to see that our portfolio management efforts are providing greater clarity regarding business unit priorities and their related CapEx needs.","Improved plant productivity is also freeing up capacity as we continue to improve our plant efficiency and add lean capability over time. Through the first six months of 2014, we converted 85% of net income to free cash flow versus 84% in the first half of 2013. We continue to expect full year conversion to be in the range of 90% to 100%. At our 2013 December Investor Meeting, we articulated plans to manage toward a better optimized capital structure going forward and to allocate capital accordingly. The plan calls for additional balance sheet leverage which we'll use for two purposes.","First, to invest in order to expand and improve our businesses and second, to increase cash returns to shareholders. We are executing this plan in 2014, evidenced in-part by last week\u2019s announcement that we will acquire the remaining 25% non-controlling interest in Sumitomo 3M which Inge covered earlier. We will finance this deal with non-U.S. cash and we expect it to close in the third quarter. We also paid 1.1 billion in cash dividends in the first six months of 2014, up 246 million year-on-year. Gross share repurchases were 3.1 billion during that same period.","For full year 2014, we expect gross share repurchases will be in the range of 4.5 billion to 5 billion versus a previous expectation of 4 billion to 5 billion. Net debt at the end of June was 2.8 billion, up 1.5 billion versus year-end 2013. During the second quarter, 3M issued 625 million of five year debt at a cue point of (1 and 5\/8%) [ph] and 325 million of 30 year debt at a cue point of (3 and 7\/8%) [ph]. Next I will go through the results for each of our business groups, starting with industrial, please go to slide number 9.","Our industrial business continues to perform nicely with second quarter sales of 2.8 billion and 5% organic local currency growth. Our 3M purification business again grew at a double-digit pace in the second quarter and we also posted nice growth in automotive OEM, aerospace and commercial, transportation, abrasives systems, and industrial adhesives and tapes. On a geographic basis, industrials organic growth was 7% in Asia Pacific and 5% in both the U.S. and EMEA. Latin America\/Canada was down slightly in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was 670 million. Operating margins were 21.9%.","Recall that each our business groups is absorbing incremental investment in 2014 related to business transformation and ERP implementation. This had the effect of reducing Q2 margins for each of our five businesses by 30 basis points. ","Let\u2019s now look at Safety and Graphics, found on slide 10. You will see that Safety and Graphics sales were 1.5 billion in the quarter with organic growth of 5%. Personal safety is a heartland division in 3M and one of our largest in terms of sales. It was once again the fastest growing business within Safety and Graphics posting high single digit organic growth in Q2.","We also saw positive growth in Commercial Solutions and in Traffics, Safety and Security systems. Sales in our roofing granules business declined versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Safety and Graphics grew organically in all major geographic areas led by EMEA at 7% and U.S. at 5%. Operating income was 353 million in the second quarter and operating margins were a solid 23.6%.","Please go to Slide 11. Electronics and Energy also turned in a good second quarter performance. Sales were 1.4 billion, up 6% in organic local currency terms. Our electronics related businesses posted organic local currency growth of 11%. Growth was strong in both display materials and systems and in electronics materials and solutions. In our energy related businesses, sales increased 1% organically.","Second quarter organic local currency growth was 9% in Latin America, Canada; 8% in Asia-Pacific; and 6% in EMEA. The U.S. was flat year-on-year. Operating income rose 23% to 293 million and operating margins were 20.6%.","Next, I will take you through Healthcare found on Slide 12. Building on a strong first quarter performance, our healthcare business once again delivered strong growth and profitability. Second quarter sales were just over 1.4 billion. Organic local currency sales growth was 5% and margins were strong at 30.7%. All businesses contributed to healthcare\u2019s growth in the second quarter. Health information systems, critical and chronic care, and infection prevention led the way.","In April, we also further strengthened our health information systems business by acquiring Treo Solutions, a leader in using data analytics, to redesign payments structures and help transition healthcare providers to value based care models. Integration efforts are running ahead of expectations. Healthcare\u2019s organic sales grew in all geographic areas paced by Latin America, Canada, and Asia-Pacific at 7%, the U.S. at 6% and EMEA at 3%. Operating income was 434 million and again operating margins were 30.7% adjusting for Treo operating margins were 31.1%.","I\u2019ll wrap up with the consumer business group found on Slide number 13. Sales in the consumer business group were 1.1 billion with organic local currency growth of 4%. Our construction in home improvement business delivered strong double organic growth in the second quarter and we also posted positive growth in our consumer, healthcare and home care businesses. Stationary and office supply sales were basically flat year-on-year.","Second quarter organic growth across consumer was 4% in the U.S. which was up from Q1. Back to school activity began in late Q2 so we\u2019re off to a good start there. Elsewhere, consumers\u2019 organic growth was 8% in Asia-Pacific and 4% in EMEA. In Latin America\/Canada, sales were down slightly in organic local currency terms. Operating income was 241 million with operating margins of 21.1%.","That wraps up my review and I will turn it back to Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, Nick. As you can see, there is a lot to like this quarter across the entire company. In industrial for example automotive volumes grew four times the rate of global (automobiles) [ph]. And in 3M purification formally known as CUNO, organic growth was 13% and we see this business accelerating in many areas of the world. I am encouraged by the growth in consumer of the modest first quarter which includes a nice improvement in the United States. Our home improvement division together with consumer healthcare and homecare all showed good growth.","Our safety and graphic business performed well. Personal safety for example grew 9% globally including more than 25% in China. In healthcare, we continue to expand worldwide with 12% growth in developing markets this quarter. I am pleased that all healthcare businesses grew on a global basis.","Finally in electronics and energy, our portfolio management actions continue to payoff. Over the past couple of years, we have consolidated several divisions to better align with customers and improved our competitiveness. Those actions along with strong volumes drove margins higher in the second quarter. Through six months, margins were 19% and we expect the full year to trend towards 20%.","So overall I want to thank our entire 3M team for delivering another strong broad based performance. And going forward we will continue to gain even more value through our three strategic levels; portfolio management, investing in innovation and business transformation. Those levels are helping us deliver solid results today while also building a stronger foundation for long term success.","Thank you for your attention. And with that we now welcome your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis, Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis - Barclays Bank","Not much to pick on in the quarter it was solid overall. But one thing that wasn\u2019t clear in the slides at least on Slide 9 industrial was -- margins were down 60 bps -- 30 bps of it but I would have thought with organic growth of about 5% you would have some operating leverage on that. So maybe just some clarification on why those margins were down.","Inge Thulin","Hi Scott, this is Inge. When you think about our business group in industrial that\u2019s the biggest business group for us and also the business group that we are historically and still today entering first when we go into new markets based on the size and scale and so forth and that\u2019s the way we have talked about how we build out businesses from infrastructure, industrial, safety, consumer and healthcare, as the economies evolve. So if you think about that business on a global scale the way we operate it, that\u2019s like 32% of total company. When you go to developing economies, it\u2019s slightly more, it\u2019s 35%-36% and then you go to emerging market which is closer I would say to 45%. So when we looked upon it and yes as you said -- so why was this happening. The real reason there is actually they have a bigger slowdown in the emerging market in the developing world.","So I am not concerned at all about it, in fact when I looked upon industrial in terms of the growth which is the important element, we saw 5% growth in United States, we saw 5% in Europe Middle East Africa and we saw 11% in China. So when I looked upon it overall I am pleased with industrial but the reason is the 30 basis point as you call out and then as that portfolio in that type of emerging market as we all know at the moment there is some small turbulence I would say if you think about Central East Europe we have a little bit of the impact in Latin America, et cetera, that\u2019s the reason. But I am not concerned and I don\u2019t think you should be concerned either. We have a very good team there that are running those businesses very well. And so automotive very good, purification again a fantastic quarter, so all core businesses are doing well there.","Scott Davis - Barclays Bank","Okay, that helps a lot. And Inge just because you referenced macro, I mean, I think we\u2019ve had 15 companies report so far this quarter. And I can\u2019t tell whether the world to getting better or the world to getting worse. What is your view on global macro, maybe by region?","Inge Thulin","Yes, well, first of all, there is the macro picture and then how we expect to perform in that world, if you think. So, first of all, I will say, in West Europe, if you think about us, we guided a year from flat to 3% and we came out first quarter with three, actually this quarter more or less the same and we still think that that will be the range for us for the year. So, that\u2019s a little bit on the positive side for us in terms of our execution.","In Asia, we saw a slight improvement in China, or what I would call base business and for me, then base business, yes, so we talk the same languages if I take out electronics because that is moving around in Asia in between countries. Our base business in China consecutive went from 8% to 10%, and has a big improvement versus a year ago. And our Japanese business in fact in total grew 7%. And if you, again, look upon the base, that was 2%. So I will say Asia is going sideways slightly up; West Europe as we expected, United States, small strength; and we had a better second quarter than first. And as you recall I said at that time, I am not concerned about U.S., because I had a feeling it will come back in the second and that was correct. I think the place where we see a little bit of modest challenge is Latin America where we said before for the year 8 to 11 and we think now may be mid digit for the year. So, slightly down but it\u2019s offset for us by other regions of the world. So, I think that\u2019s what we are saying still 3 to 6, so I will say that I don\u2019t see much of a movement versus what we have talked about earlier. Latin America slightly slower, West Europe slightly better, U.S. slightly better and also big geographical areas, so that will compensate more what you can see as I will identify as a temporarily slowdown in Latin America.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning. Inge, very strong results in electronics and energy, can you give us a little more color on the margin expansion you've had in the first half and I guess a little bit more margin expansion in the back half to get to the [indiscernible] you are guiding to?","Inge Thulin ","Yes, first of all as you recall we looked upon our portfolio, it\u2019s almost two years ago now and we consolidated many businesses that was related to electronic and energy in the company that in some cases we had in different components of the company. So, we streamlined organization and consolidate in order for us to be faster to market and be able to respond to the customer need. So, we did that and we combined the division and the outcome of that is that we got a lower infrastructure to work with. We have got better utilization of assets and we are faster to respond to markets and we have moved, I will say from in some cases product sales to more system sales which is now paying off.","So, I think we had 11% growth in electronics and a lot of that is coming to the new approach with this display material system division that is now selling components into solution for the electronic market. ","So, I would say it\u2019s a combination of efficiency into organization, better utilization in manufacturing and then we had the volume upticks that came direct on based on the work we're doing with the customer. So, if you think about where we have taken that business for the last 18 months or so from 15 to 17 and actually this quarter we did over 20. But the plan is to go towards 20 and that\u2019s where we are for the year. I think the plan is 19 plus and I think that\u2019s where it will end up for the remainder of the year and certainly will be a good year for that group. And they have really responded well to our portfolio management initiatives.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Very good and impressive. And one more thing, Inge just in safety this double-digit growth you've seen in personal protection, how sustainable is that growth in the back half of the year?","Inge Thulin","Well, we have a very strong position in that business historically. It\u2019s a fantastic platform for us and is very global in scope and we are, I will say the leader in that whole space relative to respiratory protection. It\u2019s sustainable and I think the trends are positive for us and if you think about some parts of the world where it's very strong regulations like United States and West Europe and so forth and we're doing well there. And then you have I will say developing economies and I will put China into developing economies. So, if you think about China in terms of mega trends in China that\u2019s -- its air pollution, its water and its food safety.","When air pollution is playing very well to our very strong position in this business, so when you see 9% growth for quarter, 25 plus in China, this is sustainable as a business on a global space. And one of the reasoning, we have scale and we have a very professional team in place and it\u2019s a regulatory business, so it\u2019s good for us, generally speaking -- regulated business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Inge, just a quick question or Nick, on the Sumitomo impact, you said it\u2019s closing September 1st, you've got a 12 month, $0.08 impact, you are not changing guidance. So that first four months which I guess I would have assumed would be more cost and benefit, you're just making up for that elsewhere. How should be think about the dilutive or accretive impact before the end of this year?","Nick Gangestad ","Yes, Steve, this is Nick. You are correct, we said that\u2019s approximately an $0.08 benefit over the 12 months and we are expecting this to close on September 1. At this point, we felt it was premature to up our -- change our guidance at this point we\u2019re halfway through the year, everything's going right down the middle of what we\u2019re expecting. And just as this is a slight upside to our original expectation we have other things that are on a slight negative, for example, FX impact. We started the year thinking that would be flat to hurting us by $0.05 we\u2019re now in the $0.07-$0.08 range of impact. So, all in all, we think everything is staying very close to our original guidance.","Matt Ginter","Steve, maybe one, Steve, this is Matt maybe one follow up. The transaction should not have a lot of cost associated with it from an integration standpoint. But third quarter we expect really de minims impact on earnings and assuming we close on September 1st as expected we\u2019d expect some slight accretion and you could think about it on a straight line basis using that $0.08 as a guide.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Fantastic, that\u2019s very helpful. The other point is on CapEx, that roughly $200 million lower guide in last quarter and you called out some of the lean and other impacts that you\u2019re having. But this is a strike me as a really potentially massive shift in terms of what you\u2019re getting out of this. Can you maybe talk also, are there any things that you\u2019re deferring what you aren\u2019t doing even year-on-year it\u2019s lower now. And should we kind of rethink our business model on CapEx side for 3M going forward based on what you\u2019re getting as indicated here or am I making too big a deal out of it?","Nick Gangestad"," ","Steve I appreciate the question. Our business model, over a longer period of time as we invest between 4.5% and 5% of revenue in CapEx, and we started the year with an estimate on the high end of that range. As we\u2019ve gone through the year and we\u2019re seeing those benefits which I talked about earlier, we\u2019re seeing an opportunity that we don\u2019t need some of the capital that we started out the year anticipating we may need. There is really I would say Steve, to your question should we change the modeling going forward, no. We\u2019re basically in that 4.5% to 5% range and we expect to stay there. As temporary what we\u2019re seeing of the benefits this year and really reflects great results that the team is doing so far this year.","Inge Thulin","We don\u2019t hold back on any investment relative to our growth, so there we continue them as we have laid out. But again for me this is a positive sign relative to the operation here in terms of in some cases better utilization around the world. And if you think about our strategies, the fourth strategy that as we laid out where we talk about intensified capabilities to achieve regional sales sufficiency, I think we\u2019ve been able to start to move in that direction. But it\u2019s too early to change the model by definition but I think as this year, this is what it look for us and then we think is the right time now, we have to correct that for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just want to follow up on Steve\u2019s question, just thinking about energy and electronics, I know this was a big focus for the team in terms of improving efficiency of this business. You guys have eluded sourcing initiatives, you have eluded planned productivity initiatives. Do you care to quantify the impact of those and when, if not now, when do you think we will hear about sort of more discrete items there?","David Meline","Andrew, in terms of productivity, we have, in the past, we\u2019ve shared in our margin walk how we see productivity impacting, or positively or negatively, our results. If you think back to a year ago, we were showing with utilization a negative impact on our financial results. This quarter we\u2019re not showing that, year on year we\u2019re seeing a benefit by that lack of headwind. And in measuring productivity in our plants something that was slightly negative in 2013 has turned slightly positive for us in the first half of this year.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. But it just seems a sort of a broader initiative than just quarter over quarter change. But I guess we can take that offline. The other question though on the CapEx question, you did have CapEx yet you left your cash realization target intact. So, is there extra cash consumption on the working capital side or you're just being conservative right now?","Inge Thulin","I think we just would like to keep the flexibility as we go here. So the way I think about it and we think about, we\u2019re like six months into the year and we would like to keep the flexibility as we go. There is just two more quarters and we were able hopefully to talk more about it on the next quarter as we move ahead.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Nicky, you mentioned the (expectation) [ph] of pricing would start to [indiscernible], what about the other side of the equation, raw materials, it looks like raw materials are pretty flat year-over-year in 2Q, I am just wondering what you see in terms trends in some of your key raw materials?","Nick Gangestad","Nigel, on the raw material front, we\u2019ve been seeing our raw material prices in aggregate drop between 1.5% and 2%. We saw that in the first two quarters of the year. We expect that to continue and if you think back to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, we expect the raw materials to benefit us by $0.05 to $0.15 for the year. We still see ourselves in that range probably tracking closer to the high end in that range.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, so is the raw material still down year-over-year in the second of the half of the year?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay and then secondly on the ERP, just wondered if you could maybe just talk about where [indiscernible] plan on the rollout for this year. I know that the early phases resulted in lower corporate as you work in cost more to the segments. I know the corporate was a little bit lower year-over-year. I am wondering is the EPR continuing to have that impact particularly in corporate segments.","Inge Thulin"," ","Yes, we on plan relative to the rollout. We have talked about earlier. I have rolled out now in five countries around the world. We have in addition to that rolled out four distribution centers in West Europe or Central East Europe, so we have done one in UK, we have done one in France. We have done one in Poland. And yes, beginning of this month, we rollout the biggest one which is in (J\u00fcchen) [ph] in Germany, our biggest distribution center in West Europe. ","And I was in fact myself over there, yes, the week before and then follow-up slightly after that and walked the floors relative to make sure with the team that we were prepared for that to cutover and I am very pleased to say, it\u2019s going very well relative to that execution. ","So, I will say that even as you know when you make those moves right, you always learn a little bit on every place and we have and I will say, we, yes, take those learnings and we step up our mitigations and the team in place in order to be more effective as we implement as we go ahead. ","But in terms of the financials you see then in terms of cost, it\u2019s still accurate, there is no change to that and I will say that as we move ahead probably we will like to make sure we maybe can accelerate some of the implementation in places where we can get even better financial benefits. So maybe not changed a figure in terms of [indiscernible] but see if we can capture something earlier and get more focus around it. But so far so good, but again as you know there is always a little bit of a change management as you do those type of things right, but I think the important thing, the prime metric for us is customer satisfaction.","Nick Gangestad","And Nigel to add, this is Nick. I want to add one point on that. The 30 basis point increase in spending that we\u2019re seeing in our five businesses are from spending that we are now putting into the businesses to do this and this is not a shift between corporate miscellaneous and the businesses. If you\u2019re looking at the corporate miscellaneous piece, the year-on-year change there is really driven by a reduction in our pension expense largely as we had laid out at the beginning of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","I was hoping to get some more color regarding the growth investments. You said it was a 40 basis point hit that\u2019s broadly across 3M, but how does that impact the individual segments and what kind of return are you expecting on both the pure new products but as well as the restructurings?","Nick Gangestad"," ","Well, Deane, our strategic investments come in -- there is multiple categories there, one is our invest in innovation as you\u2019re alluding to, and that is still an investment mode where we\u2019re working to develop those new technologies for the future and we\u2019re not expecting an accretive benefit to growth from those investments in 2014 and little in 2015. ","For the rest of our strategic investment that we\u2019ve talked about, part of that is restructuring and part of that is our incremental investment in business transformation and ERP. Those are tracking approximately where we\u2019ve expected on the restructuring front where about halfway through the year and where we\u2019ve spent about half of what we expect to spend for the year on restructuring. Benefits in the last half of the year, we still see in low single-digit millions of dollars, we expect more benefit from that into the tens of millions of dollars in 2015.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","","And for Inge, what\u2019s interesting at the very end of your prepared remarks you cited some upside in the business, the Cuno filtration business. There was a big multiple paid in that business a while ago but it looks like it\u2019s beginning to deliver the way you all had envisioned it. So, what is that longer opportunity for Cuno in the portfolio, when you've hinted in the past you might be interested in doing some water investments and how do you see that opportunity?","Inge Thulin ","","Well, I think first of all that what we call now purification right is a business that during the last couple of years really improved for us, so let\u2019s put out a little bit of perspective, you talk about when we purchased that the multiple was high and so forth, right. I think initially when that was purchased, we didn\u2019t integrated fast enough into 3M, so if you think about what we are looking for as fundamental growth drivers for every business is around technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and brands. Those are the things that we need to capture when we purchase something.","I think in that case we hold and that\u2019s now many years ago but I think we hold it aside too long before we really start to drive the value that 3M will add in those four categories. The last three years that have now taken place and they have done a fantastic job in my mind relative to efficiency and operational excellence, consolidation of manufacturing start to lay in some of the technologies that can help them and then start to use the global capabilities in terms of our footprint. That\u2019s why you now see quarter-on-quarter sequential good growth, there were 13% this quarter was very similar first quarter of this year and in many market we see huge opportunities as we go ahead based on our current portfolio.","It\u2019s always difficult to give you a figure as you look upon it but again I go back and say that it\u2019s clear that clean water and clear air is a very important element in most parts of the world and specifically I will say in developing world. And that\u2019s also where we see a fantastic growth rate for this business, so this is a very good space for us and I am very pleased where we stand today with that business and we will continue to invest as we go ahead for more growth and also efficiency into organization.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies ","","Good morning. Two quick questions, your Greater China business, how fast is that growing now and in the comment about the energy related businesses growing only about 1% and telecom being the leading part of that, can you talk about how weak the rest of that business was and were there any other end markets that had decelerated in the quarter?","Inge Thulin","","Well let\u2019s start with what we call China, Hong Kong in terms of that operation. We had in this quarter we moved from Q1, 8% growth to 10% growth in the quarter for China and if you compare that on that base business that was only 1% Q2 last year. So, year-over-year good improvement and over last quarter also slight improvement, so that\u2019s moving forward positively and again you see in businesses there that you take industrial was 13% growth in the quarter, healthcare was 17%, consumer and office 20% and you have safety and graphics just over 10%. So, it\u2019s moving ahead very well and I think we are past the time where China was a 25% growth for the quarter but we are running that now at 10% with slight uptick, so that\u2019s good and we feel good about where we stand today in China.","Relative to the energy piece, there is some tender business going on in that business and that can hit us a little bit short, you saw telecom had 4% growth and then some of the other businesses was down but it was not much big figures on the downside. And there is some, I will say tenders that is going because some it is government related and utility related, so it can move a little bit in between quarters but nothing to be really concerned about. And we have one of our Heartland divisions is part of that, so it was not much down, just a little bit. We're very pleased that telecom grew 4% that was a good figure for us.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research ","I was wondering if we could just go back to the cash flow discussion a little bit, a good discussion so far, just wanted to kind of talk about working capital a little bit. Nick or Inge as I think about kind of the ERP and the distribution centers and the like, is there a release of working capital that we should be expecting if it's not this year into next year? So you\u2019ve got really kind of very little operating cash flow growth year-to-date. So I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s tied to these distribution centers or if you could just kind of comment on how that plays out going forward?","Nick Gangestad"," ","Yes Jeff, on the cash flow and the working capital managing our inventory continues to be one of our important priorities and improving our inventory churns making some progress there we expect more progress on that in the coming quarters. Specifically to your question about business transformation ERP and the impact that could be having over the long term we are convinced that where we\u2019re going with business transformation and ERP that we have significant opportunities to improve our working capital and in particular inventory management and generate benefits there. In the short term in particular in the second quarter with some of our go live activity we had there was minimal I\u2019ll call it in the $10 million to $30 million increased inventory in some of the channel in anticipations of go live activity.","Inge Thulin"," ","But if Jeff your question was the longer term, it was a little hard to tell on our end. We have talked about a longer term opportunity in working capital but it\u2019s that bigger win is not something we\u2019d expect in the next year or two necessarily. We\u2019ve sized that above 500 million.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research ","Okay, thank you for the clarification there. And I am just wondering on share repurchase, kind of is there -- we obviously can do the math on the share price and figure out what a dollar buys these days, but is there any additional pressure on just kind of other dilutive effects, options exercises or anything else that kind of heats against that gross number?","Nick Gangestad"," ","No, there is nothing out of the ordinary there, Jeff, that\u2019s happening on a dilution basis. We did pick up our activity some in the first half of the year, we saw it as good opportunity and on the dilution front very-very similar to trends to what we\u2019ve seen in the last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning. Just maybe on energy, so the work you\u2019re doing on consolidating the divisions I guess showing in the margins here. So the question is, is this improvement, is this a couple of quarter phenomena or do you think this could be -- there could be runway for couple of years here and the business has been below company margins. So do you think there is opportunity to take margins up to more near the company average levels?","Inge Thulin","Well think about it in this way, we are running around 22% to 23% margin as an enterprise. We have some businesses that is running in the middle of that and you have two that is type of one is higher which is healthcare and then you have electronic and energy that is lower. And as you recall when we started the journey this was around 15 plus, that industry by definition that\u2019s a good margin in that industry by definition and that will always be a differentiation. So I will say that this move from 15% closer to 20% over this period of time was our expectation.","If it will go more up in the area of 25% to 30% I don\u2019t think that\u2019s realistic for that market in order for us to do that. But I think any business in 3M our expectation is that you should be close to the average out the company. And our organization there today is more streamlined and I think we are better prepared also to deal with some eventual volatility in that market on the electronic side that we know will come from time to time, that\u2019s part of that business and we train that business so that\u2019s okay.","Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Good, that\u2019s helpful. And then Treo, could you maybe provide some color on the margin profile there? And then how should we think about the trajectory and the impact on segment margins, as it kind of integrate that business?","Inge Thulin","Well, first of all, that\u2019s an integration into our healthcare -- health information system, so that business have been growing, the health information system have been growing very well for us the last five to 10 years. And you should think about it in terms of that this acquisition is actually an addition in order for us to get more relevance into different parts of the segment. ","So health information system today is a growing business and we are doing that for providers in coding, grouping and analytics. And that\u2019s to the hospital providers. Now we will get access to vast set of payers that then they can help to connect the two of them. So as the model is moving from volume base to quality outcome this is what will help, so I will look upon it as an integrated part of the current business we have and it\u2019s a relatively small business as you know. So, it\u2019s more for us to be able to get access and connect the two entities together.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning everyone. So, my first question is just on price cost, clearly another good quarter above 100 basis points but looks like last time FX was a benefit. Can you just quantify the tailwind that you got in the quarter from FX on the price cost basis?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Joe thanks for that question, for the quarter on the top-line we really saw no impact from FX, everything netted out to nothing. What we're seeing is a negative impact on our margin this year, year-on-year is a fact that we had significant hedging gains a year ago as part of our strategy and the lack of those gains is causing that margin year-on-year erosion, margin erosion, really has nothing to do with 2014. It has to do with the gain we took last year on our hedging.","Matt Ginter","Joe, as part of your question, how much price we have gotten due to currency?","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Yes, that\u2019s right, Matt. ","Nick Gangestad","As we've said last quarter about half of our price we really see as currency related and we think that will be running its course soon. We instituted a lot of price increases related to currency in the middle of last year and so that\u2019s the primary driver why we're saying we expect that price growth to moderate in the last half of 2014.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Nick and one follow-up may be for Inge. Inge you mentioned that you brought down your growth expectations for LatAm. It looks like you had negative volume growth in the quarter and so may be if you could just provide some positives and may be areas of weaknesses that you are seeing in a region today?","Inge Thulin","Yes, Latin America, first of all we have probably the best portfolio mix in that part of the world, and so we feel very good relative to our overall platform as we move ahead and as you know we have been doing business in Latin America since I think 1946 was when we started in Brazil. When you look upon it now, there was a little bit of temper specifically in Brazil I will say, Brazil was flat to down, Mexico was up 12%. So, I would say Brazil had an impact for different reasons and then for us at least what we are selling personal safety into the mining was also on the lower end. So, I think that Brazil was for us the downturn this quarter specifically and then Canada was flat. You have Latin America\/Canada together, Canada flat, Brazil down, most other up and Mexico up 12%.","But as I said this is a part of the world that is the most developed of our developing regions and we know how to do business there. So, step up for me always when I look upon Latin America over the years and I follow that as I led international for eight years before I came into this job. We have a constant growth over time in Latin America but that could be a little bit of dip in a quarter but that\u2019s not the overall concern for us. We are just short term stay the course and capitalize on the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan ","Good morning. Just on the price cost thing on the deflation I guess on your raw materials. How much of that, I guess you said to 100 to 150 basis points for the first half, how much was it precisely in the second quarter and then how much of that do you think is blocking and tackling and kind of structural like every year you can kind of bang out certain amount of that, it just seem to be kind of a nice tailwind for a while now?","Nick Gangestad","I appreciate that question because it gives me a chance to make it clear here that the benefits we see on raw materials are not just a passive benefit that 3M gets by being in the market. There are some benefits we get thanks to the market but a lot of this, Steve, is driven by what our sourcing team is doing in 3M to bring about those benefits. So, of that total 1.2%, 1.3% benefit that we're seeing in the second quarter, there is a portion of that that\u2019s raw materials probably a little less than half of that that\u2019s raw material driven. And that raw material portion is made up of several components. One is just outright market conditions where we're enjoying that benefit. Second is what we're doing from a 3M perspective to drive those benefits and use our power in the market to benefit there and then the third is, there is a portion of that that involves us substituting one raw material for another to 3M's advantage. So it\u2019s a broad perspective of what\u2019s driving that number, Steve.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","So I guess out of the 1.2 to 1.3 how much is just maybe to narrow it down, how much is it market exposure related half like 25% of that or?","Nick Gangestad"," ","I think it\u2019s around half, Steve, as we looked at the raw material deflation this quarter. Yes, you could think of it and it varies a little bit from period to period, but it\u2019s about half market and half due to the additional value we can add.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","That\u2019s very helpful and then one just quick follow-up on electronics. The cycles have been kind of notoriously tough to predict in, I am not sure if there is a good way to forecast this, but how do you feel about the growth there in the second half, I mean sequentially it was definitely stronger than we were expecting it up high single digits, should we think about normal seasonality in the back half of the year and what's your sense of kind of inventory the customer decision again?","Nick Gangestad"," ","You start on the inventory side. We don\u2019t see any build up in the channel so I think that it\u2019s at a normal level as in the past. So if we start there based on your last point of your question, otherwise I will say look it like you can think about it in normal way all the season, but also for us we work with all suppliers in that industry. And it will all be dependent on the end market demand in the end, so for us definitely will be the growth driver or less growth driver as we move head. But I don\u2019t think there is any change for us at this point in time relative to the outlook for the growth of electronics and energy in that business.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Hey, guys, one last quick one just on the -- you have an easier comp in the third quarter, tougher comp in the fourth quarter on growth or I think maybe other way around, but anything than the comps that moves around as far as stability of growth rates in the second half?","Nick Gangestad"," ","Are you talking electronics or total companies?","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","No, just total 3M organic, looks like the midpoint averages around 4% growth that maybe conservative or not, but should one quarter be better than the other because of the comparisons?","Nick Gangestad"," ","No, I think -- you can think about it in the following way. If you go back to 2013, first half we had 2% organic local currency growth. Second part, we had 4%. First part of this year, we are close to 5. And I think you should think about this we move ahead for the year that based on the range we\u2019re giving is 3 to 6, so I think it would be very much in that range for the last quarter.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to 3M for some closing comments.","Matt Ginter"," ","I would like to thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your engagement and interest in 3M.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 23, 2018.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentations accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our upcoming investor events found on Slide 2. First, we will be hosting our Investor Day at your headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota in a few weeks with a welcome reception in the evening of Wednesday, November 14th where we will be highlighting how 3M Science is advancing our priority markets for growth.

Mike?","Mike Roman","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you, for joining us. In the third quarter 3M delivered a double-digit increase and cash flow and earnings per share along with strong margins despite slower growth. We also continue to execute on business transformation or deploying capital to invest in our future and return cash to our shareholders. Looking at the numbers, our team posted total sales of $8.2 billion in the quarter.","We delivered organic growth of 1% which is on top of 7% growth in last year's third quarter. As you recall from the discussion on our July earnings call, our ERP rollout in the US resulted in revenue shifting between Q2 and the second half of the year. Today, we estimate a pull forward into Q2 was approximately 100 basis points with the vast majority coming out of Q3.","Moving on to earnings per share, we posted EPS of $2.58, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Our company continues to deliver strong return on invested capital along with premium margins.","Companywide we generated margins of 25% with all business groups above 22%. Our team also increased free cash flow by 24% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 114%. This is a testament to the strength of portfolio and business model, and our focus on driving productivity every day. We also continue to invest in R&D and capital to support organic growth while returning cash to our shareholders. And in the quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to 3M shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","Please turn to Slide 5 for look at the performance of our business groups for both the third quarter and year-to-date. In the third quarter, three of our five business groups, Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Safety and Graphics posted organic growth of 2%. Healthcare and Consumer each had areas of strength, but also areas that were softer than expected. Healthcare's growth declined by 1% primarily due to continued weakness in our drug delivery business. Organic growth in Consumer was down 2%. This business group was impacted by channel adjustments between quarters with our major retail customers, though the sellout of our products remains strong. In his comments, Nick will provide more detail on third quarter performance of each business group.","Given the shift of sales between quarters due to business transformation, it is also helpful to look at our performance through nine months. Safety and Graphics posted 6% growth followed by 3% growth from both Industrial and Electronics and Energy. Healthcare posted 2% growth with Consumer at 1%. Companywide, we have delivered organic growth of more than 3% year-to-date. I will come back to share our updated guidance after Nick takes us through the details of the quarter. Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Sales grew 1.3% organically in the third quarter and are up 3.3% year-to-date. Increases in selling prices contributed 120 basis points to sales growth in the quarter, with positive price growth across all geographic areas. The net impact of acquisition and divestures contributed 20 basis points to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by 1.7 percentage points, all in third quarter sales in US dollars were down 20 basis points versus last year.","In the US, organic growth was 0.5% with positive growth in Electronics and Energy, Industrial and Safety and Graphics. Q3 organic growth was impacted by the deployment of our new ERP system in the US during the quarter. Year-to-date organic growth in the US is up 3%. Asia-Pacific delivered 3.2% organic growth led by Healthcare and Safety and Graphics. Organic growth was 10% in China, Hong Kong, while Japan was down 7% or up 1% excluding our electronic related businesses. Year-to-date Asia Pacific is up 4.5% organically. EMEA declined 90 basis points in Q3 with West Europe down 25. From a year-to-date standpoint EMEA is up 2%.","Finally, Q3 organic growth in Latin America, Canada was 2.1% led by Healthcare and Consumer. At a country level, organic growth in Brazil was 5%; Mexico was up 3% while Canada was flat. On a year-to-date basis, Latin America, Canada is up 4% organically.","Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Companywide third quarter sales were $8.2 billion with operating income of $2 billion. Third quarter operating income margins were 24.7%, up slightly versus last year. Let's take a closer look at the components of our margin performance in the third quarter.","Organic volume, productivity and lower year-over-year portfolio and footprint actions added 70 basis points to margins. Selling price benefit more than offset raw material inflation which added a net 30 basis points to the third quarter margin. For 2018, we now expect full year raw material headwinds inclusive of tariff impacts of minus $0.15 per share versus a prior range of negative $0.05-$0.10 per share. We continue to expect benefits from selling price to more than offset raw material headwinds. Nearly offsetting these margin benefits during the quarter was a 50 basis point headwind from foreign currency. A 30 basis point impact from acquisitions and 10 basis point headwind from the Q2 divestiture of the communications markets business.","Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter GAAP earnings were $2.58 per share, up 11% versus last year. The benefits of organic growth, productivity and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added a combined $0.12 to per share earnings in the quarter. Acquisitions added a $0.01 with a divested incoming and transition cost from the communications markets divestiture wherein earnings headwind of $0.03 per share.","Foreign-currency net of hedging reduced per share earnings by $0.08 as the US dollar strengthened against many currencies throughout the quarter. For the full year, we now expect an earnings headwind from foreign-currency of minus $0.05 per share versus a prior estimated benefit of $0.10 or a reduction of $0.15 per share versus previous expectations. Higher year-on-year net interest expense and retirement benefit expense decreased earnings by $0.05 per share.","Our Q3 tax rate was 21.3% which increased earnings by $0.22 per share. This earnings benefit was primarily driven by the US Tax Reform. Lastly, a reduction in shares outstanding added $0.06 to per share earnings. Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. As Mike noted, we continue to generate strong operating cash flow allowing us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. Third quarter free cash flow was $1.8 billion, up 24% year-on-year with a conversion rate of 114%. Third quarter capital expenditures were $377 million, up $52 million year-on-year, and we expect these investments to be approximately $1.6 billion for the year.","In addition to investing in our businesses, we return significant cash to shareholders in Q3 including $794 million in dividends. We also returned $1.1 billion to shareholders to gross share repurchases. We continue to expect full year gross share repurchases to be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion.","Let's now review our business group performance starting with Industrial on Slide 10. The Industrial business group delivered third quarter sales of $3 billion, up 2.2% organically with growth across all geographic areas. Our automotive OEM business continues to drive increased penetration across applications such as structural tapes, adhesives, and acoustics light weighting and electronics solutions. Overall, our business was up 5% in the quarter compared to global car and light truck builds which were down nearly 2%. The automotive aftermarket business declined low single-digit organically due to softness in the collision repair market.","Our Industrial adhesives and tapes business and filtration were both up low single digits in the quarter. Finally, the Advanced Materials business led the way with double organic growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, industrials organic growth was led by a 3% increase in Asia Pacific followed by the US, up 2%. Industrial delivered third quarter operating income of $667 million with operating margin of 22.1%.","Please turn to Slide 11. Safety and Graphic sales were $1.7 billion, up 2.2% organically in Q3. Growth was led by our personal safety business up 5% organically on top of a 14% increase last year. The integration of Scott Safety is on track and the business continues to exceed our expectations.","Transportation safety grew mid-single digits while Commercial Solutions was up low-single digits. Finally, our roofing granules business declined mid teens as shingle manufacturers slowed production in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth was led by 5% growth in Asia-Pacific. Operating income in the third quarter was $412 million while operating margins were 24.8%, which includes a 150 basis point headwind from the Scott Safety acquisition.","Please turn to Slide 12. Our Healthcare business generated third quarter sales of $1.4 billion down 1.1% organically versus a 7% comp last year. Holding back both third quarter and full year organic growth in healthcare has been the continued softness in our drug delivery business, which is depended on pharmaceutical regulatory timelines and customer R&D budgets. This business saw a 25% year-over-year decline in Q3 organic growth, which negatively impacted overall healthcare organic growth by 250 basis points.","While our drug delivery business is experiencing near-term challenges, the pipeline continuously to strengthen and we expect the business to stabilize in 2019. Oral care grew 2% organically with improved growth in the US and continued strength in developing markets. Our 3M Clarity Clear Tray Aligners launch is off to a good start as the number of new cases ramps quickly and we expect continued momentum going forward. Our Medical Solutions business declined slightly against a strong comp of 7% from a year ago. Through nine months this business was up 3% with particular strengths in vascular access and advanced wound care solutions.","Food safety continues to deliver strong organic growth in the quarter, up high-single digits while Health Information Systems grew mid-single digits. On a geographic basis Asia-Pacific led the way up 10% with Latin America, Canada up 4%. EMEA was down slightly while the US declined mid-single digits primarily due to last year's strong comp.","Healthcare's third quarter operating income was $446 million and operating margins were nearly 31%. Next, let's cover Electronics and Energy on Slide 13.","Electronics and Energy organic sales growth was 2.3% in the third quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion. The electronic side of the business grew 1% led by a mid single digit increase in electronics materials solutions. This business continues to experience strong demand particularly in the semiconductor and datacenter market. In addition, we continue to see our content per mobile device grow globally as we apply 3M science to the advancement of this market. Our energy related businesses were up over 6% organically with strong growth in renewable energy and pipe coating solutions.","On a geographic basis, the US was up 5% while both Asia Pacific and Latin America, Canada were up low single digits. Third quarter operating income for Electronics and Energy was $457 million with operating margins of 31.7%. Please turn to Slide 14.","Third quarter sales in Consumer were $1.2 billion and organic growth declined 2% year-on-year. Our Home Improvement business grew low single digits organically, while the other three businesses each declined in the quarter. Looking at consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 5% increase in Latin America, Canada. The US was down slightly impacted by our Q3 ERP rollout. We continue to see strong consumer demand for our products with mid single digit point to sale growth. EMEA declined mid single digit as we've been actively managing our product portfolio. Lastly, Asia Pacific declined 7% as we've seen lower channel demand for our consumer respiratory solutions.","Third quarter operating income was $291 million with operating margin of 23.5 %. That wraps up our review of third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 15 and I'll hand it back over to Mike to review our updated 2018 guidance. Mike?","Mike Roman","Thank you, Nick. With three quarters behind us, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We now anticipate organic growth of approximately 3% versus a prior range of 3% to 4%. With respect to earnings, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $9.90 to $10 against the previous range of $10.20 to $10.45. Our change in EPS guidance is largely due to three factors; our updated growth expectations along with our updated guidance for currency and raw materials that Nick mentioned earlier.","Looking at the remainder of 2018 and beyond, we know there's a lot more we can and will do to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Going forward, we are focused on driving growth being relentless and putting our customers first and continuing to transform 3M to deliver greater productivity. This means we will continue to work to optimize our portfolio prioritizing resources to our most attractive opportunities. We will strengthen our innovation model and continue to invest in research and development, which enables us to create unique solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers.","In addition, we will continue to invest in high-growth, high-value product platforms such as automotive electrification, advanced wound care and data centers. We will also step up our efforts to fully leverage the progress we've made on business transformation. With our most recent deployment in the United States we have now successfully deployed 70% of our global revenue on the new ERP system. I am pleased with the success of our rollouts in Europe and the US. This was a significant undertaking and I thank our team for their tireless efforts.","Moving ahead, we'll be able to focus even more on leveraging the power of business transformation to improve service levels to our customers, improve productivity and accelerate value realization, and at our Investor Day next month, we look forward to sharing more details about our plans. With that, we thank you for your attention and will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research; please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I don't recall covered your stock a long time-- I just don't recall the type of volatility you had in the Healthcare business, the drug delivery you mentioned was down 25% is this - can you give us a little bit granularity behind what causes or is causing that kind of volatility right now?","Mike Roman","Yes. Scott as we talked about on the opening here, the organic growth was impacted by drug delivery down double digits. And also we did have a strong year-over-year comp as we came through Q3 of 2017. Broader we see solid growth in oral care, our food safety business continue to strong growth, health information systems, strong pipeline right where we expected. So must of the rest of portfolio is in line with expectations. I would say that the drug delivery business continues to be the challenge against what we saw for the growth for the total year.","Scott Davis","So, yes, I am not sure that answers my question. Is there an inventory de-stock at the customer level? I'm trying to just think about that, I'm assuming the customer, the end consumer still consuming these drugs-- so what's going on at the part of the pharmaceutical companies at least that's what I am asking?","Mike Roman","Yes, so our drug delivery business it's-- it's - we've talked about it as a project based business in the past. It really is-- we work in partnership with pharmaceutical companies really dependent on their regulatory cycle also we have significant R&D partnership as well and those are project based businesses as well. So we see strong pipeline ahead. We are working through a challenging performance in 2018. We see stabilization as we get into 2019 and strong growth. So we have good view of our pipeline but not impacting positively as we go through the second half of this year.","Scott Davis","Okay. That's a good answer. And then Consumer, you talked about the inventory channel de-stock, is this --is this kind of a new normal where it seems like the retailers are just holding less inventory, do you view it as a new normal adjustment kind of one time or is this something where you anticipate some additional de-stock here going forward?","Mike Roman","Yes, it's been something that we've seen with the office channel over the last year and a half almost two years now where you see a restructuring of the channel and you see a destocking as the traditional office channel restructures around the new normal for them. I think we see it more broadly as well that we are a point of sales is strong up mid single digit across portfolio, both the retail channel is at least as we come to this second half of the year see additional restructuring in. And we expect some of that to continue as we move ahead. This is a space that's been disrupted significantly and it's something that we expect to see some individual channels as we move ahead, but really it's the broader base in the second half that's impacting us now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks, good morning, guys. Can we maybe start on just US growth? So I recognize that the ERP transition probably impacted growth little bit this quarter and I think Mike you mentioned a 100 basis points earlier. But I'm just parse out like how much of-- how much of the 50 basis points of growth you saw this quarter is related to ERP versus like what you're seeing from an end-market perspective just give that the US has been so strong across industrial for most of the year.","Mike Roman","Yes. So if you look at that 100 basis points so we talked about, that's a worldwide view are really 250 basis points of impact on the quarter in the US. And as I mentioned we saw most of that, the vast majority of given back in Q3. So year-to-date up 3% is more in line with when you look through that what we're seeing. And we see positive growth in Industrial, Safety and Graphics Electronics and Energy and really we see the macro more broadly in the US positive and steady. It was, I would say-- we're back talking about our Healthcare organic growth being impacted by our drug delivery business in the US and a strong year-on-year comp in the US especially strong in that area, and then I would say consumer organic growth was impacted by that US ERP as strong as anyone any one of the businesses in our portfolio. So, they had their full share of those 250 basis points.","Joe Ritchie","And Mike is it your assumption going into 4Q that the ERP overhang kind of subsides or is that something that just carries into 4Q as well?","Mike Roman","Yes, I think that's the view we saw the vast majority come out in Q3 so that's not the big impact as we go into Q-- as we go into Q4.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. And then my one follow-up just on China obviously through the first three quarters of the year things have held up very good; we're seeing signs of things slowing down particularly on the Consumer side, I'm just curious if you can give any color around the trends that you saw through the quarter and what you're seeing specifically with the Chinese consumer?","Mike Roman","Yes, we mentioned that the slowing in the consumer respiratory protection space as one of the impacts. We see other signs of slowing in China, automotive build rates are down significantly. And that has a knock on effect and so you see some broader softness in industrial as we go into Q4. So we are seeing the same thing that's why we see ourselves tracking more to 8% to 10% range for China for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please proceed.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning guys. Mike can you give us more color what happened in Europe this quarter? We know you are expecting a slowdown in the US given the ERP. You just talked about China but EMEA seemed to fall off significantly for you versus last quarter. I think Western Europe was up 6 last quarters and down 2 this quarter. So as Western Europe, is the European decline acquire just more lumpiness or is there something a little more worrisome there?","Mike Roman","Yes, so our broader Europe is tracking to the low end of the-- of the range that we had for the year and the 1% to 4%. As we came into the quarter the Industrial and auto build rates softened a bit and we saw softening across West Europe and organic growth declined in the quarter up slightly year-to-date and we think up slightly for the full year and so at the bottom end of the range. I think it's also being impacted by some of the portfolio actions that that we are taking as we talked about as we've gone through the year part of our plan to improve the overall performance of the portfolio and the profitability of West Europe as we move ahead, but tracking low single-digits at the at the bottom of our range for the year.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike, do you have this visibility though into that sort of low single-digit growth as you go forward because it has been a very lumpy region for you?","Mike Roman","Yes. I think we have good visibility across the portfolio and the markets and I would say that the softening in the automotive and the build rates have an impact there. We have been talking about this being towards the low end of the range all year really because of the outlook we have across the markets in our portfolio and also some of those actions we've been taking. So I think it's consistent a little softer than expected in Q3, but, again, for the full year we think it's about in the range where we expected it to be.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And then Nick your price with raw material plus point three, pricing up one point obviously good results there. Can you maintain positive price versus raws even if tariff continue to ramp? And could you talk about how you are adjusting raw material sourcing under supply chain to adjust to the inflationary environment, especially if we see more tariffs moving forward?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Andy, we are continuing to see raw material price increases and so our pricing has more than been offsetting that and Andy it's our expectation that will continue. We are anticipating continued increase in raw material prices and layering on tariffs that we expect our price strength to continue to more than offset that. If I fast forward a little into 2019, we think tariffs will be having a negative impact on our total sourcing cost. There are a number of things we're doing around that source changes, supply-chain changes but also pricing changes. And I'll talk more about this in on November 15th but our view is we have approximately $100 million headwind from tariffs. And that our pricing will more than offset that and raw material price increases in to 2010.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Just a question around the moving parts in the P&L, particularly I guess your SG&A was down sort of 90 bps a share of sale, R&D down 40 bps a share of sales to offset falling gross margin. Is there any change to the view that R&D to sales of 6% is the right number and what's the risk I guess that R&D and SG&A expenses have to sort of snap back up over the next 12 months?","Mike Roman","Yes. Julian, let me take the R&D part first. On the research and development as you heard of stock, it's heartbeat of 3M, it's the center of innovation and it's the key for us sustaining our performance, premium margins, our growth, our return on invested capital. So it's still a top priority for us and a top priority for me as CEO. We are going to continue to invest in it, continue to target that approximately 6% to sales and if you look at the quarter majority of the year-over-year decline in the quarter was really due to a couple of factors; FX of course the contract R&D work that-- that I talked about in the drug delivery business was part of it, and also the divestiture of the communication market. So, that-- it's really and there are some quarterly up and downs as we make investments in experiments and a number of projects and so it's still very much the focus there.","If you look at SG&A, I think that's another one that. We --our spending is not completely smooth, but we're making improvements as well on productivity. That's one of the things that we're getting as we move forward business transformation as we take now 70% of our revenue onto business transformation. We have opportunities to leverage our service models and engage in some improvements there. So, you know, at least a little bit of what we saw in the quarter was starting to see some productivity there, and I think of the actions that we've been-- strategic investments we've been making impacting that as well.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks and then my follow-up question would be around Healthcare, you had laid out-- or the management team had laid out the 4% to 6% top-line growth aspiration two and half years ago; Healthcare is consistently run at or slightly below the bottom end of that range even prior to the drug delivery issues. So do you think that's the addressable market growth coming in light or do you think there is a need of 3M itself to step up M&A and\/or R&D to close the gap with the growing market?","Mike Roman","Yes, Julian, I would say that - I talked about the broader portfolio. We have much of the rest of the portfolio beyond drug delivery that's in line with our expectations. And if you if you step back and look at the 4% to 6% and where we are now in the 2% to 3% range versus that 4% to 6% or even as we as we kind of reset and said 4% as we came through the year, it's largely drug delivery and slower oral care. We saw a better oral care performance in the quarter as we move through the year; kind of what we expected, but, still when you look against that 4% to 6% those are the two impacts - that our biggest impact. The year-over-year comps are part of it in the quarter, but if you look at the total year now - those are the impacts. We expect Q4 to be a return to our historical growth rates in healthcare so as we lap some of the drug delivery comps and we get those broader performing portfolios to have a bigger impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker","Thanks. Good morning. Hey Mike, I just want to characterize what you're really seeing out there; you've already from a growth perspective, if you take out the ERP impact, if you take out what you would describe as kind of disrupted channel related to distributor and retail destocking, I guess you have slowing China and some European challenge, and you take out the Europe-- the drug delivery are you seeing kind of any short-cycle slowing globally from a demand perspective or do you think these are all kind of more 3M specific issues that you're going to be getting through and then normalizing?","Mike Roman","Yes, see I think you've characterized it well. The areas that we've talked about already, and we have highlighted number of businesses where there specific to our markets and our businesses in those markets. I would say that we've performed well and automotive as Nick noted we performed well in the automotive OEMs are relative to their bill grades, but their bill rates continue to move down negative actually in the quarter and part of the slowing in China and part of the impact in Europe as well.","We highlighted as well, safety and graphics has been at the top of the range that we have guided for the year and really was we expect them to be there at the end of the year but we're impacted by a negative mid teens growth in our industrial mineral business, that's another one. But again it's kind of a maybe it's our focus on construction markets and some of the challenges we see in some of those end markets, but that was definitely softness in one of our markets.","So, broader we see a steady and positive macro and broader our portfolio the majority of our businesses continue to do well against that broader macro.","Steven Winoker","Okay, and then and I of course on that, it doesn't change your sort of normal 1.5x IPI thinking?","Mike Roman","Well, yes. It's on the broader portfolio absolutely and as we move ahead that's the model that we look at it, individual business is impacting the way they did here in the quarter and maybe a couple of them as we go through the second half, it's those are - those will take away from some of that near term, but yes, that's absolutely our performance, that's our focus, that's our expectations, that's our capacity and capability that we demonstrated.","Steven Winoker","And I don't want to miss read your portfolio optimization comment towards the end of your prepared remarks. But that is something that 3M certainly had been emphasizing for sometime with Inge and with you before, so do you need something different here in this - what do you mean by that?","Mike Roman","Well, that you said it; portfolio management has been one of our key leverage. It's a driver of value for us, you look at the performance we have in electronics and energy and in safety and graphics as we come through the year those business are performing well and they have been an area that we focused a lot of our portfolio that actions around it's what we have done to reposition and reshape those portfolios through acquisition and divestitures and other actions, I think that's an example of where we take that lever and really create value and so we're always looking at that, we are always realigning our businesses around our portfolio priorities it's how we reshape the company for near term and long-term success. So it's I guess and I said that at the last call as well, we are in active portfolio of manager this is what we do to take full advantage of the 3M model as we move ahead.","Steven Winoker","Okay, and if I can just sneak in one specific think for Nick. On the inventory days and I suppose receivables. Just slight increases that are going out there. I assume that's all ERP related or is there something else going on?","Nick Gangestad","No. Steve, that's exactly - we had built some inventory in advance of going live in the US with our new ERP system. And we wanted to do that in order to ensure we were fully satisfying our customers and their supply chain and the increase you are seeing there is that not bleeding off quite as fast as we had planned but we see over the next couple of quarters that inventory coming down.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed.","John Inch","Thanks, good morning everyone. Hi, guys. So, Mike it sounds like your characterizing Europe and maybe Asia Pac a little bit as relatively stable. I think that's kind of messaging that I am getting maybe at a slightly decelerated basis. I wanted just kind of confirm that's what you're seeing Brexit or any other issues are not necessarily sequentially affecting your businesses and on that basis, is this causing you this kind of low level activity stability, because you're very big company in Europe. Is it causing you to allocate your R&D or your growth initiatives in any kind of a different way to try and stimulate things more quickly to circumvent auto, just curious on those fronts.","Mike Roman","Yes, John I think you characterized West Europe and Europe overall the way we kind of view it right now, and again we see some markets like auto impacting Europe as well, drug delivery of course impacting Europe as well. But more broadly we see it a steady economic backdrop, we're not looking at other significant changes there. And Asia I guess I would characterize it maybe at the low end of our range that we had looked at for the year so softer overall but again steady across more broadly with sometimes as long as I've said in China.","And so if you look back at West Europe, your question there we are --we deployed the business transformation there over the 2015-16-17 and we're now taking advantage of that and we are I would say doing a couple of things, it's enabling us to prioritize better where we really do invest in our best parts of our portfolio. It's the models that we have in place the service models that we have in place there up and running be able to leverage area wide ERP capability. Those are really enabling us to I think bring even sharper focus on prioritizing and that's part of our active portfolio management as prioritizing where we put our resources for growth shifting resources to those higher growth areas.","We're also as planned taking some actions to I would say streamline our structure in EMEA and even Latin America as we get ready for the go live taking advantage of business transformation so that's really also helping us the focus on the markets in areas that are most important and best opportunities for growth as we go ahead.","John Inch","So on that point you just read about business transformation ERP maybe this is for Nick, Nick give us a sense of how much BTU may have actually net contributed in the quarter and I know you haven't really updated your 500 to 700 target in Ohio right from business transformation specifically but can you give us at least an elementary advances as this is coming through. Are we looking at the low end or the high end of that range or a new range all together?","Nick Gangestad","As far as the savings, John, we are --what we've been saying and continue to say is that by 2020 we expect this to generate between $500 million and $700 million of operating income benefit. this year we're on track for approximately $100 million of savings versus last year, that will bring our total savings since we started that on an annual basis up to $250 million and we remained on track on the 500 to 700 not ready to call whether we think more likely low end or high end, but we still see ourselves in that range by 2020.","And as Mike mentioned earlier on this call we have a lot of the deployment behind us now and that's allowing us in 2019 to be putting even more energy and resources into realizing the value realization that that we've been projecting so a little bit of a shift of little less on deployment and more on the value realization and the business process changes that will create that.","John Inch","And to be clear about $100 million is a net number right like that goal flowing to the bottom line pretax?","Nick Gangestad","That's exactly right John.","John Inch","And then one more just nitpick here. Why haven't you updated the 500 to 700? I mean this goes back a few years ago right. Is there some obvious reason why should base on the nature of the way this stuff is working that you can't --you haven't actually provided some sort of look forward based on progress or realized results is that just because the U.S. would save for the last and it's the biggest slug or is there some other reason why this thing is not being updated or would have been updated sort of more quickly?","Nick Gangestad","Yes. We last updated that number in 2016 when we laid out a five year plan and we've continued to progress as we expected towards that. November 15th when we lay out our next five year plan we'll be updating that if where this goes even beyond 2020 and so partly John it lines up with longer term plans that we lay out and you can expect to see more from us on in November.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi good morning guys. Just I know there've been a lot of questions on growth and maybe not quite what we would have expected in terms of some of the bigger global controversial end markets like auto or the consumer in U.S. and China, it don't seem to be as big of a drag a lot more 3M specific stuff which I think some of the earlier questions have noted. Do you feel like over next couple of quarters and I don't want to get into 2019 too specifically, but do you think there is a smooth hand off where some of the 3M specific issues or some of the submarkets start to balance out and we can still kind of swim upstream versus some of the more controversial ones like auto or is there potential for say someone have to bleed down further into your business?.","Mike Roman","Yes, Josh, if you look at some of the businesses we've highlighted today that are impacting growth as we come through Q3 and the second half. We'll, couple of things will happen. One we'll lap some of those comps as we move ahead. And they're going to expect. I mean we're, we expect to improve those businesses. And I mentioned in drug delivery that we stabilized based on what we have in the pipeline as we get into the 2019 and we returned to growth as we come out of that. And so we can look forward and we can see that stepping into it.","Automotive is maybe a little more complex in the dynamic. I mean we're outgrowing the build rates and have consistently done that and with what we're doing with automotive electrification, we see our ability to do that to continue and even leverage our innovation further in the future. But we're still dependent on the build rates. And so what happens in those build rates as we move ahead where it goes in key markets like U.S., Europe, China, those are going to impact that. The outlook right now is fairly nominal low growth negative growth as we come through the quarter in third quarter, but slow growth as we move ahead.","So I would say we'll continue to outgrow that that will continue to be a growth contributor with what we've been able to do there. Other markets industrial mineral what happens in the end market demand will dictate that more than us as we get into future quarters. So I think it's little bit market dependent, but the one examples that we've talked about, I think we do see ourselves being able to continue to rise up in our growth relative to those markets. If you go turn to consumer, the thing I would look at is our sale out continued strong.","Our brands, we got category leading brands that are performing well off the shelf, we've got to work through, and I think our team is done a very good job of working through the channel disruption that's going on there and managing through that. We've got very good visibility as we move through that especially in developed markets. And we expect to see that sale out to eventually rise up and carry the day. And so we'll look for that as we go ahead too.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful. And maybe I could just follow on with the teaser for what you may talk about here in few weeks in November. Clearly a lot of questions about growth here on today. I think business transformation phase 1 has been a lot more margin centric and there is always been an aspiration for phase 2 to have a growth component. Is that something we could start to hear a little bit more about in the coming weeks or is that still few years off in terms of being quantified?","Mike Roman","Josh it goes to John's question and Nick's discussion earlier too. Our business transformation was focused on putting the ERP and much broader than the ERP other system capabilities in place new models transaction efficient models in place in our supply chain and in our back office. And that's we're doing with business transformation. But as we do that as we now get 70% of our revenue on the new systems, we can start to leverage that in other ways as well. And we'll be talking about at the November 15 Investor Day. We'll talk about where we see opportunities to do that on the commercial side and also in supply chain.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John Walsh","Hi good morning. I guess just trying to put a finer point on the new organic growth guidance. A squiggle does imply a range, so I was just curious as we think about Q4 would you expect to see organic growth accelerate from the 13 we saw this quarter or how should we think about that?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, John. We're just a little over a 3% through the first nine months of the year for growth. And when we're estimating 3 that's our best estimate of what the total year growth will be? I don't see a very wide range on that maybe 20 basis points plus or minus but not a very wide range on that. And yes, that included in that as an expectation that we see higher organic growth in Q4 than what we saw in Q3.","John Walsh","Great. Thank you for that. And then, you touched on the savings portion of business transformation, and how to think about that. But how should we think about the spending, obviously this year there were some restructuring around getting out of those stranded costs, but how do we think about the actual spending levels that you are absorbing in your earnings construct as we as we think about that into 2019.","Nick Gangestad","And John, you're specifically talking about our business transformation and what we're spending on that.","John Walsh","However you wanted kind of define if you want to take a broader turn that, and if you want to kind of that one program.","Nick Gangestad","John, in terms of the business transformation, over a number of years, we've been saying this is going to be an incremental spends of a little over $1 billion. And as I look, as we look at our spending over the last few years, in terms of cash outflow that has been declining. In terms of total in spending, hitting our income statement as we start to amortize some of what we built there. It's been remarkable flat year-on-year of the total spend that we're putting into our business transformation initiative. And right now my view is that's going to continue and a pretty stable level for the next couple years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin","Good morning. Can you hear me? Just question on safety and graphics, I think you guys highlight a lot of headwinds when you were at Laguna, but that one is a bit of a surprise to me and a couple of things, organic growth, 2% margin declined year-over-year and particularly you guys highlighted roofing granules, declining double-digits, and as I recall, this was one of the businesses that was supposed to drive big growth and big margin expansion post everything you've done to it in terms of repositioning this business. Can you just talk what happened the quarter and has something changed here or is it a one off?","Nick Gangestad","Andrew the roofing granules business is the smallest business we have in Safety and Graphics. And it's a business that has been enjoying, in the U.S. some of the construction increases that they are going on in construction as well as there's a cyclical or a temporary nature depending on what's happening with storms. So in this business is very closely tied to shingle production. And right now, shingles manufacturers are making less, making less shingles.","And it's a very tightly integrated supply chain. So for the last couple years this business has been on a path of high growth and we reached a point in the third quarter that, that growth has come down. And the growth going forward is going to be tightly correlated to what happens with shingle manufacturers in the amount of production they're doing.","Andrew Obin","And is broader for safety and graphics margin decline year-over-year and sort of this growth that maybe 2%. Because I always thought, this was the business that was supposed to go tighten; this was the showcase of how you can sort of realign your portfolio and achieve better margins and better growth. I guess maybe a broader question here.","Nick Gangestad","Yes, broader question. So right now we're estimating this business to be about at the midpoint of the 4% to 6% organic growth that we guided at the beginning of the year. And that midpoint is absorbing what we're seeing as the impact from the roofing granules business. As far as the total growth in the third quarter. See in mid-single-digit growth in our personal safety business against a 14% comp in our personal safety, that is by far our biggest business. Andrew, we continue to have a lot of confidence in our safety and graphic business and its ability to grow and be a leader in growing 3M's total organic growth, a lot of confidence there.","As far as the margin, we are absorbing 150 basis points of margin impact from Scott Safety and we'll be starting to look lap ourselves on that as we acquired that fourth quarter last year. And I no longer we'll see that as being dragged to the margin going forward and potentially accretive going after that.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up sort of the counterpoint to safety and graphics. Everybody was concerned about electronics and energy and you guys actually posted really good growths throughout this expectation margin was north of 30%, is the margins sustainable or were they one-time items or how should we think about that?","Nick Gangestad","Andrew, if you look at the history of Electronics and Energy Q3 tends to be the high point for our revenue and our margin for that business. Year-to-date our margins are 28.4%; that's up 170 basis points in that. That includes the impact of exiting our communication markets business. So, yes, the portfolio management we have been doing and the things we are doing and investing in research, we see as being accretive to our margins in that business, but I would not call the 31 plus that we are at this-- in this quarter as a new level-- is more third quarter is typically the high point.","Andrew Obin","But it's just-- there is no one-time big items, it's just everything one right for this business in this quarter. Is that fair to describe?","Nick Gangestad","That's exactly right, everything going right in this business this quarter; no one-time issue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Tusa","Hi guys, good morning. So, just so I kind of understand the comments on R&D correctly, are you saying that kind of that the-- the productivity which you are getting out of business transformation et cetera is allowing you to kind structurally kind of spend a lower level of R&D than the 6% going forward?","Mike Roman","Steve, I would-- I guess my message here is that we have not backed off of what we've been targeting with our R&D investment. This idea of investing to enable us to drive more of those priority growth platforms, more of the disruptive new technology, that's what we talked about when we move from 5.5% of sales to 6% to sales, and so while in the quarter we are down at 5.3, our strategy and our plan is to invest in line with what we've talked about when we said we are targeting 6%.","It's not an efficiency that we are gaining there. There are some one-time kinds of impacts on the quarter just a little bit of ebb and flow-- we expected a little overspending just by the layout of our R&D programs as we went through the year, and then we had the drug delivery contract R&D work down. We had impact of FX and we had the divesture of communications markets.","So, no-- they usually expect us to continue to drive that-- this is not a BT enabled-- we do-- we certainly do expect to get returns out of these investments and will adjust as we move ahead, but, near-term that's not-- that's not what's going on.","Steve Tusa","Okay. That makes a lot of sense. When we kind of think about, how you are kind of positioned and how you are-- what your mindset is for the next several years, the last few years you have had a couple that have been pretty good, but not too many in the kind of double-digit EPS growth range, and that's despite some very heavy stock buyback activity, were you kind of providing a new framework for EPS at some point? Do you wonder in your watch at least? Or is the 8% to 11% still kind of a relevant number, and it's been a really steady as she goes on that front? Or are we going to get an update on that?","Mike Roman","Well, that's certainly one of the things we will be talking about the November Investor Day. That's-- we will be laying out our five-year plan and the framework for that five-year plan, and so I think that's something will cover in detail there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Nigel Wolfe","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the ENE margin, you mentioned everything went right but this is I think the second or third quarter where we have seen diversion trends between ENE and the rest of the portfolio, if you can just maybe just expand how you are seeing such strong open leverage in ENE versus -the -in those trends elsewhere?","Nick Gangestad","So, Nigel, what we have been seeing-- and I mentioned this earlier on this call, we are continued to see good penetration and content that we are putting into electronic devices, we are seeing good growth in places where we are selling into datacenters and semiconductors, that growth is helping us and is being accretive to our-- to our margin. In addition, the divesture of our communication markets business within that, which had been dilutive to our margin that is now, for all practical purposes, out of that business and we are also seeing some accretive benefits from that. So, that's what I was saying that many things going right this quarter. As we have focused on that portfolio and what we are investing in and we are seeing a lot of that pay off.","Nigel Wolfe","Okay but the key message is that we exit this year, obviously recognizing the seasonality from speaking in 4Q, whatever ENE is this year, is a good base for future years. Okay. And then my typical question again, kind of things about November, when we look at the last three to five years, core growth being in the 2% or 3% range on average, 2.7% for the last three years, I know you are not going to be satisfied with that kind of growth range, what in your mind is the biggest kind of restrain on growth here. Is the R&D pipeline, the commercialization; is it some share loss competition? What is the biggest recurring force on core growth here?","Mike Roman","Yes, Nigel, growth is a big focus as we drive forward, I mean it's what we expect our innovation model to deliver, and I would say above-market growth and premium margins. That's really a - I think the hallmark of successful innovation and for us that's been really our history. When we deliver on that, that's what we see. And we expect to see that outgrow the macro and to be able to do that consistently as we move ahead, and so that, that is the focus, that's what we will talk about at the Investor Day that's what we will focused on with our team. That's the way we-- that's where we start our focus as a team.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.","Mike Roman","In summary, our third quarter included good performances in many respects including double-digit increases in cash flow and EPS along with strong margins. As I look across our portfolio, most of our businesses continue to do well, but there are also areas that we must work to improve.","Looking ahead, how we allocate capital and continue to reshape our portfolio are keys to delivering even greater value to both our customers and shareholders. These are strengths of 3M and will continue to be priorities for us moving forward. Thank you again for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing you in St. Paul in a few weeks.

Here with me today are Inge Thulin, 3M\u2019s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer. Welcome to our third quarter business review.","Note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to address a few upcoming events highlighted on slide number two. First, we have set the dates for our 2014 earnings calls. They are January 30th, April 24th, July 24th and October 23rd.","Second, we\u2019ll host an Investor Meeting in the afternoon of Tuesday, December 17th at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, in Midtown, Manhattan.

Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. So let\u2019s begin today\u2019s review, I\u2019ll turn the program over Inge. Please turn to Slide number four.","Inge Thulin","","Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. As always, I appreciate you joining us for today. I\u2019m pleased to report that Q3 was a strong quarter for 3M. We posted an all-time record for quarterly sales and every business grew sales organically. All five business groups posted margins above 20% while we continued to advance our strategic priorities and investments. Let's take a look at the few third quarter highlights.","Sales rose 5.6% to a record of $7.9 billion. Organic local currency growth was 5.8% in the quarter, led by safety and graphics at 8%, Health Care at 7% and Industrial at 6%. Our consumer business grew 4% organically as did electronics and energy. This quarter\u2019s organic growth of 5.8% was a significant improvement versus the 2% growth in the first half of 2013. Industrial, safety and graphics, as well as electronics and energy showed the most improvements. On geographic basis, developed economies such as United States, West Europe and Japan also showed substantial improvements. ","On a year-to-year basis, we posted positive organic growth in all geographical regions. Latin America, Canada led a way with double-digit organic growth of 11%, Asia-Pacific rose 7%, the United States were up 5% and Europe, Middle East, Africa increased 4%. As expected currency was the headwind to sales, reducing worldwide sales by 1.7% and acquisitions added 1.5 points to third quarter growth. So all-in-all, a very strong quarter with organic local currency growth of 4% across all developed markets and 10% in developing markets. ","Operating margins were again strong at 22% or 22.4% excluding the first year impact of acquisitions. All five business groups delivered margins above 20% while also growing their top lines through a continued broad based effectiveness and efficiency. Earnings were $1.78 per share up nearly 8% versus third quarter 2012. Finally, we\u2019ve returned $2 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases or $4.8 billion through nine months of the year.","In summary, it was an excellent quarter for 3M on many fronts and our business is continued to grow very profitably. I thank the 3M team for their outstanding effort to deliver these very good results. Let me now review the outlook, please turn to Slide number 5. With one quarter remaining in the year and the business performing to all the expectations, we are narrowing our full-year guidance to $6.65 to $6.75, this is a previous range of $6.60 to $6.85 per share. On organic local currency growth, we\u2019re also narrowing the full-year 2013 range to 3% to 4% versus a pervious expectation of 2% to 5%. We continue to expect that currency impact would reduce sales for the year by approximately 2%, and we look for acquisitions to add about 1.5% to sales for the year. ","As for the 2013 tax rate, we now anticipate the range of 28.0% to 28.5%, and free cash flow conversion is expected to be approximately 90%. Now Dave will be taking you through the details of the quarter, David.","David Meline","","Thank you, Inge. Let\u2019s begin with the review of sales growth, please to Slide 6. Organic local currency growth was 5.8% in the third quarter, which was a significant acceleration versus the 2% we saw in the first half of the year. Volumes contributed 4.8% to third growth and we continued to see good pricing power with selling prices up a 4 percentage point year-on-year. ","Acquisitions added 1.5 points to sales growth in the quarter, related to Ceradyne in our industrial business and FSTech in safety and graphics. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.7% points in the third quarter. Currency impacts were negative 6% in Latin America, Canada and negative 5% in Asia Pacific, while EMEA had a positive 3% currency impact year-on-year.","Third quarter, sales rose 5.6% in dollar terms. Looking across geographic regions, Latin America, Canada led the way with strong organic local-currency growth of 10.5% in the quarter. All five business groups contributed to growth in the quarter, including double-digit organic growth in Industrial, Healthcare and Safety and Graphics.","Asia Pacific grew nearly 7% organically in the quarter. China, Hong Kong grew by 11% in Q3 with notable strength in Safety and Graphics and in Healthcare, followed by electronics and energy. Organic local-currency growth was 5% in Japan, led by Industrial, Healthcare and Consumer. Organic local-currency growth was 4.5% in the United States, Healthcare, Industrial and Safety and Graphics led U.S. growth in the third quarter.","In EMEA, organic local-currency sales growth was 4.3%. West Europe was up 3%, year-on-year, continuing a positive trend. This was our strongest growth in West Europe since the first quarter of 2011. Middle East, Africa increased double digits and Central and Eastern Europe also posted good growth in the quarter. Organic local-currency growth was 4%, across all developed markets, a positive step up versus recent quarters and 10% in developing markets.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide #7 for a discussion of the third quarter income statement. Sales rose 5.6% to $7.9 billion, which is the highest quarterly sales result in 3M\u2019s history. We generated $3.8 billion in gross profit and gross margins increased 10 basis points year-on-year to 47.6%.","SG&A and R&D investments rose 8% and 6% respectively. Operating income increased 3.6% in Q3 to $1.7 billion. GAAP operating margins were 22%, down 40 basis points year-on-year. Included in these results was a 40 basis point impact from acquisitions, therefore underlying margins were equal to last year\u2019s third quarter result.","Leverage on organic volume growth added 40 basis points to operating margins in the third quarter and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 1.2 percentage points. Strategic investments and one-time actions reduced margins by 80 basis points year-on-year. This represents incremental investments in disruptive R&D, our ERP system and restructuring actions.","Foreign exchange impacts reduced margins by 30 basis points and the combination of the U.S. medical device tax and other factors negatively impacted margins by 50 basis points year-on-year. Third-quarter earnings increased 8% to $1.78 per share. Foreign exchange impacts hurt EPS by $0.04 versus the third quarter of 2012 and a lower tax rate added $0.02. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% year-on-year, which added $0.03 to EPS.","Now, let\u2019s turn to cash flow. Turn to Slide #8. We generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow in the third quarter. Working capital investments were higher year-on-year, largely timing related and we will expect that they will reverse in the fourth quarter.","Capital expenditures were $404 million, an increase of $46 million versus last year's third quarter and we expect full-year CapEx will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. Free cash flow was $747 million and we converted 61% of net income for the quarter.","For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow conversion will be around 90%. We paid $431 million in cash dividends during the quarter or $1.3 billion year-to-date. ","If you look at our balance sheet in today\u2019s press release, you would see that the worldwide cash and marketable securities are $1.6 billion lower today than one year ago. We\u2019re managing the business with lower cash levels, the US in particular for several reasons. First, the business continues to grow and generate significant cash flow. Second rising interest rates are positively impacting our already well-funded pension status and finally our capital structure remains very strong, which is an important component of our business model, but we do not intend to strengthen it further. Gross share repurchases during the quarter were $1.5 billion and for the reason cited above, we\u2019re increasing our expected range to $4.5 billion to $5 billion versus a previous range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion for the year. And as Matt mentioned, we\u2019ll provide a full planning update at our upcoming Investor Meeting in December including capital structure and capital allocation.","Now let\u2019s review our third quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to Slide number nine. Our industrial business had a good third quarter with sales up $2.7 billion and 6.2% organic local currency growth. The growth was broad based as all operating divisions and all geographies posted positive growth. Our aerospace and automotive OEM businesses generated double digit organic local currency growth and we also saw strong growth in advanced materials, liquid filtration, automotive aftermarket and industrial and adhesives and tapes. ","On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales rose 13% in Latin America Canada, 8% in EMEA, 6% in the US and 3% in Asia Pacific. The Ceradyne acquisition added 4.1% to growth in the quarter. Integration is going very well and profits continue to exceed our expectations. Nine different 3M divisions have launched development projects that leverage Ceradyne Technology. First year\u2019s sales are a bit short of plan due to US troop draw down efforts, but we\u2019re winning new business with customers. In September for example, we earned an $80 million contract to supply enhanced combat helmets for the U.S. Marine Corps. ","Third quarter operating income was $568 million and reported margins were 21.3%. Excluding Ceradyne, industrial operating margins were 22.2%. Margins were also impacted by negative FX and strategic investments in growth programs and our ERP system. Please turn to Slide number ten.","As expected, our electronics and energy business rebounded nicely in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. Sales were $1.4 billion up 4% in organic local currency terms and operating income rose 3% to $300 million. Margins were 20.7% up a bit versus last year\u2019s third quarter and up 3 percentage points sequentially. Electronics related sales increased 4% on an organic local currency basis. Market demand was stronger year-on-year and we\u2019re expecting to a number of newly introduced electronic devices. Most industry sources are projecting flat demand for electronics this holiday season. As a result we\u2019re planning conservatively through year end. ","On the energy side, organic local currency growth was 3%. Electrical markets led the growth, boosted by record sales of our ACCR overhead power conductor. Communications and renewable energy were both slightly positive year-on-year. On a geographic basis organic local currency sales increased 6% in Asia Pacific, 3% in Latin America, Canada and just slightly in EMEA. Organic sales declined 1% in the U.S. Please go to Slide 11.","We saw our growth accelerate in safety and graphics in the third quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion up 8% organically, a significant increase from the 2% in the first half of the year. We generated double-digit organic growth in personal safety products and in roofing granules.","Our Commercial Graphics and Building and Commercial Service businesses also posted good organic growth in the quarter and traffic Safety and Security rose slightly. Sales in Safety and Graphics grew organically in all major geographic regions with strong double-digit growth in both Asia-Pacific and Latin America\/Canada.","The FSTech acquisition added 0.9% to growth in the quarter. Safety and Graphics generated an operating income of $315 million, an increase of 7% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Margins were up slightly year-on-year to 21.8%, excluding FSTech third quarter 2013 operating margins were 22.1%.","Now let\u2019s look at Health Care found on slide 12. Sales in this business were $1.3 billion, up 7% in organic local-currency terms. As was the case in Industrial, we generated positive organic sales growth in every division and in every geographic region within healthcare. Organic sales growth was strongest in food safety, health information systems, oral care, drug delivery and critical and chronic care.","On a geographic basis, organic local-currency sales increased 11% in Latin America\/Canada, 9% in Asia-Pacific, 6% in the U.S. and 5% in EMEA. And across all of the developing markets Health Care generated 14% organic sales growth. This is very similar to recent quarters.","Operating income was $426 million, up 7% year-on-year and margins rose 40 basis points to 32.1%. Margins were helped this quarter by a gain on the sale of a small non-strategic asset, offset in part by the U.S. Medical Device Tax, the net of which added 1 percentage point of margin.","Our Health Care business continues to post strong and consistent sales growth and excellent profitability. This helps stabilize the more cyclical elements of our portfolio, the business generates tremendous value for 3M.","Finally, let\u2019s review the Consumer business found on slide #13. Consumer also posted a strong third quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and organic local-currency growth of 4%. Operating income was $247 million, up slightly year-on-year and operating margins were 21.5%. Organic sales growth was strongest in our consumer health care, home care, stationery and office supplies and DIY businesses.","On a geographic basis, organic local-currency sales growth was 9% in Latin America\/Canada, 7% in Asia-Pacific, while EMEA increased just slightly. Organic growth was 3% in the U.S. helped by a good back-to-school season. Developing markets within consumer grew 10% organically in the third quarter. Similar to Health Care, the Consumer business is a very steady grower with excellent profitability and is a stabilizing force within the 3M portfolio.","That concludes our discussion of 3M\u2019s detailed third quarter results. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Inge.","Inge Thulin","Thank you, David. Before we take your questions, I want to highlight our progress on three important strategic levers, portfolio management, investment in innovation and business transformation. First portfolio management, we continue to strengthen and prioritize our portfolio. The Electronics and Energy business is a good example of where we are making progress.","In the third quarter we consolidated the Infrastructure Protection Division in to the Electrical Markets Division. Given this business a lower cost structure, improved market relevance and greater in financial reach.","Also, earlier this year, we integrated touch systems into the Electronics Solutions Division to align these businesses to better serve our customers. There is more portfolio work to be done here and we've continued to look at other structural opportunities. One of the primary reasons performing the electronic and energy business was to present a single 3M voice to the electronics industry. Now we are easier to work with and more relevant to launch fast moving electronics customers. And I\u2019m happy to report that we are receiving very positive reaction from customers on all these changes.","Second level; investment in innovation. Innovation remains the center of our plan and as I hope you remember last quarter we shared some details about how we are investing in long term disruptive technologies with significant growth potential. We are now finding 20 new product platforms several of which are expected to be introduced to the market in 2014. ","We are also investing in a new state-of-the-art laboratory facility at our headquarters in St. Paul Minnesota, which I announced last year. We broke ground in August and construction is well underway. This new laboratory will be an important part for 3M's global research network.","Finally the third level, we continue to make good progress with respect to business transformation and ERP implementation. We successfully went live in Taiwan, Russia, Indonesia and Philippines and in October we went live in Canada. Next up is our European Middle-East Africa supply chain center of excellence in Switzerland in November. Twenty more countries are scheduled for 2014. We expect to achieve benefits in many areas including supply chain, working capital management, customer responsiveness, improved business planning and faster decision making. ","In closing, we deliver strong third quarter with good broad based performance across all business. We remain focused on expanding our business driving productivity and executing a plan with strong discipline. I thank you for your attention and we will now take your questions and comments.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator Instructions] One moment please while compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Hi, good morning guys.","Inge Thulin","Good morning.","David Meline","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Inge, I mean, you, I mean the topline growth is really coming through and I think that support is what you've been trying to accomplish. Can you give us a sense of how you think of this quarter as a bit of an anomaly in that margin -- your incremental margins at least based on some higher cost, ERP things like that, that came through. Would you anticipate that going forward, you\u2019d show us maybe a little bit better incremental margins or is it just something that the cost of the higher growth is going to impact margins for a while until things? Until these investments really normalize?","Inge Thulin","Yeah and first of all on the growth side I\u2019m pleased we are pleased with acceleration we saw through 5.8% in this quarter versus 2% in the first half of the year. And we need and I need to give some credit here to 3M team for doing a very good job in order to work very hard to take market share and had a specific programs in all business relative to competitive conversion. So I think that\u2019s an important element as we see the growth come here. ","And yes to describe the growth, in a way, to think about it, we have had steady growth in Health Care and Consumer now for several quarters in a row. They are very savvy, it's working very well. And this quarter you saw electronics and energy turn up and as I mentioned that in my comments and David comment on us as well. And then as we saw growth rate in industrial oriented business is turning up in Q3 versus first half and that was board based so it was very interesting to see it was industrial tape and adhesives, it was abrasives, was automotive OEM and it was in personal care. So it was broad base and we saw it very much also in developed economy, which was very good for us.","So as you know in terms of moving forward, our plan is not margin expansion by definition. So we are committed to the plan we laid out. I think as you think about the balance of the portfolio with more growth in our biggest business, which is industrial that had a slightly tough comparison also versus last year. They had a very good Q3 last year and had a peak performance in Q2 of last year.","I think you have to look upon at one industry also grew as they did in developed economy. I think you will see this type of shift in the mix. But I think as you move ahead, we are committed to our plan and overall, I am very pleased that now able to see topline growth and maintain margins. So if you think about we are delivering 22% bottom-line here, 22.4% excluding first year impact of acquisition. That\u2019s a very strong quarter and I\u2019m pleased with that.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Yeah. Make sense. Just this is a follow on, can you help us understand, you -- we can see the progress on the topline. I just want to ask a question in slightly different way, I mean if you think about 2012, you finished the year with about 6% EPS growth, 2013 seems to be tracking around 6% EPS growth? I mean when you think about the longer term focus of 3M and you turned around the growth side and I understand you don\u2019t want to -- you don\u2019t necessarily need to show higher margin per se? But is there a chance that you\u2019ve -- I mean can you envision the 3M that can be double-digit EPS grower? Or is it really explicit in your model that you are going to be lower risk but higher quality growth company? I guess, I\u2019m trying to figure out, what -- how you think about EPS growth as it relates to topline?","David Meline","Yeah. If I could start, this is David Meline. I would say what you have asked is very much, our thinking is aligned to what we\u2019ve talked about last year in November, which is, we laid out a plan where we had 4% to 6% annual organic growth one and half times IPI. We think that that is certainly something that is reasonable for us to continue to expect to achieve.","You look at that we said 9% to 11% EPS growth, which is a combination of both topline organic growth, as well as the earnings growth that we would expect to get from other activities of the business that would include acquired businesses, which we continue to believe our relevant to our model that includes the impacts of also the non-operating items such as the continuing reduction on share count.","We expect pensions to certainly contribute to our earnings going forward in the future years and we\u2019ll continue to balance. We will look at where the best opportunities are and to the point on this quarter, we think certainly at the present time where we can create the most value right now is to continue to invest towards the long-term health and growth in the business.","So as you point out we are quite significantly investing in places like R&D innovation towards more disruptive technologies, improving our systems, which is a very important initiative for the company and taking the opportunity to also as we see areas where we need to maybe rebalance and restructure somewhat, which is part of the normal course of our business we invest to improve our competitiveness there as well.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. Thanks. Congrats on the topline guys. Thank you.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your question.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR","Thank you. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Ajay.","David Meline","Good morning.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR","So the organic growth rate clearly much better than expectations and much better than what we are seeing from other industrials in the quarter. So and that\u2019s great. So maybe talk about how much of this performance is end demand, I know you have talked about share gains, market penetration, but maybe a little bit color between end demand share gains? And then how much re-stocking might have contributed to the performance?","Inge Thulin","Yes. Well, thank you, Ajay, for the question. When we look at upon it, I assume you are also talking a little bit of channel inventory and so forth. First of all, overall, channel inventory levels appear to be balanced across businesses and geographical areas, but what we have to be -- we have to be watchful relative to the consumer electronic markets, particularly in the mobile and handheld small, small, in segments. ","So I think that we had a good lift for that business based on specking on platforms and building for the holiday seasons. So I think you saw little bit of inventory build in order to be prepared for that. Now all external facts that we see, you\u2019re saying that the holiday season for that segment will basically be flat, so that\u2019s one of the reason why we are very cautious as we go into their last quarter. Now we had a very good -- so you are right, we've had a very good optic here, specifically in the industrial based businesses and you have to assume that there is a slight improvement in the segments, but to be honest we don\u2019t see any differences versus any of our competitors. So what is happening here you know the execution from our team relative to competitive conversions is working very well. So overall I would say that the channel inventory levels are appear to be balanced only for us to be watchful which is based on external data relative to the consumer electronic market.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR","That\u2019s very helpful and you\u2019re getting really nice pricing, especially in the context that some industrials are reporting pressure and I guess that reflects the pricing power of your brands and that my question is how should we think about pricing for you in a benign inflationary environment next several quarter.","David Meline","Yeah. In terms of pricing, I would say, certainly, if you look at the performance in Q3, we are pretty pleased. We saw price performance was good pretty broadly across the portfolio with perhaps the exception in the electronics business where you of course have structural price declines. What I would say in terms what we see, of course, geographically, we do have you know more significant price actions are going on in locations where you either got weakening currency and\/or inflationary pressures as the result. So if you think about Latin America, again we saw significant price movements, we\u2019ve also been working in Japan where they\u2019ve had obviously a significant devaluation of their currency, as well, and then of course right now our comps are a little bit easier in the second half on the pricing basis versus the second half of last year. So at the end of the day, the issue for us is to continue to offer good refreshed products which will give us strength in the market to be able to command price that reflects the value we\u2019re offering to the market and as we do that, that tends to provide also a very nice halo effect for the entire portfolio.","Ajay Kejriwal - FBR","Thank you, very helpful, nice quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein, please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks and good morning.","Inge Thulin","Morning.","David Meline","Good morning.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Could you just -- may be just can drive a little bit more through the cash flow and the effect of that recovers through the end of the year, but still you're going to end up a little bit lower than you expect. I mean to what extent is that still kind of driven by the additional growth?","David Meline","Sure Steve. Yeah, so if you look at cash flow certainly year-to-date we're running about the same level as we did last year, which is I guess 76% year-to-date versus 75% last year. Obviously, it bounces around some quarter-by-quarter and typically for example in Q4, we would expect better conversion, which is why we're expecting 90% for the year and you know what I would say is very much the 90% would be reflective of the fact that we are investing in the business and at some level as you get an inflection in demand as we\u2019re seeing that tends to put some pressure on the working capitals like them. ","So nothing unusual, but just the reflection of seasonality really.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","And more inventory and receivables based or\u2026","Inge Thulin","Typically, yeah.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay.","Inge Thulin","Typically, inventory and receivables are impacted as you are ramping up towards higher level of demand count.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then on the strategic investments and actions you talked about the ERP implementation and such. How do you see that progressing? Are there any other, where you think about those or you qualify also kind of feet on the street additional or what are some of the other actions that we can kind of get a better sense of how that money is getting invested?","Inge Thulin","Scott, I think, when we talked about strategic investment theory in this section, it was about investment in disruptive technologies that we talked about earlier. It\u2019s about ERP investment and then some restructuring on some of the couple of places around the world.","And if you think about our model, 3M model is, we are basically working on this the whole time. I think one of the things here that we have stepped up is around disruptive technologies, where we announced in November last year. On November 8, we announced that we are type of-- in the plan moving from 5.5% closer to 6%.","So that was a step up and the ERPs of course, also something that we are investing in, that will very much improve our efficiency and effectiveness and productivity as a company. Restructuring is pieces that we do ask where we go, all right. We type of look into that and we financed that in quarter-by-quarter, as you very well know as part of the business model.","In terms of acceleration of growth and you talked about feet on the street in terms of commercialization. We have, as I took off, it\u2019s now almost 24 months ago. We made a big effort in terms of marketing excellence and sales excellence and I pointed individuals in order to lead that initiative type of more centralized in order to help with tools and so forth that execute locally.","As we go, we make investment. You saw here when David talked in terms of investment, both in research and development and SG&A. We do that but in a careful way. We also have to look upon different models in terms of commercialization as we move ahead. We have to adapt and make sure we do it in the right way.","But you have to look upon at every business group by definition or working towards their objectives in terms of margin expansion and growth. And that is where they ask for additional investment that is in addition to the three, David and I talked about this morning, then I would say layout is type of normal business procedure as you grow your business.","But we feel good now. We start to see the growth. We have made investment as you know in Healthcare specifically, we build out our capabilities in international sometime ago and we continue to see that delivering which is very good for us. We take market share, we improve our penetration and we have good margins in that business, the same with consumers.","So we look upon it and balance it altogether, those two businesses, consumer, Healthcare steady continue to move forward. And then, we had three out of business groups really ticking up this quarter including Safety and Graphic, as we saw had a very good quarter for us.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. ","Andrew Obin - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Just want to follow-up on what Scott was asking you. So, as I sort of think about the quarter, you\u2019re getting fantastic pricing. Emerging markets which is high margin is outgrowing, Healthcare margins are going up and is outgrowing. You seem to be making very good progress on energy and electronics. And your framework is topline growth of 4% to 6% and EPS growth of 9% to 11%.","But it just seems in a quarter where sort of everything has gone right we still can\u2019t get over double-digit EPS growth. And the question I\u2019m asking, what would it take for you to get over double, what set of circumstances would get you to get over double-digit EPS growth if we can get it in a quarter like this?","Inge Thulin","Yeah. So, I would say Andrew, certainly, we think as we look at a quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year, we think is very reasonable from a planning perspective to expect to deliver our 9% to 11% EPS growth on the kind of growth that we are laying out here and at the end of the day and one particular quarter or another you\u2019ll have more or less impact of whatever it is, the medical device tax, the ERP spending on restructuring acquisitions, so I don\u2019t view this as something that causes me to think that we don\u2019t have the ability to deliver on our plan quite honestly.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Okay. So just a follow question, what\u2019s -- you sort of addressed the gross buyback, but what is the change in net buy back for the year?","David Meline","We would expect at $4.5 billion to $5 billion that our net would around $3 billion to $3.5 billion for the year. ","Andrew Obin - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","And the previous was, sorry?","David Meline","Previous would have about $1.5 billion less than the gross, so that would have been about $2 billion to $3 billion.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","So it\u2019s not options, it\u2019s all going to net buyback?","David Meline","The increase that I\u2019m talking about today would largely be reflected also in the net. So the gross increase -- pardon me.","Unidentified Speaker","Yes, our outlook on the redemption side has not changed. So the whole change would go to net.","David Meline","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Hey, on the industrial side, there was one of the few businesses that showed operating margin down year-over-year and yeah, you showed nice organic revenue growth in the quarter. Was the margin hit mostly from Ceradyne or were there any other items that would have created that pressure?","David Meline","Sure Deane. So just to frame the performance in industrial, first of all, we were quite pleased with the way the growth inflected up for us to 6% in the quarter. And if you look at that first of all, it was a combination, it was both developing markets which grew 7% and we saw a quite strong improvement in our developed markets were we grew 6% in the industrial, so point number one. Point number two is, if you look at last year we were under 23% margin, so it was a certainly an exceptionable quarter while comparing to last year. If you look at our core operating margin in the quarter, we were a little over 22% excluding Ceradyne and the other impacts that brought us from that 22% down to the reported 21% were \u2013 basically the same ones we talked about elsewhere. ","So the impact on industrials margins of the disruptive R&D technology investments results gets spread through the businesses. The impact on the business of the ERP investment, which is about 30 basis points, FX impacted them negatively and then one thing we haven\u2019t talked about today, but it\u2019s impacting across the enterprise this quarter is, we\u2019ve ramped up now. We\u2019re in the process of putting in place -- Well, Inge mentioned that our European -- our new European supply chain activity and so that\u2019s having some impact on us here in the third quarter as we ramp that up and get ready to go ahead and go live. ","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great and then Inge, we\u2019re really interested in hearing that this promise that you made a while ago as --- when you closed on Ceradyne, you were very excited about how many different divisions of across 3M leveraged ceramics and here we are seeing a -- I think you said nine divisions will be marketing products that leveraged Ceradyne in some way. So could you give us a sense of where are those products? It will also be a 2014 events? Are there more to come because there are certainly more divisions that leverage ceramics at 3M and potentially for that technology, would you provide some more color on it?","Inge Thulin","Yeah, well I think from a business group prospective, you\u2019ve -- you will see it mostly in the industrial space, but you will also see it in some businesses in healthcare, in the orthodontic piece. We say now that these nine that have -- that are ready to commercialize, if you recall my -- on our call last time, I talked about 13 division to 15 division that are looking into it and they are continuing to looking and it\u2019s actually expanding. So the answer for your question more to come; yes, more to come, in terms of the nine that we quote you yesterday, they will roll out different type of activities during 2014. ","So when we look upon that acquisition in total, we are very pleased crystal wall, the integration is fully complete and also we are pleased to report that fully integrated to 3M. And as you\u2019ve seen now, we have taken couple of sizable orders we had -- we announced last quarter, an order around $40 million. And as David talked we got another one this quarter of $80 million that we\u2019ll start to be delivered next year. We will not deliver that this year.","So we have -- we've got to order. We are now qualifying it and it will be roll out next year. So I think -- on the bottom line, as David said, we are meeting and exceeding our blue book in bottom line. So in terms of both get some thing in front end around $400 million and then you have technology in the back office that we can leverage a fantastic thing for us.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Yes. Just from an exclamation point on that, I know that there has been a lot of skeptics at the time of Ceradyne closing that some of the military orders were in jeopardy. And since then that looks that was application and that $80 million order came through and there are others like that?","David Meline","Well, you can say it\u2019s actually handed $20 million because we have $40 million last quarter, $80 million this quarter. So that\u2019s under $20 million. So -- and that is one of the -- one of their segments for that business. So I cannot comment on orders that we are negotiating that is not finalized but we are very encouraged with what we see.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","Good morning. Could you give us a little bit more detail on two end markets with the electronics growth you are seeing, can you parse how much of what you are seeing is because of your own pivots or share gains as opposed to the health of the underlying markets?","And then on the Safety and Graphics, architectural coatings, can you talk a little bit about sequential trends that you are seeing there?","Inge Thulin","Well, first of all on the electronics and energy, we -- the electronics piece grew 4% for us and the energy piece grew 3%. And in the energy segment, it\u2019s through the ACCR that David talked about. That\u2019s clearly we are taking market shares. So we are now taking quite a number of orders and very much back in West Europe which is encouraging for us.","As you probably recall, when we talked to earlier, that said relatively long -- I will say not relatively long. It\u2019s a long sales cycle for that product. And that\u2019s now start to be qualified specked in et cetera. So we see orders coming in many countries, West Europe specifically as they were interacting.","So I think in that piece you can clearly say that we are taking market share in the energy piece of the segment. On electronics, I will say for us as you know, we will be expecting on platforms and we are -- and that\u2019s one of the optic we see and then I will say generally speaking in that segment, we have a strong position. We have always had a strong position and what is working well for us is that we are both able to provide technologies that will enhance those product for all the customers and able to drive down cost as fast as possible.","In terms of real market share data there, I think that will be more result of how the sales through will come in the end of the day because as I said we are -- take it very easy now as we\u2019re going to Q4 and make sure that we had sales through in the channels.","On safety and graphics, orders, what was your question there relative to\u2026","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","The weakness you sliced it on architectural construction markets, if you could maybe talk a little bit about what you are seeing sequentially and I guess, then again if you impasse your own performance to (Inaudible) you think you might be losing share or if you think you are gaining share relative to the market?","Inge Thulin","No first of all that is relatively small business for us. We started at couple of years ago. The base for that business was actually Japan from the beginning. Japan have done very well building out that business. And we took the Japanese model and adjusted that and try to build out first and foremost in United States and also in some selected places in West Europe with Italy be in the center of it relative to design.","So I will say that when I look at -- when I look upon that, it\u2019s not losing market share. I think it\u2019s temporarily shift in the market place and so forth. I don\u2019t -- and it\u2019s not considered on yelling [ph] and speaking that business for us in terms of we're losing market share. ","David Meline","More project based.","Inge Thulin","Yeah it\u2019s a project based business. You would see a little bit of that going in and out of quarters, but we are doing very well there with some of our film stuff is coming out from our film technology laboratories. And we are doing very well in lighting generally speaking. Look at on it more as project based, can go up and down a little bit the business is relatively small for us. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Please proceed with your question. ","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura ","Good morning, guys.","David Meline","Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura ","Hey, Inge could you maybe just give a little bit more flavor on these 20 new product platforms, your funding in terms of these disruptive technologies. You know kind of general areas you are talking about and maybe the rough size of the opportunities things.","Inge Thulin ","Yeah I can. I will not talk about all 20, but I can talk, yes, to give you a flavor of what we are doing there. So you have to go back to the background. This is based on that we step up the investment and research and development from historically 5.2% to 5.5% closer to 6% and that those money should go into the, what we call, classified and more disruptive technologies. And I say couple of the product, then I would type of just talk about them that is maybe closer for us because there is a couple of them that are in the first stage, very close to the first stage development of completion and that will be rolled out in 2014, maybe in the middle of the year to later in the year, but we are type of encouraged around them and there's a couple of them. Various teams for building constructions is one that is based on something where we believe we should be able to capitalize on some growth relatively fast. ","There is a protective film for electronics and appliances which is very encouraging that can be used for OEMs, that oriental appliances and electronics. There is a light management constructions that are both into residential and commercial and that\u2019s very -- so all of -- if you think about those, all coming out from our film technology platforms, that smart grid sensor cables that we believe will be something we should be able to commercialize fast and effectively and west Europe is the target for that specifically. ","And then we have the [indiscernible] enhancement film that is just on the way to be rolled out. So if we look upon, as you can see its much here around our base in technologies, from platform perspective. It's going in to businesses step off everything from electronic and energy to the safety in graphics and industrial business. ","So you will hear more about them as we go, but this all to be real and at least for me and for us to see, as so it's always type of platforms that start to come to life and that we believe that we should be able to roll out during 2014 is very encouraging. So we are very pleased the way the organization took this initiative to heart, moved it forward and we are focused a lot and make sure we give the bigger program and more resources and more resources and some of them that was good initiatives and maybe dreams that we always should have and we maybe reprioritize them.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura ","Okay, thanks. And David if I could take one more crack at this kind of EPS thing. Putting the quarter-to-quarter variability and things aside, I mean the high end the organic range now for this year's 4%, which should probably in your framework at least put to 9% EPS growth and it's not this year in the guidance. So is there -- I mean you're getting a little hit from FX is that it or is there anything else this year that\u2019s not converting, you know making the four equal nine that would in the broader framework?","David Meline","Sure. So if you look at over a long period of time, acquisitions we are certainly topline contribution. We are not seeing a significant at the moment bottom line this year. Pension we had a contribution this year, we had about a hundred million dollars, so that\u2019s contributing. Tax I think is pretty much carry over year-over-year and that\u2019s a contributor if you recall in our five year bridge. We've got a couple of points in the tax. So that would be something that\u2019s not present in current calendar year and then the last one would be we\u2019re -- frankly we are investing quite heavily in the front end for example with this R&D innovation initiative which should contribute in the future. So it\u2019s kind of pay now in terms of long term investment with future results, same as true with the ERP system.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura ","So \u201813 is sort of a heavier loaded investment years, I mean would that be main difference?","David Meline","Yes. Correct.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura ","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning everyone.","David Meline","Good morning.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","So just following up there with on Shannon\u2019s question, moving from 2013 to \u201814, seems like you have had a lot more of a heavier year this year both on ERP spending, the R&D spending. Talk us through may be some offset into next year or is it possible we do get an acceleration and start to see 5% to 6% growth if the incremental margin from the business will get a lot better and so it will be better portfolio in \u201814 versus \u201813?","David Meline","Sure. So if you look at \u201914, obviously will come out with that here in December, but if a kind of frame, I was thinking about \u201814. I would start which is, we are certainly a more constructive on the overall macro economy. We think we will see some improvement in both industrial production and GDP. Although we think the improvements are going to be slow but directionally we are encouraged.","We will continue to invest in \u201814, so the investment, if you look at we talked about going to 6% on R&D. We are on that path and incrementally we\u2019ll invest more next year in R&D. Same with the ERP that will be likely our peak year of investment in our -- in the ERP system and so that will be the part of the plan next year.","We do expect in terms of the things that are in view -- we do expect pensions now to be certainly a $100 million or more of expense benefit next year. And then finally, based on what we\u2019ve been doing with reducing the share counts through the year, you can expect that will be additive to EPS again next year as well.","So I would say we feel quite good about the momentum that we have right now going into 2014 and will be able to share more detail here in December.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","I think that\u2019s a helpful bridge, David. Just a clarification on the incremental spending on ERP, I think I had a roughly $50 million incremental next year. Am I ballpark\u2026?","David Meline","Yes. That\u2019s still in the right ballpark.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Great. Then one last question on growth for 4Q, just implicit in your 4Q guidance, just curious on the -- from the year-on-year perspective, you had really nice growth organically this quarter at 5.8%. Your guidance essentially imply that there will be a step down sequentially on a year-on-year growth perspective, just given some of the commentary that you had on the electronics business?","David Meline","Yes. Well, if you look upon the 3% to 4% for the year, that implies roughly 2% to 6% in the last quarter which is aligned what we have done for the year. So I think the way we look upon it, we are very focus now to make sure we end the year strong here. And I think the business that we are -- cautious as you call out yourself is and what I have talked about is that electronic and energy as we move ahead.","But talking about that business, you think about it, generally speaking, you think about the margins for that. We have gone now through the capital quarters. We went 53 in Q1 to 77 in Q2 and 20.7 in Q3. So constant improvement on the margins. And we have said from the beginning of the year that we will deliver high teens for the year for that business and that\u2019s what we believe we will do.","So I think the Q4 will be a little bit more of a challenge for that business but very pleased with the progress both in terms of growth and the way they have been driving productivity in the underlying operation and taking the portfolio management to half and really improving that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking me in.","Inge Thulin","Good morning, Steve.","David Meline","Good morning.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","On the healthcare gain, did you guys have -- in the total company bridges where is that -- discounted? Is that under organic volume or the med device tax other line?","David Meline","That would be in med device, other.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Thanks for that now. And then on now on Ceradyne, there was a little bit more of a headwind to margin. It looks like we\u2019ve kind of breakeven this quarter relative adding with mid-single digit margins last quarter, is that seasonality or further acquisition charges or investment, what\u2019s going on there?","David Meline","Yeah it\u2019s a combination, Steve. So one that the booking of orders tends not to be -- there are some lumpiness in terms of those project. So we had a pop-up in Q2, which was a little bit less in Q3 now. And then secondly there has been quite some integration activity which is impacted expenses here in the quarter, so that also was part of what contributed that.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay and then there is just one last question for the year the margin, you guys have given sales guidance, I guess it's kind of baseline people on the fourth quarter, what's kind of a good range for the total operating margin for the fourth quarter or just for the full year?","David Meline","For the full year we \u2013 ","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","For the total company?","David Meline","Yeah we expect it to be pretty similar to what the full year was last year.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, great. Thank you. ","David Meline","Thank you.","Inge Thulin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Good morning and thanks for going along here. ","Inge Thulin","Good morning.","David Meline","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","So Inge, you talked about the pickup in investment for some of the top five initiatives. Yes, R&D has been pretty flat, year-to-date about 5.4%, so I\u2019m wondering if you're getting better base productivity within R&D and do you still see this sense as the two long term targets?","Inge Thulin","You said the 6%?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yes.","Inge Thulin","Yeah. Well, first of all -- it's clear for me that we start to see more productivity out of the laboratories and I\u2019m pleased to see that to get both investment in R&D and productivity on the same short is fantastic when you do that at 3M and we start to see that then we are just ending up our strategic planning cycles here and I can tell you when I looked upon every business group, when I looked upon international and I look on the total company line outs and investments and productivity target for research and development, I was very pleased, right, so I had more effort on that, so the answer for your first question is, yes.","Is 6% right as we go? I\u2019m not changing that at this point in time. I think it's important, re-stating the cost, relative to make investment, relative to research and development because I believe and we believe and its DNA of the [indiscernible] that is the heartbeat of 3M, that is where we really make a difference as we move ahead, but again we are very focused on making sure we get productivity out from every program that we put in place, but we are not changing the target for the plan, productivity is improving and so overall we feel good about it.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, now that\u2019s helpful. And then switching to David, obviously that the free cash provision has been decided by CapEx, well ahead of tangible D&A and I\u2019m just wondering given the ambition to raise CapEx to $2.1 billion over the five year plan, when do we started to see tangible depreciation stepping up and you know we\u2019ve had a lot of questions about the 10% plus EPS growth and I\u2019m just wondering sort of extent that step up intangible is a headwind to EPS growth over the next five years.","David Meline","Tangible? You are saying a step in depreciation is that the point?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, as efficient you have dealt with CapEx?"," ","David Meline","","We don\u2019t see -- I don\u2019t foresee a significant step-up in depreciation if you measure it as a percent of revenue. So we expect to be pretty steady in terms of CapEx percent of revenue, if you look and assume the profile of the CapEx is not dissimilar to the past that would imply that depreciation would drag with revenue growth. So I don\u2019t have that pegged as a headwind in the business. And if any of anything, we\u2019re expecting with the completion of both the globalization of our capacity. And secondly, as we get in place this year pre-system and get better visibility on data we think will have a chance to run -- run our supply change more efficiently.","Operator","And our last question is a follow-up question from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, October 24, 2019. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 business review. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments, and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","Today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings.","Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our future investor events. Please turn to Slide 2. Our Q4 earnings conference call will be held on January 28th, 2020. Please note we will be providing our 2020 guidance during our January call. As a result, we will not be having a 2020 outlook meeting later this year. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3.","During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please note that throughout today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release.","Please turn to Slide 4 and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike?","Mike Roman","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The 3M team executed well and delivered a strong operational performance in the third quarter, building on our progress in the second quarter, while the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we continue to effectively manage costs, improve productivity, and invest for the future.","We exceeded the cost savings plan that we laid out in April, at the same time reducing inventory by $180 million. This is on top of the $250 million reduction in Q2.","Our underlying margins were strong, and we generated robust free cash flow with a conversion rate of 106%. At the same time, we are making good progress on our four strategic priorities for value creation, portfolio, transformation, innovation, and people and culture. For example, two weeks ago, we finalized our acquisition of Acelity, which is an exciting addition to 3M's health care portfolio.","In Q3, we also divested our gas and flame detection business and announced the sale of our ballistic protection business, all part of our ongoing effort to optimize our portfolio.","Later in today's call, I will also discuss our guidance for the full-year and provide an update on PFAS. Please turn to Slide 5 for a summary of our third quarter results.","Organic growth company-wide was minus 1%. We continue to face softness in certain end markets, namely China, automotive and electronics, which represent 30% of our company. Growth in the rest of our business was positive. And we saw strength in end-markets such as residential construction, medical and consumer retail, which Nick will discuss.","We also continue to see good returns from our investments in innovation, including the priority growth platforms we have shared with you in the past. Year-to-date, these platforms are up 9% as we create differentiated solutions for customers in areas such as auto electrification, connected safety, and structural adhesives. Turning to EPS, we delivered GAAP earnings of $2.72 per share, a 5% increase year-over-year. Please note that this includes a $0.14 benefit from the Q3 divestiture that I talked about earlier.","We generated underlying margins of 23.8% with all business groups above 23%. For the second consecutive quarter, we improved our margins on a sequential basis while reducing inventory, which shows that our productivity actions are working.","We also saw notable improvements in both EMEA and Canada, two areas where we have deployed our new business processes end-to-end. In these areas, we are seeing improved margins, better use of data analytics, lower inventories and enhanced customer service, which gives us continued confidence in our ability to realize the benefits from our transformation journey.","In summary, I'm pleased with our team's progress in the third quarter. I thank them for their efforts and continued focus as we move forward. That wraps up my opening remarks. I will come back with some additional comments after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter, Nick?","Nick Gangestad","Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 6 with a recap of our third quarter sales performance. Third quarter organic sales declined 1.3%. Volumes were down 160 basis points, while selling prices were up 30 basis points.","The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 60 basis points. Well, foreign currency translation was a 130 basis point headwind to sales. All-in third quarter sales in U.S. dollars declined 2% versus last year.","Looking at growth geographically, the U.S. declined 1% organically. Consumer and health care each delivered solid growth in the quarter. This was more than offset by declines in safety and industrial and transportation and electronics. These two businesses were impacted by weakness in end markets and channel inventory adjustments which further softened as we moved through the quarter.","Asia-Pacific declined 4% in Q3, Japan's organic growth was up 3% with broad base strength across most of our businesses. Organic growth was down 9% in China driven by continued weakness in automotive, electronics and export related markets. For the year, we expect organic growth in China to be down mid single digits.","EMEA grew 2% with positive growth across all businesses. Latin America, Canada grew 3% led by strong growth in Canada and Mexico. Please turn to Slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide third quarter sales were $8 billion, with operating income of $2 billion. Operating margins were 25.2% which included a 140 basis point benefit from the Q3 divestiture.","Overall, I'm pleased that our actions to drive productivity continue to gain traction with strong underlying third quarter margins of nearly 24%. On the right hand side of the slide, you can see the breakdown of our third quarter margin performance. First, the biggest impact to Q3 margins was the year-on-year decline in organic volume, along with our actions to lower production volumes and reduced inventories to improve cash flow in the quarter.","Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from the restructuring actions taken in Q2, as well as net gains related to property sales. In total, these factors resulted in a 160 basis point reduction to margins, versus last year's third quarter.","Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 100 basis points to margins, primarily due to the gain from this quarter\u2019s divestiture, which was partially offset by the M*Modal acquisition. Higher selling prices continue to more than offset raw material inflation, contributing 30 basis points to third quarter margins. Well, selling prices came in a bit lower than expected, our sourcing efforts to reduced raw material costs resulting in a net benefit, which we expect to continue as we move forward.","And finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 80 basis points. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter earnings were $2.72 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit from this quarter\u2019s divestiture.","Excluding this benefit, overall earnings were solid as the 3M team delivered strong operational performance. Looking at the components of our year-on-your earnings performance, the net impact of organic growth, inventory reductions and the other items that I covered on the prior slide, reduced third quarter per share earnings by $0.16.","Acquisitions and divestitures combined increased third quarter earnings by $0.10 per share versus last year. Foreign currency net of hedging was an additional $0.05 per share tailwind in the quarter. Our third quarter underlying tax rate contributed $0.08 to per share earnings year-on-year.","The lower rate is primarily a function of last year's tax reform and the benefits it created for U.S. based companies with a significant portion of their manufacturing in the U.S. And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2.6% versus Q3 last year, which added $0.07 to per share earnings.","Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. As Mike noted, we delivered very strong cash flow in the third quarter. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion with a conversion rate of 106% which included a negative 27 percentage point combined impact from the Q3 divestiture, and cash payouts of previously accrued respiratory related legal settlements. For the full-year, as a result of increasing cash flow, we are raising our expectations for conversion to a range of 105% to 110% versus 95% to 105% previously.","Third quarter capital expenditures were $349 million and remain on track to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for the year. During the quarter, we paid $828 million in cash dividends to shareholders and returned $142 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases.","Please turn to Slide 10, where I'll summarize the business group performance for Q3. I will start with our safety and industrial business, which declined 3.3% organically in the quarter. Similar to the first half of the year, we saw continued end market softness and channel inventory reductions, which impacted most of our portfolio.","Looking geographically, safety and industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 2% increase in EMEA and a 1% increase in Latin America, Canada. Well, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific each declined.","Safety and industrials third quarter operating margins were 26.8%, which included a 3.9 percentage point benefit from the gas and flames detection divestiture. Overall underlying margins in this business were solid in the quarter when considering negative organic growth and inventory reductions.","Moving to transportation and electronics. Third quarter sales were down 3.4% organically compared to last year. The electronics related businesses declined high single digits organically, as demand remains soft in consumer electronics, semiconductor and factory automation end-markets.","Our automotive OEM business was down 3% in line with third quarter global car and light truck builds. Advanced Materials grew mid single digits organically well both transportation safety and commercial solutions each grew low single digits.","Geographically, Latin America, Canada grew 7%, EMEA was up 1% organically. Well, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific each declined mid-single digits. Transportation and Electronics third quarter operating margins were 25.2% down 250 basis points. Similar to safety and industrial, margins were impacted by lower sales and inventory reductions.","Turning to health care, the business delivered 2% organic growth in Q3. Organic growth was broad based across most of our health care business. Growth was led by a high single digit increase in Health Information Systems. We continue to invest in this business, including this year's acquisition of M*Modal, which recently launched a new AI clinical documentation software that provides real time insights to clinicians. Medical Solutions, our largest business in health care was up low single digits in the quarter. We are excited to have Acelity join this team, which Mike will cover shortly.","Food safety grew organically mid-single digits with oral care up slightly. Separation and purification was down mid-single digits, primarily due to softness in China. Looking geographically, health care grew across each area.","Health care's third quarter operating margins were 26.7% impacted by 1.5 percentage points from the M*Modal acquisition. Also impacting margins were inventory reductions, Acelity acquisition related costs and investments in priority growth platforms.","Lastly, third quarter organic growth for our consumer business was nearly 3%. Sales were led by ","mid-single digit growth in home improvement and low single digit growth in consumer health care. Well stationery and office and homecare declined.","We saw continued strength in many of our leading brands in particular Filtrete, Command and Nexcare. Looking at Consumer geographically, EMEA, Latin America, Canada and the U.S. each grew low single digits, while Asia-Pacific declined.","Consumers operating margins were 23.2% in the third quarter up slightly year-over-year. That wraps up our review of third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 11. And I'll hand it back over to Mike. Mike?","Mike Roman","Thank you, Nick. I would like to make a few comments about our acquisition of Acelity, which was finalized earlier this month. We are excited as we bring together two innovative companies focused on improving health care outcomes for patients. Acelity offers an impressive range of medical solutions, including their groundbreaking negative pressure wound therapy.","They are an ideal fit within our health care portfolio, complementing our existing business and further accelerating 3M as a leader in advanced wound care, which is a significant and growing market. Acelity has annual revenues of $1.5 billion and year-to-date, they have delivered organic growth of 5% and EBITDA growth of more than 10%.","We look forward to leveraging the fundamental strengths of 3M, especially our global reach and technologies to build upon these results and drive even greater value. We expect the acquisition to be $0.25 dilutive to GAAP EPS in the first 12 months or $0.35 accretive excluding purchase accounting and anticipated one-time expenses related to the transaction.","We are pleased to welcome the talented people of Acelity to our 3M team and are confident in the value this acquisition will deliver to our customers and our shareholders. Please turn to Slide 12 where I will discuss our guidance.","Today we are updating our guidance to incorporate the Acelity acquisition along with our expectation of continued softness in China, automotive and electronics. With one quarter remaining in the year, we are providing our guidance for Q4.","We anticipate earnings in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 and an organic sales decline of 1% to 3%. On this slide, you will also see our updated full-year guidance for EPS and organic growth. Before turning to Q&A, I would like to make a few comments related to PFAS. We continue to proactively manage this issue. And I would like to provide some specific updates of what we have done since our last earnings call.","As you may know in early September, we testified before Congressional Subcommittee in Washington D.C. We reminded the committee that the weight of scientific evidence does not show that PFAS cause adverse human health effects at current or historical levels. Opposition shared by public health agencies and independent science review panels. In our testimony we also announced a number of commitments that build upon our existing efforts related to PFAS including supporting new coordinated research into PFAS, establishing a clearinghouse to share best practices on detection, measurement and remediation, supporting nationwide science based regulation and continuing to work with former customers to help ensure that unused AFFF containing PFOS is properly handled.","We also reaffirmed our commitment to ongoing remediation of our manufacturing facilities and historical disposal sites. With respect to litigation, the AFFF multi-district litigation is still in the early phases and at this time no trials have been scheduled.","Outside of AFFF, the earliest we expect other product related trials to begin would be in the Spring of 2020.","Moving forward, we will continue to keep you updated as developments unfold. In summary, as I look across our company, I see the strength of the 3M model. We have deep competitive advantages in our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands. We also have experienced teams that know how to manage through macroeconomic slowdowns, which our businesses tend to see early. In these situations, we put an even greater emphasis on improving our operational performance and reducing costs, enabling us to generate strong cash flow as we did again in the third quarter.","And throughout the business cycle, we remain focused on winning with our customers and keeping them at the core of everything we do, a great strength of the heart of the 3M culture.","As a result, we are well positioned to lead out of this slowdown, and deliver strong growth and premium returns as our markets recover. Thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning guys.","Mike Roman","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike or Nick, can you give us more color into your revenue guidance for Q4, if you look at sales comps. They're reasonably close to Q3 and Q4, you are forecasting continued deceleration at the mid-point of your guide, so you are expecting some of your markets just still get worse in Q4 and could you give us some color by segments are the biggest changes there in safety and industrial, and then in health care, are you going to reach the high end of your range. And how much of that is the China slowing that you mentioned?","Mike Roman","Andy I would say when you look at Q3 versus Q4, Q4 has a very similar dynamic to Q3. You start with industrial production GDP, they're pretty much in line quarter-to-quarter. We, as I said in my remarks are still anticipating some that slowing in China automotive and electronics could continue through Q4. So that outlook continues to remain the same. I would say our view of Q4 is on the top line, much like Q3 and with a range around it.","And then we are and our focus continues as you expect to focus on execution. There are growth opportunities, that 70% that has positive growth in Q3, there are growth opportunities there, so we're going to be pursuing those aggressively and there are much of health care as part of that.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, Mike and maybe shifting gears, Nick, can you give us more color and how you're thinking about all the moving pieces around margin obviously good performance in the quarter, you got to around 23% in Q3 and you came in closer to 24% ex-divestiture. So you talked about second half restructuring, currency tailwind lessening impact from inventory destock. And then you've got the transformation optimization ramping up. So can you talk about which of these variables were better than expected? And if it's possible, could you give us some early color and how you're thinking about these variables into 2020?","Nick Gangestad","Okay, Andy, quite a bit you asked there. First of all, we are I am very pleased with our margin performance in Q3. When we strip out the gain on our divestiture nearly 24%, and we're seeing productivity actions that we\u2019re taking gaining traction.","And at the same time, we're continuing to lower our production volumes and inventories with our focus on improving cash flow. So very pleased with that. Now when we look at what's going on in the margin performance itself in the quarter, there's about 150 basis points that we lay out that's negatively impacted from organic growth, inventory reductions and other items and about a third of that headwind is just directly related to the lower organic growth.","And then the remaining two-thirds is tied in with our lower production on lowering our inventory levels. And it is partially being offset and being benefited by our restructuring actions, which are coming in exactly as we expected. And we also had a gain on a sale of some property that will just go into a little more depth on. We continue to do have a portfolio process where we're reviewing our assets that we have in place looking for are they optimal?","And can we be moving to more cost effective operations, we continually do that. And then in the third quarter, we consummated a transaction disposing of an office building that resulted in a net benefit of about 50 basis points to our margin, or about between $0.06 and $0.07 per share. So those are the main things going on in the quarter from a margin perspective. If I as far as next year, Andy, I think it's really too early. We're so focused on delivering 2019. We'll give guidance on that in January.","Andrew Kaplowitz","All right, thanks Nick.","Nick Gangestad","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning.","Mike Roman","Good morning, John.","John Walsh","I guess, maybe going back to electronics and automotive markets, maybe even China as well, in the Q, you have the reported numbers, you kind of give us some direction on the local currency growth on the call, but are you actually seeing the second derivative start to improve in those end-markets. So if you look at some of the external data, electronic markets declines have kind of stabilized, at least where they are in terms of negatives and gotten a little bit better sequentially, auto could potentially flip next year as second derivative gets better, but can you talk specifically to your businesses and those that touch those markets, what you saw in the quarter?","Mike Roman","Sure John. Yes, just maybe kind of look across all those starting with automotive, so automotive the build rates are still negative and actually, I would say, the projections, they were worse than the projections maybe bit better than what we saw in the first half but still negative and so that was something that is an update to how we look at the second half of the year, I think we had a more conservative view of the overall projections.","And so we are planning for this. We did see additional channel reactions to those negative build rates. We had talked about in the Q2 call that we thought a majority of the channel response to the decline in automotive and electronic more broadly took place in the first half of the year, but we did see some additional adjustments, a big part of that in I would say in China, but more broadly than that as well. ","Electronics continued to be a drag in terms of end markets, they were negative growth as well. There's some signs out there that people are optimistic it\u2019s going to improve. We have some early indications that semiconductors is looking like it might start to improve. Certainly there's been some good consumer electronics, OEMs and brands that have talked about increasing sales. We've yet to see that necessarily play through the supply chain for us, but it's, I think the Q3, Q4, what I said earlier to Andy's comment, we see auto electronics and China kind of in line between Q3 and Q4.","So we haven't seen that what we call a bottom and an upturn yet, although there are some signs in electronic side anyway, that there's an outlook for improvement coming.","John Walsh","Okay, thank you for that. And then I guess as we think about at least the acquisitions and I know, you don't want to get into next year, but maybe we can talk about the underlying you're seeing in the back half this year, obviously M*Modal will flip from being a headwind to a tailwind based on your prior guidance for that business. We have Acelity coming in, but can you talk about the underlying health care business either in terms of incremental, if you were to take out all the noise, are you seeing anything different than history? Or maybe just help us understand what's going on there in an underlying basis?","Nick Gangestad","Hey, John, just to clarify you\u2019re talking about growth or margin when you're saying that?","John Walsh","Sorry, on the margin side, on the margin side, because there's going to be a lot of noise in that margin number, particularly on Q4 through the acquisition dilution.","Nick Gangestad","Yes, thanks for clarifying that, John. So what we're seeing in health care, from year-on-year margin performance, the biggest thing as I said earlier is coming from our M*Modal acquisition and yes, that will start to flip next year. Other things going on there, we're continuing to invest in a number of priority growth platforms. If those are a number of growth platforms that you've seen us lay out and health care has a disproportionate amount of those and we continue to invest in that.","We also in the current quarter is some investments we're making as we get ready for the Acelity, as we were getting ready for the Acelity acquisition, that that's, that's part of that. Just from a historical standpoint, we reorganized this business earlier this year, and added our separation purification business to be part of this. And I think, John, we restated and shared with those were on a restated basis for last year and the year before that, the health care business was operating on about a 28% operating income margin.","John Walsh","Great, thank you for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell, Barclays. Please proceed.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning.","Mike Roman","Hey, good morning.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning, maybe just starting with the health care division, not so much on the margin side, which I think you've clarified that maybe organic growth. So I think the organic growth year-to-date in health care is running at about 2%. Also, just wondered, when you're looking at that, maybe over the next 12 months, what are you expecting to accelerate that number and related to it separation purification rolled over, it sounded like having been flattish in Q2. How long do you expect that downturn to last and maybe tied to health care? The Acelity GAAP dilution has shrunk a bit versus what you said at the time of the deal. What drove that?","Mike Roman","So, Julian, I would start with just this remains a very attractive business, the end markets are very attractive with some strong growth trends, the demographics play well here.","So, as we look forward, we see that as a strong growth driver for us. If you look in the quarter that the 2% growth, it was positive across nearly all of health care and it was led by good growth again in Health Information Systems and food safety, strong growers. Medical solution was up low single digits. The headwind that we faced with separation and purification, as you talked about, and that was primarily due to elevated channel inventories in a few areas of the world.","And one of those is China, where we have a significant separation purification business, so that was the headwind, we did have both drug delivery and oral care. We're up slightly in the quarter and we expect drug delivery to continue to improve sequentially as we go forward and oral care continues to grow strongly, globally we saw some softness in the U.S. And we think the strength globally will carry us to better growth as we move ahead.","So the overall markets have strong portfolio and the medical solutions business getting stronger with the integration of Acelity. By the way, the results in health information are reflecting some of the early synergies that we're getting from our M*Modal acquisition bringing those teams together that's really starting to play out in the market for us as well with our customers. So I think we do see it improving as we go into next year.","Nick Gangestad","And Julian in regards to the improved guidance that we're giving in regards to Acelity, we had previously said that in the first 12 months, we expected it to be $0.35 dilutive to GAAP earnings and we now expect it to be $0.25 dilutive in the first 12 months to GAAP earnings. That\u2019s $0.10 better EPS impact is primarily related to lower than expected financing costs.","We saw interest rates from the time we announced that to when we actually obtained that financing improve. That's one piece and the most significant piece, we also are seeing better than expected EBITDA projections for that business than we were assuming back in May when we announced this deal.","Julian Mitchell","That's good to hear. Thank you, Nick. Maybe one quick follow-up switching tack, just looking at the firm wide P&L for Q3. Very good performance on SG&A to sales coming in at 18%. Just wondered how much you thought that was sort of variable costs, or something temporary, like currency affecting that number or that ratio and how much is related to fixed cost reduction efforts that Mike you've been putting in place the last 12 months, and whether that sort of lower SG&A to sales run rate may be sustainable.","Nick Gangestad","If I look at this year-on-year, third quarter last year to third quarter this year, we're down about 80 basis points year-on-year. That's the combination of a couple of things. First of all, FX is not having a very material impact on that on as a percent of revenue, because it's, it affects both the numerator and the denominator, not a big change there.","The two biggest things, Julian that are impacting that. One is the restructuring actions that we took in second quarter, we're seeing that benefit, the second and that that I see as sustained. The other thing that's impacting that is the gain we had on the sale of the building that I mentioned earlier, that that will not be a repeated action. It's about half and half.","Mike Roman","And Julian I would just as Nick said, we're executing well against our plan for the restructuring actions. Our teams are also responding to the dynamics that we see in the market and I think you see good operational and cost discipline as part of every business. So those are both playing through.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning.","Mike Roman","Good morning, Andrew.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","And just a question, sort of another broad question on growth, as we think auto probably will remain a headwind, specifically North America and even if China bottoms into 2020. Just wondering, what kind of set of macro assumptions do we need for 3M to grow top line organically in 2020? Overall, I'm not asking for your forecast. But if you could just outline what's the baseline macro scenario that gets 3M growing in 2020? Thank you.","Mike Roman","Andrew I\u2019m probably not ready to get the forecast. But I would say what you talk through just automotive electronics and you think about broader across what we've been talking about in our businesses, absent a recession and or some other major downturn in the markets in 2020, we expect to have positive growth across the company. You'll see know, at least in a year-over-year comparable improvements, less headwinds in automotive and electronics. As I talked about earlier, we're seeing some early signs that we might have some upside in electronics going forward, though, that has to play out.","Right, we are focused on Q4 and Q4 will tell us a lot about what to expect certainly in early 2020. But absent a recession, we expect to have positive growth.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up on electronics, historically, you guys have been very good at calling out electronics a lot better than other suppliers into the industry. Seems it was one area of the shortfall in the quarter. Can you give us more specifics as to what sub segments within electronics end market. And I'm, looking at one of the slides where you give the full blown disclosure, what specific end markets or products drove deceleration of this quarter versus previous quarter? Thank you.","Mike Roman","Maybe I will talk about\u2026","Andrew Obin","In 18, I\u2019m referring to Slide 18.","Mike Roman","Yes, I will talk about the four end markets in electronics broadly that are -- that we talked about when we talked about driving our growth, consumer electronics, we saw softness in that, continue to come through in Q3. Factory automation, there's no sign that that's turning around at this point, and that that also remains soft. Auto electrification, we saw lower build rates in Q3 in electric, in automotive electrification related platforms and make some models and so that was impacted by the overall auto build rate.","And so that was that we still had some growth in our auto electrification portfolio, but not as strong as we had seen earlier in the year. And then semiconductor, I would say it declined into the quarter but as I said, there may be some early signs that we\u2019ll see that pick up as we go forward. So, that's kind of the view of the four. So literally three of them were soft in the quarter and our frame is to, that's the outlook for Q4 as well.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Tusa","Hi guys.","Mike Roman","Good morning, Steve.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","So given you aren't going to do the kind of a year-end meeting, will there be a point where you guys kind of it just seems to me like a lot has changed since we last kind of sat down and walk through the strategy like a little less than a year ago. Will there be a time here in the next six months or so and certainly in the context of like maybe what you might learn on the PFAS front, where we'll kind of all get together and reset kind of the long-term view or are you still of the view that, steady as she goes, there's really no change to kind of the longer-term framework and algorithm you provided, last fall or winter, whatever that was in Minnesota?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Steve certainly the first year of our five year plan hasn't turned out as we anticipated, and given the slowdown in those key end markets, we've been talking about. We do have parts of our five year plan that are just as a reminder are doing well. We're on strong are on track for strong performance in free cash flow conversion and return on invested capital, but you're talking about growth when we look at growth in the outlook. Our Q4 earnings calls where we'll give an outlook for next year which is really the next indicator of where we are to get back on track with the longer five year plan. It's I think we are taking the right actions, I think it's early to today to give an update on the five year plan, but we'll be looking for the right time to do that as we come out of our guide for next year.","Steve Tusa","Okay, so there's no like you're still kind of a, hey we'll see what happens here. And we may or may not reset that. I mean, is there a chance that you'd look at that? Or is there basically no chance that this is basically just a cyclical element in your first year and you will assume everything kind of bounced back?","Mike Roman","We\u2019re always looking at the long-term plan versus what we see in the markets, and I think as we get a better view of 2020 we will incorporate that and then we'll come back to.","Steve Tusa","Okay, and then just one last thing on the -- on kind of the leverage the core underlying leverage. I mean, I appreciate you guys had you know some pretty significant inventory headwinds. It still seems to me, especially with the property sale, that there's a bigger decremental kind of volume impact even when you strip out the impact of inventories, is there anything that kind of changes that over the next couple of years? Are you guys spending more than you would otherwise be spending in kind of a tougher environment?","I mean, how do we think about the type of growth you guys need to have, that kind of 40% incremental margin or some real leverage on the margin as things come back up because it looks to me like the decremental leverage remains a little bit tough when you strip out everything but volumes?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Steve when part of our year-on-year comparison is as you noted, aggressively pulling out inventory out of our own supply chain, we're estimating year-on-year that's having a 150 to 200 basis point negative impact on our margins. So to partly answer your question reaching a point of more stability on our amount of inventory in production that we have in our supply chain. That in itself is in the future going to start to create some of a tailwind to us when we\u2019ve depleted that inventory out. And by the way, we in our guidance here, we're estimating that we're going to take about another $50 million of inventory out of our supply chain in the fourth quarter.","Steve Tusa","Okay, and then one last quick one on price cost? Is that that material benefit, that\u2019s kind of like, detached from volume, right? So like volume goes down, obviously your materials are going to go down, or is that how does that kind of reflect that dynamic? Just remind me about, just remind us of that?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, that's detached from volume. That's looking at what we're getting from prices versus what we're paying for our raw materials. And we really don't factor in a volume component to that.","Steve Tusa","Yes, okay. Great, thanks for all the details. You guys were very helpful.","Nick Gangestad","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.","John Inch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, John.","John Inch","I just want to pick up on the point of the year-end meeting, is this just a suspension for this year based on economy or an influx, or this permanently you're not going to hold these anymore? And so I'm actually curious, how do we get our gift bag of stocking stuffers?","Mike Roman","Well, John, it\u2019s definitely we think it's the right thing to do this year. So we have a really clear ","view of what we saw in the quarter as we start the year. We think we can give a better outlook at the earnings call. We did it last year, too. And the dynamic was similar. We saw changes in the end markets coming and we thought it was a better place to give, I think just better quality outlook for the year. So we're going to do it again this year.","John Inch","Yes, I don't disagree. Honestly, November last year was a little early. Just based on the way things were fluctuating, that is not really that much of a surprise. I do want to ask you though, the U.S. did seem to step down in the quarter kind of versus that trajectory and not sure that we're hearing that really from other companies. So I'm curious, kind of what's your read Mike and Nick, on the U.S., what kind of got worse? Was there some inventory? Is this transitory or, what's kind of going on in the underlying and Asia also seem to get a little worse too, but I think you sort of explained that with the additional inventory step down that kind of occurred in some of those end markets, but what's going on in the U.S.?","Mike Roman","Sure, John. IPI as I said earlier, IPI is kind of similar Q3 to Q4 worldwide, but the U.S. we saw significant decline in IPI and a revision down into third quarter and Q4 actually is projected to go negative. So you're seeing a broader impact on industrial production, broader manufacturing, we're certainly seeing that and that's impacting our safety and industrial business, our auto businesses is certainly caught up in that.","We have good growth areas in much of health care. There's some segments, consumer and retail spending continues to be strong in the U.S. And there's some other segments like construction where we've seen significant growth opportunities, but that broader industrial manufacturing set of markets is weighing on the U.S. results. And then we saw with that slowdown, we saw additional channel actions in the quarter. And so that was part of what you saw coming through our numbers, especially our safety and industrial business.","John Inch","And I'm assuming I mean, obviously, we all saw the September I assume print, I'm assuming everything you've seen thus far in October doesn't is the trend since September kind of more or less the same with respect to the United States or is there any other, is there any difference thus far realize that you still got another week to go but?","Mike Roman","Well, I would say as we've talked in the past channel tends to react pretty quickly. So we it's early days in October, we'll see if there's additional reaction there, but I think I would say what I said earlier that Q4 and Q3 kind of in line and October starting out as expected.","John Inch","And then just lastly, Nick on the $0.35 of Acelity accretion, how much like how should we spread that there's obviously going to be some in the fourth quarter through the next four quarters. How would you spread that? And then what about the restructuring savings that we took in the second quarter from those actions? How much hit the third quarter? And how would you expect, again, sequentially the restructuring savings from your second quarter actions to play out?","Nick Gangestad","So the restructuring savings, just as a reminder, we expected an annualized benefit of $225 million to $250 million where we expect $110 million of that to be impact the second half of this year, and that's playing out as we expected and it's almost evenly split between Q3 and Q4. And then the balance of that we expect to benefit the first half of 2020. That that's in regards to the restructuring. As far as Acelity and now you're on to, you're not talking about the GAAP impact, but now from a $0.35 once we exclude the purchase accounting and the transaction and the integration costs, we expect that a large chunk of that's going to be hitting in Q4 right now, all we\u2019ve guided, we expect about $0.15 on a GAAP basis, but on a non-GAAP basis, we're not providing guidance yet. But of that $0.35, we will be seeing that more evenly spread over the next four quarters.","John Inch","Maybe the point is the fourth quarter what how much of the fourth quarter been as Acelity, is that $0.15 of your fourth quarter guidance?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, from a GAAP perspective, it's a $0.15 headwind to us in the fourth quarter and then another $0.10 headwind in the first three quarters of 2020.","Mike Roman","Yes, John that is included in our guidance.","John Inch","Yes, okay. All right, we will work details offline. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Mike Roman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Mike Roman","Hey, good morning, Deane.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, I\u2019d like to circle back. I know inventory has come up multiple times during this call. But maybe you can just clarify the interplay here, you're referring to customer channel inventory adjustments, and we've seen this multiple quarters now you called it out with safety and industrial, just because of lower demand, it gets reflected in your organic revenue growth. So we get that but then, as 3M, you're also taking inventory down.","You did $180 million this quarter, you said there's another $50 million. The interplay between the two, how what inventory you actually taking down is all worth the result of lower customer demand? And then Nick, help us understand the cash flow impact as you liquidate this inventory?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, Deane this is impacting our cash flow positively. And it's the single biggest driver, while you're seeing us increase our estimate of cash flow generation for the full-year, as we're realizing these benefits of reducing inventory within our own walls. Some of that is in response to what we're doing, responding to what we see a lower, lower demand right now.","So that's, that's part of it Deane, but part of it is also that we're seeing opportunities for us to be managing our own supply chain more effectively. And that was part of what we've talked about for the last few years around business transformation. I would say we are starting to see some of that benefit. And that's part of the reason why we have this confidence that we can be bringing down our inventories and improving the cash flow as you're seeing.","Mike Roman","Deane, I would add that and we had a plan coming into the year to take down inventory significantly. And follow on to our go live in the U.S. last year, August. We have built inventory ahead of that. We talked a lot last year about what customers did Q2 to Q3, but we built inventory to manage through that. We didn't take all of that out by the end of 2018 and had a plan to do that in 2019. And so what you're seeing part of significant part of what we're doing is that plan and executing it while we see a slowdown and are having to manage our operations against that slowdown.","Deane Dray","That clarification was very helpful. And just as a follow-up, I know there was some SG&A questions but it also looked like corporate costs came in lower. Was that all, was real estate gains there and then interest also looked lower and what were the dynamics there?","Nick Gangestad","The real estate gain that was all in corporate Deane, you're correct on that. As far as interest expense, the total net interest expense came in slightly lower and this will be the last what I'll say low quarter for a while be and this is part of the $0.15 guide. We're saying on Acelity because late in the quarter we issued more debt and we'll be seeing our interest expense increase in the fourth quarter. So we ran, I would say pretty steady interest expense over the last three quarters, we will be seeing that uptick in going into Q4.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning, guys.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Scott.","Mike Roman","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","Is there any color you can give us an how the rating agencies view the PFAS overhang, do they circle a number around it and that's called one turn of debt or something like that and just, or is it just not? We're just not far along enough along on that yet?","Nick Gangestad","Scott, I described it as I'd say both our rating agencies as well as everything else -- everyone else on the equity side as well is interested in what that that will be, it's something they're watching, and monitoring just as we're monitoring, I'm sure same as your monitoring as well, but there's not a specific thing that I know of that they're building in their estimates for that for our rating.","Scott Davis","Okay, and I have and cycle timing is always tough, but you're taking down inventories now and then, presumably, sometime in 2020 things get better. I mean, is there a top line impact? Do you think missed orders or risk at all in the inventory plan? Or is it just or inventory so high that it's just, it's just not an issue?","Mike Roman","Yes, Scott, I would say, really what I was talking about this, this big part of our inventory actions this year are follow-on to our go-live in the U.S. and that we don't see that impacting our service. That's getting us back to where we should be. And I would say we what I highlighted in EMEA and Canada as we get deployed end-to-end, we actually see additional benefits and we can get more efficient and manage cycle times differently and days of inventory outstanding will go down and service will go up. And so we're seeing that kind of virtuous combination. So I don't nothing we're doing is putting at risk service. And I would say it's a indication that we're moving forward and getting a position to have better service at lower inventories.","Scott Davis","Are the customers holding less inventory to your mind?","Mike Roman","Well, when you go through distribution across a number of our models, they're all getting more efficient, they're driving out structure and cycle time as well. So I think some of what you see in inventory reductions in the channel is just them driving more efficient models. Big part of it this year is the slowdown in the end markets. But in general, I think you're seeing all supply chains get more efficient, at least the ones related to us. We are seeing them get more efficient inside our four walls and then with our channel partners as well.","Scott Davis","Okay, super helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Mike Roman","Good morning, Joe.","Nick Gangestad","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So maybe my first question, just touching on the decremental margins. I think, Nick in your prepared comments, you highlighted the good decremental in safety and industrial. And I'm just trying to figure out the divergence between the decrementals in that business versus the decrementals in the transportation and electronics business. And so any insight that you can provide on either how much of that is either mixed or end-market specific as to as opposed to how those businesses are being run, and how to think about those decremental margins moving forward?","Nick Gangestad","As far as the decrementals between SIBG versus TEBG that I think there's a lot of things in common, Joe actually more than what they're different where they're both seeing volume reductions impacting them as well as taking inventory. And as well as taking inventory out. On the TEBG side, there is also some mixed benefit that's impacting the TEBG numbers a bit more than the SIBG numbers, partly from the geographies in which TEBG sells as well as the businesses where we're seeing the growth versus negative growth this quarter.","Joe Ritchie","So is it is it fair to assume that as things, things stay negative for the next couple of quarters? The decrementals then in the transportation and electronics business should remain kind of at pretty high levels. Whereas, you'll be you'll be able to manage safety and industrial a little bit better?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, over time Joe, as I'm sure you've observed this to TEBG will have higher incrementals and higher decrementals partly given the fixed asset base that we have there that when things are going up, we tend to see a lot more of that fall to the bottom line and when things are going down, we'll see more of that, that flow. So it'll tend, it will follow what's happening with our volumes in the coming quarters Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, fair enough. And then Mike, maybe one question for you, as you kind of think about things on a higher level, not too long ago, you guys performed a strategic review of the Health Information Systems business. I'm just wondering, given what we're seeing in the markets today, is there another thought to kind of look across the portfolio closer to see, if there's any opportunity from a divestiture standpoint?","Mike Roman","Joe, we are always evaluating our portfolio. It's an ongoing process. It's one of the things as we built to become a more active Portfolio Manager, it's really become an active ongoing process and we're focused in that, as I've shared in the past that we're focused on optimizing the value of our portfolio, on an ongoing basis and looking at everything from what we do with our organic investments to where we focus our acquisitions, and what we do with to optimize all parts of our portfolio, including divestitures. And we showed examples, again, where we were, when we identified parts of our portfolio that we could create greater value by divesting them, we're ready to take those actions. So I think it's, I think of it as a very active portfolio pipeline on an ongoing basis and something we top priority for us.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, good morning.","Mike Roman","Hey Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Hey, Nick, could we just go back to the inventory impacts. I think you said 150 and 200 basis points. So was that $150 million, $200 million, please clarify that?","Nick Gangestad","That was 150 to 200 basis points impact based on our year-on-year change in inventory levels and throughput that we're putting to our factories.","Nigel Coe","Yes, okay, can we just dig into that because that implies a $500 million gross margin impacts, just based on the 150 on revenues. And theoretically, that comes back in 2020, as you think about inventories, but it seems like apples for apples, you\u2019re cutting inventory by about $400 million excluding disposals. So I'm just wondering how on earth, it can be as big as that impact just because of the fixed costs absorption. So maybe just kind of clarify that point please.","Nick Gangestad","So Nigel, part of that analysis is looking at how much we built inventories in the third quarter of 2018 compared to how much we reduced inventories in the third quarter of 2019. And in the third quarter of 2018, we were still building inventories fairly substantially. And that's now slipped. So all of that 150 to 200 will not pull forward into 2020 because some of it is a statement on the benefits we were getting in 2018.","Nigel Coe","Got it. Okay, that helps. We'll take it offline on that one as well. And then you kind of alluded to this in the answer to I think Joe's question on the geographic mix location of the sales and you're growing in EMEA, which is your lowest margin regions still, you\u2019re declining heavily in Asia, which is your highest margin, so maybe just address the mix impacts that you\u2019re seeing right now on margins?","Nick Gangestad","Yes, so some of our businesses and that as we look geographically, Asia-Pacific is one of our higher margin places. And EMEA is one of our lower margin places, so geographic mix is having an impact on us. On the EMEA side, you're accurate in saying, it is our lower margin parts of the world. However, I will point out and thanks for bringing that up. We've been on a journey of rate increasing our margins there. And we are very pleased with the progress we've been making in 2019 on our progression to moving our West European margins up to 20%. 2019 has been a substantial step towards reaching that by 2020. And we were highly confident will be there by next year.","Nigel Coe","Got it. And then just one quick one, Nick, on the FX hedge the eight basis points of impact this quarter. How does that evolve going into 2020? Do we flip into a slight negative in 2020 means any views on that?","Nick Gangestad","It depends on whether you're asking about margin or EPS. We continue to have a number of unrealized gains that if currencies stay where they are. We'll see those gains flowing through in the next two years from our hedging. Right now, I'm not willing to say whether I think it's going to be a benefit or not because there's just too much volatility in the FX market to say but if you look at our 10-Q that we\u2019ll be issuing, we lay out here is the amount of unrealized FX hedging gains that we will unwind in the next year or two.","Nigel Coe","Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. Just one last inventory question. On the last call, you reduced inventory by about $70 million more than in Q3, but the margin impact was about 50 basis points less, is there -- is that what just simply because of the year-over-year comparison issue that you're speaking of or is that also because of which business lines you were reducing inventory in?","Nick Gangestad","No, Laurence, it's solely a function of the comp that we're going against in 2018.","Laurence Alexander","Okay, and then just to clarify the 200, 150 to 200 basis points, I think what that Nigel was referring to. I think some of the questions on the call I have framed it has a year, as a full-year impact. Is it a full-year impact or is it just a Q3 impact?","Nick Gangestad","That was just a Q3 comments on the impact it's having on our total margin.","Laurence Alexander","Okay, thank you.","Nick Gangestad","Yes.","Mike Roman","Thanks Laurence.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.","Mike Roman","To wrap up, I am pleased with our team's progress in the third quarter, which demonstrates the strength of the 3M model and our ability to perform across the business cycle. Moving forward, we are focused on delivering greater value for our customers and shareholders building on the momentum from our execution and results in Q3, driving strong cash flow and improving growth.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, October 24, 2017.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Director of Investor Relations at 3M.","Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 business review. On the call today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President, and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Each will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","Before we begin let me remind you of the dates for our future investor events. Please turn to slide 2. First, starting with earnings, our Q4 earnings conference call will be held on January 25. And second, our 2018 outlook meeting will take place in New York City on December 12 from 8 a.m. to noon. Invitations for this event will be sent this afternoon, so please RSVP as soon as possible. We hope to see you there.","Please take a moment to read our forward-looking statement on slide 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.","Please turn to slide 4. And I'll hand the call off to Inge.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Coming off a strong first half, our team delivered an even more robust performance in the third quarter. Organic growth accelerated to 7% with positive growth across all business groups and all geographic areas. We posted record sales and record earnings and did so while continuing to invest for the future.","Let me take you through the highlights. Total sales were $8.2 billion, an all-time high for our enterprise. As I mentioned, we delivered strong broad-based organic growth of 7% led by Electronics & Energy at 13%. Health Care grew 7% organically, followed by 6% growth for both Industrial and Safety & Graphics. Our Consumer business posted organic growth of 2%, its second consecutive quarter of positive growth.","It was also good to see broad-based growth across all geographic areas. This was true in both developed and developing markets, where our long-standing presence, market position, and depth of capabilities enable us to win. Growth in developed market was 4% with 14% growth in developing markets.","With respect to EPS, we increased earnings more than 8% to $2.33 per share, which is a Q3 record. Company-wide we expanded margins to 25% with all business groups above 22%.","Turning to free cash flow, we posted a good conversion rate of 100%. We continue to invest and grow the business while also returning significant cash to our shareholders. And in the quarter we returned $1.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases.","Please turn to slide 5. Beyond financial results, we are continuing to build an enterprise that is positioned for success both today and into the future. This includes executing our three key levers, which are significant value creators.","The first is portfolio management. And earlier this month we finalized our acquisition of Scott Safety. This will complement organic growth and further enhance our position in the fast-growing global personal safety market. At the same time, we completed the sales of the electronic monitoring business, which no longer aligned with our strategic objectives. Portfolio management, a process we have intensified over the last several years, is strengthening our competitiveness and making us more relevant to our customers and the marketplace.","Investing in innovation is the second lever. Research and development is the heartbeat of 3M. It's how we deliver premium value to our customers and premium returns to our shareholders. This is why we continue to invest 6% of sales into research and development, which total $463 million in the quarter.","The third lever is business transformation, which starts and ends with our customers. The deployment of our ERP system remains on track with West Europe nearly complete. We have also started initial deployments in the United States, which you will hear more about at our outlook meeting on December 12.","That concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Thanks, Inge, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 6 with a recap of our third quarter sales performance.","We posted strong organic growth in the quarter of 6.6%, as we continue to outgrow the markets we serve. Selling prices improved sequentially versus second quarter and were flat year on year. Excluding Electronics, price was up 20 basis points, which marks our strongest quarterly pricing performance this year.","The divestiture of nonstrategic businesses over the last 12 months reduced sales in the quarter by 120 basis points. Conversely, foreign currency translation increased sales by 60 basis points. All-in, third quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 6% versus last year.","In the U.S., organic growth was 3.6%, led by a high single digit increase in Health Care and a mid-single-digit increase in Industrial. Our Safety & Graphics and Consumer businesses also delivered positive growth in the quarter.","Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 13% in Q3. All business groups within Asia-Pacific continued to post strong growth in the quarter, including double digit increases in our Electronics & Energy business and in our Safety & Graphics business. Organic growth was 23% in China\/Hong Kong and 5% in Japan. Excluding Electronics, China\/Hong Kong grew in the mid-teens and Japan was up 3%.","Moving to EMEA, organic growth was 4% in Q3 with West Europe up 3%. Both the Safety & Graphics and Industrial businesses led the growth in EMEA.","Finally, Q3 organic growth in Latin America\/Canada was 5%. All businesses posted positive growth with Health Care leading the way, up high single digits. At a country level, Canada delivered strong organic growth of 14%. Mexico was up 5%, while Brazil was flat. We continue to generate broad-based growth across the globe, giving us confidence in raising our full year expectations, which Inge will discuss later.","Please turn to slide 7 for the third quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, third quarter sales were $8.2 billion with net income of $1.4 billion, up 7.5%. On a GAAP basis, third quarter operating margins were 25%, which includes a 60 basis point impact from incremental strategic investments.","Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the third quarter. Gains from organic volume growth and productivity contributed 90 basis points to operating margins. Our continued focus on portfolio management is strengthening our enterprise in many ways, including margins, which improved by 40 basis points due to the exit of nonstrategic businesses. The combination of lower raw material costs and selling price changes added another 30 basis points. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts brought margins down 40 basis points in the quarter. And higher year-on-year pension and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points.","Let's now turn to slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Third quarter GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share, up 8.4% year over year. This result includes a $0.06 impact from incremental strategic investments.","The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.23 per share to Q3 earnings. Organic growth was the predominant driver along with raw material benefits and the continued positive impact business transformation is having on our productivity efforts.","Acquisitions and divestitures added a penny to earnings year over year. Foreign currency net of hedging reduced earnings by $0.03 a share. And the slightly lower tax rate was a $0.01 benefit. Finally, lower shares outstanding net of higher interest expense was a $0.02 benefit to EPS.","Please turn to slide 9 for a look at cash flow. We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company, which allows us to consistently invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. Third quarter free cash flow was $1.4 billion with a conversion rate of 100%. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 100%.","Turning to CapEx, we continue to be encouraged by the numerous opportunities to invest in both growth and disruptive technologies. Third quarter capital expenditures were $325 million. And we expect these investments to be approximately $1.4 billion for the year.","In addition to investing in our businesses, we returned significant cash to shareholders in Q3, including $701 million in dividends, up $31 million. We also returned $380 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases, or $1.6 billion year to date. We now expect full year repurchases to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion versus $2 billion to $3.5 billion previously.","Let's now review our performance by business group. Please turn to slide 10. Industrial, our largest business group, continued its strong growth, up 6.1% organically in the third quarter. Industrial's growth was once again broad-based across all geographic areas and all businesses.","Our Heartland businesses within Industrial \u2013 namely industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives, and automotive aftermarket \u2013 all delivered mid-single digit growth in the quarter. Our auto OEM business was up 6%, outpacing global car and light truck builds by approximately 400 basis points, as we continue to drive increased penetration on the automotive OEM platforms across the globe.","Finally, advanced materials led the way with mid-teens growth in the quarter with strong performance across its portfolio, while also benefiting from favorable year-on-year comps.","On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a high single digit increase in Asia-Pacific, while all other areas grew mid-single digits.","Industrial delivered third quarter operating income of $614 million with an operating margin of 22.2%. Adjusting for incremental strategic investments, operating margins were 22.6%, a 110 basis point improvement from Q2 levels.","Please turn to slide 11. Third quarter Safety & Graphics sales grew 6% organically. Growth was led by our personal safety business, which accelerated to double digit growth in the quarter. We continue to experience strong demand for our personal safety solutions and look to build on this strength with the integration of Scott Safety starting here in the fourth quarter.","Our roofing granules business grew solidly, up mid-single digits on top of a tough year-on-year comp.","Lastly, transportation safety posted positive organic growth in Q3, as we continue to evolve its portfolio with the sale of the electronic monitoring business earlier this month.","Geographically, Safety & Graphics grew organically across all areas, led by an 11% increase in Asia-Pacific and an 8% increase in EMEA.","Third quarter profits in Safety & Graphics were up 11% year on year to $410 million with operating margins of nearly 27%.","Please turn to slide 12. Our Health Care business in the third quarter grew 6.9% organically. Health Care delivered broad-based growth across all businesses and geographies. Our medical consumables business, which is our largest segment within Health Care, posted high single digit growth, as worldwide demand for 3M's products and solutions remains strong.","Oral care delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter, as we continued to deliver strong international growth, particularly in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and West Europe.","Organic growth in Health Care was led by a double digit increase in our drug delivery business.","Geographically, organic growth was led by high single digit growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America\/Canada, and the U.S. We saw notable strength in Health Care across developing markets, particularly in China\/Hong Kong, which was up double digits in the quarter.","Health Care's operating income was $471 million and operating margins were 31.9%.","Please turn to slide 13. Electronics & Energy third quarter organic sales growth was up 13% and is up 11% year to date. We are on track to deliver 10% organic growth for the year.","This business continues to benefit from our portfolio management efforts over the past few years to streamline the business, enhance customer relevance, and drive improved efficiencies.","The Electronics side of the business grew 18% organically, as our team continued to increase penetration on many OEM platforms globally, including semiconductor manufacturing, electronic assembly, data centers, and automotive electrification.","Our Energy related businesses were up 2% organically with electrical markets up mid-single digits, partially offset by a decline in telecom.","On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 20% increase in Asia-Pacific, while Latin America\/Canada and EMEA also delivered positive growth.","Third quarter operating income for Electronics & Energy was $394 million with operating margins of 27.9%.","Please turn to slide 14. Third quarter sales in Consumer grew organically 1.9%, which was a continued improvement versus recent quarters. We saw positive organic growth in three of our four Consumer businesses, namely home improvement, home care, and consumer health care, while stationery and office declined.","Category defining brands in Consumer continue to be a strength for 3M. We delivered strong double digit growth in both Command damage-free mounting products and ScotchBlue painters tape. Filtrete home filtration products grew mid-single digits globally.","Geographically, organic growth in Consumer was led by Asia-Pacific, up high single digits, while Latin America\/Canada and the U.S. also delivered positive growth.","Finally, operating income was $307 million with an operating margin of 24.8%. Adjusting for strategic investments year on year, operating margins were nearly 26%.","Please turn to slide 15. Before turning the call back over to Inge, I want to cover a few items that will impact the fourth quarter. First, the completed divestiture of the electronic monitoring business is expected to have a net positive impact of $0.12 to earnings in Q4. Second, the Scott Safety income, net of acquisition and integration costs, is expected to reduce earnings per share by $0.08. Third, we recently closed a debt tender offer to retire some of our higher coupon debt. This will result in a nonoperating charge estimated to be an $0.11 impact to earnings per share in the fourth quarter. Lastly, as we have discussed throughout the year, we plan to continue to take actions in Q4 to strengthen our portfolio and better optimize our footprint. We estimate that these incremental investments will negatively impact fourth quarter per share earnings by approximately $0.06 to $0.10.","Please turn to slide 16. And I will now turn the call back over to Inge. Inge?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you, Nick. As I look across our enterprise, I am very pleased with our performance in the quarter and throughout the year. As a result, today we are increasing our expectation for 2017 in terms of both organic growth and earnings per share. We now anticipate organic growth of 4% to 5% versus a prior range of 3% to 5%.","With respect to EPS, we expect earnings of $9 to $9.10 per share, versus a prior range of $8.80 to $9.05. This is a 10% to 12% increase year on year. And as you can see, we continue to expect strong performance in terms of both return on invested capital and free cash flow conversion.","With that I thank you for your attention. And we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Please limit your participation to one question and one follow up. One moment, please, while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning.","Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.","Morning.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Morning, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question, sort of a top-down question. Top-line growth 6.6%. As you think, this economic environment, right, and as you overlay it over your longer term framework, would you describe current economic environment as average relative to your five-year framework? Above average? And from that perspective, I'm just trying to think, if 6.6% is something we can expect to achieve in this environment? Or is that a one off?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Well, first of all, good morning. I think to talk about the five-year plan is maybe difficult, and that's the frame you put it into. But I will say that it's maybe on the high end versus what we thought when we lay out the plan originally as we stand.","You can also see that we have a range now that we move from. We've gone from 2% to 5%, then 3% to 5%. Now we are 4% to 5% for the year. And we have very high confidence as we move into 2018, which we will talk more about on December 12 in New York.","But I will say that generally speaking, the execution of our commercialization programs are going very well for us. And it's broad-based, which is very, very good. So I think it's \u2013 I think about 4% to 5% for the remainder of this year. I would think more about on the high end of the 4% to 5%.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Terrific. And just a follow-up question. On the Electronics growth, that has been very good. Can you just give us a little bit more color what specifically drives it? And I'm just trying to understand how much of it, sort of increased content in mobile devices, particularly on adhesives. Or your participation in the Asian semiconductor cycle, if you could separate those two sources of growth. Thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yes. Well, first of all, I think always on Electronics & Energy as a business group, we have, yes, to take a step back and really understand what we have done from a portfolio perspective. And that is something that we all see as we take actions. What is not so visible if you're not right in the industry day by day is also how we have shifted and accelerated some investment to faster growing segments. So I think that's an important element for us to think about.","Now on the platform for consumer electronics, we are very global. So for us, we are adding penetration on a global base in most of those devices. And it's going very fast. I will say specifically on the China OEM in terms of the pickup. And if you think about that, demand there for performance, quality, and functionality is exactly what we are all about. So that means that we are growing very fast on those platforms. So we are doing better there than we had estimated, which is a positive things.","I think also in terms of growth, semiconductor, of course, we are part of that growth. And I will also say the shift in terms of us focusing more now versus three years ago on data centers, on automotive electrification, on energy grids is driving this growth.","So if you think about it, just to give you facts, the base where we came from was a market that had a size of $60 billion, that had a growth of 1% to 3%. We're continuing there. But we have shifted during the last couple of years to market size that are $12 billion but have a growth rate to 10% to 15%. So I think that is the answer to what we are doing there. And I would say there the fact that the growth is coming, the margin are expanding, we are more relevant to our customer, is a big credit to that business group of what they have been doing.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But that would imply that Electronics growth is sustainable into 2018 as well, because these are structural drivers.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah, I think so. It is. It is. But again, when you have technology conversion, you can have ups and downs in between quarters. But if you look upon the total business, we will continue to do well.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.","Morning, Julian.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Hey, Julian.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Morning. Maybe just a first question around strategic investments. I think previously you talked about that being a step-up year on year of $0.20, $0.25 in the second half. Now it's looking somewhat less than that based on your guidance. Maybe just give some background as to why that's happening. Is it just a pushout into 2018? And what kind of returns? How are returns on that investment to date coming through?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yes, Julian, thanks for that question. I would call what we're doing in the third quarter as a really good example of our business model in action, where we have good organic growth, strong margins. And at the same time we're taking actions to position 3M for future success.","As you mentioned, earlier this year we announced we expected to incur between $0.60 and $0.65 of strategic investments for the full year. And we're tracking right in that range. And those strategic investments include things we talked about at the beginning of the year for core growth platforms, but also actions to be improving our footprint and addressing our portfolio. All of that part of the 4% to 5% organic growth outlook we now are seeing for this year.","We are making good progress on that in 2017 to better optimize our manufacturing supply chain footprint. And I'd point you back, Julian, to what we laid out when we \u2013 in March of 2016, about a plan to be investing between $500 million and $600 million over the course of a few years to ultimately generate $125 million to $175 million in annual benefits by 2020.","So for the full year 2017, that $0.60 to $0.65 range does include the charge related to the debt tender that we'll be incurring in the fourth quarter. That has been part of our thinking. And we closed that tender in October, hence that charge coming in Q4.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Understood. Thank you. And then just my second question, price and raw materials in your operating margin bridge slightly picked up, a slightly larger tailwind in Q3 than in Q2. Within that, how much was the sort of raw materials portion? And do you view your current pricing trends as sustainable from here?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Most of that 30 basis points, Julian, is coming from raw materials. The pricing, as I mentioned for the total company, flat, or if I exclude Electronics, up 20 basis points. We're seeing that core underlying price growth growing as the year goes on, excluding the Electronics. So we're seeing Q3 as a quarter where our price strengthened.","But the majority of that 30 basis points is coming from raw materials. And let me just elaborate a little more on that, Julian. The core underlying market we're facing for raw materials is certainly toughening. We are not seeing the underlying market creating that 30 basis points of benefit.","That 30 basis points of benefit that we see hitting our financials is the result of work and projects that we're doing to take out raw material costs and the prices we're paying. So example, raw material substitutions or product reformulations to take out those raw material costs. That's the biggest thing driving that 30 basis points you're seeing.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Steve.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Really, really good quarter.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just following up on the Electronics commentary. You guided to kind of 10% for the year. I guess that implies, just making sure I get my math right here, that implies kind of 4Q at up high singles, kind of 7% to 8%. Is that correct from an organic perspective?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yes, Steve. Your math's pretty sound there.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess you talked about it as sustainable. I mean you're not saying that the double digit is sustainable obviously. I mean, semiconductor sales this year are up pretty solidly double digits. So it's not quite a surprise you guys are kind of doing well there.","So when you say it's sustainable, do you mean relative to kind of an index of the devices you're on? Or within the range that you talked about? Kind of the trend line rate of that business over the last several years, it's just been more like mid-single digits? What did you kind of mean by sustainable?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","So, Steve, when we say sustainable for Electronics & Energy and the opportunities that we see there, we continue to see opportunities for penetration in consumer electronics. As Inge mentioned earlier, we continue to evolve our technologies to grow our relevance in consumer electronics.","But even more importantly, we're repositioning our portfolio to be going after faster growing market opportunities in Electronics & Energy. And those are places where we're seeing the results of our actions paying off, where we're seeing growth occurring there. Places like automobile electrification.","So Inge said a few minutes ago, we'll always see some ups and downs based on what's happening with underlying consumer demand for electronics. But the \u2013 what you're seeing now is our business model really working, of us going after the higher growth markets.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one more question just on kind of the investments and margins and how that's playing through. R&D was a little bit light. And anything going on there? I guess you're just kind of repurposing investments to more kind of commercial type of things? Is that how we should think about it?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. Well, there's nothing going on. As you know, we have made a commitment to increase investment in research and development from 5.5% historically, closer to 6%. We are normally just running at 6%, so it's nothing abnormal going on there.","But it's not the move to commercialization from those activities. We are very committed to research and development. And for us, science, technology, and sustainability is key driver for us as we move forward and as have been in the past. So there is no shift from R&D to commercialization.","Commercialization, that's where we invested those additional $104 million for the year, when we expected 50 basis point to 100 basis point growth. And as you see, it's coming. So we're very pleased with that.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Yeah. Great quarter. Congratulations. Thanks.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you, Steve.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Morning, Andrew.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You had an easier growth comparison in Health Care, but the acceleration in growth really is notable. I know you've been saying that you expect second half acceleration. But can you talk about whether this is simply your previous growth spending now really impacting the business? Or did you see an acceleration in Health Care markets? And can you talk about the sustainability of mid-single digit growth in this business moving forward?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yes. First of all, we have invested for quite some time in Health Care. And I think for Health Care specifically was the first business where we made additional investment that we broad based called core search. And that's paying off.","And a lot of those investment was of course in developing economies. And we can see broad based that that's paying off. And we had \u2013 in the developing economy for the quarter, Health Care grew 12%, but they also grew in developed 6%. So our base is very strong in developed, specifically in United States and in West Europe. And we continue to grow very, very well there.","And then you can see that the developing economy is coming as we planned. So I will say when we have talked about the range of 4% to 6%, that's a realistic plan. And then we will be in that range as we move forward. I have no doubt about that.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. That's helpful. And then...","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Hey, Andrew, excuse me. I'll just add one thing. For the year, we're guiding Health Care 3% to 5%. And with the results we're about 4% growth through the first nine months of the year. We see ourselves solidly in the 3% to 5% range for 2017.","Now and of course in the longer term, as Inge was just mentioning, the 4% to 6% is how we see growth in that business.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks for that, Nick. And then my follow-up is just on pricing again. You talked about U.S. pricing getting back closer to flat for the year, Nick, last quarter, which it does appear to be doing. But how much of the better pricing performance in the U.S. was 3M pulling back on rebating or discounting, versus just stronger overall Industrial and Consumer markets helping you? And do you think it's possible to get back to positive pricing in the U.S. in 2018?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. Andrew, we have been seeing slight incremental improvements in pricing in the U.S. And we continue to see that improving into the future. I wouldn't call it any kind of pullback on our part that's causing that to happen. It's in \u2013 it's a pricing environment where we see our business model, one where we have increased ability for price growth there.","As far as 2018, I'm not ready to declare an up or down on that one. We'll talk more about that on December 12.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Nice quarter.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. I will echo the xylophone of a solid, strong quarter. In any event \u2013 and I want to follow up on the pricing question as well. I mean obviously, you've been fairly contrite about perhaps not getting as much price as you wanted to get in the back half \u2013 or excuse me, the beginning part of the year. And you talked about catching up on that. And you've cited the 20 basis points. But could you talk maybe a little bit just structurally how you're thinking about your businesses? Where you think you're going to see pricing pressure over the next two years to three years?","Obviously, the debate around kind of what is much more perceived as lending itself to transparency around Consumer, Industrial. And then kind of the rubber is meeting the road in Safety. But could you talk about where your moats are? And how you're feeling about it? Just maybe not in the context of what is a very strong kind of third quarter, fourth quarter right now, but just structurally down the road.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. Well, you should think about 3M as the price leader in most, if not all, categories we are in. And if you look \u2013 if you think about that historically and as we move ahead, it's very much based on our scientifically based business model.","So for us, if you think about the new products, the new solution that we are providing, it's all in order to drive improved productivity and\/or efficiency for our customers. Our business model is about understanding our customers' business model.","We are by definition not a commoditized company. So we don't go in and fight on businesses where price is the primary discussion. We try to go in and make things different versus just making them better. So you do things better. But where the real value is when you do it different. That's also the time when you can drive price.","So there is \u2013 and as you can see, our commitment to science, technology, and sustainability is continuing that wave forward. And you have also seen the portfolio work we have done here the last three years, four years, five years have been businesses that are more commoditized. We don't think that we can add as much value to them versus other companies. That's also why they have exited our portfolio.","So I would say that there will be no change moving forward relative to our strategy around pricing. Now again, as you know and we know, things in between quarters can change slightly. But there is no big change relative to our strategy around pricing. It's very, very important for us. And it's important due to the fact it's part of our business model.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Could \u2013 as a follow up maybe you could just talk about obviously the messaging for kind of your growth initiatives and continued commercialization. I suppose your outlook meeting will be around electrification. But could you talk about and maybe take it from the top for the portfolio where you see the most opportunities? And how we should be thinking about kind of quantifying what the longer term opportunity around electrification is?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Are you talking electrification, specifically?","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, for autos.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah, of course. If you think about that in terms of the mega trends and what we can do, we have three elements into that area specifically. We are very strong in automotive. We have showed that over time. We are outperforming automotive build quarter after quarter and year after year and within this quarter as well. So our connection into automotive is very strong. We have a strong technology platform in our Electronic & Energy that we then utilize through those contacts in order to build our platforms.","And then the other thing that is easy to forget is that we are a global leader in traffic safety. And if you take those elements together, traffic safety, automotive electrification, and pull them together, that's exactly where the trends are going. And there is big platform for us to capitalize as we move ahead.","So think about it in that perspective of I will say a certain thing that will \u2013 you and I will see today as we drive our cars. But also things that would come relative to the evolution of road safety in the automotive space.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for squeezing me in.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Hey, Scott.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Hey, Scott.","Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.","Scott.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Welcome back.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Thank you. It's nice to be back. Appreciate it. Inge, you finally seemed to crack the code on China. That was a region that was tough for you guys for a while. And boy, you've had a couple pretty good years there. I mean what do you attribute most of the success? I mean I know you mentioned some of this earlier in the call. But have you changed up your sales and marketing? Does it just take time to get brand awareness? And is it pricing strategy? I mean what outside of Electronics, obviously.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","But if you could just talk through that.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","So first of all, we've been in China for a long time as you know. I think we started our wholly owned subsidiary there in 1984 and have made investment over time. And we have good capabilities in terms of manufacturing there. And we have also a good research and development center there.","Now it looked like \u2013 and as we had talked about before, that being there is not a shift. But there have been additional investment in China for what we would call domestic markets. So that will for us then benefit Health Care and Consumer specifically.","And I think what is happening as we speak is that the consumers in there and the OEMs, they're becoming more demanding on performance, on quality, and functionality and brands. And that is going right into our business model in order for us to be more relevant. So we are capitalizing on that.","We have also made additional investment in the domestic markets. Right? So you think about it in terms of everything that is produced and commercialized there. And we grow two times GDP and IPI (43:54) in the last couple of quarters.","And we have shifted a portfolio to more Safety also in Health Care. So that's helping us in addition our own initiative. So that's type of, I would say, Chinese mega trends if you like. And then we, in addition, have made a lot of efforts on air quality, water quality, and automotive electrification.","So you take that together, growth are coming. And it's very nice to see. So I think it's a focus, a presence and a focus, a commitment under the long term that now has start to pay off I think very much because of demanding for performance, quality, and functionality.","And then as you say, brands are becoming more and more important. If you take air quality in China, it's equal to 3M. 3M stands for air quality in China. So that's actually our brand in China. And if you travel into China and you do some interviews, they will like to talk about respiratory products, about our things in filtration, et cetera. So I think it's coming back to brand awareness and the quality and functionality we're able to provide in the country.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","That makes sense. And just to follow up on that, I mean one of the things you've been doing, Inge, is trying to get more locally designed products in each of the regions.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Whether it be U.S., Europe, Asia, Latin America, and you've taken R&D up as a total spend, not just as a percent spend. But your revenues have grown, so you've taken it up meaningfully as a total spend. And how do you manage that structure, whereby you make sure you don't have guys working on duplicate projects? For air quality, for example, you've got guys in China working on new developments. And at the same time you've got guys in the U.S. working on the same things. I mean how do you really manage that complexity?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Well, we have our Senior Vice President from Research and Development that are managing the overall structure relative to how we do things. And there is very little duplication.","And if you think about the science based off it, research and development, you think about research, there is four centers around the world that are doing the research. There's only four of them. Then you have \u2013 locally you will have capabilities for development. And that's a combination of the local business and the global division in order to manage that. So there is not duplication.","And some time \u2013 to be honest, some time you can see duplication. But it's very, very seldom. And I think the advantage for us is sometime when someone is on something and find a solution for local market, we can replicate that other places. So will there be duplication sometime? Yes, I'm sure there will. But it's not much at all. And I think the evidence is there in terms of the outcome or the result.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Excellent. Keep up the good work, guys. Thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Take care.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Morning, John.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. Morning, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Morning, Inge. So can we talk about investment spending in the quarter? I guess I thought you were going to be doing about $100 million. And you did $48 million. But maybe that was $100 million over two quarters. Maybe Nick could \u2013 what's going on there?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. For the total year we're on track for the total investment spending. We ended up having $40 million, mid-$40 million for investment spending for the third quarter. It's roughly a 50\/50 mix of some of our footprint actions and the accelerated growth investments.","And we're continuing to execute that plan. It's going according to the expectations we had for how this would play out for 2017. So I see it tracking just as we've planned it for the year.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, Nick, you didn't spend less than you had planned in the third quarter? And that's coming through in the fourth quarter? Or no?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","In the fourth quarter we expect that to go up slightly to now to be \u2013 I can \u2013 I'll put in cents, earnings per share terms. That'll be $0.06 to $0.10 or roughly $70 million to $110 million of total incremental strategic investments. That will be more heavily focused on footprint than on growth. Because on the growth side, John, we're starting to lap ourselves with some of the growth investments that we started later in 2016.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay so $70 million to $100 million. That's incremental year over year, correct? That's...","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","That is correct, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It looks like inventory and receivables sort of sequentially as a function of sales maybe have moved up a little bit. Is that \u2013 I'm presuming that's, as a short cycle company, this is a response to channel fill. What is that? Is that new products that you're pushing through? Or is that actual pull-thorough from it could be a variety of sources. You're obviously a giant company, so it's hard to sort of parse that out. But what in fact is going on there? Is that just reflective of the global economy actually picking up?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. There is part of that that's the economy. So from an accounts receivable perspective, certainly our growth is the biggest driver of where we're seeing accounts receivable balances going up.","On the inventory, that's also a function of the growth. The only thing on top of that I'd add is in the case of our business transformation effort, as we prepare to go-lives in different geographies around the world, one of the things we typically do is build some inventory in advance for our customers to ensure we can have an undisrupted supply chain for them. That's a little bit of what we're seeing right now.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","But I think important, John, is there is no channel fill by definition. We don't see anything in the channels that is abnormal for us. So I think that's important to put in place as well.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, if anything to your point, Inge, Consumer should have actually have had channel down fill, right? So is that still going on? And what was price in Consumer by the way?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","We don't typically put our price out by business group. And in the case of channel in the U.S., in the office supply channel we are continuing to see contraction there. Just not at the same level that we were seeing in the first half of this year, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I'll just ask one more, because that electrification of vehicle thing took up 17 questions. Gross margins, why were they down again this year for the first three quarters versus last year? Like, what's ultimately going on in the gross margin complexion of 3M today based on your businesses, you're spending versus last year? Why are they down? And do you think they will actually start to pick back up? Or is this all going to be about the OpEx management?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","John, I think you must be looking at our gross margin on an all-in published basis.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I am, yeah.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Part of what we've been doing this year is we have been doing a number of these supply chain footprint actions. Those costs are impacting our gross margin. When we strip that out, we are continuing to see slightly improving gross margins for 3M.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And that \u2013 when does that alleviate, Nick? When do you start to look at kind of a trend up on an all-in?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","In terms of our view on supply chain footprint actions, we originally laid out a year and a half ago that we expect between $500 million and $600 million of investments. We have done the majority, more than half of that, in 2017. So there will still be some footprint action expenses that we see in 2018. It will just be on a lower base than \u2013 a lower level than what we've seen in 2017. So it'll flip to become a tailwind for us from a margin perspective in 2018.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Morning, Joe.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So maybe touching on organic growth, clearly, really nice quarter and good acceleration. I guess if you look at the fourth quarter kind of implied guidance of call it like roughly 3.5% to 4%, a little bit of a deceleration, still good growth. But I'm just wondering like maybe you guys can comment on exit rates through the quarter and whether you're seeing anything interesting in the current rates.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Joe, in terms of trends that we saw throughout the third quarter and continuing into the first three weeks of the fourth quarter, we're seeing no change in trend. What you may be noticing in our guidance for the year is the fourth quarter will be our toughest comp for the entire year. But we're seeing no underlying deceleration in the trajectory of our sales revenue.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And maybe following on there, Nick, as the quarter progressed, was there any change throughout the quarter? Or was the quarter just pretty even throughout?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Joe, it was pretty strong throughout the quarter. There was no discernible trend between the different weeks or months of the third quarter. It was very even and strong throughout the quarter.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Great. And then maybe just shifting gears a little bit to capital allocation. Clearly Safety & Graphics over the last couple years has been an area where you guys have invested. Looks like you're taking down the buyback a little bit this year. I'm just wondering as you're thinking about M&A across the portfolio, perhaps maybe prioritize where you think you guys should be putting your M&A dollars moving forward?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Well, I think first of all, the pipeline for all businesses is very good. And as you correctly have illustrated it, we have done acquisitions in Safety & Graphics specifically but also in Health Care, even if they have been smaller. I'm now talking the last couple of years.","I think Safety & Graphics as a business group now, we had Capital Safety added in and now Scott Safety coming on the base that we have for our very strong franchise in personal safety. We're in a good position there to continue to accelerate that growth. And I would say that we have interest in all five business groups in order to do some additional thing. But as I said, we have now to make sure in Safety & Graphics that we focused everything in order to execute the implementation and integration of those businesses.","But more than that, we are open to see where we can add businesses, that is strategically important for us and that are aligned with our four fundamental strengths, which is technologies, manufacturing capabilities, geographic reach, and brand equity. So if we can drive a faster return and fast return for ourself to those four fundamentals, and they are in a strategically good position in our portfolio, we are very interested.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Inge, maybe how much of a limiting factor right now is valuation?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","I think always there \u2013 it's not now. There's always \u2013 whenever you talk about that, there is always a limitation to it. Right? There's \u2013 and I think it's important for you to really decide on where would you like to make it strategically. Right? So you can see some of the acquisitions we have made, we have looked upon the real value it can add to use. And then we have paid for it. Right?","We are \u2013 in my mind we are world-class company. We are interested to buy world-class companies that we can integrate and drive forward. So then you need to pay a little bit more, but not too much.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of UBS. Please proceed.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Hey, Steve.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Hi, Steven.","Bruce Jermeland - 3M Co.","Morning, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Hey. I'll just \u2013 I'll keep it to two questions. The first one, Inge, you know 3M has faced I think a lot of skepticism around its ability to hold Health Care operating margin over time. So far you've proven that skepticism wrong. And as we're facing yet another sort of high level margin before the strategic investment for the quarter. So maybe comment a little bit on the pressures in Health Care globally? And how you're withstanding that? And your conviction going forward in the business' ability to continue to do that over time.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah, I think you're right. That, first of all, we've been in this business for a long time. It's a very attractive business to be in for reasons that we all know. The aging population trend, et cetera.","I think the important thing is that you're able to provide at least two things. One is a benefit for the patient. And second, a benefit for the provider. And our portfolio is still right into those two things. That is what we do. And when you can add value even in an area like Health Care, which is very different than Industrial, you will be able to win in those segments.","I don't know if you know, but I know that I was part, myself, of Health Care back in Europe in the early 1990s, 1991 to 1995 specifically. And there was a lot of pressure then through the German health care act. And what we had to do then was just, again, to prove the value for patients and for the provider and ourself, to be very efficient in the model in terms of manufacturing capabilities and logistics. And that's what we are doing.","So when you look upon that specific business in terms of our growth rate, our margins, our cost of goods sold on SG&A, it's almost a perfect model for how you should do business in my mind. And you look upon that and you compare that to Safety & Graphics, they are soon at the same point. Not as high margins, but you can see the growth rate and very respectable margins of 25 plus percentage.","It's again businesses that are regulated, it's about safety, it's about making sure that the patient or the worker always get the best. And people pay for that.","And if you see Health Care, the acceleration we had in developing economy was 12%. The issue in developing economy is never quality, it's money. And as soon as the money is becoming available, 3M is one of the first products they will purchase into the system, based on key opinion leaders around the world writing papers of what is the best outcome in the treatment for patients.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, on I think a question also that you've tackled repeatedly. But given once again the strength in the quarter that's showing up, any thoughts going forward about revisiting taking on incremental leverage for growth investments going forward? You're I think below one time net debt to EBITDA?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah, Steve, you know our guidance of what we laid out for leverage over the course of five years. That we expect to add between $10 billion and $15 billion of leverage over that time. We've made progress in 2016 and progress on that in 2017 on that path. There's nothing changing on that front of seeing the capacity we have for adding that leverage.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, gents.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Morning.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'll keep it \u2013 covered a lot of ground, so I'll keep this very brief. So we've tackled the question on sustainability of organic sales. And obviously your 4Q guidance doesn't assume it continues. But I'm just trying to understand what caused the acceleration. And I know that there was some timing differences on days in 2Q. But do you have any intelligence in terms of the broad portfolio in terms of sell-in versus sell-through? I know in Consumer you got good data. But what about more broadly in Industrial and Health Care channels, sell-in versus sell-through. And were there any pricing increases or rebate concessions that maybe might have distorted the course? Or was this really just good end market demand?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","This is good commercialization and market demand that we capitalize on. On sell-in and sell-out is often talked about relative to the retail and consumer lines. And there was no difference in this quarter for us relative to sell-out and very much the same in terms of sell-in as well, specifically in the office supply channel.","But there is nothing here in terms of us pushing something into the system in terms of any specific activities. As and I said earlier, we \u2013 our business model is around creating value for the end customer and for the OEMs in the industry. So there is nothing else here that is pushing the growth up.","And as you can see, it's broad based. If you think about we have EEBG [Electronics & Energy business group] of 13%. We have Health Care of 7%; IBG [Industrial business group] and Safety\/Graphic at 6%. And then Consumer, 2%.","And you look upon geographically, APAC, 13%. And if you take out Electronics, it's still 8%. And then you have Latin America\/Canada at 5%, United States, 4%, and Europe\/Middle East\/Africa, 4%. So it's broad based and it's all businesses, which is very, very encouraging for us.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","No. No question. That's great detail. Thanks, Inge. And then on \u2013 Nick, on the raws, the $0.03 of benefit in 3Q. Obviously great job by the team. What does your plan embed for 4Q, just given the inflation we've seen post hurricane?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","And, Nigel, could you repeat that, the $0.03 benefit from what?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Raw materials.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","From raw materials. Yeah. We think that will \u2013 we think that will be flat to some benefit for us in Q4 and probably a little bit of a mixed dynamic there. As I said, we've seen pricing continuing to benefit. So from a price raw material, I think we'll still see increasing benefit from our selling prices.","On the raw material benefit, we continue to see that as a tougher and tougher comp for us. Up until now, it's been offset by the projects we're doing, as I mentioned earlier. That will likely sustain. But I wouldn't be surprised if the benefit from that came \u2013 the net benefit came down slightly in the fourth quarter.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Good morning, Deane.","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Hey, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. I know we're into overtime here, so I'll keep it to one question. Can you talk about oral care in the U.S.? And how were you impacted by the ongoing distributor changes that's been causing stocking and restocking? And might you have picked up any more market share during this commotion?","Nicholas C. Gangestad - 3M Co.","Yeah. Deane, I wouldn't say that we're in a position where we're declaring that we've picked up market share in the recent months or quarters. I would say this is a strong global business for us. And we are \u2013 we see lots of demand for our oral care solutions around the globe.","The U.S. is down slightly in our oral care business. And it's a business where we haven't seen quite the channel fluctuations that you might be talking about. It's been pretty stable for us. The biggest driver for us in our oral care business is our demand in emerging markets and other parts of the world.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Hello, Mr. Alexander? Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","So good morning, guys. So two quick ones if I may.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","The soft spots in your business, the stationery and the office and the commercial solutions in the safety and protection.","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","To what extent are those still core? Or how do they fit in the macro driven, mega trend driven, science-based growth that you were describing earlier?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And secondly, what are your criteria for adding new materials to your 46 technology platforms?","Inge G. Thulin - 3M Co.","Yeah. Well, if you \u2013 relative to the two divisions, if you start with the division in Safety & Graphics, that's a division that have a very strong precision with films that is one of our core technologies. If that is \u2013 in this case, is film for decoration, for brand equity building, but it's also the same type of I will say equipment and asset we are using for all our light management businesses. So that's a business that is very strong for us.","And if you look upon the underlaying capabilities in order to produce those product, that's core to 3M. So there is no question around that business. And there is no question about office and supply either. That is where you have the Post-it. That's where we have the Scotch Tape, et cetera. So those are brand equity big businesses that we earn good money with. And our customers are on very, very good margins with them as well.","So if you think about that from a perspective, also those businesses in stationery products, they are based on technologies that are very solid for 3M as an enterprise. So there is not even a question relative if they belong to 3M or not. So that's that answer.","In terms of building out technology platforms, we have 46 as you said. In some cases, if we need to build out something, we will look upon that. And I think the latest \u2013 we have a couple of them during the last couple of years. One is the ceramic business, where we bought one company that in fact had a defense business of around $450 million. So we purchased that. What we really purchased was actually a technology platform that we'll deepen and broaden what we already had ourself in the ceramic. And that that could be used for many, many, many divisions.","And we did one in Lebrona (1:09:00) that is a filter capabilities that we built into filtration and non-woven (1:09:07) capabilities, et cetera.","So if we see a need to add something that we not can do our self or take too long time for us, we will go out and look for that. But again it's built on the demand from the market and where the market going for the future. It's not us sitting internally and look upon what we are doing and, yes, try to see what we should add.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call.

With me today are Mike Roman, 3M\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and Nick Gangestad, our Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Nick will make some formal comments and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","Please note that today\u2019s earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com under the heading, Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2.","Before we begin, let me remind you of the dates for our 2019 quarterly earnings conference calls, which will be held on April 25, July 25, and October 24. ","Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During today\u2019s conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M\u2019s future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and press release.","Please turn to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike. Mike?","Michael Roman","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I will open with a brief summary of our fourth quarter and later in the call, I will come back to discuss our full-year performance along with our outlook for 2019.","3M executed well in the fourth quarter with results that were in line with our expectations. We delivered organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas, along with a double-digit increase in both cash flow and adjusted earnings.","Looking at the numbers, total sales in the quarter were $7.9 billion. We posted organic growth of 3%, which is on top of 6% growth in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Growth was led by our healthcare business group, which grew 5% organically, along with electronics and energy, which grew 4%. ","With respect to EPS, our team delivered adjusted earnings of $2.31 per share, up 10% year over year. This includes a $0.02 net benefit from a divestiture which Nick will cover in more detail.","The strength of our value model is enabling us to consistently generate premium margins and healthy cash flow. Margins in the quarter were more than 22% with all of our business groups above 21%. Cash flow increased by 23% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 128%. Finally, in the fourth quarter we returned $2.1 billion to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","That concludes my opening comments. I will now turn the call over to Nick, who will take us through the details of the quarter. Nick?","Nicholas Gangestad","Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. ","Organic sales growth in the fourth quarter was 3% with volumes up 160 basis points and selling prices up 140 basis points. The communication markets divestiture reduced sales by 1.3 percentage points while foreign currency translation was an additional 2.3 percentage point headwind to sales. All in, fourth quarter sales in U.S. dollars declined 60 basis points versus last year.","Geographically, the U.S. grew 4.4% organically with broad-based growth across all business groups. Latin America-Canada was up 5% organically with broad-based growth across Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. Asia Pacific grew organically 2% in Q4, led by double-digit increase in healthcare and mid-single-digit growth in electronics and energy. Organic growth was up 1% in China-Hong Kong versus 18% a year ago. China-Hong Kong organic growth was led by healthcare and electronics and energy, while safety and graphics and consumer declined. Finally, organic growth was up 1.3% in EMEA with West Europe flat. EMEA was led by mid-single-digit growth in both healthcare and safety and graphics, while consumer and electronics and energy declined.","Please turn to Slide 6 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, fourth quarter sales were $7.9 billion with operating income of $1.8 billion and operating margins of 22.4%. On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see the components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter. Organic volume, productivity, and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added 100 basis points to margins. Lower year-on-year divestiture gains, net of actions reduced margins by 130 basis points. Higher selling prices continued to more than offset raw material inflation, contributing 20 basis points to fourth quarter margins. Finally, foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by an additional 10 basis points. ","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $2.27 per share. Please note that this result included a couple items that were not included in our guidance. First, during the quarter we recorded a net $0.04 tax charge. This charge relates to the transition tax and the deductibility of our Q1 2018 legal settlement associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Secondly, we completed the final piece of the communication markets divestiture, resulting in a net $0.02 earnings benefit. Taking into account these items, fourth quarter underlying earnings were $2.29 per share.","As you see, a number of factors impacted fourth quarter earnings. The benefits of organic growth, productivity, and lower year-on-year portfolio and footprint actions added a combined $0.18 to per-share earnings in the quarter. Lower year-on-year divestiture gains net of related actions reduced fourth quarter earnings by $0.13 per share versus last year. Foreign currency, net of hedging was an additional $0.03 per share earnings headwind in the quarter. Other expense contributed $0.06 to earnings year-on-year as higher Q4 2018 retirement expense and underlying net interest expense was more than offset by last year\u2019s fourth quarter repurchase of high coupon debt. Our underlying tax rate was lower year-on-year, which added $0.05 to Q4 earnings; and finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined by over 3% versus Q4 last year, adding an additional $0.08 to per-share earnings.","Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at our cash flow performance. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.7 billion, up 23% year-on-year with a free cash flow conversion rate of 128%. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $531 million with the full year totaling $1.6 billion. Also during the fourth quarter, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases.","Let\u2019s now review our business group performance starting with industrial on Slide 9. The industrial business delivered organic growth of 2.5% in Q4 and 3.2% for the year, with growth across all geographic areas for the quarter and full year. Growth was led by advanced materials, up double digits followed by low-single-digit growth in industrial adhesives and tapes, separation and purification, abrasives, and automotive aftermarket.","Our automotive OEM business was down 1% year-on-year versus a 5% decline in fourth quarter global car and light truck builds. For both the quarter and the full year, our auto OEM business outperformed global car and light truck builds by 400 basis points, continuing our long track record of outperformance.","On a geographic basis, industrial\u2019s organic growth was led by a 4% increase in the U.S. while the other three geographic areas each grew low single digits. Industrial delivered fourth quarter operating income of $627 million with an operating margin of 21.2%. Underlying margins were up 40 basis points year-on-year adjusting for last year\u2019s portfolio and footprint actions.","Please turn to Slide 10. Fourth quarter safety and graphic sales grew 3.3% organically versus an 11% comparison a year ago. For the full year, safety and graphics was up 5.1%. Growth was led by our personal safety business up 7% organically. Scott Safety continues to do well with strong double-digit growth in Q4. Commercial solutions grew low single digits while transportation safety declined mid-single digits. Finally, our roofing granules business declined low teens as shingle manufacturers continued with lower production volumes in the quarter. Geographically, organic growth was led by a 7% increase in Latin America-Canada, followed by the U.S. and EMEA which were each up 5%. ","Operating income in the fourth quarter was $345 million with operating margins of 22%. Underlying margins were down 110 basis points year-on-year due to the sales decline in roofing granules along with some additional fourth quarter actions.","Please turn to Slide 11. Our healthcare business generated fourth quarter sales of $1.5 billion, up 4.8% organically. In Q4, our medical solutions business posted mid-single digit organic growth with particular strength in vascular access and procurement solutions. Oral care grew 4% in the quarter with positive growth in both the U.S. and international. Our 3M Clarity clear tray aligners launch continues to build momentum. Fourth quarter organic growth was led by a high single-digit increase in food safety followed by mid-single digit growth in health information systems. ","On a geographic basis, healthcare grew across all areas with continued strength in developing markets, led by China-Hong Kong up 18% in the quarter. Healthcare\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was $458 million with margins of 30.2%. We continue to focus on investing in our priority growth platforms in advanced wound care, population health, and custom orthodontics.","Next, let\u2019s cover electronics and energy on Slide 12. Electronics and energy finished the year with solid fourth quarter organic sales growth of 4.1%. The electronics side of the business delivered fourth quarter organic of 3% with similar growth in both electronic materials and display solutions. On the energy side of the business, sales were up 5% organically with strong growth in both grid modernization and renewable energy. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by a 7% increase in Latin America-Canada, while both the U.S. and Asia Pacific were up mid-single digits. Fourth quarter operating income for electronics and energy was $396 million with operating margins of 29.5%. ","Please turn to Slide 13. Fourth quarter sales in consumer were $1.2 billion with organic growth of 1.9% year-on-year. Growth was led by our home improvement business up mid-single digits and stationary and office was up low single digits, while home care and consumer healthcare declined. Looking at consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 6% increase in Latin America-Canada with the U.S. up 5%. EMEA declined 7% as we continue to adjust our product portfolio in this region. Lastly, Asia Pacific declined 5% as we continue to experience lower year-on-year demand for our consumer respiratory solutions, particularly in China-Hong Kong due to improved air quality. Finally, fourth quarter operating income was $257 million with operating margins of 21.3%. ","That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 14, and I\u2019ll hand it back over to Mike. Mike?","Michael Roman","Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter capped an important year for 3M as we posted good results and continued to transform for the future. We delivered organic growth of more than 3% with growth across all business groups and geographic areas. We expanded GAAP earnings per share by more than 12% to $8.89, or $9.96 on an underlying basis. We posted free cash flow conversion of 91% along with a return on invested capital of more than 22%. ","In 2018, we also delivered record sales of $33 billion while returning significant cash to our shareholders. All in, we returned $8.1 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases, and last year was our 60th consecutive year of dividend increases. ","Please turn to Slide 15. Beyond financial results, in 2018 we continued to position 3M for long term growth and value creation. This includes executing our four priorities, which I laid out at our investor day in November. I\u2019ll comment briefly on the impact of each priority, starting with portfolio. ","The ongoing review and reshaping of our portfolio is critical to maximizing value for our customers and shareholders. In 2018 for example, we sold our communication markets business. This builds on the portfolio work we\u2019ve done over the last several years in electronics and energy which has led to improved growth and margins. Last month, we also announced the acquisition of MModal\u2019s technology business, which is a leading provider of AI-powered healthcare solutions. As you recall, two years ago we decided to retain and further invest in our health information systems business. This acquisition builds on that commitment and will expand our ability to improve outcomes for both patients and providers. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter and its impact is reflected in our updated guidance for 2019, which I\u2019ll cover shortly.","Turning now to transformation, which is fundamentally improving how we serve our customers, how we work and how we compete, 2018 was an important year in our transformation journey. Our team executed our ERP deployment across all five business groups in the United States, which accounts for nearly 40% of our global sales. This was a significant undertaking. I commend our people for successfully rolling out our new systems and I thank our customers for working closely with us through this change. With the U.S. rollout, we have deployed approximately 70% of our global revenue on the new ERP system. We are now stepping up our efforts to fully leverage this progress and accelerate value realization for our customers and our company. Ultimately, transformation is making 3M a more agile, more efficient and more competitive enterprise. ","Our next priority is innovation. Innovation is fundamental to our organic growth and is key to our long track record of delivering premium margins and return on invested capital. It allows us to create unique, differentiated solutions for our customers, which leads to superior returns for our shareholders. In 2018, we continued to invest in both research and development and capex, with accelerated investments in our priority growth platforms focused around healthcare, transportation, safety and infrastructure. Technology is advancing rapidly in these market spaces, and 3M will continue to capitalize on these opportunities as we move ahead.","This brings me to people and culture, which is foundational to each of the other priorities. Everything that differentiates 3M - our technologies, our manufacturing, our global reach, our brand - starts with our people. In 2018, we expanded development opportunities for 3Mers while launching initiatives to deepen our commitment to sustainability, diversity and inclusion. We also earned a number of external recognitions, including being named one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies for the fifth straight year.","In summary, our team made good progress on each of our priorities in 2018 and we are positioned for a successful 2019.","Please turn to Slide 16. As you recall, at our investor day in November we laid out our guidance framework for 2019. Since then, there has been slowing in key end markets with the biggest impact coming from China, automotive and electronics; therefore, we are widening our range for expected organic growth to 1 to 4% against the prior range of 2 to 4%. We now anticipate EPS of $10.45 to $10.90, which includes a $0.10 earnings headwind from the MModal acquisition, against a previous range of $10.60 to $11.05. Please note that the prior range did not include the MModal impact. We continue to expect a return on invested capital of 22 to 25% along with a free cash flow conversion rate of 95 to 105%. ","Please turn to Slide 17. Here you see a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth, starting with our business groups. We expect organic growth to be led by healthcare with a range of 3 to 5%, followed by safety and graphics at 2 to 5%. Organic growth in industrial is expected in the range of 1 to 4% with electronics and energy at zero to 4% and consumer at 1 to 3%. ","Looking by geographic area, we expect organic growth in the United States of 2 to 4% followed by EMEA at 1 to 3%. Organic growth in Asia Pacific is expected in the range of 1 to 5% with Latin America-Canada at 3 to 5%. ","I\u2019ll now turn it back to Nick, who will provide some color on our 2019 outlook. Nick?","Nicholas Gangestad","Thanks Mike. Please turn to Slide 18. Here are our key planning assumptions in 2019. Most of our key assumptions remain unchanged from what we discussed at our November investor day, with the exception of three items. First is the expanded full-year organic growth range that Mike just discussed. Second is in regards to our global pension expense. December\u2019s market volatility lowered our 2019 earnings benefit versus our expectation in November. Lastly, we are now including the estimated full-year growth and earnings impact from the pending MModal acquisition. Other items to note, we are forecasting full-year foreign currency translation to be a 1% headwind to sales but neutral to earnings.","Turning to raw materials, we do anticipate higher year-on-year costs, including tariff impacts; however, we continue to expect our selling prices along with our global sourcing team\u2019s ongoing productivity efforts to more than offset the expected raw material headwinds. We estimate the 2019 impact from the pending MModal acquisition net of the communication markets divestiture to be neutral to sales and an earnings headwind of $0.15 per share. We continue to increase our efforts to accelerate benefits from transformation, portfolio and footprint optimization, along with our manufacturing and SG&A productivity. Lastly, we forecast our full-year tax rate to be 20 to 22% versus our 2018 underlying rate of 20%. ","I\u2019ll now move to our 2019 capital allocation plan on Slide 19. Our strong operational cash flow fuels our capital allocation plan. We expect another year of strong cash flow from operations with 2019 estimated to be between $9.5 billion and $10.5 billion prior to our investments in R&D and our global pension plans. All in, including cash, marketable securities, and added leverage, our 2019 plan calls for $14.5 billion to $16.5 billion of available capital. Our first priority for capital deployment remains investing in our business, which includes research and development and capex supplemented with acquisitions, while at the same time returning cash to shareholders. ","Please turn to Slide 20. Here you can see our 2019 earnings road map based on the key assumptions I just laid out. For 2019, we expect per-share earnings in the range of $10.45 to $10.90, including a negative $0.10 impact from the MModal acquisition. This earnings range represents an increase of 5 to 9% year-on-year compared to our 2018 underlying EPS of $9.96. ","To wrap up, fourth quarter was a good finish to 2018. We are focused on executing our four priorities along with delivering on our financial objectives in 2019. ","With that, we thank you for your attention and will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Good morning. Just a question on Asia - you guys clearly seem to have a better handle on your customers than a lot of other folks, but as we think about 2019, do you have a sense when Asia growth bottoms ex-whatever contingency you have on the tariff negotiations? How should we think about the pace of growth in Asia throughout 2019?","Michael Roman","Andrew, if you look at the guidance we have for Asia in our outlook, we see it pretty balanced across the year within those ranges and within that range of guidance. Now, the caution as we start the year is really focused on not so much trade and tariff, but on the impact in end markets that we talked about - automotive and electronics are the focus for the slower, more cautious view as we look to 2019. So, I think as we get a better view of what\u2019s going to go on in those end markets, that would change where we are in the range, but I think that balance across the year is the way I\u2019d have you think about it.","Andrew Obin","Just a follow-up question. A couple of people asked us about R&D spend. Your longer term framework, 6% for the year, I think in \u201918 it was 5.6 for the quarter, 5.5. Any timing on R&D in 2018 and how should we think about R&D in 2019?","Michael Roman","This is--as you said, Andrew, this is still a priority and we\u2019re committed to this. It\u2019s what drives our differentiation, our innovation in 3M, and if you look at where we are in the quarter, we saw some impact from the contract R&D work that we do for customers and I would say the divestiture of the communication markets, so those are a few of the things that kept us a little lower in the quarter. We are committed to driving that model, that 6% R&D and the investment in capex that goes along with it. If you look at 2018, we actually did have an increase in headcount, so it\u2019s a better reflection maybe of our commitment to that ongoing investment.","Andrew Obin","Terrific, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks, good morning guys. Maybe just following up on Andrew\u2019s question on China, and more specifically auto and electronics, you took the guide down by a point at the low end, not really surprising given what we\u2019re seeing across the value chain. I guess the question though, is, it seems like those end markets were generally okay for the quarter. How did things progress during the quarter, and what are you actually seeing in your core business that makes you feel like growth will be slower in those end markets for 2019?","Michael Roman","Joe, we talked about this a bit at the third quarter call that we saw some slowing in China as we went into Q4, and automotive was one of the things that we talked about. That said, we saw additional slowing as we exited the quarter, and you see it in the projection for build rates, the updated view of the build rates in the quarter and then the projection for where things are going in 2019, there\u2019s just caution. There\u2019s a revision down. It\u2019s not a huge step down, but it\u2019s a revision down in the first half of the year really driven by China, so I would say some additional slowing in the outlook for build rates in automotive.","Electronics - you know, it held up well in the quarter, we had a good solid finish for that business. In fact, if you look at 2018, we were right in the range for what we were expecting in the electronics markets, and we had a cautious outlook as we went through the year. I think you see it with the OEMs in that market, they\u2019re signalling a cautious view, and it\u2019s more for first quarter than it was necessarily impacting Q4 of \u201918.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, fair enough, Mike. If I could follow up, Nick, just on price cost. You\u2019ve seen commodities come in a little bit as we ended the year, saw the raw mat headwind on the bridge, but maybe just talk a little bit about how much price do you think you\u2019ll be able to get in 2019, and are the pricing actions already in place for those benefits?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes Joe, I would say much of 2018, as well as Q4, has played out exactly how we expected, that we expected fairly significant raw material headwinds that we\u2019ve been more than offsetting throughout the year with our selling price increases, so as I look backwards on \u201918, very much how we saw that happening. ","As we look forward into 2019, we do see raw material and tariff headwinds continuing, just not at the same level of what we saw in 2018, so you see in our earnings bridge, we\u2019re expecting $0.10 to $0.20 of headwinds, and that\u2019s inclusive of tariffs. In November, when you were with us, I laid out that I expected that to be about $100 million headwind from tariffs. Right now, we put that at about $70 million year-on-year headwind from tariffs, and that\u2019s built into that $0.10 and $0.20, and we remain optimistic that selling prices will more than offset.","The last part of that question, the vast majority of our price increases have already been enacted, either late in the second half of 2018 or ones that have already been announced that go into effect early this year, so much of it, if not all of it has already been actioned.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys. Nick, can you talk about what happened in safety and graphics in terms of the 22% margin you report in the quarter? You mentioned some fourth quarter actions and weakness in roofing granules impacting margin, but margin was obviously lower than last year\u2019s Q4 despite now lapping Scott Safety, so how much of the fourth quarter actions were unusual and would you expect margin going forward to be up significantly in \u201919 versus \u201918?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes Andy, one of the first things you should do is just look at--we had a noticeable gain in fourth quarter last year on the sale of our electronic monitoring business within safety and graphics. That\u2019s why we\u2019re explaining that the underlying margin, once we pull that gain out, is down 110 basis points. The two primary things driving that 110 basis point margin contraction, one is that decline in roofing granules, and then we\u2019ve also--as you know, we\u2019ve acquired the Scott Safety business. We continue to take actions to integrate that. We\u2019ve been taking a number of actions, and that continued integration of Scott Safety is the second contributing factor to the margin contraction. Overall, we\u2019re extremely pleased with Scott Safety\u2019s performance, high growth in the quarter, and very pleased with the contribution it\u2019s making to our safety and graphics business.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, and then maybe shifting gears to healthcare, 4% growth in oral care is the best you\u2019ve recorded in some time there, and China growth is obviously strong in healthcare. Do easier comps in drug delivery mean that the lumpiness really that we saw in \u201918 is probably behind 3M and that the confidence level in your 3 to 5% organic growth in healthcare for \u201919 is reasonably high?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes Andy, I think it\u2019s still going to be lumpy in 2019, and that\u2019s primarily going to be driven by comps to what we saw in 2018. For the full year, we\u2019re not anticipating that drug delivery in total is going to have a noticeable impact on healthcare\u2019s growth, but as I look at the seasonality of what we\u2019re staring into of comps in drug delivery, we will see it being negative in the first half of the year and likely positive in the second half of the year. ","Michael Roman","Andy, let me clarify - negative comps from drug delivery. We\u2019re not seeing the healthcare business negative in the first half. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","Right, but overall the rest of the business does seem reasonably solid, and you would say you have pretty good visibility into the rest of the business, including the new product intros that you\u2019ve got in oral care starting to impact that business?","Michael Roman","Correct, yes.","Andrew Kaplowitz","All right, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning. Maybe a quick one on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of channel inventory levels and if we\u2019re all still normal, or if you\u2019re seeing anything different across any of your businesses.","Michael Roman","John, I would say we came out of Q4 pretty balanced across the businesses in channel. It\u2019s something we watch very closely - you know, we\u2019re watching sell-in, sell-out, and it looks to be pretty balanced. I would say with a word of caution around the end markets that are slowing - that always puts a focus on channel, so when you look at what\u2019s going on automotive and electronics, we\u2019re watching that closely and making sure that we have a good view of what\u2019s going on there. But as we exited \u201918, it looked to be a pretty good balance, and that\u2019s not just true of those specific end markets but across broader industrial and even across the consumer business as well.","John Walsh","Got you. Maybe just drilling down into one of those specifically, because every once in a while it kind of does get called out, is on the automotive repair and refinish. Obviously there was some channel consolidation there - that all seems to be behind the business, I just wanted to kind of confirm that.","Michael Roman","Yes, I think what I said about the broader industrial is true for automotive aftermarket as we come out of \u201918 as well - pretty balanced across the channel. That said, what we called out there, the consolidation, that\u2019s something that is ongoing. We saw a significant impact as we went through the first part of the year. I think that\u2019s something that can continue, so that\u2019s another one of those impacts on channel inventory that we watch as we see consolidation. But coming out of the year, pretty balanced in automotive aftermarket as well.","John Walsh","Got you. Maybe one more specific to the businesses here. With the acquisitions you\u2019re done, personal safety now by sub-business is one of your larger exposures. Obviously I think you said organic was up 7. Can you just kind of talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening there and if you think that kind of momentum can continue to carry on?","Michael Roman","If you think about personal safety, it\u2019s been a leader for us in growth over the last two years - \u201917 and \u201918, both strong growth, and that\u2019s really, I think, a testament to the organic priorities that we put there and the leading position that we\u2019ve been able to develop organically, and then also the acquisitions that have complemented that portfolio well. It positions us well in the marketplace where the growth is happening, and so we continue to see leading growth for the company and we have a very strong portfolio and position for our customers.","I expect--you know, it\u2019s a larger business and it\u2019s a very strong contributor to our growth as we move ahead, so I expect it to continue to lead in its market.","John Walsh","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow up if there was any extra color you\u2019d give on how the year is starting out in Q1 versus either sales ranges laid out on Slide 17 or else the earnings bridge items on Slide 20 - things like FX, hedging . I\u2019m not sure how that plays out through the year. On the revenue side in particular, just wondering how confident you are in Q1 that APAC and the EMEA regions can both see positive growth. ","Nicholas Gangestad","Julian, so far what we\u2019re seeing as a start to this year is very much in line with the guidance that we\u2019ve laid out. Just in terms of how we ended 2018, I\u2019d say as we went through the quarter, things were very much in line with what we were expecting. The only color I\u2019d put is we probably saw some weakening in China as the quarter went on.","Now in terms of 2019 and our guidance and what we\u2019re expecting there, things that can impact quarter by quarter, foreign exchange, and I\u2019ll talk this on an EPS basis, we think that\u2019s going to be neutral for the year given where the currencies are, if they stay there, and given our hedging position. I will note that it will be a headwind in the first half of the year, particularly in Q1, and then a tailwind to us in the second half of 2019. ","Other things to note, we expect margin expansion throughout the year, full year. Based on our guidance, it pencils out to about 100 basis point margin expansion, and tax rate, the tax rates we expect by quarter, we\u2019re guiding 20 to 22%. I\u2019d expect to see the first quarter closer to the low end of that range and then the other quarters closer to the midpoint or high end of that range. ","Then as far as growth that you were asking about, right now our view is we see pretty much all the areas lining up with the ranges that we\u2019ve laid out. I think in the case of China and Asia, where we\u2019re guiding low to mid single digits, if anything I\u2019d expect the first quarter to be the more challenged of those and then progressively better, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much out of the range that we\u2019ve just laid out here, quarter by quarter.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you, Nick. My follow-up question would just be around some of the various cost levers in the P&L. You\u2019d stated that operating margins should be up about 100 basis points for 2019 overall. I\u2019m guessing R&D may be a slight headwind, R&D to sales coming up, so how do we think about the delta on gross margin versus SG&A? I ask particularly because you had very, very good SG&A control in the second half of the year in particular. Is that a one-time but then needs to step back up in SG&A to sales in \u201919, or is it a function of productivity and business mix changes so it\u2019s sustainable? ","Nicholas Gangestad","Julian, if I break it into the three components you\u2019re asking about, we do see our R&D expense as a percent of revenue going up in 2019. We see our gross margin improving and we see our SG&A percent to revenue going down, so that margin expansion is going to be coming from both gross margin improvements and SG&A productivity.","The gross margin improvements, some of that has been going from our transformation, some of it is coming from our footprint actions that we\u2019ve been actioning over the last couple of years, and then on the SG&A front it\u2019s our continued leverage of the productivity through our transformation efforts, that we\u2019ll be continuing to expand margin on that front. ","Julian Mitchell","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. ","Scott Davis","Good morning, guys. A couple small questions here. First one, I\u2019m just curious, how do you get Scott Safety to grow 10%? I mean, Tyco tried for a long time and I don\u2019t think they ever had a quarter anywhere close to that type of growth. Is it as simple as just plugging into your distribution system, or is there something more to it?","Michael Roman","Yes, I think Scott Safety, it goes back to what I was talking about with the safety business in general. When we\u2019re bringing together those complementary portfolios, it\u2019s been a really, I think, a win-win for us as we\u2019ve integrated the teams together, that we can go out with leading solutions and combine those, and that\u2019s having a noticeable impact. It\u2019s certainly energized the teams and it\u2019s had some impact on the business. I think we had a number of projects come together in Q4 - that was part of it as well, so we certainly saw positive timing impacting it, but we are seeing a lift from having our leading personal safety portfolio combining with Scott Safety and Capital Safety, for that matter, and bringing those into the marketplace together.","Scott Davis","That makes sense. As a follow-up, I\u2019m just curious on the cadence of cost-out on the ERP. When you deploy--when you get 70% done, how long before you can cut the cord on the duplicate spend? There\u2019s obviously some duplicate spend for a while until you are 100% comfortable going with that new ERP system. Is that a material change in cadence through the year of cost-out into 2020?","Nicholas Gangestad","Scott, I wouldn\u2019t call it a material change throughout the year. I\u2019d call it a continued progression of what we were seeing in \u201918 into \u201919, so there\u2019s not going to be one significant triggering event; but every quarter, additional productivity as we realize those benefits, as we ensure that our supply chain is functioning as we expected, as we\u2019re meeting our customers\u2019 requirements, as we continue to work through those things, we continue to see more and more SG&A opportunity for benefits, but not a cliff. It will just continue to evolve over the next couple years.","Michael Roman","Scott, maybe to add to that, we have a value realization map, and as we deploy and we stabilize, we get benefits from that as we take better advantage of our service models that we put in place, we get benefit. But we\u2019re also--you know, we talked about this in the investor day, really doubling down on leveraging the new capabilities we have, and that gives you a steady opportunity to drive productivity. That\u2019s what I think you\u2019ll see, and that\u2019s the next point - it\u2019s going to be a steady progression as we take full advantage of the capabilities that we\u2019re putting in place.","Scott Davis","Fair enough. Good luck and thank you, fellows.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Thank you, good morning everyone. A little chilly for you guys this morning, I see too. ","Michael Roman","A little bit.","Deane Dray","Glad everyone made it in. For Nick, it looks like free cash flow - yes, you\u2019re above 100% for the fourth quarter, but it did lag your historical fourth quarter conversion pretty significantly. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes there, please?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, as part of what I\u2019ve shared before, we in 2018 built inventory in anticipation of some of our go-lives for our business transformation ERP deployments, and as we\u2019ve progressed throughout the year, one of the more significant things is that that extra inventory that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s been impacting our cash flow. It\u2019s one of the things that we are starting to see change in the fourth quarter, and our expectation as we guide 95 to 105% free cash flow conversion in 2019, the expectation that we make even more significant improvements on that going through \u201919. So working capital is the biggest thing I\u2019ll call out there, that we see that it\u2019s one of our biggest places for opportunity in our free cash flow conversion. ","Deane Dray","Got it. Then one of the businesses that had a soft spot in the third quarter was office retail, but I see it swung into one of the growth areas this quarter. Could we just drill down for a bit on office retail, maybe address ecommerce and expectations in 2019?","Michael Roman","Deane, this has been an evolving story and we\u2019ve talked a lot about the channel and the restructuring that\u2019s going on there. We see it as a sell-in, sell-out kind of story. Even through that transformation, we were seeing sell-out for our portfolio still being positive. We were seeing negative sell-in as we saw the restructuring of the channel and inventory coming out. Certainly ecommerce is another growth platform for that portfolio and we continue to do very well there in that category - it\u2019s a strong growth driver for that business, so as we came through \u201918, we started to see the balance between sell-out and sell-in come a little closer, so we saw some positive growth on the sell-in, and again the sell-out remaining still strong. So as we get into \u201919, the story will be what additional structure or changes will happen in the channel, how does that shift. We\u2019re going to continue to be focused on the end user and driving that demand and driving that sell-out, and I think we\u2019ll continue to drive positive growth from that over the long run.","Deane Dray","Got it. Just a last quick question - your comment on the air quality improvement in China caught me a little bit by surprise, but I see news reports now real significant improvement, especially in Beijing. Is that going to be a recurring theme, because you\u2019ve got some tough comps in that business throughout that you\u2019ll be looking at in 2019.","Michael Roman","Deane, we certainly had some tough comps as we came through the second half of \u201918, and with an improvement in air quality you saw that play out as part of the slowing that we saw in China in the second half of the year and impacted those businesses related to it as well. When we go into \u201919, we still see some comp in the first half of the year, but it gets a little more normalized and it will depend on what happens to air quality as we move ahead, does it continue to see an improvement. But the base for it gets more in line with what we saw in \u201918 as we go through \u201919.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Tusa","Hi guys, good morning. Can we just help calibrate, perhaps with some numbers, what could happen here in the first quarter? I mean, I hear a lot of commentary from you guys and from everybody - obviously it\u2019s more of a macro thing, about things slowing towards the end of the quarter, and then into the first quarter you had a couple electronics guys who really saw a fall-off towards the end of the quarter and into the first, and you said it\u2019s not going to be too different but kind of sounding like it\u2019s toward the low end of the range year-over-year. I mean, are we talking about basically of a--will you grow organically in the first quarter at the low end of that range, is that what you\u2019re saying?","Nicholas Gangestad","Steve, I would not be surprised if in the first half of the year, partially based on comps, we\u2019re in the lower half of the range, and in the second half of the range we\u2019re in the upper half of the range. Much of what we have is lined up that way. I don\u2019t see us in negative growth territory in any quarter. The second quarter, the only reason I say that, Steve, is we noted in second quarter last year that we felt there was some pull ahead of revenue from third quarter into second quarter, so we\u2019ll be facing into that comp second quarter of this year.","Steve Tusa","That makes a lot of sense. Your normal seasonality is up low double digit from 4Q to 1Q. Should we think about that as a little bit lower organic offset by lower tax, or is the organic enough to kind of make first quarter a bit less of a seasonal performance?","Nicholas Gangestad","I think taxes typically--our first quarter is typically our lowest tax expense. I do see it a bit more normalized of tax expense if you look quarter by quarter. If you look at 2018, our tax expense in the first quarter was noticeably below the range. I don\u2019t see that happening in first quarter of \u201919 - I think it will be in the range, but closer to the low end. Then the other piece, Steve, as I mentioned, FX will be a bit of an abnormal pattern throughout the year, that it will be a headwind to us in the first half, in particular in the first quarter, and then it will be offsetting and flipping, and that\u2019s primarily driven by hedging that we\u2019re seeing. We had hedging losses in 2018, and if currencies stay where they are, they\u2019ll be flipping to hedging gains in 2019.","Steve Tusa","And how big are those gains for \u201919?","Nicholas Gangestad","We had hedging losses of approximately a little over $80 million in 2018, and if currencies stayed where they are, they\u2019d be in the $50 million, $60 million, $70 million of gains right now.","Steve Tusa","One last quick one for you guys on portfolio management. This year, you\u2019re kind of flipping the portfolio around a little bit. It seems like it\u2019s a bit of a headwind, this kind of $0.15 headwind. I know some of it is temporary, but is that kind of--should we be ready for a bit of year one dilution as you work through--you know, as you continue to work through the portfolio on an annual basis, or does it all catch up towards the end because I know that you\u2019ve guided to positive, ultimately positive benefits over the long term, but obviously this year is a bit of a negative. How should we think about that in the context of the long term guide on portfolio management?","Nicholas Gangestad","If I use MModal as an example, that one we see as a $0.10 headwind this year that\u2019s driven by some of our transaction costs one time, some of our integration costs at the beginning of our time of owning it, as well as some ongoing amortization. This particular one, we guided that we think by year three it will be about 10 times--that this would equate to a 10 times EBITDA, so it will be generating $100 million-plus of EBITDA by year three. I\u2019d say that\u2019s not uncommon of what to expect, that often in the first year we want to aggressively integrate whatever we buy into the company to be fully realizing the value model that we can create by having it part of 3M.","Steve Tusa","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning guys. Maybe to start out, Nick, can you talk about what some of the offsetting factors are in guidance? I guess if I add up pension, MModal, and then the lower organic growth, it seems like a bit more than what you\u2019ve tweaked the range by. You mentioned that the tariff headwind was a little lower. Is there anything else in the bridge that we should be aware of as being an offsetting item?","Nicholas Gangestad","In terms of what we were anticipating back in November, those three things you just called out, Josh, those would all be tweaks down. As far as tweaks up since November, we\u2019re seeing a less negative environment for raw material prices, that if I had called out specifically back in November what we were expecting for raw material headwinds, I would have been quoting a higher number there, and that\u2019s partially offsetting some of these tweaks down that I\u2019ve laid out. That\u2019s the single biggest one that\u2019s changed.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then just as an exporter, did you see any of your customers in the fourth quarter do any pre-buy work when January was still kind of a target date for tariffs? We\u2019ve seen some of that in some other short cycle guys, curious if that impacted you at all.","Michael Roman","Josh, we watch that closely and it\u2019s part of what we look at in the channel - you know, when we see these macro changes, are they impacting the pre-buy. We didn\u2019t see that as we came through the quarter, and as Nick said, the quarter progressed the way we expected. It\u2019s not just watching from a distance - we\u2019re close with those partners, and we didn\u2019t have any indication of that happening, certainly not at any significant level.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it, appreciate it. Thanks Mike. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.","John Inch","Good morning everybody. So Europe, Western Europe flat, how much of that was self-inflicted by your own actions to withdraw from certain product lines and markets versus the actual market, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to quantify it, but how does that spill into the 2019 outlook as well? Is there a way to quantify that?","Nicholas Gangestad","John, I\u2019d estimate that there\u2019s about 200 basis points of us taking specific actions of adjusting our portfolio, of product lines that we\u2019re choosing to exit that are built into that. There will be some carry-forward of that into \u201919, but not on as a significant level as what we saw in 2018.","John Inch","Nick, are you still on track to get to the 20% margins in Europe? I forget exactly what you said in November, what your timeline was, but how is that tracking? Is that ahead of schedule, or just on track? ","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, we\u2019re on track to do that, John. 2019 will be a noticeable year where we\u2019ve done a number of things in \u201917 and \u201918 to set us up for that. \u201919 will be a year of seeing noticeable margin improvement to get us on track to that 20% by 2020.","John Inch","Twenty percent by 2020 - okay. Then there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here to this guide. I understand why you took the lower end of the range down a point, but the midpoint if you adjust for MModal really only declines by $0.05, which I guess you could argue that\u2019s the impact of half a point, but there must be some other things. I\u2019m curious - specifically on raw materials, I get what you\u2019re saying; on the other hand, Nick, didn\u2019t you say that tariffs would be fully offset, and versus November, this raw material productivity, the minus-$0.20 to minus-$0.10, is that actually lower, because obviously things like oil and other things have actually declined, so just trying to calibrate why, even though you lowered the guide where only the midpoint is $0.05 lower, is any of this being offset because raw materials are, while still a headwind, slightly better? If that makes sense.","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes, if I had shown this, what we expected it look like in November, I would have been showing a higher raw material headwind there as we\u2019ve seen with oil and some of the things that we were expecting on tariffs haven\u2019t turned out quite as bad as what we were estimating. Back in November I said we were confident that we could more than offset whatever we see with raw materials and tariffs with our selling prices, and we remain, I\u2019d say, even more confident on that front.","John Inch","Then just lastly, Nick, how did the semicon piece of 3M do specifically? Remind us, is that about a billion dollars? I know consumer electronics is around 2. Did semicon--was it seeing the weakness particularly in Asia that a lot of these companies are calling out, or did you do better; and if you did better actually, why do you think that\u2019s the case?","Michael Roman","John, maybe I\u2019ll take that. If you look at the business, our electronic materials business has got the semiconductor piece of it. It\u2019s not the largest piece of that. When you look at that, we\u2019ve got other businesses in there. We\u2019ve got materials into consumer electronics, we have assembly solutions, but a big portion of it goes into semicon. We certainly expected to see some slowing as we went through the quarter. As Nick talked about, they were in line, that business was in line with the overall 3% growth that we saw in the quarter. Going forward, there\u2019s more caution in that marketplace and the semiconductor manufacturers are part of that, so I would say it was less of an impact on Q4 but more of part of the caution as we guide going into \u201919.","John Inch","Understood, got it. Thanks guys, appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander","Hi, two quick ones. Could you characterize what you\u2019re seeing in Latin America in a little bit more detail, like where the pockets of strength are, and can you speak a little bit more broadly about in 2019 - 2020 what kind of impact you may see on 3M from emerging market customers realigning their supply chains to work around the current tariff disputes?","Michael Roman","Laurence, talking about Latin America first, we saw broader based growth in Latin America across our portfolio, both Brazil and Mexico, the largest countries there, performing well as we came through Q4. It was pretty balanced and pretty broad-based in portfolio and growth, and we have that same kind of outlook as we look to 2019. ","To your question about the supply chain and are we seeing changes there, it\u2019s certainly something we watch for. We expect the supply chain to react over time as tariffs come into play. We haven\u2019t seen a significant impact to that at this point - it just hasn\u2019t shown up that way. We watch it closely with the customer and we\u2019re connected with them on the design and specification of our products, and that includes pretty good visibility on the supply chain. We just haven\u2019t seen it react that strongly to this point.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, good morning, and thanks for going long here. Can you hear me okay?","Michael Roman","Yes.","Nigel Coe","Good. I\u2019m having some problems with the phones here, so I\u2019m on a cell phone. Just want to go back to the electronics outlook for zero to 4, and obviously you\u2019ve provided some [indiscernible] in terms of quarterly cadence. If we dig into the businesses, electronics business, energy, are you seeing any appreciable difference in the two sub-segments for \u201919? ","Michael Roman","Nigel, you\u2019re talking about the sub-segments of energy, or you\u2019re talking about energy versus electronics?","Nigel Coe","Energy versus electronics, and looking at that 2% midpoint, how would that break out between the two sub-segments.","Michael Roman","Yes, we highlighted the good performance from energy markets in Q4, and we have an outlook for that to continue as we go into 2019, so I would say that is more of the same. The electronics, we\u2019ve been coloring that all morning based on the outlook in the end markets, so I would say that\u2019s the one that we\u2019re a little more cautious about. Energy looks pretty stable as we go into the year, but both of them contributing, I would say, evenly across the year, with that kind of caution on the end markets in play. ","Nigel Coe","Okay. Is there any appreciable difference in the margin profile between energy and electronics? I\u2019ve always assumed electronics was higher margins, but could you clarify that?","Nicholas Gangestad","Yes Nigel, there\u2019s really not a discernible difference between the margins in the different components there, between our electronics and our energy. They\u2019re very similar, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Then Nick, if you could just quickly clarify the comments you made on safety and graphics margins for 4Q. You called out Scott Safety integration headwinds, but then we\u2019re comping against some of the purchase accounting headwinds in 4Q17, so I\u2019m just wondering why we wouldn\u2019t have seen a benefit from Scott Safety in 4Q18.","Nicholas Gangestad","When I\u2019m backing out last year, there were one-time costs with Scott, bringing them in, as well as the gain that we had on the sale of our electronic monitoring business. When I go and say it\u2019s 110 basis point underlying margin contraction, that\u2019s already discounting for that piece. Now that we\u2019ve taken that out and it\u2019s part of our ongoing business, we are continuing to take actions in Scott and other parts of our safety and graphics business, but Scott\u2019s the largest one that we\u2019re taking actions on. That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s behind that. ","The other piece that I maybe didn\u2019t highlight clearly enough for you, Nigel, is the sales decline that we\u2019re seeing in roofing granules, that is creating a year-on-year margin contraction in safety and graphics that\u2019s impacting that total. ","Nigel Coe","Understood, thanks Nick.","Operator","That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.","Michael Roman","Thank you. In summary, the fourth quarter capped another year of significant accomplishments for 3M as we posted good results while strengthening our company for the long term. Moving ahead, we are focused on executing our four priorities and delivering for our customers and shareholders in 2019.","Thank you again for joining us this morning, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. "]}}
