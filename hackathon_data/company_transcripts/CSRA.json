All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.","Stuart Davis","Thank you, Amy and welcome everyone to today's quarterly earnings conference call. Larry Prior, our CEO; and Dave Keffer, our CFO are here to discuss our financial results, business momentum and forward outlook. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website where you will also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll be using during today's call.","Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, please note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. For a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our Form 10-K from May.","In addition, the statements represent our views as of today and subsequent events may cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.","Finally, as shown on Slide 3, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics which we believe provide useful information for investors. The slide deck for today's call includes an explanation of those adjustments and other reconciliations of the figures to the most comparable GAAP measures.","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Larry, who will begin on Slide 4.","Lawrence Prior","Thank you, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. We\u2019re pleased to begin fiscal year 2017 with another strong quarter of execution. In the first quarter we posted excellent results across key financial metrics, continued our business development momentum to lay the foundation for future growth and demonstrated progress in our strategy to differentiate CSRA as the leader in digital innovation for government. In addition, we are implementing a talent management approach that will brand us as an employer of choice for high tech professionals.","Let me flush out each of these four major achievements in detail. First, revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow are all on track. So we reaffirm the guidance that we gave on the last call. EBITDA margin was especially strong at 17.4% driven by the twin CSRA hallmarks of excellent program execution and cost discipline. Our foundation of fixed-price contracts motivates us towards innovation and cost efficient delivery and enables us to deliver for shareholders.","In addition, we generated excellent cash flow in the quarter. Through disciplined financial management we were able to generate operating cash flow of $156 million which allowed us to continue to pay down debt, pay dividends and begin to evaluate acquisitions. Second, we posted another positive quarter with $1.3 billion in bookings. This marks the sixth straight quarter with a book to bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our book to bill ratio of 1.3 times for the trailing 12 months points to future growth and demonstrates that we can compete fiercely in the federal IT marketplace.","Our health business, which is our fastest growing market, led the way with two key wins in the quarter. We won $180 million re-compete of our work for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program. This global funding organization supports cancer, military medical and other disease and injury specific research. It manages more than $1 billion in biomedical research investments annually funding groundbreaking research projects intended to transform healthcare, provoke military service members and the general public.","Dr. Steven Goldberg directs our peer review and science management team which is the nation's preeminent provider of scientific peer review solutions. Over the last 20 years on this program, we've developed and deployed a world-class approach for engaging scientists, clinicians and consumers in the evaluation of grant applications. In addition, the New York State Department of Health rewarded our support with a one-year $127 million extension of our contract to enhance operate and maintain the health insurance exchange implemented under the Affordable Care Act.","To date we have enrolled more than 3 million residents through this program and the program is a recognized leader across all states. We expect to reach agreement on a multiyear extension early next year.","The largest new business win in the quarter was with the U.S. Coast Guards Telecommunication and Information Systems Command. Kudos to Pam Bosque [ph] our Coast Guard Account Manager who will serve as the PM for this program for her leveraging of our next-generation IT expertise and just the teams creativity to win this $55 million five-year contract. We have a great opportunity to strengthen communications within the Coast Guard through lifecycle management, server consolidation and technology insertion to enhance both current and future missions.","In addition to providing enterprise IT services and responsive technical support we will lead the development and the deployment of the U.S. Coast Guard's IT infrastructure managing sensitive secret and top-secret networks, both onshore and afloat. The maritime domain is complex and the challenges and threats in our operational environment have never been greater. As the largest pure play IT systems integrator for the Department of Homeland Security, CSR is well-positioned to support TISCOM's vital mission of ensuring our nation's security and prosperity.","Across the company we submitted $4 billion of proposals for new businesses in the first quarter and we are on pace to achieve our FY '17 target of $16 billion in new business submits. As of the end of the quarter we had $11 billion in submits outstanding and looking only at new business we had about $6.5 billion awaiting decision including 14 opportunities greater than $100 million in total value.","Our second quarter is shaping up to be a very strong one on the BD [ph] front. Our proposal rooms are overflowing and we expect to submit another $5 billion of new business proposals in the second quarter. Q2 award volumes are usually high because it is the end of the government's fiscal year, but most of the awards tend to come in September. We began the quarter with the best July we've had in years with multiple $100 million plus wins.","These large wins defend our base with competitive re-competes that include $131 million award for architecture and design work for Navy ships and the wins also drive new growth with new business including $167 million fixed-price IT job for the Defense Intelligence Agency where we unseated two entrenched incumbents. We did so by leveraging the competitive advantage of our shared services center in Bossier City, Louisiana and a deep technical expertise of our groundbreaker team in Maryland.","As of the end of Q1 our backlog stood at $15.1 billion, which is about three times annual revenue. Backlog is up 5% year-over-year driven by strong bookings over this last year and if we keep these positive trends going revenue growth will certainly follow.","Third, we are enhancing our leadership in digital innovation as part of our overall strategy to drive sustainable growth by implementing next-generation technologies for our government customers. Central to that strategy is working closely with technology innovators. We recently announced new strategic partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Racemi and Docker.","These partnerships extend well beyond the standard prime software integrator-vendor relationships, so commonplace in the aerospace industry. In this case we share go-to-market strategies. We treat them as partners. We get preferred access and pricing and we share development strategies with our partners to our mutual benefit but more importantly to the benefit of our government customers.","I truly believe that no one can provide our partners the same level of delivery excellence to government IT customers than CSRA can. This strategy is not some recent development or a pet project of a few techies, rather it is the motivating construct that utilize our customers, our business our company and its of course our investments.","In fact, late last month senior CSRA technology leaders and I spent a week on the West Coast meeting with established tech partners, meeting with emerging technology companies and meeting with the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental DIUX which the DoD stood up to bridge between the military and companies operating at the cutting edge of technology. This trip came on the heels of this summer's CSRA Emerging Technology Partner Day where we met with 11 companies from leading venture capital funds to discuss capabilities and opportunities.","It is clear from all of these interactions that we can catalyze adoption of these technology innovations as we deliver IT capability for government customers with incredible critical needs. We have already identified great outstanding collaborative opportunities where we can work together to create new solutions for our customers' mission challenges. In fact I believe we will have tangible success that will be material in our next two quarters. In addition to revving up the business development engine, it will help us drive organic growth through this innovation on programs that we're so proud of today.","Fourth, we are excited about the progress we are making on talent management front and we are committed to building CSRA into an employer of choice. Over the past quarter, we have seen consistent headcount growth for the first time as a public company. Our voluntary attrition has been trending down over the last couple of months since we have concluded much of the organizational integration activities driven by our synergy case.","We are seeing strong interest in our job openings and have averaged a record number of offers accepted over the past quarter. A big shout out to our HR team and to all of our recruiters. We are recognizing employees through our FY '17 quarterly performance award program and celebrating key contributions to our customers' missions as well as to company performance that serves them.","We launched our new Tuition Reimbursement and Certification Program to support employees continued development which in turn will also help our customers in their digital transformation. We see our employee focused culture as our key future discriminator in our ability to recruit and to retain the best talent especially for next-generation technologies. For example ,we implemented a new wellness program that included a variety of offerings such as weekly fit-bit competitions amongst our interns, employee walking sessions at lunch, yes are taking part in discounted weight watcher programs as well as working at biometric improvements.","Our intent is to make wellness and caring for our employees wellbeing a cornerstone of our CSRA culture. In October we will complete the migration to one HR system. Now on the one hand it is going to bring us significant number of improvements, it will increase the efficiency of hiring and promotions and performance reviews, but what we find really exciting is we are working with our SaaS partner Workday on the new system and this is consistent with our customers' zero philosophy of bringing NexGen technology into our company as we deliver for our customers across the government. We are making strong progress in branding CSRA as a great place to work.","And now I'll ask Dave to provide more detail on the financial results as well as our forward outlook.","David Keffer","Thanks Larry and good afternoon everyone. The first quarter results were in line with our expectation and keep us on track for the guidance that we laid out on our last call. With this our third public quarter, GAAP and adjusted results are coming into closer alignment. There is no pension mark to market impact this quarter and fewer spin, merger and integration costs. I will focus on the adjusted results and note any deviations from GAAP along the way.","Turning to Slide 5, revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion down 3% sequentially and down 5% from pro forma revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Most of the year-over-year decline was in our Defense and Intelligence segment consistent with the headwinds we outlined on our last earnings call.","On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, Homeland Security and other civilian agencies was down 2% and our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 8% year-over-year. The largest contributor to the decline was the logistics modernization program for the U.S. Army followed by a lower overall volume of direct material and other direct cost purchases. We're still negotiating with the L&P customer on the wind down of the program. But it's worth mentioning what a successful engagement this has been.","The SAP development program has saved our customers $6 billion through lower software maintenance costs and better inventory management. We look forward to supporting the Army however we can and competing on the next increment of development at some point in the future.","Our contract mix remains essentially unchanged. As a percentage of total Q1 revenue 42% was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 37% on cost-plus contracts. As a result of merger synergies and strong contract performance, profitability and earnings were excellent.","Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $218 million up 4% from the same period a year ago as EBITDA margin increased from 15.9% to 17.4%. Similarly, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.51 up 2% from last quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was unchanged compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, but the year ago quarter included a pretax gain of $17 million on the sale of Welkin. Without the divestiture gain, adjusted EPS would have increased 12% from the year ago quarter.","I will quickly walk you through the principal elements between revenue and earnings. Gross margin was 21.2% aided by a pickup on the Department of Homeland Security program that we've been tracking for several quarters. Pro forma SG&A was $52 million which was down $30 million year-over-year based on cost synergies and up $7 million sequentially from higher bid and proposal expense as we accelerate our submittals. The net of the program pick up, the elevated B&P [ph] spend and other similar items was about $0.02 of EPS above our steady-state rate.","First quarter pension related income was $24 million consistent with the rate laid out on the last call. GAAP depreciation and amortization expense was $65 million which includes the $16 million of intangible amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog that we back out of our adjusted net income and EPS. Also excluded from adjusted EBITDA and EPS was $13 million of other pretax merger and integration costs. These costs continue to decline and should be even lower in future quarters.","Interest expense was $30 million in Q1 up slightly from last quarter given the additional costs from the interest rate hedge we executed in March which was offset somewhat by reduced debt levels. Given that we no longer have significant transaction related adjustments in our quarterly tax rate, we're using the GAAP tax rate in our calculation of adjusted earnings per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was around 36% which added a little over $0.02 to EPS compared to the previously projected long-term rate of 39%.","Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $156 million helped by incorporating SRA into the company's accounts receivable purchase facility, which increased operating cash flow by $46 million. This program makes clear financial sense as it accelerates cash collection for enhanced deployment at a very low cost of capital.","As a result of the strong cash flow, we aggressively executed on our balanced capital allocation program and deployed $98 million to pay down debt, $50 million of which eliminated the outstanding balance on our revolver and $48 million of which satisfied the FY '16 excess cash flow sweep requirement on our term loans. We also used $18 million to pay dividends.","Our capital allocation approach continues to balance growth and fiscal responsibility for shareholder returns. First quarter free cash flow of $67 million excludes the impact of the receivables purchase facility and reflects normal fluctuations in quarterly working capital performance. We expect frequent cash flow to increase in the second quarter and to remain on track for the year.","Days sales outstanding were 54 days as of the quarter end, a degradation of one day sequentially from an unusually strong Q4 level. As of July 01, 2016 we had $133 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.7 billion in debt. Our steady cash flows and $700 million of undrawn revolver capacity provides substantial liquidity and flexibility to manage the business, pay down debt, return cash to shareholders and to make accretive acquisitions.","With an in line quarter, we are maintaining our forward guidance as shown on Slide 7. We continue to project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $905 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.91 and $2.04 and free cash flow between $300 million and $350 million.","Our assumption for pension income of $96 million is unchanged. We have slightly tweaked other base assumptions. For the full year we now expect our effective tax rate to be around 38% and our fully diluted share count to be around 165 million shares. Annualizing revenue for the first quarter yields the low end of the FY '17 guidance range. So we will need new business wins to move up through the guidance range. We expect new business wins to materialize from our high volumes of submittal awaiting adjudication and continued robust bidding activity.","Annualizing first quarter EBITDA and EPS point to the middle of the guidance ranges after controlling for the program pick up and lower tax rate. That said, we expect revenue, EBITDA and EPS to step down slightly in Q2 before turning to sequential growth in the back half of the year as we ramp new business wins.","In summary, I'm pleased that we\u2019re able to drive improved profitability while investing heavily in the organic growth engine of the company. With a robust volume of submitted proposals and strong positioning on upcoming next-generation IT and critical mission support opportunities, we look forward to accelerating new business wins while maintaining our industry-leading profitability and strong cash generation.","With that, Amy, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Edward Caso at Wells Fargo.","Edward Caso","Good evening. Congrats on the results. Can you talk about your capital deployment priorities, particularly where share repurchase might fall into the equation or when might it pick up?","David Keffer","Hey Ed, it is Dave. I\u2019m happy to talk through that. Of course, there\u2019s more art than science to that analysis, and it\u2019s one that we spent a lot of time thinking about and assessing every quarter. To date, we\u2019ve deployed about $268 million to debt pay down, about $100 million to shareholder returns and have not yet, since the spin and merger with SRA, made another acquisition. ","So to date, we\u2019re in the 30% range for shareholder returns and 70 for debt paydown. Long-term guidance ranges for cash deployment, of course, are 50% for debt paydown, 40% for shareholder returns and 10% for M&A. Those priorities will continue to evolve over time, obviously, over the first year out of the gates here, M&A was less of a priority for us, reducing debt from the current \u2013 from the initial $3 billion level was a high priority and sprinkling in some effective shareholder, share repurchases under our $400 million authorization also a priority.","Going forward, we\u2019re comfortable. We\u2019re pleased with the current volume of debt we\u2019ve been able to pay down. We will look at shareholder \u2013 share buybacks going forward. We\u2019ll continue to look at those carefully each quarter. And as we said on the call, we are open to M&A in places where it can be strategically valuable to us and help spur further organic growth.","Edward Caso","Can you clarify the two big contracts you mentioned, the Army contract which is running down, is there opportunity here? Is there something in the near term or you explain exactly what sort of the scenarios are going forward? And also with the New York State one as well, how that might decline and then rise again? Thank you.","Lawrence Prior","Yes, this is Larry Prior. So with the Army, with the logistics modernization, we've got a core development team that\u2019s continuing to provide help with some of the incremental improvements with this SAP program. And the discussion with the Army is not bringing it down as fast as was originally planned and how do we keep some of that talented enterprise software skill set alive and well supporting the Army program as we get ready to compete on several other SAP programs. They\u2019ve been really open to the discussions and recognize for the Army and their commitment to SAP, it\u2019s fairly strategic.","We\u2019ve got one of the best software teams around it. So we continue to discuss, how do we protect that team for the good use of Army enterprise planning, while we\u2019re bidding aggressively on several SAP opportunities. When it comes to New York State, remember there\u2019s two programs both continue to see some extensions. eMedNY was the first one for center for Medicare and Medicaid.","We did not bid on the re-compete. We thought it was a flawed model. A competitor won it. As they face any challenges, we stand ready to help the State of New York with this essential function of government, and we continue to benefit from extensions on that.","The one I mentioned on the call though was New York State of Health around the Affordable Care Act. We got a one-year extension. And as we go through the life of it, we expect that we\u2019ll grow into a multiyear extension. It\u2019s a very good program for us. We cherish the work. We perform well on it, and we think it\u2019s a nice base for us as we look to the rest of \u201817 and into \u201818.","Edward Caso","Great, thank you.","David Keffer","Thanks Ed. ","Operator","The next question is from Amit Singh at Jefferies.","Amit Singh","Hi guys, thank you for taking my questions. On the full-year guidance, I mean in the prepared remarks, it seems like to come at the upper end, you sort of need to win more business. But if you're looking at the lower end of your revenue and EPS, I mean is that - does that seem very - do you feel very confident in achieving that based on just whatever you have right now?","David Keffer","Sure. This is Dave. I'm happy to give you a few more context points there on visibility as we think about our guidance outlook. So to the low end of the guidance that you mentioned, we need to win about $150 million of new business or generate $150 million of new business revenue, I should say, in this fiscal year.","To get to the midpoint it's $250 million and of course, the high end would be $350 million. So think of that $150 million to the low end as 3% and then 5% to the mid-point and 7% to the high end. Given the volume that we have pending, we talked about $6.5 billion worth of new business bids, not re-competes but full new business. We're excited about the opportunities to win new business this quarter in what's traditionally a very strong quarter for contract award notices and we feel like that's what gives us the confidence in our guidance range and what we've seen throughout as the opportunity to deliver on that guidance range.","Amit Singh","All right. Perfect. And just quickly on M&A based on what we were discussing in the last question. So I mean, broadly, you're targeting sort of 10% of your cash deployment towards M&A, but could there be scenarios where you could think about a much larger activity and M&A in the near term?","Lawrence Prior","Yes. I just want to make sure that we underscore our balanced approach to capital deployment. And having three quarters under our belt, we think it's important to have the discipline of that balanced approach where, first and foremost, we're retiring debt. I'm thrilled that we took down the revolver.","Second, we believe that repurchasing shares and buyback is a really good thing to do and we'll consider acquisitions, but they have to really perform in three fronts. They have to give us a technology edge as we think about cloud-enabled digitization of the marketplace. We always look for customer intimacy and competitive advantage.","And then almost always, we want to think of future contracts that will have a really positive result from any acquisition. Examples in our past have been 426 and Tenacity. But be clear, priority 1 is a balanced approach around capital deployment, and we take some pride in reducing our debt in such an aggressive fashion as we've been disciplined about also doing share buyback.","Amit Singh","All right, perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Bill Loomis with Stifel.","William Loomis","Hi thank you. Good evening. Let's see. I guess, Dave, maybe on kind of second quarter slightly lower sequentially. Any chance you can give a little more color on that because obviously, that sets up for as you have talked about more aggressive back half growth? And then how much was the pickup on the DHS contract, you mentioned?","David Keffer","Hi Bill, it's Dave. So on the first point around the Q2 decline, we said in our prepared remarks to expect a slight decline. I think that's consistent with the way we characterize it here. It's hard to quantify without getting into specific quarterly guidance, but not a meaningful step-down from quarter-to-quarter but a slight decline is what we see on each of the lines.","On the contracts, pickup in the quarter, given the sensitivity around specific contract items, we're not going to get into the specific details on any one, up or down. We called it out as we did a couple of quarters ago talked about EAC adjustments, in general, being a few million higher than we would traditionally see.","We called this one out because it added a bit to the results in the quarter. The net of that item and other kind of unique items in the quarter, as we said, was about $0.02 favorable to the company. You can think of on a pretax basis a $0.01 equaling about $2.5 million. So think of the net of those factors being in the $5 million range.","William Loomis","Okay. And then just a pension question, what was the cash flow impact with the pension, any contributions or any cash impact and then for the quarter and then for the year?","Lawrence Prior","No, no cash contributions made into the program of any materiality. The $96 million is the pension income expected for the year absent any mark-to-market ups or downs at the end of the year and the remeasurement. So think of that as the adjustment between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.","We have a small, as I mentioned immaterial volume of cash that flows into the pension program related to the service [ph] program one of the smaller elements of defined benefit programs, but again nothing that materially affects our financials.","William Loomis","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Gautam Khanna at Cowen & Company.","Gautam Khanna","Hey guys.","Lawrence Prior","Hi Gautam.","Gautam Khanna","Nice quarter.","Lawrence Prior","Thank you.","David Keffer","Thanks.","Gautam Khanna","Yes for sure, I was \u2013 I had a couple of questions on the guidance first. Well, first of all, before that, I think re-compete losses in the quarter?","Lawrence Prior","None.","David Keffer","None.","Lawrence Prior","I mean the ones we\u2019ve got hanging out is STRATCOM, so we had protested that. GAO looked to support the original decision. We're going to evaluate what it looks like and tune our next steps. But that's when we had already reported out, and when we've taken out of our plan.","Gautam Khanna","Okay, and so that's down if I recall in the December quarter is that right?","Lawrence Prior","That\u2019s correct.","Gautam Khanna","So, in the September quarter?","Lawrence Prior","That's correct.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. On the guidance Dave, you\u2019ve mentioned the 150, 250, 350. So this is still go get business or is this you already have booked a lot of stuff and it starts to convert $150 million of revenue from the backlog already to sales. If you could just comment on how much is truly go get on the comp business?","David Keffer","That 150, 250, 350 is the remaining go get, Gautam. So you can imagine with a large volume of awards to be adjudicated this quarter, we intend to win our fair share of those and have those contribute meaningfully to revenue towards the second half of the year, and that would be what contributes to the 150, 250, and 350.","Lawrence Prior","And Gautam, I would characterize it as it's known, it\u2019s amidst awaiting decision and there's nothing more exciting than the last quarter of the government's fiscal year in the month of September when you've brought as much to bear awaiting decision as we have. I did mention that July had gone well for us. One of those new wins we're already ramping up and I'm hoping the conversation is going to evolve from one where we're talking about our pivot to growth to one off executing on the growth we've achieved.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, likewise that would be wonderful, I was wondering if you could also frame for us, so September quarter is going to be seasonally strong from a booking standpoint, but presumably December and March, we might be in an extended CR situation and when you look at the stuff you're hoping to win in the September quarter is any of this new business Greenfield type opportunities that could be delayed by an extended CR or is this mostly existing business of other competitors you hope to take away and any comment of how we should frame with CR into your thinking?","Lawrence Prior","Yes, I think, so we've gotten used to CRs I mean how strange that and CRs have become the norm. So a lot of our government customers seem to be fairly disciplined. We take real pride in watching FEDSIM as a bastion of adults running acquisition in the government today. And we think they'll continue to operate in a very professional, disciplined manner.","There\u2019s other great examples of that. So I think this quarter it is lining up to be fairly disciplined with lots of award activity. And I don't think any thought of the CR coming with the new fiscal year has slowed down anything. As we go into the government's first quarter, I still expect a CR to be shorter in duration. I still think they'll be the omnibus package probably built on a defense appropriations bill. Everyone will hang a Christmas ornament on it.","And then watch the dialogue around supplemental, where they're thinking about a budget request in parallel on the national security side, built around overseas contingency ops. But then a matching security side that's focused on helping federal civilian government, I think that play is going to be run again.","Stuart Davis","And Gautam, this is Stuart. As we look at how we're expecting wins to lay down over the rest of the year, we could actually see a fairly positive December depending what happens on the protest activity. We've built them in a little bit of flexibility there that there could be some slippage, although we certainly took heart from the fact that the DIA award that Larry talked about was not protested.","Gautam Khanna","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe if you could just remind us of any sizeable re-competes that we should be watching for in time and in size over the next couple quarters?","David Keffer","Hey Gautam, it\u2019s Dave on that one. So I would point to two re-competes and these are contracts we've talked about before, both of which we're expecting award decisions on right around the change in the fiscal year for us, which is obviously next spring. The first of which would be the groundbreaker program, which as we've mentioned in the past is roughly 7% of our revenue today. ","The second would be the re-compete of our TSA IT infrastructure program, which has in the past run approximately 3% of our revenue as well. Those are on a similar procurement timetable. Obviously the exact timetable or an award decision and transition of our work toward new contract is TBD, but those are both primarily FY\u201918 events.","Gautam Khanna","And is groundbreaker, do you still think the sum of the three parts could aggregate to equal what you are currently doing is the prime on groundbreaker or do you think the work scope is not going to expand such to enable us to be flat even if you succeed in that three?","David Keffer","Yes, I think it's way too early to make that call as ourselves, our competitors have our bids submitted and we need to have people trying to reengineer that back to think about pricing.","Gautam Khanna","Understood. All right, thanks guys, good luck.","David Keffer","Thank you.","Lawrence Prior","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Frank Atkins at SunTrust.","Frank Atkins","Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a little bit about the cyber security environment if you could remind us the scale of work you're doing there, the growth rate in the end markets as you see it and any changes in pricing if any?","Lawrence Prior","Yes, so we do it a couple of different ways. So for us cyber time is a direct sale where we're focused on doing work with security operation centers. Examples are the work we do for the FAA, the work we do for State Department Security, the work we do for the 24th Air Force.","So we have we have a robust direct sales program where it's competing head to head for pure-play cyber work. Most of it however, is Integral to enterprise IT where anywhere you are in the stack out to your endpoint computing, you are helping your government customers have everything beyond perimeter defense and thinking about active means to really identify threat.","I think there's a greater propensity of the government now to invest in cyber as part of their integrated IT build. You see the proposal by - in the President's budget, there's a couple of bills in Congress to think of industrial funding to help with the infrastructure, the legacy, hardware and software to upgrade it to a place where good hygiene really matters and cyber will be something that at least has a foot in a foundation in an infrastructure that\u2019s 2016 generation instead of 2003.","Relative to the pricing I think it's again, customers want out of IT a lower price. They expect us to consolidate data centers, they expect us to go virtual, they expect us to leverage cloud enablement, but they also expect to have pristine elements of cyber throughout the bid, and then they\u2019ll make that differentiation. So I see customers who will invest in cloud, invest in cyber, invest in data analytics and expect us to deleverage delivery and give them a better price.","Frank Atkins","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then I wanted to ask about kind of the human capital talent side, any changes in your ability to find good people or retain good people out there?","Lawrence Prior","It\u2019s a dynamic environment. We\u2019re spending a lot more energy on talent around next-generation IT, enterprise IT and some is just the core domain knowledge of our customer sets. We\u2019re having good success in building and recruiting our leverage teams out of Bossier City, Louisiana, but we also see greater mobility, that a lot of our employees are taking advantage of technical searches, and they\u2019re thinking about how they move across our enterprise in doing exciting careers in next-generation IT.","We\u2019ll always have the challenge with all of our peers of working their way through the process of clearances. Our advantage is we have a base of thousands of cleared IT professionals. And Leigh Palmer and Ben Gianni in the Intel team are really doing a good job leveraging some of that talent across what our traditional barriers, i.e. the Potomac River, so trying to get really good tech talent to cross from Virginia to Maryland and vice versa. If the work is exciting enough if there is a period of time they\u2019re willing to do it and excited to do it.","So I think each company has got to hit it a little different way. For us what\u2019s core, talent once next-generation search, they want mission that matters, they want flexibility in the workplace. We\u2019re pretty casual with open spaces. We are fine with software developers working at midnight just so long as their peers think whatever they deployed to get hub is really cool, and I think that's the advantage that we're going to bring as we create CSRA as a company that's our first choice for that technical talent.","Frank Atkins","Okay. And last one from me, any changes in the kind of traditional September quarter billing slush or spend as a result of \u2013 how can I put it, actually the dramatic election cycle here?","Lawrence Prior","Yes. So I've been a bit cynical about what was our traditional budget flush of years ago and as I've tracked it year-to-year and as you've seen, I don't know, five or six CRs, government is more rationable about ratably spending their material buys. And you'll have some element that they will do something in the last month, they'll do something in the last quarter.","I mean we've had a couple of customers, yes, they moved it in July and we helped them with it. I think the quarter in September is far more important relative to awards of new business and setting the table for the next six months of our fiscal year as well as for FY 2018.","Now my view is, Dave is looking along with our whole team at the second quarter, we'll work our upside, down side, we will work our initiatives around any materials that might help with the quarter. But I see it as a second order issue compared to getting a book-to-bill way north of one three and helping set the future of our company as well as our industry. And I think for ourselves and our peers, it feels like a normal quarter.","Frank Atkins","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Stuart Davis","Amy, it looks like that we don't have any more questions, so I think that's going to conclude our call for today. I want to thank you Amy for your assistance with today's call, and I want to thank all of you who were able to join for your interest in CSRA, and will hope to see you out there on the road someday soon.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.","Stuart Davis","Thank you, William, and welcome, everyone, to today's quarterly earnings conference call. Larry Prior, our CEO; and Dave Keffer, our CFO, are here to discuss our financial results, business momentum and forward outlook. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call.","Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, please note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. For a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K for May.","In addition, the statements represent our views as of today, and subsequent events may cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.","Finally, as shown on Slide 3, we'll discuss some non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. The slide deck for today's call includes the reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Larry, who'll begin on Slide 4.","Lawrence Prior","Thank you, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm pleased to report a very strong quarter delivered by the CSRA team. We're ahead of consensus on all of our financial metrics. Revenue growth is accelerating, and we maintained our rock solid commitment to financial discipline.","On a year-over-year basis, revenue is up 7%. Adjusted EBITDA is up 7%, and adjusted diluted EPS is up 27%, including the benefit of tax reform and 11% excluding tax reform so positive momentum across the board.","Dave will do a deep dive on the quarterly financial results. I want to focus on our 4 key high-level drivers of our results, our business development model, our diversified customer portfolio, our strategic positioning and, of course, the positive impact of the Trump tax reform.","First, sustained business development success is driving our top line growth, and we continue to demonstrate our ability to compete in the market. In what is typically the slowest quarter for awards, we achieved $1.6 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. This is our 12th straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our trailing 12 months book-to-bill ratio is 1.7.","Consistent with our strategy, the awards for the quarter are all about leveraging innovation and new technology for mission success. For example, our largest award was as $677 million recompete of our work to operate, maintain and develop the traffic flow management system for the FAA.","Under the new contract, Fran Casey and the TFMS team will incorporate the FAA's next-generation future technologies program to minimize delays and to increase air safety. CSRA is committed to supporting the FAA's next-generation air traffic management system, and we're really honoured to continue the partnership.","New business wins in the quarter totaled about $0.5 billion, and our win rate on new business was 44%, again well above our target rate of 25%. The key new business win was the $238 million enterprise service desk for the Department of Veterans Affairs. This takeaway win spearheaded by [indiscernible] on the program side and our Rebecca Miller on the BD side, represents the VA's first migration of critical services to a managed service environment.","As we stand up our enterprise service desk for IT services and support, we've already hired about 500 people, mostly at our Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana, as well as another shared delivery center in Barbourville, Kentucky.","This transformational program builds on our more than 25 task orders supporting the VA, ranging from providing cloud services to digitizing millions of veterans records. We are totally committed to supporting the VA in their mission to improve medical care for our veterans and to serve veterans and their families.","We also received a 2-year $62 million award to support the U.S. citizenship and immigration services customer engagement center. With this award, CSRA is now the sole provider of these services to the center, which accepts more than 12 million inquiries for citizenship and immigration information annually.","To meet the demand of this program, we could add up to 700 people in our shared delivery centers. We remain convinced that the ITC in the Barbourville facility provide us competitive advantage. Our customers increasingly recognize that leveraged delivery enhanced by innovative automation improves both the efficiency and service quality.","What's more, shared delivery centers can make meaningful contributions to the local communities. And last week we are proud that the Bossier Chamber of Commerce recognized the ITC as its business of the year.","Based on our leading forward indicators, we expect to continue our business development success as far as we can see. At the end of the third quarter, we had $12 billion in submits outstanding, including about $8 billion in new work awaiting decision.","This included 16 new opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. Proposal activity has been very robust over the last quarter, and we expect the fourth quarter to be our largest in terms of submit activity.","That brings me to my second point. We see our diversified customer portfolio as a major strength. As is evident from this quarter's wins, the federal civil market is very active, and we offer it a compelling value. Civil customers have demonstrated a greater propensity to adopt next-gen technologies, which is one of the reasons that we're a leader in cloud and AI.","In addition, because we address the entire federal government market at scale, we're able to pursue more enterprise-wide IT mega deals than competitors who are focused on a single market segment. Our broad-based view of the market is also a key enabler of robust mutually beneficial relationships with leading technology providers.","Take our relationship with Amazon Web Services as an example. Last month, we achieved managed service provider partner status for the second consecutive year after our rigorous third-party audit of more than 100 controls. We're also an AWS premier consulting partner, given our significant investment in our AWS practice and extensive experience consulting on and deploying Amazon solutions, and much of that experience is in the civil sector.","For example, the FAA just announced that the registered more than 1 million civilian drone pilots. CSRA developed the drone registry system and has supported it over the past 2 years using a FedRAMP compliant AWS hosting environment.","This program is a clear success story for CSRA and Amazon. Beyond the FAA, we're supporting AWS solutions at the VA, the EPA, HHS, NASA, the SEC and many others.","Similarly, we're a Microsoft Gold partner with competencies in application development, application integration, cloud platform and cloud productivity, collaboration and content, hosting, data platform and messaging. We're working several large opportunities jointly with good collaboration and co-investment.","The foundation of that partnership stems from our work implementing an integrated Microsoft Office 365 dedicated cloud for the State of California. With over 100,000 users and stringent HIPAA-compliant security controls, the California system is one of the largest, most complex Microsoft deployments to date. In addition, we've deployed 60,000 seats of Microsoft's full collaboration platform for the FAA using a fixed unit rate service model.","We're also extending our strategic cloud partners to include Google. The Google Cloud platform and G suite applications offer compelling, next-generation and AI-based solutions for federal customers. The genesis of the partnership is our cancer genomics cloud for the National Cancer Institute that leverages Google's high-performance computing services. Our solution allows clinicians and biologists to efficiently ask impactful questions across the vast database of cancer patient and treatment data.","Our reach across the whole of government market differentiates us in the eyes of our partners and because of it, we received preferred pricing and access to the best talent for joint pursuits.","With the administration clearly prioritizing the defense and intelligence markets, we have invested in the national security space through the acquisition of Praxis and NES, but we see organic growth in our civil portfolio as well. A strong civil business is not only consistent with our strategy but integral to it, which brings me to my third point.","We believe that by aggressively pursuing our long-term strategy, we're well positioned for continued success.","We're the leader in next-generation IT delivery for the federal government just as the government is increasingly looking to harness, the transformational power of the cloud.","On last year's Q3 call, we are articulated a strategy that has fundamentally guided us to drive sustainable, industry-leading, organic growth across the federal government market through customer intimacy, rapid innovation and outcome-based experience.","In the lead up to our fiscal year 2019, we have validated that strategy. For example, the Department of Defense is now aggressively moving out on cloud adoption in ways that were unthinkable a year ago. The Modernizing Government Technology Act is now law, and the government is committed to technology modernization.","Earlier today, I spoke at ServiceNow Federal Forum, and I can attest to the tremendous interest in automation, realtime analytics, machine learning and cloud-based IT services among the government technology community. We're seeing an accelerating demand for next-generation technology and an increasing readiness on the part of our customers to embrace agile contracting methods.","In response to this demand, our primary strategic imperative for the next 3 years is to build up platforms with our innovative partners that deliver mission outcomes through modern IT.","Over the past year, through our business development success and strategic focus, we won key top contracts and built important capabilities that will serve as platforms to deliver cloud and next-generation IT services over the coming decade.","For example, Q2's large IT engineering recompete in the Intel community can provide the managed services platform for the federal government where we integrate hybrid cloud and ServiceNow into an insight-driven service catalog that leverages both automation and AI.","Similarly, we are building a repeatable platform to help customers define their path to the cloud across architecture, security, app dev, business processes and workload migration. And we're doing it with an integrative and powered by milCloud 2.0, the FAA cloud and our other cloud transformation programs.","Over the last few months, we made tremendous progress on the milCloud 2.0 program. We completed the installation and the configuration of our cloud infrastructure at Maxwell Air Force Base and at Tinker Air Force Base, and we expect to receive an authority to operate next week, a full month ahead of schedule.","We're currently showcasing the milCloud 2.0 launch at the AFCEA West conference in San Diego, and we're getting an amazing response. As the world's first on-premise commercial cloud solution for DoD, milCloud 2.0 lays the foundation that can revolutionize how the Department of Defense deploys IT services, develops advanced capabilities and unleashes the power of agile computational resources and advanced data analytics.","We are seeing positive signs for a 2 year funding deal that raises both defense and non-defense spending, which will provide a wonderful platform for growth. Just as important, the government is putting new emphasis on emerging technologies like elastic computing, data management and analytics, cybersecurity and machine learning.","With a focus on IT as a driver of efficient mission outcomes, the government will increasingly move to outsourcing in the public-private partnership arrangements with a bias towards fixed-price outcome-based procurements. Over the long-term, we are rock solid on our commitment to growth with margins in our target range. We have the right strategy, and we are executing on it.","And finally, fourth, CSRA and its shareholders will be a major beneficiary for the recently enacted tax reform. Our effective tax rate under the old code was typically in the mid to high 30s, including federal state local taxes. Under the new tax code, we'll end up with a long-term all-in rate in the mid-20s, a gain of more than 10 percentage points.","In the normal course of planning, we're investing in our people and our solutions, especially around platforms. The new tax rate derisks that investment and buttresses our ability to remain on the leading edge of technology. The majority of the tax reform savings will fall to the bottom line. We'll stay sensitive to competitive forces in the marketplace, but we did not expect this benefit to be competed away.","Our commitment to cost discipline, modern IT delivery through managed services and outcome-based contracting will allow us to lower cost for our government customers even as we defend our margins. The additional cash that we generate will further drive earnings and shareholder returns through our balanced capital allocation plan.","No Dave will provide more detail on the financial results, as well as the forward outlook.","David Keffer","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a strong quarter on all fronts, and our momentum continues into the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 5, in the income statement. As we indicated on our last call, we've really turned a corner on revenue with year-over-year revenue up for the second straight quarter.","Revenue for the quarter was $1.31 billion, up 7% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. We had growth in both of our segments, as well as growth on both an organic basis and through our recent acquisition. The largest contributors of year-over-year growth for our emergency call center support for FEMA at about $50 million and the NES and Praxis acquisitions.","We also benefited from expansion of several recent wins, including OPM background investigations, C-comm [ph] logistics support, CMS HIGLAS and EPA infrastructure. As another indicator of our growth momentum, third quarter revenue was up 3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. This is in sharp contrast to our normal quarterly progression. Increased leave taking in the December quarter generally dampens revenue by about 3%.","The contract mix moved noticeably toward fixed-price and time and material contracts and away from cost-plus contracts, driven by the NES business and the FEMA call center support contract. About 47% of third quarter revenue was on fixed-price contracts, 27% on time and material contracts and 27% on cost-plus contracts. As Praxis reaches its full run rate and FEMA declines from its Q3 run rate, we'll likely return to a mix more in line with where we have been running.","Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $16 million, up $8 million sequentially and $11 million from last year's Q3 EACs. This performance helped spur [ph] adjusted EBITDA, which was $201 million and was up 7% year-over-year.","The adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4% was still above our long-term target. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some GAAP items, most notably $8 million of book loss on the sale of our corporate headquarters and $4 million of cash expense for acquisition, integration and other costs.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.56, up 27% from the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. Consistent with our definition, this excludes GAAP pension income of $20 million and acquisition-related intangible amortization of $15 million. Most of the key line items between EBITDA and EPS have been very consistent.","Interest expense was $29 million in the quarter, and depreciation and amortization excluding acquisition-related intangible amortization was $44 million. Both of these measures are within a couple million dollars of their sequential and year-over-year compares.","The major change driver is the tax line, and we have two factors in play. First, we revised our forecast to the R&D tax credit for the year, which took our projected FY '18 tax rate from just over 36% to just under 35%.","To offset the higher tax rates booked in the first two quarters, the Q3 tax rate before the impact of tax reform was 31.5%. Using this rate, adjusted EPS excluding tax reform would have been $0.49, up 11% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.","Second, tax reform dramatically lowered our long-term tax liability and offered a onetime benefit in the third quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was negative 64%, which includes the benefit of $101 million associated with our net deferred tax liabilities at the end of the quarter and makes the year-to-date rate, excluding that benefit, equally effective tax rate expected for fiscal year 2018. Because it's truly a onetime item, the adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.56 excludes the $101 million pickup from net deferred tax liabilities.","Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $157 million and free cash flow was $133 million. The strong result keeps us on track to reach our free cash flow guidance for the year. Cash flow in the quarter benefited from the reimbursement for the $25 million payment we made last year related to a CSC divestiture.","Days sales outstanding for the quarter were 59 days. We expect to shave a couple days off DSOs over time. The $33 million of growth cash proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction are not included in operating or free cash flow and do not impact DSO. Still, it is a real - it is real cash that we collected and have applied to debt pay down.","On the last call, I indicated that we were evaluating plans to secure additional financing to fund the Praxis acquisition and refinance our shortest-duration term loans. At the end of the quarter, we entered into a third amendment to our credit agreement, which increased the Term Loan B Facility by $200 million and extended the maturity dates of the Tranche A2 and revolving credit facilities by 1 year. With the additional $200 million of debt, we've now paid off the entire $700 million revolver so we retain significant financial flexibility.","As of December 29, 2017, we had $80 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.7 billion in debt excluding capital lease obligations. Consistent with what Larry said, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation model over time.","On to the forward outlook. As we approached the end of our fiscal year, we have modified guidance as shown on Slide 7. We're leaving the free cash flow range intact and narrowing and increasing the remaining ranges.","We now project fiscal year 2018 revenue between $5.15 billion and $5.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA between $805 million and $825 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $2 and $2.05 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million.","Looking at the midpoints of guidance, we've increased our revenue range by $75 million, the adjusted EBITDA range by $30 million and the adjusted diluted EPS range by $0.09. At the guidance midpoints, fiscal year 2018 revenue will be up 4% compared to fiscal year 2017. Adjusted EBITDA would be up 3%. Adjusted diluted EPS would be up 6%, and free cash flow would be up 8%.","Implied guidance for our fourth quarter is for revenue to be up 9% and adjusted diluted EPS to be up 8% on a year-over-year basis. The guidance incorporates the immaterial impact of the short - January government shutdown and assumes no future shutdowns occur.","Our experience is that most of our work continues unabated and that the largest impact of any shutdown is a temporary low in contract awards and cash collections. We'll formally introduce guidance for fiscal year 2019 on our call in May.","Based on our current forecast, we see an opportunity for FY '19 to produce organic growth, augmented by the full year effect of NES and Praxis. EBIT margins will likely be at or above the top of our long-term range of 14% to 15%, and we see the potential for solid EPS growth, particularly driven by tax reform.","Now back to you Larry for some closing remarks.","Lawrence Prior","Thanks, Dave. I've often stressed our leadership role in taking technology innovations to our government customers. To that end, back in July, our Chief Technology Officer, Yogesh Khanna, hosted a call with the analyst and investor community about the state of cloud technology within the U.S. federal government.","Congratulations to Yogesh. He was just recognized by SCW as one of the top 100 leaders in federal IT, and he's been planning our next call for March the 13th with a focus on data analytics and artificial intelligence, which is one of the most promising technology areas for government adoption, especially when coupled with cloud transformation.","Dave Vennergrund, who leads our data science and artificial intelligence practice area will lead the call, and he'll be joined by leaders from two of our key partners. Annie Hickel [ph] Product Director for Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services and Dan Turchin, he is the Co-founder of Astound, formally known as Neva, whose AI platform is an emerging leader in service management. Look for our press release next week announcing the call in details for our March 13 meeting. We hope that you can all join us.","With that, operator, we're ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questioner today will be Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Caso","Good evening. Congratulations. Can you help a little bit with the organic growth numbers, what they were Q3? What's implied in Q4? Thank you.","David Keffer","Sure, Ed. The organic growth in Q3 was a couple percent, and we'd expect another point or 2 in the fourth quarter.","Edward Caso","Okay. Larry, you mentioned a few times about selling out capacity in your various centers. Where are you on that? Do you have capacity? Are you starting to open other geographies?","Lawrence Prior","We've not opened other geographies. We did add a second building in Bossier City where we do call center work. And then you'll remember when we first down there we were tenants and what's called the Cyber Innovation Center, and we\u2019re still using capacity there, have room for expansion.","We want to be very cautious as we think about the next state. We've got some expansion room, and I think that density is a wonderful thing, and we'll continue to get real efficiency out of the facilities there.","Edward Caso","Next question, just so we\u2019re really clear, the tax rate that\u2019s implied in the adjusted \u2013 in the $0.56 here for in third quarter and what the tax rate will be in the fourth quarter?","David Keffer","Sure. That tax rate, that gets us to the $0.56 number in Q3 is around around 23%. That's what you'd see in the GAAP statements if you back out the $101 million deferred tax liability adjustment.","For the fourth quarter, it will be in the low 30s, call it 32%, I think would be a reasonable modeling estimate, and that's consistent then with the estimated full year rate, again adjusting out that deferred tax liability change.","Edward Caso","Right. Thanks.","David Keffer","Thanks.","Operator","The next questioner today will be Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes. Thank you very much. Larry, you talked about your win rate in the quarter on new work and how that's been above your target. It looks like we're looking at a pretty good budget increase on ten [ph] side next week.","Can you just talk about the addressable market for you guys is getting bigger? You're winning more work than you thought you would. What's the upside potential maybe over the next couple of years from a top line standpoint?","Lawrence Prior","Yes. I think we're going to test that CAGR as you heard the implied rate that Dave highlighted for fourth quarter where you're starting to go above mid single digits. We've always had in our design that we were going to bid enough with the proper win rate to allow us to cast that mid to higher single-digit kind of growth after.","If the Senate is successful in the kind of budget increases they're talking about, that's an increase in spending of roughly $300 billion over the next 2 years. These are large and sustained increases. They're talking about an additional $80 billion in 2018 for the Defense Department, another $85 billion in 2019. And it's matched by the Senate Democrats pushing for $63 billion in 2018 for non-defense and raising that to $60 billion in 2019.","So the uplift from the market is, as we said is powerful. It seems to be well supported. There are surrounding issues. It's going to be noisy. But I think day is done, I've been saying you'll see an omnibus. You'll see an increase in funding and our frontloading and our emphasis on business development and just the great performance by Jorge Vasquez and our group EVPs have really good timing to take advantage of that upswing in the market.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes. Okay. I appreciate that. I guess when the budget does come out next week, what's your team going to be looking for specifically? I mean, are there things that we should be monitoring, whether it be certain agencies or certain programs? What should we be looking for?","Lawrence Prior","So what you're looking for in the next week is the busting of the budget caps, the extension of what is allowable under debt. They may take till March 23 with the CR to write the 12 appropriations bills that would be folded into an omnibus. So I think it may take a bit longer to get to the details that everybody is looking to see.","As you look at the appropriations bills forming in an omnibus. I mean, what we need first is setting the budget caps, breaking sequestration and raising the debt limits, and that's well underway. It will be under the rubric, the organizational structure of a CR and give themselves until mid-to-late March to fully flush out an omnibus.","But what we'll be looking for is - think of the strong voice in the Defense Department right now, unleashing the power of agile computational resources and advanced data analytics. That's a quote from Deputy [indiscernible] So what we'll be looking for is the funding around federal IT and seeing the emphasis around cyber, around cloud and around data analytics.","Joseph DeNardi","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And the next questioner today will be Matt McConnell with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Matt McConnell","Thanks. Good evening.","Lawrence Prior","Hi, Matt.","Matt McConnell","Sorry if I missed it, but what were the new business submissions in the quarter? And there are new run rate that you have in mind for the next couple of quarters? I know it's sort of kind of $4 billion a quarter, but you've been above that recently. Is there a new run rate that we should be thinking about?","Lawrence Prior","Yes. So there will be variance by quarter, so don't think that it's ratable over the course of the year. And in my comments, I've talked about, we're really going to be doing a lot more submits in the fourth quarter than we did in the third. And Stuart, if you have any more color?","Stuart Davis","Sure. We were again - as Larry estimated, a little below that run rate in the third quarter. We were between $1 billion to $2 billion in new business submits in that quarter, but are expecting a very heavy submits for the fourth quarter and makeup background.","Matt McConnell","Okay. All right. Great. And then Larry, you just kind of maintaining pricing power given some of the lower tax rates. How do you have conviction around that you can maintain price or are there areas of the business that you think could face some incremental price pressure? Just how do you ensure that this tax benefit end up dropping to your bottom line?","Lawrence Prior","So I was making the case that we're going to guard our margins and our profitability. Our focus is still to lower our cost to the government, especially in fixed-price contracts and doing it first through leverage services, so one of the core advantages of the ITC is the same people supporting multiple contracts and leveraging technology.","Second the use of automation, as I, said at the Salesforce conference this morning. Anytime, we changed out remedy and put in salesforce, we get savings of 60% to 90% of labor front, and we're able to redeploy that talent to other programs.","So conops [ph] for delivering elastic rate cards with consumption buying allows you to protect your profitability. Now you're not building up your headcount at the rate that some of our peers would think is necessary, but you're giving yourselves competitive advantage as you price these fixed-price contracts that are focused on delivery.","Stuart Davis","And one kind of poster child [ph] for exactly that dynamic, Matt, is our biggest new business win in this quarter, where you look at the VA enterprise service desk where it was managed service delivery and able to hit very attractive price in the center of margins.","Matt McConnell","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next questioner will be Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jeffries. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you. Good evening.","Lawrence Prior","Hi, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hey, guys. Maybe can you get a bit more specific. Is it fair to say NES and Praxis, Praxis contributed about $75 million to organic revenue? And then just on the pipeline into Q4, you are forecasting a stronger Q4 in terms of organic growth and exiting the year? Maybe you can talk about what some of the drivers are there.","Lawrence Prior","I think your numbers are in the right ballpark, Sheila. The NES and Praxis revenues, as we've said before, we're in the ballpark of 1 times their purchase prices, which gives you a sense for the quarterly run rates, which gets you in the ballpark and the number you mentioned, which leads to a couple of points of organic growth in the third quarter and better for you even then that in the fourth quarter.","We talked about some of the recent wins that have driven organic growth during this year, and we'll continue to, as we look at Q4 and beyond, OPM elements, as the EPA program, CMS HIGLAS wins these are great programs wins over the past year. We've talked about milCloud a number of times now, and that's not only a critical program for delivery, but also one that can help them expand our business profile.","So it's a series of programs that have driven year-to-date growth in some of those same ones, plus wins like the VA managed service, win that Stuart mentioned a moment ago that we had in the third quarter will really begin to ramp up nicely in Q4 and into '19.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","And then just on the deals, how are they tracking in terms of intervention [ph] are they starting to contribute to the big [ph] pipeline?","Stuart Davis","Yes. I mean, we were going for revenue synergy right out of the gate. So supporting like South Korea with MPLS switching to allow us to put 100 gig [ph] in the country was phenomenal, and we're coupling the best capabilities out of CSRA with all of the NES talent.","Praxis was one where we had a couple of contract vehicles where we instantly could bring the unique talent of the Praxis developers to bear and immediately go to work. So it's - they are both ahead of the acquisition plans and we think they are doing really well.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you for the color. And then just one last one. If you could just may be update us on your recompetes and what's the latest there, the major ones, Groundbreaker TSA and Warfighter?","Lawrence Prior","So I'm not going to comment on the first one, but our largest contract we won and we're off to the races doing great, and I've had my years spin back for saying too much about it so I won't. We \u2013 with impact they came out with amendment. We responded to be amendment. We think it will continue to be a long process, and we continue to perform and serve while we're doing it.","It doesn't affect this year's plan and in May, we'll take a look to see how it sets out for '19. And then with Warfighter focus, we just got a 2-year extension, so both Raytheon, ourselves are extended on that, and we thought that was very helpful.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great. Thank you.","Lawrence Prior","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Joseph Vafi with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Joseph Vafi","Hey, guys. Sorry about that.","Lawrence Prior","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Vafi","Good results. Just one for Larry to start. Perhaps, we've had Bossier City with good volume growth, both out of hurricane relief and now with this new win around citizenship. It seems like it's becoming almost a new leg of the business and business process services.","Wondering if you could kind of frame the opportunity in that kind of business process world, especially on competitive landscape, given the kind of lower-cost geography down there? And then I have a follow-up one Dave.","Lawrence Prior","Actually with the FEMA work, we centered that in, in Falls Church, and the competitive advantage was the software-as-a-service automation tool that we used. A lot of our focus here was a much larger bilingual population. So we were able to stack it effectively and use the automation tools to great advantage both in terms of quality, as well as in our pricing strategy.","I think we see this virtual cycle where we're hiring people into call center process work. We're able to work in Bossier City as an example with the community college to get the search that allow them to do service desk support from tier 0 working their way up to stack.","Again, it's richly enabled by a robust service malpractice. And what you'll see are the folks that are in that Tier 2 Tier 3 stack port pretty well over to either working dev ops or start doing development. So we think it's healthy, and it's something that we're going to continue to invest in automation to give ourselves advantage both in terms of quality and in pricing.","Joseph Vafi","Okay. And then maybe one - maybe 1.5 for Dave. Dave, it sounds like when you are concluding your remarks you are talking about some EBITDA numbers preliminarily and fiscal '19 above the range, I was wondering what if you could preliminarily talk about what might be driving that and then, why cash flow didn't move as much as earnings based on the new tax rate? Thanks a lot.","David Keffer","Sure, Joe. On the first question around FY '19, as we mentioned on the call, we provided some kind of initial color on '19, but May is really the call where we\u2019ll get into a lot of detail and discussion of '19 in terms of why we will continue to be at or above that guidance range.","Certainly, it's the same drivers that have gotten us here. It's the strength of the fixed-price business profile, the execution against those contracts and the fact that we've invested prudently and had nice new wins coming in and executing well with opportunities for margin expansion on many of those. So it's the same drivers that have driven performance above that range to date.","And on your second question, around cash flow, yes, we got a pretty broad cash flow guidance, we hope that the minor impact this year from tax reform would push us higher in that range than we otherwise would have been, but didn't see a meaningful enough change from it to move the guidance range.","Joseph Vafi","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And the next questioner today will be Frank Atkins from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Frank Atkins","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask first on any changes in the labor market in terms of the wages, trends out there, attrition or your ability to attract and retain. You spoke a little bit about some of the developmental efforts, but any other color out there you could provide would be great?","David Keffer","We're not experiencing anything out of the norm. So whether it's the clearance process, whether it's time to fill, it's fairly consistent with what we've experienced over the last couple of years.","I mentioned the win for the VA. We were able to staff 500 folks fairly quickly. We had robust retinue of our own team working it. FEMA was a dramatic ramp and then for a couple of our Intel programs both in the D.C. area as well as supporting them out of Bossier City city. So no, I am not seeing anything too far out of the norm.","Lawrence Prior","I mean, our attrition rates have remained fairly steady in the mid-teens, and the kind of year-over-year wage inflation has been in the low single-digit kind of numbers.","David Keffer","And we did find a merry poll last year, and we're going to do one next year. And we thought most of the tax benefits dropped immediately to the bottom line. We had budgeted for that merit increase and found offsetting reductions elsewhere in the overhead. So we think we bullet proof the plan, and we're in pretty good shape.","Frank Atkins","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And with some of the tax changes and the impact of free cash flow, does that change your view in terms of allocation of dollars towards M&A and debt pay down and all going forward?","David Keffer","Frank, it's Dave. Our view is it doesn't meaningfully change our capital allocation priorities. We continue to have a view toward a balanced capital deployment plan over time. And having looked at tax reform in some details, it really don't seem that should move the needle on our plans at this point.","Frank Atkins","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Lawrence Prior","Thanks, Frank.","Operator","And our next questioner will be Krishna Sinha with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Krishna Sinha","Hi. I was wondering if you could help bridge to the new adjusted EBITDA guidance. So it's plus $30 million from the previous midpoint. It seems like $10 million or so of that is from better-than-expected EACs. So what's the rest of that increase?","David Keffer","Sure. So we've been trending toward the higher end of our EBITDA range throughout the year. Q3 was a very strong execution quarter, as we mentioned, with EACs another strong program performance. We anticipate that continuing into the fourth quarter and therefore see a healthy increase in the EBITDA guidance ranges as the appropriate update as a result.","Lawrence Prior","I think if you go back to the Q2 call, Dave said we should be at or perhaps or even slightly above the EBITDA range for the year.","Krishna Sinha","Okay. Can you give us the inorganic contribution?","David Keffer","Not material to that change.","Krishna Sinha","Okay. Do you expect EACs to return to normal level? You said they were about $8 billion more than what you typically get. So is that something that's going to normalize going forward?","David Keffer","Over time, they certainly will. We wouldn't expect this quarter's run rate in every quarter. It will be one of those things a little bit lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But with strong continued performance, we will continue to see occasional quarters with upside like the one that we just posted, and a number of those that you posted inception to date.","Krishna Sinha","Okay. And then just real quick on Warfighter. You mentioned you got a 2-year extension. Is that just a bridge at current rates? Or is that like a total recompete where you had to submit a new bid and take any risk reserve and start benchmarking to new EACs and all that sort of stuff?","Lawrence Prior","That's just a bridge of the current contract and extension of the current contract or current subcontract as it were. The recompete procurements will continue to come out over the next couple of years in various pieces, and we'll participate at various ways in those recompetes.","Operator","And our next questioner today is Brian Ruttenbur with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Brian Ruttenbur","Yes. Thank you very much. Another question on tax real quick. As I calculated, we'll have an additional, is that correct, $40 million to $50 million annually in '19 of cash. Is that a correct ballpark calculation?","David Keffer","I think that's a reasonable ballpark estimate, yes. We'll get into more detail on that in our May call. But for today's purposes, based on what we know today, I think that's a reasonable ballpark.","Brian Ruttenbur","Okay. And the tax rate will go on the run rate basis from the mid-30s to 23, 24, 25, 26? What is the number? I've heard a couple.","David Keffer","You're in the right range. It's something we're continuing to evaluate. If there is the statutory rate change in the many other much more minor changes we're all that up now to see we're the final rate will come out, but something in the mid 25s. We think 25% is a reasonable planning factor. We'll end up being the right way to look at it.","Brian Ruttenbur","Okay. And then internal growth, do you think you can sustain this level of internal growth, given all the factors out there, roughly 4% internal growth?","David Keffer","Right. As we said we think FY '19 shows us an opportunity for another organic growth year, and we're getting to more details on that on the May call but we feel great about the trailing book-to-bill at 1.7 times and nice wins like the ones we talked about on the call today at VA and elsewhere. So we need to sustain that stronger business momentum through the fourth quarter and into FY '19 and beyond.","Lawrence Prior","Robust budget and business development on top of it, we feel pretty bullish.","Brian Ruttenbur","Very good. And then last question on acquisitions and leverage. This has been asked a couple of different ways, but in terms of a additional acquisition, do you feel comfortable taking on additional leverage given the environment if you have the right situation? I know you have the capacity.","Lawrence Prior","I said last call, our focus is on integrating wells [ph] NES and Praxis, making sure we're working all of the revenue synergies that those business cases provided, and we'll keep our hand tight for the moment.","Brian Ruttenbur","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And the next questioner today will be Lucy Guo with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. ","Lucy Guo","Hi. It's Lucy on for Gautam.","Lawrence Prior","Hi, Lucy.","Lucy Guo","Hi. So I'm sorry if I missed this. I joined the call late, but can you \u2013 two questions. First, can you talk about whether the 2% or so of organic growth in Q3 included any FEMA work?","David Keffer","Yes. FEMA was one of the contributors to organic growth in the quarter. We did talk about that during our scripted comments. But program continues, and we feel like we're doing a great job for that customer and, obviously, a very critical mission area.","Lucy Guo","And secondly, just once again better understanding or maybe some qualitative color on the progression of margins heading into next year and how do you see that correlate with the ground breaker recompete kind of saving in?","Lawrence Prior","So we're not going to comment on that recompete besides that the programs starting off well, and we think we've got a lot of room to manoeuvre there.","David Keffer","As we said at the end of our scripted comments, we see EBIT margin likely to be at or above the high end of our long-term guidance range of 14% to 15% next year, and we'll be happy to provide more detail as we get out of that May call and have a couple more months of analysis between us now and then.","Lucy Guo","Sounds good. Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will be a follow-up from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Thanks for taking the follow up. Larry or maybe for Dave, you guys said at the higher win rate, the extension on Warfighter, can you just talk about what you're revenue visibility into next year at this point, may be how much you guys have on the books?","David Keffer","Without providing guidance for next year, we can't get into revenue visibility, what we can say is we see - we have comparable visibility as we look next year to what we had this year and the year prior. It's - there's new business to be won, there is small volume of recompetes, so we have a great very visible backlog of current contracts as well. So we'll get into much more detail on that on the May call.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Fair enough. Larry, you mentioned the shift of outsourcing from the government and your strategy to use lower costs as a way to facilitate that. It seems like competing away tax reform has become the dirty word on Wall Street.","But the other way to look at it is you can use tax reform to maybe accelerate or make the argument even more compelling for the customer to outsource more by offering them a more attractive value proposition. Can you just talk about whether you agree with that view or not?","Lawrence Prior","I think your focus is on having a competitive concept of operations where you use leveraged services and fixed-price contracts, an element of which relies on a rate card where there's elasticity and they do consumption based buying and everything is fixed-price, and it's all managed services and outcome-based.","I see that as a way to lower the price and the cost for their government, while you're defending your margins and really improving, but not just the financial framework for your business, but improving the quality of the technical depth as you build capacity through leveraging services. I think that's core and that's where the government is going.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you.","Lawrence Prior","Thank you.","Operator","And there looked to be no further questions. So this will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Stuart Davis for any closing remarks.","Stuart Davis","William, we wanted thank you for your assistance in today's call. And to all of our listeners and participants on the call, thank you for your interest in CSRA.","Operator","And the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.+++++ "],"6313":["CSRA Inc. (NYSE:CSRA) Q3 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call February 10, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Stuart Davis - VP, Investor Relations and Strategy","Lawrence Prior - President and Chief Executive Officer","David Keffer \u2013 EVP and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Company","Amit Singh - Jefferies","Tyler Scott - Wells Fargo","Operator","Good day and welcome to the CSRA Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead, sir.","Stuart Davis","Thank you. Welcome everyone to today's quarterly earnings conference call, our first as a public company. Larry Prior, our CEO and Dave Keffer our CFO are here to discuss our financial results, business momentum and forward outlook. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website where you will also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. The information contained in the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation is preliminary and unaudited.","Turning to slide one of the presentation, please note that during this call we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. Two risks are highlighted on slides one and two and for a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties please refer to our SEC filings including our form 10-Q which we expect to file early next week.","In addition, the statements represent our views as of today and subsequent events may cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. Finally, as shown on slide three, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics which we believe provide useful information for investors. Unless specifically called out, all statements on the call reference pro forma adjusted figures. The slide deck for today's call includes an explanation of those adjustments and other reconciliations of the figures to the most comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Larry who will begin on slide four.","Lawrence Prior","Thanks, Stuart. Good afternoon everybody. On behalf of the 19,000 employees of CSRA I want to thank you for taking the time to participate on this call and for your interest in CSRA. I am proud of the accomplishments of our entire team in our first quarter as a publicly traded firm.","As we stood up as a standalone company after our spinoff from CSC, completed our merger with SRA, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange and worked really aggressively to realize the synergies of our deal, both creating new business opportunities and increasing earnings, all while keeping our focus on serving our federal government customers as they implement critical IT and mission solutions for our nation.","Our third quarter results support our overall investment thesis and build a strong foundation for our long-term earnings model. Specifically, I want you to take away three key messages from the quarterly results. First, although revenue is a little light, we believe we are set up well to turn toward sustainable organic revenue growth. Second, EPS was very strong as we maintained our industry-leading profitability and aggressively delivered synergy savings from our SRA merger, and third, taking advantage of our strong cash flow model, we initiated share repurchase and dividend programs to deploy capital to generate additional shareholder returns.","Now I'll explore each of these areas in a little bit more detail. Key takeaway number one, as I said revenue was slightly below our expectations, but it was consistent with our performance in the first half of the year or down about 5% year-over-year. Entering the quarter, we believed there was a reasonable chance that would reach resolution on the Maryland Medicaid Enterprise Restructuring Project or MERP.","Although we do expect to record a gain at some point in the future, we have now taken it out of our projections. That said, our long-term outlook on revenue is very positive. At the midpoint of our guidance fourth quarter revenues would be up 3% sequentially building a very strong foundation headed into the new fiscal year.","We're not ready to call the precise moment of the upturn, but we believe we are testing our floor. Several factors give us conviction around this view. Most important, CSRA booking trends are robustly positive. In the third quarter, we booked more than $1.8 billion in contract awards, and as far as I can tell, our third quarter book-to-bill ratio 1.4 times leads our industry. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of one times or greater.","Given the variability in the timing of awards we believe that the trailing 12 months bookings is the best leading indicator for growth and ours was 1.3 times with about a third of that being new business. With these wins we are building backlog and revenue momentum. Our combined backlog was up 6% year-over-year. Furthermore the market climate should support a return to growth. Our customers are operating with appropriated budgets that show growth.","Yesterday President Obama submitted his budget request for government fiscal year 2017 that begins on October 1. The submission was consistent with the two-year budget framework approved this past fall and we expect a stable budget environment into the fall of 2017. Despite the backdrop of a presidential election coming up, government spending should be fairly predictable. All of this supports our fundamental long-term view of revenue growth that we laid out in November. We expect over the long-term to grow revenue at an average rate of about 2% to 3% as the industry returns to growth and we take market share.","Key takeaway number two, the company is committed to controlling well what we can and delivering EPS growth. Based on strong contract performance and rock solid execution on our synergy case, we increased our industry-leading margins to drive earnings ahead of plan. Frankly, the compatibility of the two legacy companies is allowing us to realize our synergies earlier than expected.","We have already achieved our original goal of taking out $80 million of annual cost and even though most of the savings will be reflected in future reporting periods third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was above our target range of 16% to 17%. We will continue to drive additional savings as we consolidate systems and streamline our processes as part of integration. But fundamentally, we now have a team in place that will move us forward.","We will continue to prioritize the delivery of EBITDA over Cost-Plus revenue which is just a part of our DNA. Tying my first two points together, as we are trimming our infrastructure to create the most efficient government service provider, we are continuing to prioritize our investments to business development. We are driving our bid submittal volume higher and we expect to maintain positive new business awards.","The fourth quarter is already off to a great start with major takeaway wins including the $252 million infrastructure support contract with the Security and Exchange Commission. The cost synergies help support our investment in growth while improving our leading margins. With strong bookings and margins we reiterate our expectation of an average of 8% to 10% EPS growth over the next three years.","And finally key takeaway number three, one of the principal responsibilities of the CEO and Board is to deploy capital effectively. We articulated our balanced capital allocation model at our November Investor Day and we are committed both to paying down debt to enhance our financial flexibility in operating the business as well as to returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","When we see that our valuation is compelling, we will act decisively, both within our formal trading program and opportunistically when we are able. In the third quarter we bought back 37 million of our stock and a little more than two months we've returned $66 million to our shareholders. CSRA generates tremendous free cash flow and we intend to use that to support total shareholder returns.","In summary, we are delivering growing bottom line results, prudently deploying capital for our shareholders and winning new contracts at a rate that should provide good top line growth for us in the coming years.","Now Dave will go through the financials in detail and provide our forward outlook.","David Keffer","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased with our third quarter results, especially how well our team managed our costs while executing a very complex transaction. There are quite a few moving parts to the story, so let me talk through everything very deliberately and provide you with a clear view of our underlying performance.","Turning to slide five, in my remarks I'll refer to the pro forma adjusted results disclosed in our press release. These figures assume the CSC spin and SRA merger occurred at the beginning of the period and they exclude costs directly associated with either the spin or merger transaction or the ongoing integration process.","We believe the pro forma adjusted results provide useful insights into the current CSRA run rate and therefore provide an important baseline for comparing to past and future performance. Our press release provides all appropriate reconciliations from pro forma adjusted results to GAAP results.","To be as transparent as possible we'll also specifically call out items that may differ across our peer set, especially as they relate to free cash flow which we believe in a critical valuation metric. Following this call Stuart and I will be happy to discuss the financial figures in more detail.","Let's walk through the Q3 income statement from top to bottom. Pro forma revenue was $1.27 billion, down 5.1% from the same period a year ago. On a pro forma basis our Civil segment which includes Health, Homeland Security and other federal civilian agencies was up 2% year-over-year.","New program starts and expansions primarily in Health more than offset reductions and material purchases on several federal civilian contracts. Conversely our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 13% year-over-year. A major source of this decline was our Army Logistics Modernization program which is transitioning to a maintenance phase after a very successful large-scale software deployment. ","In addition, lower material purchases on Navy contracts, the sale of the Welkin business and the wind down of Army OCL work outweighed the ramp up on new intelligence programs. As is typical for the December quarter, we experienced seasonally high leave-taking due to the holidays which reduced revenue compared with the September quarter. The first three quarters of FY '16 have all been down 4% to 5% compared to FY '15.","We're guiding sequential pro forma revenue growth in Q4 and we're optimistic that these year-over-year declines will begin to moderate, particularly in light of our excellent bookings performance so far this year. Our contract mix is one of the key drivers of our margin differentiation and it was essentially unchanged in Q3. As a percentage of total revenue our contracts were 44% fixed price, 20% time and materials and 36% Cost-Plus.","Q3 pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $224 million as our EBITDA margin improved to 17.7%. Driven by both of our operating segments, this strength and profitability reflects outstanding execution across our contract base and includes profit pickups on a few of our large fixed-price contracts. Net favorable adjustments in our estimates at completion or EAC's for fixed-price contracts were $19 million in Q3, several million dollars higher than we'd expect in a normalized period going forward. Our margin performance also reflects strong direct labor content, the initial effects of our merger cost synergy program and a change in the estimation method of pension income.","Our Q3 23 pro forma adjusted EBITDA includes $4 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $28 million of net pension related income. Our frozen pension plan regularly generates income from the return on planned assets offset by expenses associated with plan obligations.","Like many companies in recent quarters, we elected in Q3 to change how we calculate the service and interest cost components of pension income using the full yield curve instead of a single point on the curve. This approach should improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and yield curve spot rates and provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.","The estimation method change was the primary driver for increased quarterly pro forma pension income of about $7 million compared with prior quarters in FY '16 and we expect to maintain this new run rate until the next measurement period this spring. As Larry indicated, we've already achieved our original target of $80 million from SRA merger cost synergies which should generate $50 million of annual EBITDA benefit after the effects of cost-plus contracts.","We plan to drive additional cost synergies over the next several months, further bolstering our long-term plan to maintain adjusted EBITDA margins in excess of 16%. This margin rate is sustainably above our peers based on our greater mix of fixed-price and T&M contracts, our pension income, our capital investments on key programs and our ability to drive lower direct and indirect costs.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $50 million on a pro forma adjusted basis in Q3. This excludes the amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog an intangible asset valued at $65 million that is being amortized over one year. As a result our GAAP amortization expense will be approximately $5.5 million higher per month than our adjusted amortization expense from December 2015 to November 2016. Compared to the 8-K we filed on Christmas Eve the funded contract backlog asset is slightly lower based on a few minor updates in the purchase price accounting. Of course, these changes to depreciation and amortization are non-cash items.","Interest expense totaled $29 million on a pro forma adjusted basis in Q3. This figure applies the effects of our post spin and post merger capital structure for the full quarter including the interest on our term loans, revolving line of credit debt and capital leases, as well as the deferred financing costs and original issue discount on the debt. To calculate pro forma adjusted earnings, we applied our expected long-term effective tax rate of 39%.","Our Q3 diluted share count was 165 million, down from our prior SEC filings due to the final share count calculations for a very complex transaction and the share repurchase program we initiated in December. Pro forma adjusted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.48.","The additional pension income associated with the change in estimation method and the lower share count added about four cents to our earnings-per-share in the quarter. Even excluding those benefits, we're very pleased with our ability to drive margins and earnings in a seasonally low quarter.","Turning to slide six and the balance sheet as of January 1, 2016, we finished the quarter with $204 million of cash, $200 million of drawn revolver, $140 million of capital leases and $2.8 billion of term loan debt. With the steady cash flows our business has generated historically and with $500 million of undrawn revolver capacity, we're pleased with the liquidity and flexibility that this capital structure affords us. And with an average interest rate currently around 3% the cost of debt is very manageable. We will look to lock in a fixed rate on a portion of our debt through our hedging program this quarter.","The other balance sheet item I'll note is the net pension liability of approximately $468 million, the vast majority of which is included in the other long-term liabilities line. This figure which is calculated based on GAAP guidelines applies a very low discount rate to the plan obligations given that interest rates remained historically low. Based on the IRS calculation methodology which uses different actuarial and interest rate assumptions our plan remains in an overfunded position and we do not expect to be required by IRS guidelines to make any material cash contributions to the plan in the next several years.","The third quarter cash flow statement reflects a number of one-time items related to the spinoff and merger transactions. First, we received funding from CSC prior to the spinoff to bring CSGov's cash balance to $300 million. Then on the dates of the spinoff and merger we received the $3 billion of new debt financing and used it to pay off SRA's existing debt and hedges, distribute the cash portion of merger consideration to SRA shareholders, fund the special dividend to CSC shareholders and pay SRA's transaction -related expenses.","Since then we have made a number of other payments related to the spinoff and merger. We paid $30 million to CSC for the first of five annual maintenance payments under the intellectual property agreement that governs our proprietary information sharing and in December we paid transaction fees to investment banks and other advisory firms in excess of $20 million.","On the working capital side, accounts receivable increased by about $20 million compared to their usual run rate due to the normal seasonal slowdown in payments. Days sales outstanding for the quarter were 55 days. Our DSOs should decline over the next few quarters due to seasonality and merger related improvements.","In all, the third quarter was unique from a cash flow perspective, but formed the foundation for our solid capital structure going forward. As these one-time adjustments fade we will focus on free cash flow which is the lifeblood of the business. In general, we expect to generate free cash flow above net income as D&A exceeds CapEx by more than the non-cash pension income.","We noted in our November Investor Day presentation that we would use a portion of our portion of our future free cash flows for shareholder returns in the form of both dividends and share buybacks. To that end, on our first day as a public company our Board of Directors established a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend which was paid in January and authorized a $400 million share repurchase program effective immediately and ending in March 2019.","We intend to deploy cash to buy back shares over time when we believe our stock is undervalued and our balance sheet is well suited to fund the payments. We kicked off the program with $37 million of share repurchases during December and another $13 million in January.","Turning to our forward guidance on slide seven, our plan in future periods is to provide annual guidance in the fourth quarter earnings report of the prior fiscal year and to update that guidance on subsequent calls as needed. We are providing Q4 guidance on this call to provide an extra degree of clarity given the complexity of our historical pro forma numbers, but will shift to annual guidance in the future. We project that our fourth quarter 2016 revenue will be between $1.28 billion and $1.33 billion which equates to a year-over-year pro forma revenue growth rate range of minus 5% to minus 1%. ","We don\u2019t currently expect that Q4 revenue should have any material adjustments so this guidance is a GAAP figure. We project that our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will be between $214 million and $226 million and our adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $0.45 and $0.49.","These guidance ranges reflect gradual improvement from our Q3 revenue performance driven in part by seasonal changes in leave-taking and the conversion of revenue on new contract awards we received in the first three quarters of FY '16. We also anticipate that our ongoing cost synergy program will incrementally improve SG&A performance in Q4.","Our guidance takes in to consideration the effect of the recent major snowstorm on the East Coast which closed government offices for a number of days. But we have attempted to mitigate that impact through teleworking and flex time programs. Our Q4 revenue guidance also includes the impact of our lowered cost structure on Cost-Plus contracts as we realize synergies. This approach is fundamental to how we make business decisions. We intend to zealously guard profit dollars even if at expense of Cost-Plus revenue.","Although not in our adjusted EBITDA or EPS guidance, integration related costs will diminish materially in the fourth quarter. FY '17 integration cost should be even smaller primarily related to our ongoing IT system integration projects.","Looking ahead to FY '17 we anticipate better year-over-year revenue growth than we have had in FY '16 driven by the strength of our book-to-bill ratio this year and the backlog growth that has resulted from it.","Although Cost-Plus revenue will continued to be suppressed slightly by expense reductions, our earnings will benefit from the full year effect of our merger synergy initiatives which will help to offset the pricing pressures to which we've become accustomed in recent years. On the cash flow side, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income consistent with our model and we will look to pay down a portion of our debt and provide shareholder returns.","We also affirm our long term model of an average compound annual growth rate in revenue of 2% to 3% and EPS of 8% to 10%. Combined with a meaningful dividend, we believe CSRA will be an attractive investment for our long-term shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back to you Larry, for some additional comments.","Lawrence Prior","Thanks Dave. Before turning to your questions, I want to take this opportunity on our first quarterly call to briefly lay out our strategy and differentiators to give you an understanding of who we are and where we\u2019re taking this company.","Let me start with how we came into being. I\u2019m now on slide eight. Splitting off of the U.S. public sector business from CSC allowed us to tune our messaging, our benefits and our go to market approach and focus it on our federal marketplace. It also allowed us to think about capital allocation differently, which enabled us to merge with SRA as part of our go public process.","SRA was a perfect fit for us and is an integral part of CSRA contributing richly to our culture and leadership team. And so it brought us broader access across the entire federal community with especially deep relationships and access in the health and federal civilian markets as well as complementary contracts in the defense and intelligence communities.","Most important is what the legacy CSGov and SRA businesses share. We share our passion for mission, a dedication to next generation IT and our firm commitment to cost discipline. Both legacy companies are dedicated to a culture and values around honesty with all of our stakeholders and service in support of our customers.","This cultural compatibility is easing the integration process and our combined team is leaning forward together taking advantages of combined capabilities in customer access to identify and to pursue newly addressable opportunities.","As shown on slide nine, I see CSRA as the premiere pure-play provider of IT services to the U.S. public sector and together we will deliver innovations, efficiencies and tailored offerings to our customers, distinct long-term investment opportunities and added value creation to our investors, scale to our strategic partners and targeted skills development and stronger career opportunities to our employees.","With more than three quarters of our work in IT, we are the company best positioned to combine deep domain expertise with the ability to lead our public sector customers into their digital future. The U.S. Federal Government is in the process of transforming its IT infrastructure and software systems with mandates such as datacenter consolidation in Cloud First in order to increase efficiency and reduce expenses.","Federal CIOs expect relatively flat IT budgets over the next few years with reductions in hardware spending based on virtualization and cloud initiatives. The capabilities we provide address the priority areas of IT investment for the Federal Government including Cloud, cyber security, data analytics, Agile based software development methodologies and inevitable modernization of the government's applications with a bias for software as a service and to mobile devices. For the Federal Government as a whole, next generation technology offerings such as Big Data and Cloud should show double-digit annual growth over the next three years.","Now turning to slide 10, several wins and program expansions demonstrate the strength of our go to market strategy. First is the Department of Homeland Security. We extended our work in support of the agency's Data Center 1 for four and a half years and added nearly $1 billion of ceiling. John [indiscernible] and his team developed creative solutions and contracting approaches to create an efficient and flexible contract focused on the as a service conception based model with access to our CSRA private cloud within the government\u2019s four walls.","Under the new contract, any DHS component can purchase a wide array of managed services, private cloud offerings, hardware and software, network and security infrastructure, app support and of course project management. This contract will help DHS evolve with technology and mission needs while meeting their highest levels of security and giving them a trusted and stable foundation to transition a next generation IT.","Second, we are beginning to ramp up the FAA cloud services contract, one of the largest cloud development opportunities in the federal market. I\u2019m incredibly proud of Peter O'Donoghue and our team which led all of our Agile developers to respond to a high visibility, short fuse requirement to development and deploy a new application, designed to register small unmanned aircraft systems or drones. It was in anticipation of a surge in drone purchases during the most recent holiday season and in just six weeks we stood up an easy to use, cloud based system to register the drones, accept payment by credit card and print registration certificates.","Now we couldn\u2019t have done it without great partners. The Amazon Web Services cloud based system linked together cutting edge technology partners like Stripe, Storm Path and Newrelic and we can support over 1.5 million registrations per hour. This effort has built tremendous credibility for CSRA with the customer and with our partners and it provides superb past performance qualifications as we bid new cloud native applications.","Third, led by Ben Gieseman, we won the recompete of our work for the administrative office of the U.S. Courts. Our customer expanded our scope to a potential value of $115 million over five years. We will provide full software development lifecycle expertise for a variety of applications supporting probation and pre-trial services and electronic court filings and we will transition all application development to the scaled Agile framework and make use of Dev\/App methodologies.","Finally, our largest new win in the quarter came from the Department of Veteran Affairs. This was a legacy SRA win spearheaded by Mark Cardarelli who heads up our VA business. On this five-year, $233 million task order, we\u2019re helping the VA move to paperless claims processing to enable quicker processing of disability benefits for our VETs. This is our first VAY [ph] program and it really provides us a natural entr\u00e9e into claims processing.","Now these examples and many more like them convinced me that CSRA will be able to meet our long-term financial goals while helping our critical customers handle emerging problems of national significance.","Operator, we are now ready to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes today from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks good afternoon guys and great results.","Lawrence Prior","Thanks.","David Keffer","Thank you, Gautam.","Gautam Khanna","A couple of questions to start, first I was wondering if you could give us some color on the bid pipeline, any metrics you have on outstanding bids, maybe what you expect to submit in the next six months? And how the bookings cadence is looking in the March quarter just given you just came off a very strong year? And then I\u2019ll follow up.","Lawrence Prior","So we\u2019ve pretty much been on track with our model where we\u2019re looking to continue to grow our qualified pipeline and really having a BD engine running on all cylinders and I think one of the things we have done a little bit differently is focus on new business in addition to the great work we do on extensions and recompetes.","David Keffer","Now Gautam, one of the things that Larry has talked about is really building up that submits volume. So we do have a large number of bids that are outstanding and waiting adjudication about $6 billion of submits in that and those jobs really fit with the pattern that we have in terms of fixed price work in terms of focus on IT and should sustain our model going forward.","Lawrence Prior","We\u2019ve done about $12 billion in bids year-to-date and of that about 68% was for new new. So you could see we\u2019re beginning to pick up some momentum and we've benefited obviously in the third quarter.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. So you've got $6 billion of outstanding bids right now, is that fair?","Lawrence Prior","Correct.","Gautam Khanna","Okay, terrific. Also I was wondering if you could talk about - you've talked about the longer term cadence of sales 2% or 3% sales growth, can you calibrate us on what fiscal '17 is apt to look like just given the known headwinds of [indiscernible] and LMP program and maybe some others, just to give us a sense for what is sun setting next year that is knowable today? And do you expect that 2% to 3% number to be kind of backend loaded over the three-year forecast period or do you think you can actually get there as early as 2017?","Lawrence Prior","Yes, it is a great question and as you look over this year you could tell we've been testing sequential growth. Q2 was up a little from Q1 and when you look at the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter we're up a little from Q3 and it really is the result of that natural tension where we're working off some of our current book of business, but creating new revenue from the BD engine. The Logistics Modernization Program, yes we're absolutely transitioning from very successful development programs to O&M.","We think the slope of decline is softened a little bit, but we absolutely have to replace that with new new work. BD is absolutely demonstrating the ability to compete win and the book-to-bill is showing it. So we think that the pivot growth is on our horizon, I just can't call the quarter in FY '17 when it will happen and we're busy working the FY '17 plan and plan to do guidance on FY '17 at the next earnings call.","On a macro level, wow! it's a solid budget picture. The President's budget was more positive than I expected and just watching the reaction of people wanting to add on to it and whether it's for OCO or the Democratic Senators thinking about the FEDSIM side, the investment in cyber, the investment of repairing legacy IT, so I thought the budget picture was very positive. Now that's intention with kind of the slow adoption rate of our federal customer for NexGen IT. They measure twice, they cut once, they put the toe in the water and if not nearly the adoption rate that we see in the commercial side, but it also doesn't have the cannibalization rate.","So fundamentally we got a timing issue. It is not a matter of if we pivot to growth, it is a matter of when. And you know, Dave and I are naturally conservative as a newly public company and we really look forward to giving you color on this at the next earnings call.","Gautam Khanna","Today can you give us any color on what the known year-to-year headwinds are in aggregate on the top line just contract? I think you've talked about on the - at the Investor Day about a 5% of sales that naturally sunsets, is that a ballpark what you are expecting in '17?","David Keffer","Hey Gautam, it is Dave. I think we'll stop short of getting into a lot of detailed numbers around that when it comes to '17 and offer more insights on that in more detail on the next earnings call. With that said, we can give you some useful context I think. As we look at the recompete picture for the year I\u2019d call it a fairly typical recompete picture, our average contract length is around five years and that would indicate that in a typical year roughly 20% would be up for recompete. As we look at '17 it's reasonable to expect that to be one of those pretty typical years. So obviously it's incumbent on us to win the vast majority of those and sustain our business base that way.","You've touched on a point that is clearly relevant. We have many large contracts, top 25 contracts are about half of our business and those are in all different phases of their life cycles. So we've talked about logistics modernization for the Army which is a maturing contract that will likely decline in FY '17 from '16.","I wouldn\u2019t say there were any that are in that exact phase of their life cycle, but we have several other that have been really outstanding performers this year in terms of both organic growth in delivering in new and creative ways for their customers as well as, as you could see in today's results, the bottom line performance and really outstanding profitability.","So as we look at '17 obviously our job is to do two things in that front, one to deliver another year of sustained organic growth on those programs and to find new ways to deliver for those customers and also to win as much new work as possible to fill the gap created by logistics modernization and other programs in that phase. So hopefully that gives you a sense for it. It is not an atypical year and it's one that we look forward to providing more specific guidance on the next call.","Gautam Khanna","I appreciate the color guys and good luck. Thank you.","David Keffer","Thank you.","Lawrence Prior","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Singh with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Amit Singh","Hi guys, congratulations again on a great quarter. And I actually just wanted to get on the margin side of the business, you did adjust EBITDA margin of 17.7%. And just to start off, you talk about some one-time contract pickups, if you could talk about how much of that helped your margins? And then going forward, you're talking about 16% plus sort of margins, but I'm trying to understand if you already have all the synergies you are thinking about getting more synergies, what could bring sort of margins down from current levels? I mean is 16% being more on the safer side?","David Keffer","Sure, it is Dave, I am happy to address that one further, so the 17.7% you mentioned the EBITDA margin in Q3 included a few things that are worth noting as we did to a degree in our scripted comments. First there were about 60 basis points of benefit from the higher pension income related to the change in calculation methodology there.","In the quarter we had a relatively small volume of cost synergies that impacted the quarter given the timing of the transaction. We'll have a few more of those impacting this quarter as we said, given that we've now achieved the initial target for synergies.","The EAC cost adjustments and overall contract profitability was really an outstanding element of the quarter, just fantastic execution on our programs and particularly on some of the large fixed price contracts. So those were $19 million worth of EAC adjustments. With that said, that's not $19 million worth of one-time items certainly.","We are a business of large fixed price contracts among other contract forms and we've had a fairly strong flow of favorable EAC adjustments given improvements in contract delivery efficiency over the last couple of years. But $19 million is not a level we would feel comfortable projecting to every future quarter by any stretch. So we've talked about several million dollars of lower expectation as we look at Q4 and beyond for those types of adjustments on fixed-price contracts.","The other element I'd mentioned is we had relatively few ODC and direct material buys in the quarter. It was a quarter of strong revenue content compared to prior quarters in prior years. If we have more of those obviously revenue would benefit and the margin would come down just a bit.","Lawrence Prior","And as we have levers to extend contracts that may be up for recompete we've generally been pretty good at it. We've got levers to defend our margins and our business model. We're doing gangbusters on the synergy case and will continue to work that every day.","As Dave mentioned, we're very focused on the execution at the program level by everyone on our team and then of course we've got Bossier City, Louisiana where we're really focused on low-cost delivery where we can couple all of the strengths of moving technical content there to gain advantages through the subsidies of the state and the tax advantages as well as favorable labor arbitrage. So when you think of those levers it gives us a lot to work with as we try to defend our margins, grow our revenue and deliver earnings.","Amit Singh","Great, and just one quickly, could you guys quantify the impact from the storm in the fourth quarter that you have on your revenue guidance?","David Keffer","It is very difficult to estimate that impact. We have \u2013 on contracts where employees are located on government sites in the DC Metro area that is obviously the most significant impact. But in this day and age many of our employees, even those typically headquartered on government site can telework and can be just as productive from a home office.","So we don't have a great way to calculate exactly the impact of that storm. What we can say is, compared to a typical year where from Q3 to Q4 there would be a nice seasonal uplift given less leave-taking in Q4 than we experienced over the holidays in Q3 the positive impact this Q4 will be more muted slightly by the snow days. Exactly how much or whether we have more snow days between now and March 31 is obviously tough to estimate.","Lawrence Prior","And then our team is really good and beginning to plan about 72 hours in front of a weather event first thinking about the safety of our employees, making sure our facilities are up and running and then we start thinking of the alternative ways to deliver work in a meaningful way to our customers and helping with our financials.","Amit Singh","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tyler Scott","Hi everybody, this is actually Tyler Scott on for Ed Caso. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to start, we\u2019ve kind of had a couple of months here with the new budget agreement of the 2017 DoD budget request out, are you seeing any change in the pace and deployment of the budget here, are your clients increasing the tempo of \u2013 or decisions, any change there?","Lawrence Prior","Oh, I think it has been consistent over the last couple of quarters where they have really all gone back to work and there has been good steady work by all the folks on the acquisition side to get proposals out to adjudicate an award. So our experience is they\u2019ve been doing a better job this year than we\u2019ve seen in the rearview mirror. On the mission side they are really busy across every agency or government. So I think just the palpable relief of a two-year budget agreement gives them all a hall pass to go to work and to be on the top of their game.","Tyler Scott","Great, also you\u2019ve had kind of a string of some pretty large wins here with the DHS, the SEC and then the VA, which I guess is in this awards number. Can you talk about the general level of competitiveness on these, what is the pricing like, any change to how the contracts are being structured, are they fixed price, cost plus or T&M?","Lawrence Prior","Yes so it\u2019s D, all the above that you will see on some of them where your initial period of time on the contract is for example with the T&M, as you are going in and doing discovery of their enterprise IT environment and then you have to think about knowledge transfer and then moving over to a delivery based contract. So we are very good at that, but it\u2019s one where you absolutely have a mix.","For Army National Guard where we do the enterprise ops in security services, I think that was fairly straightforward and consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past. With the VA, there was a wide variety, we weren\u2019t the lowest bidder, we weren\u2019t the highest bidder, but we went with a really good set of teammates as well as we thought a good technical solution.","David Keffer","I\u2019m glad actually you mentioned the DHS award because it kind of refers to something that Larry mentioned earlier. We have a number of recompetes that are coming up and in many cases, we\u2019re going to look to extend those programs where we can and where we can provide good value to our customers.","Lawrence Prior","And that\u2019s one where we\u2019re consistent with our margins as we lower our price to the customer using a consumption based model and I think that is the future where you are giving a NexGen-IT solution as they take advantage of digitization and they are buying something by the drink instead of having 10 people doing staff augmentation where they are not productive all the time.","Tyler Scott","Great and maybe if I can just sneak two more in, is there any way you could break down what the, how much of your awards this quarter were new work? I know a couple of these big ones were takeaways and then how much were recompletes? And then also what\u2019s the go forward OCO exposure maybe for the rest of this year or how much more of headwind is that going to be? Thank you.","David Keffer","So if you look in the - in our third quarter, I mean Larry gave you the kind of the year-to-date number of about 33% of our awards were for new work. If you\u2019re looking specifically in the third quarter obviously there was the nearly $1 billion extension that supports the base. So we had between $400 million and $450 million of new business as part of that mix.","Lawrence Prior","And with that the DHS award as they opened it up to 16 components it is not legally new work, but we\u2019re treating it as an opportunity to meet all of the CIOs, all of the components and deal directly with them in this new vehicle. I've got a contrarian view of OCO; that I think it's found its floor and given the complexity of the world today, I'm beginning to see early indicators it is going the other way.","So I think the size of the force in Afghanistan is stabilized. I think we're seeing some of our team increasing in some of the allied countries within the Gulf. So I'm hesitant to say it's a headwind right now and I'm just carefully watching where that cardinal direction may go.","Tyler Scott","Okay, great, thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Stuart Davis for any closing remarks.","Stuart Davis","Operator, thank you for your assistance with today's call and thank you all for your interest in CSRA. We will be out meeting with investors in New York and Boston later this month and we look forward to meeting with many of you at that time. This concludes our call for today.","Operator","Thank you very much. This concludes the call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect."],"6319":["CSRA Inc.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [OperatorInstructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Vice President for Investor Relations and Strategy. Sir, please go ahead.","Stuart Davis","Thank you, Steven, and welcome, everyone, to today's quarterly earnings conference call. Larry Prior, our CEO; and Dave Keffer, our CFO, are here to discuss our financial results, business momentum and forward outlook. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you will also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call.","Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. For a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K from May.","In addition, the statements represent our views as of today and subsequent events may cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.","Finally, as shown on Slide 3, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. The slide deck for today's call includes the reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Larry, who will begin on Slide 4.","Lawry Prior","Thank you, Stuart, and good afternoon, everybody. We began fiscal year 2018 with strong performance across the business that sets the stage for us to meet all our guided metrics for the year.","We continue to execute on the twin hallmarks of CSRA; excellent profitability and business development success. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA and EPS both exceeded consensus estimate. We also achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x, anchored by the Defense Department's MilCloud win, a $498 million cloud development and migration award that underscores our leadership position in next-generation IT.","Dave will do a deeper dive on the financials and I'll focus on four key topics: first, our view on the market; second, our leadership and next-generation IT; third, our success in business development; and forth and really important, employee engagement.","First, our view of the market. We remain convinced that the federal government market will support our growth objectives over our planning horizon. The Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate are working their process for the coming government fiscal year, which begins October 1. So far we've seen some increases in spending and some decreases, but none of these decreases were of the magnitude proposed in the President's budget.","We think the most likely outcome and scenario is that the government will begin the fiscal year with a continuing resolution that extends FY17's robust funding. Congress will also need to raise the debt ceiling in the fall. The talks to avoid a government shutdown and a credit default will surely grab the headlines but our customers are continuing to operate and focus on their missions. Procurements are moving through the system and programs are ramping normally.","Even with a divided Congress, there are some areas of strong bipartisan support and IT monetization is one of them. For example, in May, the House passed the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which would establish and authorize $500 million for a government-wide technology modernization fund. Large agencies would be authorized to setup their own IT working capital funds that could be used to replace legacy systems move to the cloud and invest in cyber security.","Our entire industry is solidly behind this bill, which is being championed by Congressmen, Will Hurd from Texas. Congressmen Hurd served in the CIA for nearly a decade. He has worked in the private sector advising on cyber security. He knows our industry. CSRA welcomes the efforts of members of Congress, like Will, who will across the aisle to forward good commonsense ideas that further the mission of government.","Second, the employees of CSRA are next-generation IT leaders for this federal government. A few weeks ago, we were excited to demonstrate our next-generation thought leadership through a conference call with investors on cloud adoption in the federal government space. Our Chief technology Officer, Yogesh Khanna, with great support from our partners at both Microsoft and ServiceNow, discussed the specific drivers in the federal market and the important trends that we see going forward. The call was well attended and the feedback has been really positive.","We plan to hold similar calls in the future working together with our partners to shine a light on additional next-generation technologies and how they can further the mission of our customers. One of the key messages from the call was our approach to working with technology partners, especially to identify and apply advances in technology.","Public sector organizations increasingly require new and creative approaches to fulfill their complex missions. That's why from our inception we've looked to continually expand our circle of partners to include companies focused on next-generation innovation and agility. Over the past year, we've partnered with 19 emerging tech companies, from Silicon Valley and beyond, to deliver innovative solutions to public sector organizations, and be clear, our search continues.","In May, we showcased eight new contenders for more than 120 companies considered at our third Emerging Technology Day, which showcased artificial intelligence and automation. Our Emerging Technology initiative is designed to foster ideas, make connections and hasten adoption. Representatives from the featured companies presented their solutions to an audience of more than 50 government customers and 200 of our own CSRA project managers.","We match our deep mission understanding and experience, working with the federal government with the groundbreaking innovation to create positive mission outcomes quickly for our customers.","Our thought leadership is also evident in the work that our customers entrust us. As I mentioned earlier, our largest win in the quarter was the $498 million MilCloud award. On this contract, we'll provide to Defense Department with robust and resilient private cloud infrastructure for a variety of highly protected workloads and prepare essential business processes for later broader use in the Defense Department's IT cloud portfolio. This win was a great team effort with John Anderson and Damon Bramble bringing the customer perspective; Dan Pressel architecting the solution and Donald Robinson providing technical leadership, truly a great success for the company and a game-changer.","We are now positioned as the industry leader for cloud and military IT. With stringent security concerns, the Defense Department has lagged a bit compared to other government organizations in movement to the cloud. Now the department is ready to take the next step in its IT transformation and we are excited to continue this partnership with the military and provide our experts and resources to meet or exceed their demands.","Initially we'll be installing cloud infrastructure at two DISA data centers, in Alabama and Oklahoma. During the startup phase, security is a major imperative. We will take the appropriate time to achieve the authority to operate so that our fiscal year 2019 will show us the ability to ramp the program aggressively as we move workloads to the MilCloud.","The contract will also allow us to expand our alliance partner offerings, including public cloud, storage, service providers, database and more. CSRA's winning FISMA High Cloud solution also provided a much lower total cost of ownership and allows the Department to consolidate their computer infrastructure, through the as-a-service model. This will engender greater efficiencies for onboarding DoD consumers reducing their cost, increasing the efficiency of competing platforms and increase the overall IT security posture of the United States government. The contract will also leverage talent and capabilities out of our own Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana.","To conclude on this point, technical thought leadership is central to our strategy. It is the linchpin to the three primary competitive differentiators that we have described as core to our company; customer intimacy, innovation and outcome-based delivery. It helps us to engage with our customers around their future direction. It enables us to innovate for our customers for better outcomes and it helps us drive to an as-a-service solution, where customers reward us for outcomes instead of inputs. Thought leadership doesn't just happen. We invest in it because we see it as integral to our future in part of just who we are.","That brings me to my third point. Our business development results continue to demonstrate the competitiveness of strategies and our offerings. MilCloud was the largest win, but we had solid business development performance across the board. We achieved $1.6 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x. This marks the 10th straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our trailing 12 months book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.5x.","Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $15.6 billion, which is up 3% sequentially. And funded backlog was $2.5 billion, which was up 2% sequentially. Our submitted volume for the quarter, it was massive, $7.4 billion in total and $5.1 billion of that in new work. As a result, at the end of the quarter we had $14 billion in submits outstanding, and looking only at new business we had about $8.4 billion of waiting decision, including 22 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. This volume supports our view that the second quarter could be even more robust than is normal for the end of the government fiscal year.","Finally, I want to update you all on our two large outstanding re-competes, Greenway and IMPACT. The decision on our prime Greenway bid, known as GES, continues to track for late August or early September. Remember that there are three pieces to the Greenway. The first of the Regional Infrastructure Support contracts, known as RIS I, is likely to be awarded first, followed shortly by GES, with the RIS II contract likely delayed several months after GES is awarded.","On IMPACT, as reported in the press and filed on GIO's website, we filed a pre-award protest because TSA was not following the process that they had laid out for the procurement as required by regulation. TSA now has indicated that they plan to reopen discussions and seek another round of proposal submissions to address the concerns that we raised.","We've had preliminary indications from TSA and are looking forward to receiving the details of TSA's corrective actions to include timing of revised submissions and projected award date. We are now operating on a bridge contract that extends our performance on the contract potentially through June of 2018. We're working well with the end customer. We remain dedicated to the TSA mission, and we continue to receive new tasking on this important mission.","Fourth, our employees are engaged and we are committed to strengthening that engagement. In Q1, we conducted our first employee engagement survey. With excellent participation and candid responses, we now have a solid baseline of employee sentiment. In identifying what is resonating well and what needs to be better, stronger and more compelling, we can continue to build a CSRA culture that inspires a sense of pride and engagement for all employees. Going forward, we can make even more informed decisions about where to focus, where to improve.","We achieved an engagement score out of the gate of 72% favorable, a positive result that we can build upon. What came shining through was a shared commitment to and recognition of our cultures and values with scores approaching and into the 90s across the board. Our employees almost uniformly see that CSRA enable them to perform meaningful work for our customers in an environment where we hold ourselves accountable for delivering service excellence where we operate with integrity, where we set the highest standards for honesty and ethical behavior and where we treat people with dignity and respect, regardless of their position.","This is exactly how I see at CSRA as well. In fact, I've joined the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Coalition and have committed CSRA to cultivate a workplace, where perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected, and where employees feel encouraged to discuss diversity inclusion. CSRA is committed to a point of view on diversity inclusion that shapes our decisions, shapes our actions, improves the employee experience and motivates us to provide innovation in imaginative next-generation solutions for our customers in taking the pledge to advance diversity and inclusion practices, both within our own walls and outside of them, we take the next step in our commitment to building an inclusive culture at CSRA and which all employees can bring their whole selves and have the opportunity to thrive.","While we are encouraged to see that employees are engaged and we score high on our core culture and values, we've got more work to do around improving career development paths and strengthening the ties across organizational boundaries. We are implementing specific programs to address these areas as part of our goal of becoming an employer of choice. Achieving and sustaining of that goal will require continued effort and leadership at every level of the company.","Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and the forward outlook, and then I'll come back with some closing remarks.","Dave Keffer","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board. Revenue and cash performance were essentially in line with our plan and earnings performance was excellent.","Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the high points of the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $1.23 billion, down 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Following the pattern we established last year, the year-over-year revenue decline continues to improve and we expect the comparison to turn positive in our second or third quarter.","Civil segment revenues increased 3% compared to revenues from the same period of the prior-year, driven by the expansion of several recent program wins, including OPM background investigations, High Glass and SEC. Defense and Intelligence Segment revenues decreased 8% year-over-year. The primary drivers of this decline were the Army Logistics Modernization Program and the STRATCOM IT Capabilities contract. Recent new business wins in the Defense and Intelligence Segment, including the CECOM Logistics Support, DIA ESOC and joint service provider contracts are continuing to ramp and the segment should show positive growth later this year.","Our contract mix was relatively unchanged with 45% of quarterly revenue on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. Earnings performance was very strong in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million, which was up 5% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margins of 16.6% was higher even than last quarter and above what we expect for the year, which reflected great work throughout the company, especially our program managers delivering excellent performance.","Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $12 million, which is up $9 million from last year's Q1 EACs. We see the $3 million to $5 million range as our normal level of quarterly EACs, which primarily results from changes in the risk results on fixed-price contracts.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, unchanged from the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 36.5%, which was about 0.8 percentage points higher than in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and a little below our expected long-term rate. D&A has come up a bit from where it had been running, based primarily on additional capital leases to support growth on our Flight School XXI program and some additional enterprise software costs.","GAAP D&A shows a year-over-year decline from $65 million to $60 million. Removing the acquisition-related intangible amortization in both periods, including the amortization of the SRA contract backlog in Q1 of FY17, shows an increase in D&A included in our adjusted EPS from $34 million to $43 million. The shift from operating to capitalized expenses and the effect of leaving EPS in line with our model and EBITDA running a little ahead.","The key items to reconcile to GAAP include pension income of $21 million, acquisition-related intangibles amortizations of $17 million and pre-tax merger and integration costs of $5 million. As noted in our press release, the acquisition-related intangible amortizations, includes a $5 million amortization expense related to the write-off of software that came over to us as part of the spin.","In the first quarter, we completed integration of our human resources systems. We expect to complete the integration of our finance and accounting systems by the end of our fiscal year, at which time the merger and integration costs would be minimum.","Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $87 million and free cash flow was $76 million. In Q1, we returned $31 million to shareholders, including $17 million in dividends and $14 million in share repurchases. As of June 30, 2017, we had $194 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt, excluding our capital lease obligations.","The balance sheet and cash flow statements for the quarter are complicated by two factors; the repricing of some of our term loans and the NES acquisition. In June, we were able to amend our term loan B facility and reduce the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points, with the spread between our term loan A1 and B rates now being so low, we shifted about $184 million from the term loan A1 facility to the amended the loan B facility to extend the duration by four years.","As part of that transaction, we wrote off $1.7 million of deferred financing fees related to an earlier amendment and recorded an additional $1.5 million of deferred financing fees related to this amendment. At the end of June, we drew $55 million in our revolving credit facility to fund the NES acquisition. The full purchase payment of $105 million will be reflected in Q2 financial statements.","Now onto the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal year 2018, including revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion; adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million; adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2; and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million.","Revenue visibility has improved since our last call. At the midpoint of guidance, we now expect that about 91% of revenue would come from existing business, which is up from about 85%. Of the remaining 9%, more than 5% would come from re-competes, with the remainder from new business.","Walking through the rest of the year, we expect sequential revenue growth in every quarter, with year-over-year growth beginning in the second or third quarter. This is a major milestone for us and we've turned the quarter on revenue with recent wins starting to kick in and some of our headwinds starting to fade. Our EBITDA margin obviously ran hot in the Q1. With more normal EAC performance, we expect adjusted EBITDA to decline in Q2 and to benefit from new business wins as the year progresses.","Now back to Larry for some closing remarks.","Lawry Prior","Thanks Dave. Yesterday, we held our second annual meeting and elected our Board of Directors. I want to take this opportunity to recognize how helpful the Board has been to Dave and to me and really to all of our shareholders. The Board works as true partners to the CSRA leadership team with a focus on maximizing our opportunities and managing our risks, all the while exercising their duty of loyalty to shareholders and their duty of care across all aspects of the company every day.","To help you understand the strength of this Board and their commitment to responsible governance, we've begun a series of Board interviews and all of our Board members will have their interview be posted to our website. So far we've captured Billie Williamson, our Audit Committee Chair; Sean O'Keefe, our Compensation Committee Chair; Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, who chairs Non-gov; and Mark Frantz, known in the venture community as well as serving on our Comp Committee.","They are real assets to CSRA and I recommend that you take a couple of minutes to watch the videos, get to know the Board better and appreciate the strong team that we're building here at CSRA.","And with that, operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Rick Eskelsen","Hi, good evening. It's Rick Eskelsen on for Ed. Larry, I was hoping you could start with an update maybe with some of the mega deals with some of the moving pieces here on MilCloud? I think last time you talked, it was about 16 they are expected to be decided this year. Is that still the case? What's the mega deal outlook like?","Lawry Prior","Yes, that's close. I'll let Stuart start and I'll clean up.","Stuart Davis","Yes, I think that we are progressing. Obviously MilCloud was the first out of the gate. We've had a couple of adjudications but not many. Q2 was really expected to be a banner quarter in terms of adjudication and we've got something like 30 adjudications, north of $100 million, totaling almost $4 billion that should be adjudicated in Q2. So we'll start to get some early indications on the mega deals.","Lawry Prior","And Rick, I think the moment term that George Batsakis and the four group EVPs have built that what I appreciate is it's balanced across all four groups. So any one of them could bring in a billion in TCV [ph] and having that much being adjudicated and that kind of potential just reflects the momentum that George and their teams have built. And as you and Ed both know, September is the biggest month of the year for our industry and I think it's lining up again.","Rick Eskelsen","Thanks. It's very helpful. Continuing on the BD team with the NES acquisition. I know when you talked in the past, it's been a very additive acquisition for the business development in the networking space. I guess two questions. Any update on - or additional discussion on NES and what it brings? And then in terms of the guidance, what have you included for NES in the forward guidance?","Lawry Prior","So just to start, we're moving swiftly on the integration and working to have it fully integrated into our defense group. We're finding that it's going seamlessly that they've got great leadership, great technical talent, really recognized by customers. When you walk into the offices in DISA, DoD and in the defense agencies, the quality of the technical staff at NES is just unbelievably recognized. We are really trying to help them walk across our entire company. So they are helping with work with the FBI. Andy Gomer, our Chief Networking Officer is really excited about a couple of the big bids in the Intel community and are already adding on past quarter work.","Remember in this quarter, the last quarter of the government fiscal year, it's a time to shake the trees and help government spend money that was not spent well over the first couple of quarters when they were in the CR. So there is an opportunity for creativity on the part of NES to look to our current vehicles and see can they bring in brand new added work. So both on the large captures, as well as the day-to-day, we really appreciate that technical talent and what it brings.","Dave Keffer","And just to put a few numbers around it, Rick. For NES, we've talked about the purchase price of $105 million. Their revenue run rate over the last fiscal year was in that same range, so it should give you some sense for their near term contribution. Going forward, we won't be breaking out their revenue or profit as we did for SRA, or frankly as we would for another large acquisition in the future. For smaller strategic tuck-ins like this one, the really key is the two companies coming together and generating some of the revenue synergies that Larry talked about.","Rick Eskelsen","Thanks. Just the last one from me. Can you talk a little bit about - and you touched on a little bit, Larry, with your comments. But in terms of the ability to find talent in the market, what are you seeing? Has it gotten meaningfully tighter and just what's happening on the talent side in the market? Thank you.","Lawry Prior","Yes. So watching our talent team led by John Reing has had a remarkable July. And it looks like this quarter is setting up well, even when you see sometimes a somersault. So we've got, I think, momentum building where the core prop around value, where it's next-generation technologies bridging the mission to have an impactful career tracks with all the engagement survey work we are doing and we are hearing it from recruits.","Yes, there is stress in the D.C. area and your time to fill creeps up 10 days or so but we are also bringing in interns. We got 110, 111 interns this year, all excited about the company. A good set of them down in Bossier City, Louisiana, where we continue to really get rewards from the investments that we've made and the growth and leverage services there.","So for us, it's an outlet to give us a bit balance as we try to grow talent. But I think it's within the normal range of what I've experienced over the last 20, 30 years. And we are going to continue to compete based on the quality of the work we do, the excitement of what a next-generation career means for these people, and the ability to do mission and be rewarded by it.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Vafi with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Joseph Vafi","Hi guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice results here. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit first on MilCloud now that it's formally kicked off and it sounds like some of the entities within DoD are a little bit excited to get this going. Do you have a better feel for how some of the work on MilCloud will start to translate into the top line and into margins over the remainder of the fiscal year? And then I have a follow-up.","Lawry Prior","Yes, so let me start where - you don't want to rush to the first instances in building a cloud for the Department of Defense, that in this case, security and the authority to operate are center stage and you can't have check-the-box mentality or I've added a future set mentality. It is central in its core to the value prop for the defense departments. That authority to operate is center stage. So we don't want to rush as we come out of the gate with this customer. We want to double down and get security really, really right, so that the DISA and the Department look to the services, look to the other agencies.","There is a value prop around security and the cloud. There is private cloud that gives them confidence. Then as you think about how do you extend that ATO to include the public clouds of an Azure or an Amazon. How do you add in both compute and storage and do good things with the data? You want to get it right. And it's going to require us between now and the end of this year to be cautious, careful and thoughtful. And we are going to take our time, Joe, and do this when really right.","Joseph Vafi","Okay.","Dave Keffer","Yes, Joe, just to add a little bit to that. It's a 500-or-so-million contract. It's the kind of contract where, as Larry pointed out, the initial period seeking the ATO would obviously just be a tiny fraction of that contract value. The real opportunity then is to grow it in each successive year so last year of the contract should be the highest and strongest. And really the key is to build that foundation and be able to move workloads with every passing year.","Lawry Prior","And if you look for the options, the headroom is like $495 million, $500 million now. With options, you could expand it to north of $750 million. So when you have something this important to the Department and it's a watershed change, it's in inflection point for they think about cloud, we wanted based on our FISMA High approach to security and the ATO and we are going to be treating that with a good bit of care, a bit of caution but are lot of fidelity and making sure it works well for this customer.","Joseph Vafi","That makes a lot of sense. And then, on the submits and the bits awaiting adjudication. It's a really big number and we're kind of running out of time this fiscal year. Do you think that the ban which is in place on the adjudication on the contract offering side to get this adjudication is done here exiting September quarter?","Lawry Prior","We do. And we're obviously have the finger on the pulse and our ears to the win to make sure - remember, it's pretty normal for September to be a defining month in the fiscal year, both our industry as well as the government. And each year, we come into July and August on the edge of our seat waiting for all that activity in September. And from our point of view, our field of view it's lining up that they will award. They will adjudicate and we'll see these ramp normally.","And there is a lot of noise around the lack of political appointments, but I also see a lot of work by the career service and the career uniforms of our government and their continuing to advance the cost. So we are expecting that it will be, not just a normal September but a robust September, and all the signals we see are showing that.","Joseph Vafi","Okay, great. And then maybe just one more quick one. This is a little bit - maybe a little tougher question on IMPACT. With the protest and how it's shaking out now, any more color on how you think that how that adjudication goes, given what's gone on so far? And clearly I understand that it's pretty sensitive. Thanks.","Lawry Prior","Yes, we absolutely built our proposal strategy around the requirements that are laid out in the RFP. And then in the discussions with both the contracting shop and the end customer, we stuck religiously to the process, and anytime we sense there is a deviation from their state of process, we do that's disadvantages to us as we were religiously following, what we think, is in line with the far and important to good acquisition process.","We still like our value prop and we look forward to them coming out with a final proportion revision and after some discussion and we'll see how it plays out.","Joseph Vafi","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rayna Kumar","Good evening. Could you discuss a little bit about what is causing the uncertainty in revenue growth turning positive in 2Q versus 3Q?","Dave Keffer","Hi Rayna, it's Dave. In referring to Q2 or Q3 being the first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, it's just nothing more than an indication that we would envision that second quarter being on that borderline and so rather than trying to pin it down to one quarter. It just gives you a sense that it will be around the middle of our fiscal year that we've reached at that point we've been looking forward to frankly for the last two or three years now to get through a positive year-over-year revenue growth number and we are excited about it.","Rayna Kumar","Great. Could you quantify the pricing trends that you saw in the first quarter and then your expectations from pricing for the remainder of the year?","Dave Keffer","Sure. It's tough to quantify. Obviously every bid is different. What I'd say is that the trends over the past several years have been for pretty tight aggressive pricing and competition. We didn't see any change to that in the first quarter of this fiscal year. Pricing strategies are a bit different depending on requirements and contract types. But we've continued to deploy the same approach and haven't seen the market commend anything different.","Rayna Kumar","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks. Good afternoon guys.","Lawry Prior","Hi Gautam.","Dave Keffer","Hi Gautam.","Gautam Khanna","Hi. So Dave, maybe for you, if you could talk about the $18 million of favorable adjustments. Was that broad-based across the number of contracts? Was it isolated to one or two? Just any flavor you can give because it was a big number.","Dave Keffer","Sure. So the net number was $12 million for the quarter. That was a bit higher than usual, as you pointed out. It's certainly a positive result in this quarter and it's one that's fluctuated a bit in the past and that we want to make sure you and others expect that to continue, obviously very difficult to project from quarter-to-quarter. The positive - the favorable adjustments were spread across a variety of contracts. It was not one or two contracts that drove that figure but rather quite a few of them that happen to have favorable activity in the quarter, as we noted primarily related to changes in risks projected going forward, so continued strong performance from our project managers on those programs. Larry?","Lawry Prior","Yes, Gautam, I'll just brag on Dave a bit that he has been leading Project Emerald [ph] where we are going in program-by-program. And it included - I think Dave did about five different videos on how and why you might want to add DL to your projects and why contribution margin is important. And Gautam, the next time you're in town, I'll pick one of the two of the videos and run it by.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. I look forward to it. But to your point, you don't think this is going to be sustained level of growth favorable just because things will mean revert and it was an unusually good quarter, or if it's a process improvement that maybe you are holding back a little bit on the guide [ph]?","Dave Keffer","The former, mean reversion, prior quarters have been in the $3 million to $5 million range. We think that's a better projection of a typical quarter going forward.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. No problem. And just as we approach the Greenway contract awards, do you anticipate any transition pricing, any sort of - is that one of the things you're thinking about when you think about margins ticking down a bit as we move through the rest of the year? Is that re-compete? Do you think it would be at a much lower margin than what you're currently recognizing? Is that the big driver or is it just the mix of new business ramping the sustainability of some of the one-time items that have gone your way etcetera? How much is Greenway impacting that?","Lawry Prior","So the thing that I think most about is when we talk about 20-plus bids that are not of north of $100 million. And when you think of new IT work, where you go in and you're discovering a new enterprise IT environment. That first year is you're discovering what the current state is and you're bringing in your processes. You're bringing in your tools like ServiceNow. You get some headwinds on the profitability in year one of new work. And my guess is we are going to experience some of that. We've been planning for it with all of our transition planning for the new work. But that's going to be a good challenge and a good problem for us to have, as we scale the business and then begin this discovery process.","And don't get me wrong. Anytime you've got a big re-compete, there is pressure on profitability, but you also think that how long these contracts age and you look for opportunities as you begin them to bring in new capabilities around cloud that might not have been present in the original RFP. So as we look at our bid model versus our execution model, we'll look to understand the enterprise and improve profitability over the life of a contract.","Stuart Davis","And what I'd add there Gautam, consistent with Larry's points on how execution takes shape, these transitions take time including when the incumbents are successful, we can hold onto Greenway, The transition from one contract to the other will take time, a period of quarters. And so the primary effect is really an FY19 in effect. There is some smaller FY18 margin implication of Greenway real award and same with some of other re-competes. But certainly the predominance of that is an FY19 effect.","Gautam Khanna","That makes sense. And Dave, maybe - so you guys are speaking with a lot of numbers early on so I missed it. But on the go-get revenue, should we assume that this year if you retail all the re-competes, was that to say it's 91%, plus 5%. So there is only 4%, or roughly $200 million that you need to quote go-get book and convert this year to get to the midpoint? Is that the math?","Dave Keffer","That is the right math. We did say 91% firm and greater than 5% re-compete. So you can take from that. It would be less than 4% or less than $200 million for the business. But you have the math right.","Gautam Khanna","Got it. And that's - okay and that includes NES as part of the base on the 91%?","Dave Keffer","It does.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. Got it. That's great. So it's a little bit less than go-get. Just in Q1, how much of that $200 million did you actually - is that net of Q1 bookings, so that's what's left?","Dave Keffer","That's right.","Gautam Khanna","The Q1, okay. Got it. One last one. Sorry to keep asking questions. But a quarter ago, you guys talked about the long-term targets and maybe getting there in a different fashion than you envisioned when you went on the initial separation road show. How is your thinking on that changed, given the big revenue opportunity that appears to be on the front of you? Do you think it's going to make a shift back to a higher top line than what you were thinking even a quarter ago just given the pipelines?","Lawry Prior","So we've been I think - so where we've been consistent is the investment in top line growth with George and the group EVPs and the solution architects and the partners. And what we're seeing with Q1 was just robust amount of proposals in submits. It continues into this quarter. And the fact that you've got so much awaiting decision and a big chunk of it looking to award this quarter, we think the model is working. Now we added a little color to it by acquiring NES and improving our P win on some of those really big deals. So we used a bit of the balance sheet to underpin our strategy for driving top line growth by adding a technical edge of the network layer. It's just so fundamentally important I believe for next generation.","We will still continue to guard our margins. And the Dave and team will do heavy lifting one program at a time. And I think we'll be successful in getting the growth that we need to deliver the earnings that you're looking for, Gautam.","Dave Keffer","One thing\u2026","Gautam Khanna","Great job guys. Strong results. yes.","Dave Keffer","Thank you. I wanted to switch on something Larry said earlier. If you look at last year and where the business development was really coming from, it was really two groups driving the way. You look now and it's very even across the whole business, so we had each of our four groups submitting of a $1 billion of work this quarter. It's a very strong across the whole company.","Lawry Prior","And counterintuitive in the current discussions is people will say there is stressed on the federal civilian portion of the government and we'll see a little of it. So for example, we have folks who help bring people on to the Affordable Care Act side and that's ended but we've won new incredible work with what we do with the EPA and we've also - I think we are doing great with shared services both at Commerce and at NASA.","So Paul Nedzbala and his leadership team with Kamal Narang and Kevin Connell and others, they are just doing great. And as Dave pointed out, you could see in the Q, we had real growth in what is supposed to be our more stressed segment. So what we are looking for is continue to bid and see that pipeline expand while then taking advantage of what the market is allowing in defense and intelligence, where we need to flip to a growth model as we begin to work our way through some of those headwinds. They are beginning to fade.","Gautam Khanna","I appreciate it, guys. Great results.","Dave Keffer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Atkins with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Frank Atkins","Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to go back to MilCloud again. Why do you think you were chosen over peers in your view, and what does that, say from a competitive landscape, view your strengths are?","Lawry Prior","So I think it starts with knowledge of mission and recognizing that the barrier to adoption was the commitment and the recognition that security is the first and foremost requirement. And everybody works to security in the cloud. But for example, we work with Red Hat and have an open environment in our software stack for our FISMA High Cloud and it's one where - if there was ever, god forbid, a cyber event, the government forensic experts would have a 100% access and visibility anywhere in our stack and we would welcome them go below the control plane and really have an unfettered access to our cloud inside their firewall inside their DISA deck [ph].","And our mindset was security first and then think about how we can scale with them to make it useful as they think about both compute and data but then how do we really be thoughtful about the business model, in one that aligns with how Azure or Amazon think about the future and making that palatable and easy for the defense customer.","So I think it was our alignment and passion for working with our partners but the recognition that if you didn't have that private cloud focused on security inside the deck, you'll never expand that ATO to the wonderful public cloud work that Amazon or Azure are doing for a NPR environment, a SPR environment or future JLX environment.","Frank Atkins","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then if I could just get a quick update on the Bossier City in terms of both capacity where you stand, as well as response from clients?","Lawry Prior","Yes. So we've built the facility to think about 800 people housed within the new ITC. I joke with the team that the density I like, we could probably go to a 1,000. It's really been well received by customers, especially in the D.C. area where they recognized that there is some challenges in hiring here. But also just the pricing advantages and the critical mass, when you have a unified agile dev ops team where you get really great capabilities, it's a competitive advantages that they all want to visit, they all want to see, they all want to touch. So we are having lots of success in bringing our customers to visit and beginning to move work there and we are pretty bullish on it.","We've got an additional facility we built out for call center operations and it's a great place for employees new to technology to work in a disciplined environment under great leadership, then work with the Bossier City Community College to get their initial certs and then continue and to grow into our ITC. So we are building our own pipeline via the call center to the community college or directly from our partnership with Louisiana Tech. And I got to tell you every customer that visits wants to put work there.","Frank Atkins","Okay, great. And last one from me. If you could just talk about potential M&A, how you look at that and maybe areas of strategic tuck-ins? Thank you.","Lawry Prior","Yes, I think NES is a great case study and it hit the tri-factor of how we think about M&A. So first, it has to have a differentiated technical advantage. And with Andy Gomer and the team, my god, they know the network fabric. They know every circuit into every base, CONUS and OCONUS.","The second thing that rests on the technical expertise and the domain knowledge is a special relationship with intimacy and to be trusted by a customer, and whether it's the leadership of the DoD CIO, whether it's DISA, the other agencies, the Army, NES has earned that respect and that trust.","And then the third one is often the hardest is there are future opportunities were through that technology and that customer knowledge, you can gain competitive advantage on one of these mega deals that helps transform a company. So if we find any possible acquisitions that hit that tri-factor, we'll be interested but we'll always look for balance in our capital deployment thinking about our dividend, thinking about where we are with our leverage and thinking about where we are with our market multiple and is buyback of stock a better option.","With NES clearly, what was in the best interest of the shareholder was to merge with them do great things for the Defense Department and help build the network fabric that can be fundamental to this move to next generation IT.","Frank Atkins","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Krishna Sinha with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Krishna Sinha","Hi, thanks. So I just want to understand the TSA bridge contract a little better. So is it possible that you could get a final decision after this protest period that occurs before June, I guess, 2018 that would supplant this bridge contract or just - can you just talk about the phasing on that?","Dave Keffer","Sure, I can start. It's Dave speaking. So the bridge contract extends inclusive of its option period through June of 2018 if an award were made sooner and transition were able to commence and be complete sooner than June of '18, it would be possible if the government wouldn't need to exercise each of those options. Obviously the timing of the remainder of the procurement process is still so up in the air that we wouldn't - we'd hesitate to try to get much more specific than that.","Krishna Sinha","Okay. And then given your very strong book-to-bill over the last 10 quarters, can you just give us an update on what your trailing 12 months new business win rate is and then also your trailing 12-month re-compete rate?","Stuart Davis","Yes, this is Stuart. So if you look over the last year, our new business win rate has been 39%, so very, very strong. Obviously 35% is kind of how we've been running for an extended period of time. Re-compete win rate over the last year is at 80%.","Krishna Sinha","Okay. And what's driving that because I know when you guys talked about the re-compete win rate earlier, it was supposed to be closer to 85%, 90%. Is that just the one, I think, it was STRATCOM that drove that down a little bit or is there other re-competes that you've been struggling with?","Stuart Davis","There certainly have a couple. STRATCOM hasn't been the only loss but that was certainly the most material contributor to the trailing 12-month number. If you look at just in the quarter the re-compete win rate was 90%, which would be on the high side of what we think is reasonable.","Krishna Sinha","Okay, fair enough. And then for the MilCloud contract, the ceiling value is $500 million. The option values sounds like $750 million. Can you talk about the initial funding amount and what the initial period of performance is on this?","Dave Keffer","Sure. The initial funding amount\u2026","Lawry Prior","Yes, so the initial amount is in the tens of millions focused on getting through the ATO. So as I pointed out, we've got between now and the end of our fiscal year, to fully implement the instances in Oklahoma City, as well as in Alabama, and then work with the management team in Illinois and go through a disciplined approach to get that ATO approval?","Krishna Sinha","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Brian Ruttenbur","Yes, thank you very much. Couple of quick questions. On NES, the acquisition that closed, you paid $105 million. Did you disclose the revenue or contribution either in the quarter on a going forward basis that you expect from that or profitability from NES?","Dave Keffer","Hi Brian, it's Dave. For an acquisition of this size, we haven't and won't get into that level of detail on it. What we did say is that the purchase price was in the range of the last fiscal year's revenue run rate and that should give you a general sense for the contribution of the business going forward. And certainly if it's profitability were out of whack with industry standards, we would have provided some more insights on that as well. So you can assume that's in the normal range.","Brian Ruttenbur","Okay. So that being said one-time revenue, so if you paid $105 million, they did roughly about in last year's revenue. Is that right?","Stuart Davis","Yes, do the math and think of trailing 12 months is that number.","Brian Ruttenbur","Okay, perfect. And then the other question - it's been asked a bunch - but the TSA and the Greenway. I think that it's being asked but I just want to clarify. TSA, first of all, how far do you see them kicking the can down the road, if you will? Do you expect an award in June, do you expect it later? Seems like there is a lot of delays happening with the new awards, especially the ones that had been protested. Is there an extension beyond or potential for extension beyond June for you guys?","Lawry Prior","We just don't know yet and don't have the visibility. And remember, we filed a pre-award protest. So that's a little bit horse of a different color. Normally when you protest after an award, part of your legal team will have some access in a cloistered way where you have a better sense. That's not the case. So we're waiting to hear from the acquisition leads at TSA and how they want to proceed, how the leadership of DHS weighs in and what their thought process is. We were glad to see that they are re-looking it and look forward to serving that mission. We continue to see work added onto it and see where it goes.","Brian Ruttenbur","Great. And then on Greenway last question on just the timing of awards. You mentioned phase three would be a couple of months delayed. When should we wrap all this up? Is that by the end of calendar year do you think or do you anticipate it going into first or second quarter, calendar first or second quarters?","Lawry Prior","It's interesting. So RIS I, the first regional, I would expect this month. As I said, the GES the one we're most interested in is a prime, either at the end of this month or early next month. I would think RIS II, we keep hearing rumors that it's delayed. It could be the end of the calendar year. It could slip a little bit beyond that.","Brian Ruttenbur","Thank you.","Operator","And as there are no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Stuart Davis for any closing remarks.","Stuart Davis","Well, Steven, first I'd like to thank you for all your help on today's call and obviously thank everybody for their interest in CSRA. As usual, we look forward seeing you out on the road and answering any follow-up questions that you have. Thank you.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Stuart Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.","Stuart Davis","Thank you, Andrea, and welcome, everyone, to today's quarterly earnings conference call. Larry Prior, our CEO; and Dave Keffer, our CFO, are here to discuss our financial results, business momentum and forward outlook.","Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call.","Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, please note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. For a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K for May.","In addition, the statements represent our views as of today, and subsequent events may cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future but specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.","Finally, as shown on Slide 3, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. The slide deck for today's call includes the reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Larry who will begin on Slide 4.","Lawrence Prior","Thank you, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. With today's earnings announcement, we celebrate a major milestone in the history of CSRA, our first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.","Our team has been building the foundation for growth through sustained business development excellence, and we posted another strong bookings quarter, highlighted by the successful defense of our largest recompete.","Together with last quarter's milCloud 2.0 win, we secured our position as the pre-eminent platform for cloud and next-generation IT services to the national security market for the next decade.","In addition, we're deploying our strong cash flow to accelerate our growth with strategic acquisitions that position us to take share in priority national security markets.","I'll now drill down in each of the 4 statements I just gave to offer insight into how we see our performance, positioning and outlook.","First, we've turned the corner on revenue growth. In the second quarter, revenue was $1.27 billion for our first year-over-year increase and our largest quarter-over-quarter increase since we were formed in November of 2015. We've been building for this moment for some time, and you can feel the additional energy around the company.","Growth enables us to invest in our people, expand our opportunities for current employees, invest in next-generation technology differentiators and take on broader missions for our customers.","Our year-over-year growth will accelerate through the back half of the year up to and perhaps beyond our long-term target of 2% to 3%, due in part to the critical near-term work we're doing for FEMA that I'll describe in a moment.","Our market should support continued organic growth over the long term. We're optimistic that Congress will reach agreement to avoid a government shutdown and will override the Budget Control Act caps.","As congress reconciles the National Defense Authorization Act, we expect they'll include the Modernizing Government Technology Act, which has now passed both the House and the Senate and will create a 2-year $500 million industrial fund for technology modernization.","Though each next-generation IT program is slow to ramp with a careful, security-first approach to achieving an authority to operate, and investment in the control is essential to the government's certification and accreditation teams, the backdrop for IT modernization and the adoption of cloud technologies is positive, and it's building momentum. Second, business development remains robust.","Business development success is the key to revenue growth, and we've prioritized BD investments since our IPO. We've achieved $4.2 billion in bookings in the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 3.3x, our 11th straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x or greater.","Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now up to 1.8x. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.7 billion, which was up 14% sequentially. And funded backlog was $2.7 billion, up 11% sequentially. These totals exclude $125 million in wins that were subsequently protested, virtually all of which is new work for CSRA.","The key win in the quarter was in the recompete of our largest contract. Under the new 10-year $2.4 billion program, we'll provide enterprise IT for a major Department of Defense agency. We're through the protest period so we've now secured our position as the go-to infrastructure provider for another decade.","This win was the result of a lot of hard work by an amazing delivery and proposal team led by Leigh Palmer and Ben Gianni. The key differentiator for the win was our elegant technical solution featuring a hybrid infrastructure built with our strategic partners, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, ServiceNow and Cisco as well as dedicated VMware and Oracle stacks.","The award of our companion program is currently under protest and until that protest is resolved, we'll meet critical customer needs under our legacy program. Once resolved, we stand ready to introduce innovation and next-generation solutions rapidly to enhance mission success and, of course, to introduce program efficiency.","Even excluding this large recompete, business development performance was solid across the board with a book-to-bill of 1.4x. New business wins in the quarter totaled about $900 million or over $1 billion including the protested wins.","And Q3, traditionally the slowest award quarter in our industry, is off to a blazing start, including a $238 million managed services takeaway win at the Department of Veterans Affairs. As is typical, the award was protested, but this is a great win for our health and civil team on a very competitive opportunity.","We're optimistic that the substantial new business opportunities scheduled to award in the second half of the year will continue to strengthen our momentum heading into fiscal year 2019.","Our view is bolstered by the level of proposal and award activity. Submit volume for the quarter was ahead of plan, $6 billion in total and $5 billion in new work. At the end of the quarter, we had $10 billion in submits outstanding, including about $8 billion in new work awaiting decision.","I'll highlight 2 of our key awards for the quarter to give you an idea of what this team is capable of. The first is a $164 million takeaway contract to secure more than 3 million endpoints for the Defense Information System Agency, or DISA. Jim Matney architected a next-generation solution and road map that leverages the cyber talent from NES.","We'll work closely with our Microsoft and McAfee partners to enhance this endpoint security and cyber strategy and to protect the Defense Department from internal and external cyber threats. This win exemplifies our leadership position in cyber, especially within the Department of Defense.","We have industry-leading experience in moving agencies to a shared service model and training people through our cyber institute, which serves as a prime contractor for the Department of Defense's Defense Cyber Investigative Training Academy, or DCITA, and is an authorized delivery partner of CompTIA, the Computing Technology Industry Association.","We secure all the defense networks and the Pentagon through the Joint Service Provider Defensive Cyber Ops program, and we lead customers through the development and execution of critical IT security best practices such as information assurance, implementing IT security processes and tools and managing security operations centers.","Just last week, we launched the Cyber Center of Excellence led by Dr. Matt McFadden to bring together our next-generation technology and world-renowned cyber experts to provide access to the latest threat intelligence, trends and resources to defend against persistent threats.","This is a virtual center operating out of Columbia, Maryland and our ITC in Bossier City, Louisiana. It leverages our extensive alliance partner network to develop rapid prototype technologies and then test them in our cyber range. These partnerships allow CSRA to provide quick access to the latest cyber innovations and tailor them for government customers.","The second win that I mentioned that I'd like to highlight is our search support to FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide assistance for survivors of recent disasters, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the California wildfires.","This has been an all hands-on deck effort under the great leadership of John Xereas and Jay Johnson. We submitted our proposal 3 days after the RFP was issued and stood up a fully operational center within a week.","The nature of search support will make for some lumpy quarters, but it's the right thing to do, and we're really proud of our team. We care deeply for those affected, and FEMA is a great customer who really gets mission.","Our recent wins bring me to my third point. The move to next-generation IT is beginning to accelerate, and we are well-positioned to take advantage. Over the last 2 quarters, the combination of wins on milCloud 2.0 and our large IT engineering recompete gave us 8-year and 10 years of prime real estate across both the defense and intelligence community customer sets and helps us create the platform to help lead the transition to managed services using cloud and other next-generation technologies.","More customers are looking to adopt cloud solutions, and we are working closely with our strategic partners. For example, the Navy R&D community just awarded us a 3-year $35 million contract to provide advanced cloud migration engineering and maintenance services for both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.","In addition, many customers are looking to accelerate cloud adoption. One great example led by Stone Baggiano from NES has our company working with Microsoft to enhance the design created and deployed for the Air Force Office 365 cloud-hosted enterprise services or the CHES contract.","Our new zero-stack design leverages Azure for Office 365 supporting services typically hosted on premise. The solution minimizes the U.S. Air Force data center footprint while providing a proven rapid path for the Air Force and other government agencies to migrate from legacy on-premise sim [ph] systems to a secure cloud-based Office 365 Azure solution.","On milCloud 2.0, we are working with DISA to achieve an authority to operate earlier than planned. At DISA, the Navy and elsewhere, we're helping blaze many new trails with the help of great customers to improve the security architectures of cloud-based systems.","We also continue to seek out the latest technologies from small, innovative, venture-backed tech firms. We just held our fourth Emerging Technology Day at the end of October featuring 8 companies focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics that we selected from an initial screen more than 100 companies.","We had excellent participation again, including 50 of our government customers. We're actively seeking engagements with participants such as Cylance who uses artificial intelligence to provide cybersecurity that predicts, prevents and protects the enterprise prior to an attack, and DataRobot, who provides a cloud hosted platform that allows data scientists and business analysts alike to mine open source algorithms to develop accurate predictive models in support of mission need.","Cloud storage and compute enable the power of artificial intelligence to improve and transform enterprises, giving customers better ability to forecast and predict as well as to leverage automation for labor-based cost savings.","For example, we're partnering with emerging technology vendors like Perspica and ScienceLogic to forecast system outages and suggested preventive maintenance for our data centers and Pondera to tap a wide variety of data sources to root out and prevent Medicare fraud before it happens.","CSRA's commitments to next-gen and our broad set of cloud contracts makes us of the platform of choice for integrating Silicon Valley solutions throughout government to increase innovation, efficiency, agility, resiliency, all the while reducing costs.","At the same time, each cloud migration program offers startup challenges and requires investment. For example, on milCloud 2.0, we're working closely with our customers to enable adoption, shorten time lines and continue to accelerate cloud transformation for the government's unique risk posture. We're also investing to make cloud adoption easier, leveraging the innovation freedoms provided on the milCloud 2.0 contract.","We're investing to ensure success and to create a full complement of next-generation services available from our commercial strategic partners. This will reduce friction in cloud adoption and it will accelerate our robust cloud ecosystem for the special needs and the special missions of the Department of Defense.","Fourth, we're using our balance sheet to spur growth through compelling acquisitions. In the first quarter, we acquired NES for their specific expertise in the defense telecom network fabric infrastructure as well as the applications, architecture and implementation. They bring us the trifecta of deep technology discriminators, strong customer relationships and the ability to target near-term opportunities and improve our Pwin.","For example, under Jack Curran's great leadership, the NES team continues to upgrade large portions of the Department of Defense network with MPLS in crucial places like South Korea. This will improve network resilience for our forces in Korea, and the increased capacity enables better access to cloud-based services.","Last month, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Praxis Engineering. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals, and we expect it will be completed late in our third quarter. I see Praxis as another trifecta with robust capabilities and relationships that we can apply towards near-term pursuits.","Praxis is squarely focused on mission applications development for the intelligence community. The vast majority of its 350 employees are TS\/CSI cleared software and system engineers.","Praxis is a great cultural fit for us with a focus on mission success and IT innovation with the best idea wins mindset. Bill Donahoo and Jerry Schepers and the whole Praxis team are excited to take on a greater portfolio of contracts and customers and lead all CSRA mission work for the intelligence community.","In closing, acquisitions that fit our criteria don't come along very often, so we're happy to have found 2 gems back to back, but don't expect this acquisition pace to keep up over the next couple of quarters.","Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook.","David Keffer","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 5 of the income statement. As Larry said, the highlight of the quarter was our return to revenue growth.","Revenue for the quarter was $1.27 billion, up 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and up 3% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We expect even more year-over-year revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters.","Civil segment revenues increased 4% compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year, driven by the expansion of several recent program wins, including OPM background investigations, CMS HIGLAS and our work with the EPA. The FEMA awards that Larry referenced was only a minimal contributor in the second quarter as it had just begun to ramp.","Defense and Intelligence segment revenues decreased 3% year-over-year, significantly improved from last quarter. The primary drivers of the decline were again the Army Logistics Modernization Program and the STRATCOM IT capabilities contract.","Recent new business wins in the Defense and Intelligence segment including the CECOM logistics support, DIA, ESOC and joint service provider contracts continued to ramp, and the NES acquisition contributed as well.","Our contract mix was relatively constant. 44% of second quarter revenue was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 35% on cost-plus contracts.","Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million, which was down 2% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.6% was still above our long-term target although below last year's Q2 and this year's Q1 margins. The drivers of the decline included several factors such as investments in early-stage programs and the lower margins on NES revenue.","Net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $8 million, down sequentially and unchanged from last year's Q2 EACs. We still see the $3 million to $5 million range as our normal level of net quarterly EACs, which primarily result from changes in the risk reserves on fixed-price contracts.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.46, down 10% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.6%, which was about 1.1 percentage point higher than in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a little below our expected long-term rate.","GAAP D&A shows a year-over-year declined from $63 million to $56 million. Removing the acquisition-related intangible amortization in both periods including the amortization of the SRA contract backlog in Q2 of FY '17 shows an increase in D&A included in our adjusted EPS from $34 million to $42 million.","The shift from operating to capitalized expenses, including capital leases to support growth is the primary driver of year-to-date EBITDA running a little ahead and EPS running a bit below the midpoint of our guidance ranges.","The key items to reconcile to GAAP include pension income of $20 million, acquisition-related intangible amortization of $14 million and pretax merger and integration costs of $9 million.","Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $72 million, and free cash flow was $14 million. Day's sales outstanding for the quarter were 54 days, a sequential improvement of 2 days.","In Q2, we used $21 million to pay down debt and returned $18 million to shareholders including $16 million in dividends and $2 million in share repurchases. We also completed the NES acquisition for $104 million, including $101 million in cash.","The purchase price was funded from cash on hand and $55 million from our revolving credit facility. As of September 29, 2017, we had $91 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt, excluding capital lease obligations.","I'd like to address 3 items that are not on our Q2 balance sheet or statement of cash flows but are important to the story going forward. First, during the third quarter, we'll make a payment of approximately $235 million for Praxis, which we could choose to fund through our $700 million revolver.","However, the debt market conditions are very appealing right now, and we're evaluating plans to secure additional financing to fund the acquisition and refinance our shortest duration term loans. Consistent with what Larry said, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation model and plan to continue to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders.","Second, as we spun off from CSC, we took ownership of the property in Falls Church that housed CSC's headquarters. We now occupy about 2\/3 of the total space as our headquarters with the remainder mostly unoccupied since CSC left shortly after the spin.","Last week, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction in which we received $33 million of gross cash proceeds and took on a 12-year operating lease. We'll incur a book loss of approximately $10 million on the transaction and have a favorable loss for tax purposes as well. The book loss will be excluded from our non-GAAP metrics in Q3.","And third, you won't see any changes in this quarter's financial statements stemming from the 8-K we filed in September related to the dispute with the State of Maryland on the Medicaid Enterprise Restructuring Project, otherwise known as MERP.","We will soon appeal the absurd and speculative decision by the State Department of Health, and the case will proceed to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals for a fresh review.","We currently have about $28 million in deferred revenue and $60 million of deferred costs on our balance sheet. No reserve or other change to our accounting is merited under GAAP as we continue to feel very positively about our chances of success in the court proceedings.","Now on to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we're maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2018, including revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million.","Let me give you a little color on where we're trending in each of those ranges. With the successful defense of our largest recompete and another quarter of important new business wins, we expect year-over-year organic growth in the second half of the year, and revenue visibility should continue to improve.","At the midpoint of guidance, we now expect that about 98% of our revenue would come from existing business, which is up from about 91% last quarter. Of the remaining 2%, more than half would come from recompetes.","We'll also begin to get contribution from Praxis in the back half of the third quarter. Like NES, the Praxis revenue run rate is about equal to its purchase price. So, all in, we now expect to be near the top end of our revenue guidance range.","On EBITDA, after 2 quarters, we're a little more than halfway to the top end of the range. We expect our EBITDA margin to be lower in the second half than the first. Praxis is mostly a cost-plus business, so its margins are in the single digits. The additional EBITDA from Praxis puts us closer to the top or potentially slightly above our EBITDA guidance range.","On EPS, our run rate after 2 quarters puts us at the low end of guidance. After the usual Q3 sequential decline driven by holiday leave taking, we expect EPS performance to accelerate in the fourth quarter as the investments in milCloud 2.0 and other early-stage programs begin to tail off, ending up the year in the lower part of the guidance range.","Praxis will likely be awash in FY '18 if we end up securing additional debt financing, presumably trading off higher short-term interest cost for more flexibility and lower long-term rate risk.","Finally, we expect cash flow to follow the same pattern as FY '17 and accelerate in the back half of the year to land us within our guidance range. One cash flow benefit we've generated already in Q3 is our reimbursement for the $25 million payment we made last year related to a CSC divestiture.","As you think about quarterly revenue progression for the year, the ramp on FEMA and other programs should allow us to overcome most of the usual drop in the December quarter, which has been between 3% and 4% in each of the last 2 years. We should then have even stronger year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, particularly with the full quarter of Praxis.","On the adjusted EBITDA and EPS lines, the third quarter will probably be down from Q2 levels due to the usual seasonality and then rebound in the fourth quarter. We're not forecasting any material drop-off in revenue or earnings from the transition on our large recompete win based on the outstanding protest on the companion program.","And with that, operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Vafi with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Joseph Vafi","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Joe Vafi, Loop Capital. Just a couple of quick questions here. First, Larry, I just wanted to drill down on what you were saying about next-gen IT contract activity and brewing contract activity building momentum. I'm wondering, especially on the military side when you look at next-gen IT contract activity versus kind of what's been the bread and butter of a lot of say pure companies C4ISR.","Do you see that C4ISR kind of maintaining a steady pace? Or do you think that some of this next-gen IT is taking budget away from C4ISR? And then I've got a follow-up.","Lawrence Prior","Yes. So, I haven't looked at it as losing market share around C4ISR. It's still important to the department, and you see continued investment around the UAVs especially and through a whole variety of - from large to small. But they create massive amounts of data, and you're seeing that as a forcing function where people are trying to do more work with artificial intelligence and automation to try to cue analysts to change detection.","You can't do that if you don't have the data storage and the compute and really in the cloud. And what we've seen with the new leadership at the Pentagon is just a real forcing function to accelerate adoption with the def - Sec Def memo, an RFI on cloud, and we experienced positive acceleration and really great teamwork with customer for milCloud 2.0.","So, I think there's a realization that you want to take advantage of all of the data that's created by this platforms and be way more creative in having the right algorithms that give an improvement in legality where C4ISR with great data analytics and AI provided by cloud power, it's a weapon. And I think the Department recognizes and is supporting it.","Joseph Vafi","That's helpful. And then is there any update on that outstanding TSA recompete at this point?","Lawrence Prior","Yes. So, we're still in the preaward protest mode and TSA - GAO continues to adjudicate, and the drum keeps beating and it just keeps stalling.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Caso of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Caso","Hi, good evening. Congrats here. I read, and I think I heard you say that your acquisitions would be focused on national security going forward. So, is that really where your interest level is, and you don't have interest in civil and health? Should I read that, that way?","Lawrence Prior","I would rephrase it. So, we're pretty well done with acquisitions where we had 2 wonderful tuck-ins that give us technical advantage, great with customers, and they are both in national security. And I think that in this administration, in the world we have today, we need to do more across the intelligence and defense community.","And with the winning of our recompete and milCloud 2.0, we've got phenomenal, decade-long platforms for next-gen IT. And what NES does is help us with network fabric that's so critical to move data to a complex hybrid cloud, but also a lot of the savings that we want to achieve at the infrastructure level needs to be reinvested through things like these industrial funds to work the applications layer from mission apps.","So, we were underweight with mission apps and I think underweight in national security, and we fixed both with these acquisitions, Ed. And I think we're good for the moment, and I doubt I'll see another one of the quality come along in the near term, and we want to focus on execution and a balanced deployment of capital.","Edward Caso","My other question is around competition. Seems as we do our visits in the last year or 2, all your competitors' drumbeat has picked up as far as focusing on IT is concerned compared to the old mission outsourcing work. Seeing that change over the last several years of running this business and has that had an impact on pricing?","Lawrence Prior","We've not. I've been waiting for fast followers for a couple of years around next-generation IT. And this last month, I spent quality time with the Microsoft Azure team at their federal forum here in D.C., and we're still center stage. And we live, breathe, wake up every morning excited about teaming with Amazon and Azure and moving work to the cloud.","I think we need more companies helping us make a market to accelerate the scale and the momentum of this move. And don't underestimate how important artificial intelligence, machine learning and how it improves so much in both legality on the defense side, performance of systems.","And we're just in the early innings, and I think we need more companies who are careful about this and concerned about this to help all of government make this transformation. And over the next 4 to 5 years, I think there's plenty of room for all of us to help government transform.","Edward Caso","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hi, good evening and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on your guidance comment earlier in terms of your revenue outlook. How do you feel a little bit, given the FEMA contract that leaves us $142 million and Praxis maybe contributing 1 point of growth just in the fourth quarter? I guess how do you feel about your organic outlook versus 3 months ago?","David Keffer","It's Dave. The FEMA contract has a ceiling of $141 million. The actual final revenue contribution from that contract will be dependent on both our ability to supply as many agents as are needed to field those important calls as well as the volume of those calls that come in through the FEMA lines. And it's likely that, that total certainly over the next several months will be less than the ceiling value that was established.","With that said, we feel great about the - our ability to support that customer, obviously in a critical time of need for them and for the people that were affected by those natural disasters and it does have a favorable impact on our organic growth in the third quarter, potentially into the fourth quarter depending on the duration of the demand for those calls.","So incrementally, I'd say we feel a bit better there. Certainly, we've got a large volume of new bids outstanding. We talked about $10 billion in total new business and total submissions outstanding and $5 billion of that of new business alone submitted just in the second quarter. So, we feel good about our ability to get some substantial new business wins in the second half and drive momentum into FY '19.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just on that point, Dave, in terms of the $5 billion of new business submission, can you maybe give us an idea how they're allocated on a contract basis? Is there one large one or what area that's driving that pipeline?","David Keffer","If you think of the end of this quarter, we have about 25 pending bids north of $100 million, and that's up from 22 that we reported back in first quarter. Of those, about 15 of them are in the Fed\/Civ side of the business and 10 around national security. And we continue to track mega deals, and that's up as well quarter-to-quarter.","So, we're tracking about 23 right now versus 19 a quarter ago. And what struck me was the size, magnitude of how much we're bidding. But also on the megadeals, it's about 50-50 across national security and Fed\/Civ. And seeing the continued enterprise IT jobs on the Fed\/Civ side is - I wouldn't call it a pleasant surprise, but it was good to see.","And I think the balanced portfolio and the broader reach, more so than a pure play defense contractor could do or a pure play Fed\/Civ, I think it underpins our strategy and supports our position around enterprise IT going to next-gen.","Lawrence Prior","In terms of contract type, Sheila, I think if you look at the submits over the past, let's say, in FY '18, they've been a little bit lower in terms of percentage of fixed-price than our current mix, but many of those jobs can still evolve, and we certainly want to take our customers to outcome-based procurements even on those things that may start out in a T&M or cost-plus kind of nature.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you.","Lawrence Prior","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So, Dave, in your comments on the guidance, trending towards the low end of earnings, does that include any accretion, positive accretion from the deal that just closed or is about to close?","David Keffer","That hasn't closed yet. We expect it to close later in the third quarter. It's minimally accretive if given our assumption around the financing efforts that we'll be tying to that acquisition, Gautam. So, we just talked about both the additional EBITDA from Praxis but offset to a degree on the EPS line by the potential for additional interest costs as we get even more flexibility and duration in our capital structure.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And Dave, just generally, I know we talked about some of this contract transitions. You guys have been very open about it, how you've outperformed on margins really since the spin-off in the way that creates a tougher bar as you move forward as contracts renew and new stuff ramps.","When we think about fiscal '19, should we expect a similar kind of transition year where organic growth maybe moves higher as you convert some of these orders into revenue, but we have a little bit more stunted earnings growth just as margin transition that extends into fiscal '19 as well? I'm just trying to frame kind of earnings growth next year. I know you're not guiding to it yet but...","David Keffer","So, you took the words right out of my mouth, Gautam. So, we'll guide FY '19 in May. And obviously, there's a reason for that where there's a lot that remains to be seen between now and May in terms of new business developments and the continued pace there. We do have some key recompetes.","We're ecstatic to have the next 10 years of runway for that critical intelligence customer. As we're asked earlier, the TSA recompete process is still ongoing as well as the large war fighter-focused recompete which is ongoing in terms of changes in timing and structure, and so we're following that very carefully.","The FEMA work that is significant to the second half of this year, we'll see what its long-term implications are. On the flip side, we're ecstatic about the pace of new business we've been able to generate over the past 18 months.","We have 25 pending opportunities of $100 million or more, and we feel like we're really well positioned for long-term growth. So hopefully, that gives you a sense for where we are over the next several years. Where any one year falls in that mix obviously remains to be seen. And we'll get much better more specific guidance on that come May.","Gautam Khanna","And just to be clear, on that big intelligence contract, you won the main portion of that. I was wondering if you could give us the status of the other 2 pieces. I thought one of them went to a different team, but I wasn't exactly sure you can get added on to it. And then what about the third piece, Res 1, Res 2, if you will?","Lawrence Prior","Now that we've won our recompete, Gautam, I'm going to comment less about the other 2 contracts, only that we'll be center stage as they get adjudicated and we'll work cooperatively with the winners. We are very focused on performing on our current work, making that transition. And that's about all I'm going to say right now.","Gautam Khanna","Does it present a sizable headwind on margins next year, the outcome of that big contract having been rebid? Or is that something that's fairly easily digested?","Lawrence Prior","I think where we are the margin profile, Leigh and her team are doing a great job, and we just have to see how it scales year-to-year with the delay, that gets us some advantage in '18. And it's still what that impact is in '19.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And then just last one in terms of the uses of capital going forward, you mentioned M&A is probably less likely. You're going to extend the terms on debt. How do you think about earnings growth and share repurchase as it relates to earnings growth as we look into the next couple of years? Is that an important lever? Or is it more on deleveraging post the acquisition and - how do you measure it?","David Keffer","It is, Gautam. This is Dave. So, the 3 legs of that stool remain of equal importance to us, and we'll weigh them on a quarterly basis going forward. Going into FY '18, we happen to identify a couple of really incredibly valuable acquisition targets, and we're ecstatic to merge with the folks at NES and now Praxis.","But to Larry's earlier points, that doesn't mean that likely we'll find such perfect fits on a typical quarter going forward. We'll look to reduce debt, and we'll balance that with shareholder returns depending on current valuation and our perception of the relative returns that we get on each.","Certainly, EPS growth is an important for metric - metric for us just as it is for our shareholder base, and that will remain a key element of our cash deployment plan.","Gautam Khanna","All right. Thanks a lot guys. Good luck.","David Keffer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Krishna Sinha of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Krishna Sinha","Hi, thanks. So, in this year's - I just want to dig on your free cash flow numbers. This year's free cash flow, you've got a range of $330 million to $380 million, and you've got some onetime in there. You got the $45 million cash reimbursement, the sale-leaseback, and I think you had another $25 million from the divestiture.","Can you - so can you give us what's - if you take out all the one-times, what's your underlying free cash flow number that you're going to hit for this year? And then what can we expect going forward?","David Keffer","So, the only onetime item included in that guidance is the $25 million reimbursement, which is related to divestitures from years ago at CSC. The sale-leaseback would not be included in our free cash flow line. It will be a cash inflow to the company but outside of the free cash flow definition.","So that is excluded but certainly a helpful contributor to our cash position. The $25 million reimbursement for what we paid out last year is really the only onetime item included in that $330 million to $380 million.","Krishna Sinha","Okay. And could you give some commentary on what you expect going forward, especially since you have some large tranches of debt due in the next 2 or 3 years. So, can you just talk about cash flow generation in comparison to debt repayment?","David Keffer","Sure. So, as we talked about earlier, we're looking carefully at our capital structure right now, and we'll look to have the optimal mix of durations in our debt structure going forward as we think about how to finance the Praxis acquisition. And so, it's possible we'll have a longer duration mix of debt on our balance sheet before too long here.","Certainly, we feel very good about our ability to cover our interest payments and make significant debt reductions each year as we have in each year to date. That will continue to be a key element of our cash deployment strategy.","So, generating well over $300 million of free cash flow per year, you should expect that the debt reduction will be a significant use of that cash in each subsequent year.","Lawrence Prior","So, Krishna, although we do have the onetime upper of the $25 million in this year, one thing that we've talked about in the past is sometime towards the back part of this year we'll be on one financial system, and we certainly are hopeful and have every expectation that working capital will be a positive contribution to free cash flow as we move into FY '19.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matt McConnell","Thanks, good evening. Now that you're through the large recompete that you discussed this quarter, could you frame - and I know you mentioned the impact program. How much of your revenue is up for recompete over the next year?","David Keffer","Sure. I can give you a sense for that. You're right. Certainly, the largest recompete is now behind us. We've said in the past that the TSA recompete is in the range of 3% of our revenue historically, and that there are a couple of other programs. We mentioned one of them earlier. War fighter focus is in that same 2% to 3% range. Nothing else rises to that level.","And so, in aggregate, it's a pretty typical year as we look at the next kind of 12 months if you think of that as the period in question. It's a pretty typical next 12 months of recompete volume, which would be, in a typical year about 20% of our total business space.","Matt McConnell","Okay. All right. Great. And Larry, you mentioned your third quarter is off to a pretty decent start, order-wise. I think some other companies had talked about a little uncertainty maybe, especially on the civil side just from budget uncertainty, administrative - administration change uncertainty. Are you seeing that at all through the CR period? Or any comment on that?","Lawrence Prior","So far, it's been business as usual. And several of the takeaways I talked about were awarded in good order. Now we're also seeing the protest. So, the VA win I talked about was timely, well executed by the VA as you might expect protested, but we expect they'll be just as disciplined as the deal with that. So that's why I wanted to discuss we're seeing real positive signs as we enter the third quarter and lead.","David Keffer","And we'll have another large win in the civil side. It will be a recompete, but awards continue to happen on that side. As Larry talked about, there are lots of opportunities we see in the civil market going forward.","Matt McConnell","Okay, great. Thank you.","David Keffer","Andrea, I'm showing that there's nothing else in the queue. So, with that, I think that we're going to conclude the call. And again, Andrea, thank you for your help on the call today, and thank you all for your interest in CSRA.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"6316":["CSRA, Inc. (NYSE:CSRA) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call November  9, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Stuart Davis - VP of IR and Strategy","Larry Prior - CEO","Dave Keffer - CFO","Analysts","Edward Caso - Wells Fargo","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Co","Amit Singh - Jeffries","Bill Loomis - Stifel","Operator","Welcome to the CSRA Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.","Stuart Davis","Thank you, Austin and welcome, everyone to today's quarterly earnings conference call. Larry Prior, our CEO and Dave Keffer, our CFO, are here to discuss our financial results, business momentum and forward outlook. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. Turning to slide 2 of the presentation, please note that during this call we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.","For a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our Form 10-K from May. In addition, the statements represent our views as of today and subsequent events may cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. Finally, as shown on slide 3, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics which we believe provide useful information for investors. The slide deck for today's call includes reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Larry who will begin on slide 4.","Larry Prior","Thanks, Stuart and good afternoon, everybody. We're thrilled to report a quarter of strong execution across the board. It's our best quarter yet since going public and we're pretty excited about it. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS were all above both our forecast and the consensus estimates. Kudos to all of our program managers who were able to accelerate mission delivery for our customers and drive excellent performance.","This performance shows up in sequential revenue and EBITDA growth and in the especially strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 8.1% which helped drive adjusted EPS growth on 10% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Key to EBITDA margins were well above our long term target of 16% to 17%. Our aggressive execution on the synergy case has built a strong foundation, but achieving these levels is a result of tremendous execution and discipline on the part of our seasoned program managers. Because fixed price contracts are such a large part of our mix, we have become industry best at executing fixed price work. We may now and then dial back our margins as we invest in and deliver growth, but strong fixed price execution is an essential part of our DNA and achieving our long term target of 16% to 17%.","Beyond the financial results, I want to focus your attention on three key points. First, what we're seeing now validates the strategy and the operating model that we laid out just about a year ago. Second, our business development engine is humming, generating substantial new wins in a very competitive environment. And third, our talent management team is rapidly staffing our new wins to position us for sustainable growth.","So let me speak to each of these three points in more detail. Point number one. We're really hitting our stride as a new Company. Our second quarter results demonstrate the promise of CSRA as we pivot towards growth and continue to deliver industry-leading profitability. It's now been a year since we got together for our analyst day in New York and we'll celebrate a year as a publically traded company in December. A lot has happened over that time and we've had many successes and a few challenges. Still, I see the last year as validating our strategy and our operating model. Let me start at the beginning with our customers.","Our employees remain committed to customer success and customer satisfaction remains high. Passion for mission is a shared value for all our employees and it is central to all that we do. While revenues has occasionally been a challenge with greater headwinds than we expected from our legacy book of business, our BD engine is now firing on all cylinders and we have proven that we can beat entrenched competitors on both technical innovation and cost efficiency. Our focus on next generation thinking and robust two way partnerships with leading technology vendors is spurring new business wins that will drive growth.","For example, on the last call I referenced our first emerging technology partner day that we hosted over the summer. We already have built an offering around [indiscernible], an especially exciting technology partner whose product provides visibility throughout the entire application infrastructure stack to deliver past, present and most importantly, predictive analytics. We see tremendous applicability throughout the Department of Homeland Security for this offering and using our DC1 contract to deliver. We held our second emerging technology partner day last week and I look forward to more success in working with new and innovative players to bring the best technology to bear to help our customers' missions.","Now we've come together rapidly which has accelerated the development of a new culture and an operating model that has generated tremendous cost savings and made us more competitive in the marketplace. We outlined a synergy case and then doubled the saving in half the time. We're still maturing our processes, but our commitment to cost discipline and innovative solutions are hallmarks that you can depend on from us.","Point number two. The business development results for the quarter were just outstanding. We posted our seventh straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our government customers accelerated awards at the end of their fiscal year and we posted $2.4 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.9 times. Over the past year, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.3.","As impressive as the reported business development numbers are, they understate just how good a quarter it was. 63% of the bookings in the quarter were for new business as opposed to recompetes and our win rate on new business was 40% which is well above our target rate of 25%. Moreover, we had a $744 million award in the quarter, most of which was new business for CSRA, that was subsequently protested. Now, the contracting organization for this award has 100% success rate defending its original decisions against protests, so we're confident that we will ultimately prevail. If we had included that award in the second quarter bookings, our total bookings would have been $3.2 billion for a book-to-bill ratio of 2.5 times, including $2.3 billion in new business. This is more than double the target of $1 billion in new awards each quarter, even as we're still ramping up our submit volume.","Our investments in business development and our focus on next generation solutions are paying off. Our new business wins position us well to return to organic growth in FY18. The second quarter marked the moment where we saw the full benefits of our merger and integration. For the first time, the new business awards were primarily the result of combined CSRA bids. George Batsakis and his BD team are truly industry's best and we believe we can win anything we go after.","The awards reflected broad based success across the entire portfolio with six awards north of $100 million in total contract value. We had significant new awards in each of our four groups and both in mission and in IT. The common theme throughout is delivering innovative and efficient technology solutions to our customers' most pressing needs. Let me highlight just a few of the major wins in the quarter to give you a sense of what I mean.","First, our largest award was a five year, $503 million blanket purchase agreement to provide background checks for the office of personnel management. Gil Dussek and his team will manage the program for us and they were instrumental in the vision of how to win and then execute this work by introducing new partners and new technology into a workflow to significantly increase efficiency and improve quality. We performed background investigations across all four of our groups and see screening and vetting as a strong potential growth vector for us and a process that's just screaming for next generation data analytics.","Second, John Marshall led the take-away of $114 million cyber program to develop and deploy a network security strategy to protect the offices throughout the Pentagon. CSRA will also work with the U.S. cyber command to provide situational awareness of potential network threats. This program is a tremendous calling card of our deep and significant cyber capabilities. Third, Tasha Wilson-Daley leads a team that won $116 million contract to modernize the IT systems of the Office of Justice programs within the Department of Justice. This is a key component of our growth strategy, helping existing enterprise IT customers realize their digital future and in this case through cloud migration, agile application development, a real focus on mobile application development and leveraged shared services.","Fourth, Agon Donyez, led the successful capture of the $73 million contract to manage a portfolio of cloud computing services across the Department of Veteran Affairs. This was one of a number of cloud wins in the quarter with many more pending and in discussion. Here is a prime example of where we're leveraging our firsthand experience of transitioning our own data to the cloud and building on decades of systems integration and expertise to be the go-to cloud provider for the public sector.","Fifth, we won a $45 million three year contract to advise the U.S. Customs and Border Protection on effective and efficient methods to detect and prevent unlawful travel and trade. Alfonso Delucio will head up a collaborative team of systems engineers and logisticians to identify and deploy intuitive leading edge technology to secure and protect our borders. On top of these Q2 wins, we continue to see significant opportunities to take market share. Across the Company, we submitted $4.9 billion of proposals for new business in the second quarter and we're on a pace to achieve our FY17 target of $16 billion in new bids. At the end of the quarter we had $12 billion in submits outstanding and looking only at new business, we had about $6.4 billion awaiting decision including 18 opportunities each greater than $100 million in total value.","Our third quarter should be another strong quarter for awards. As I said, the $744 million award that was protested should be resolved and we have more than $3 billion in additional new business award decisions expected in the quarter. This kind of momentum is keeping morale high, but on the BD team and really at every level across the entire Company.","Which brings to my third key point. Talent. In the second quarter, we had record new hires of about 1,300 employees, another 500 who accepted with future start dates and we still have about 1,000 more funded openings. The acceptance rate on offers extended is about 90%. Our new wins are creating a demand for new talent and we're having great success bringing on people who are attracted to the combination of deep mission expertise with a focus on next generation thinking around IT. And a culture that builds around core principles like best idea wins where we work across barriers, we work across domains and we work across hierarchies to find the best idea to solve any problem. Importantly, many of those new hires were in our integrated technology center in Bossier City, Louisiana. Next week our team will be at the formal ribbon cutting ceremony. As we build up staff and capability at the state-of-the-art IT and data center, we're bringing great jobs to Louisiana, developing more efficient and effective solutions for our customers and providing a great work environment for our team.","The key driver for ITC growth in this quarter was our enterprise service operation center win for the Defense Intelligence Agency. Under $167 million contract, Kelly Miller is leading a team that manages self-help knowledge portals and provides remote service desk resolution and in-field customer engagements supporting the Intelligence customers globally. This program is a future platform for next generation software as a service, offering to a broad set of customers and is just a wonderful platform for the Company. And we're going to keep this momentum up at the ITC with $150 million third quarter new business award that will implement shared services and partnered with service now for the Department of Commerce.","Finally, early this morning our nation elected Donald Trump as our next President. With congratulations from President Obama and Secretary Clinton, we celebrate the peaceful transfer of power and the quick move to governance of the nation. The prevailing message has been one of change and we now will see how broad that change can be. President-elect Trump has spoken in favor of easing sequestration, enhancing infrastructure and defense spending and taking care of veterans, all areas of strength for us. Also as the largest IT provider to DHS, we expect to benefit from a focus on delivering mission success to that department. We will continue to navigate the complexities of government well and the demand for information technology and technology-enabled mission services is going to remain strong. Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook.","Dave Keffer","Okay. Thanks, Larry and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that the second quarter results were ahead of our expectations on almost all measures. The results are also fairly straightforward as GAAP and adjusted results are steadily coming into closer alignment as we approach the one year mark post-merger.","Turning to slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, up 1% sequentially and down 4% from pro forma revenue in the second quarter of FY16. The sequential growth was the result of a lot of hard work across the team and I see it as an early indicator that we're turning the corner on revenue. Quarterly revenue and profitability benefited from some pull-forward of program deliveries that were expected in the third and fourth quarters across both segments. These accelerated deliveries drove the sequential increases in revenue and EPS when we had expected a slight decline in both. Our contract mix also improved slightly, as a percentage of total revenue 46% was on fixed price contracts, 20% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost plus contracts. We see contract trends continuing to support our attractive business mix.","As a result of strong contract performance and merger synergies, profitability and earnings were excellent. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $229 million, up 5% sequentially and down 3% from the same period a year ago with a record EBITDA margin of 18.1%. Similarly, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.56, up 10% from last quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 6% compared to the second quarter of FY16. In the second quarters of FY16 and now FY17, we executed our programs with outstanding efficiency, leading to a higher volume of contract EAC improvements and other pick-ups than usual and driving a quarterly spike in EBITDA margins.","In addition, our aggressive execution of the merger synergy case has laid the foundation for the FY17 results. We've been able to accelerate and amplify the savings based on the phenomenal efforts of the finance team and really the entire Company. Over the next few quarters, we expect our EBITDA margin to decline from the Q2 level toward our FY17 guidance in the low to mid-17% range. Our longer term guidance range of 16% to 17% which would still lead our peer group, remains appropriate as we pivot toward top line growth.","I'll walk through a few of the income drivers with a focus on what's changed from last quarter. Pretax merger and integration costs which are GAAP expenses, but excluded from adjusted EBITDA, were $8 million or about of half of what they were last quarter. These expenses will continue to decline over the next few quarters. Below EBITDA, depreciation and amortization excluding the intangible amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, was $47 million or $2 million less than last quarter. Interest expense was $29 million in the quarter, down about $1 million from last quarter as we continue to take down our debt. Our effective tax rate was around 36%, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter, but down 3 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Finally, pension related income was $24 million, so no change there, but we always want to be clear about the non-cash contribution to adjusted EBITDA and EPS.","Now turning to slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $55 million which was lower than expected. Days sales outstanding were 57 days as of the quarter end, an increase of three days sequentially. DSO typically improves in the final quarter of the government's fiscal year but we didn't experience the usual volume of early payments this year. Cash flow was also affected by one-time payments and timing items. For example, we made tax payments of $45 million in the quarter compared to about $2 million in the first quarter.","We also made a $25 million payment to another contractor, pursuant to a divestiture agreement executed in 2013. When the government reimburses that contractor, they'll pass along the payment to us and we expect that reimbursement to occur this fiscal year. This advance payment was a one-off transaction and there's nothing similar remaining on our books. In addition, second quarter capital expenditures were higher than usual due to the timing of customer requirements. And approximately $20 million of our Q2 CapEx was non-cash in nature, related to the accounting treatment of training equipment deployed on one of our large programs. As a result, free cash flow during the quarter was $8 million, direct project capital expenditures should normalize in the second half of FY17.","We followed our balanced capital allocation program in Q2, deploying $50 million to pay down debt and $24 million to return to shareholders, $16 million in dividends and $8 million in share repurchases. We spent another $5 million on share buybacks in early October for a total of about 0.5 million shares in late Q2 and early Q3. $337 million now remains on our current share repurchase authorization. As of September 30, 2016, we had $68 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen as we pay down debt and grow EBITDA. Since going public, we've now paid down about $320 million in debt and have improved to about 3 times net debt to EBITDA. We prioritize debt paydown to create flexibility and to enable our balance sheet to be a strategic asset going forward.","Now onto the forward outlook. We're maintaining our guidance as shown on slide 7. We continue to project FY17 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $905 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.91 and $2.04 and free cash flow between $300 million and $350 million.","Let me now address our visibility into the rest of FY17 and early signs of what to expect in FY18. Annualizing revenue for the first half remains near the low end of our FY17 range. On our last call I talked about needing to generate about $150 million of revenue from new business to reach the bottom of the revenue range. With our strong awards in the second quarter, we've taken care of most of that figure. In fact, the awards made in the quarter should generate more than $400 million in incremental revenue on an annual basis. But our two largest awards in the quarter aren't expected to generate revenue until December or later. The OPM contract requires us to build capability and then process investigations before significant revenue is recognized. And resolution of the protest on our $744 million Army win isn't expected until the end of the third quarter.","So while we've increased our confidence in driving organic growth in 2018, we still have greater visibility into the lower end of this year's revenue range than the top. But on the bottom line through the first half of the year we're tracking toward the high side of our EPS guidance range. There are three other P&L items that we should discuss, even though they won't have a material impact on our adjusted EBITDA or of EPS this year. First, the term loan markets have improved since our spin merger transaction. So we're in the process of repricing a reduction in the spread on our term loan B effective at the end of November, when the soft call provision expires at the one year anniversary of our loans.","We also expect to repay a portion of our term loan B outstanding balance by upsizing the current term loan A. This transfer of debt would reduce our effective interest rate and we also expect to extend the maturities of all loans by one year and amend certain terms and conditions of the credit agreement in our favor. The non-cash accelerated amortization charges associated with this amend and extend transaction would increase our GAAP interest expense in Q3. But consistent with industry practice, we'd exclude this one time charge from our adjusted earnings figures. Going forward, the repricing should reduce our cash interest expense by around $5 million per year and the extended loan duration and amended terms provide us with outstanding flexibility in executing our strategy.","Second, for the last few quarters we've incurred $16 million of intangible amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog. Going forward, GAAP intangibles expense will decline with only two months of backlog related amortization in the third quarter figure and none thereafter. This has no impact on our guidance but as we've noted previously it will impact our of GAAP EPS. And third, this fall we've offered to buy out certain groups in our frozen pension program. The offer has just recently closed, so we don't have a final tally, but we will shrink both the assets and obligations of the pension program. This will necessitate a mark to market adjustment in our third quarter in addition to the usual fourth quarter adjustment.","It's too soon to tell the direction or magnitude of the mark to market adjustments or any changes to recurring pension income. But the recent mortality table update should be favorable. Remember that the mark to market adjustments are in GAAP EBITDA and GAAP EPS, but not in the adjusted EBITDA or EPS that we guide to and that none of these changes impact cash flow. We do expect free cash flow to rebound and to end the year within the guidance range.","With higher holiday leave taking from our employees and our government customers in the December quarter, we expect Q3 revenue EBITDA and EPS to decline slightly, consistent with our experience last year, when pro forma revenue declined approximately $50 million sequentially. Seasonal improvements in growth from many of the large Q2 and Q3 wins should drive a meaningful sequential improvement in Q4. This would imply that we're closer to organic growth in the fourth quarter and that we enter FY18 with strong momentum and an opportunity for top line growth to reach the range of our long term model of 2% to 3%. In summary, we continue to deliver industry leading profitability and we can see growth on the horizon based on outstanding business development momentum. With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Caso","Can you spend a little more time talking about your ability to access the talent that you need. Obviously you're crushing it here on the new business side. Particularly in the context of these IT professionals and mission professionals often having to have security clearances and what efforts maybe you're doing on the greening side and if that is - you're getting any pushback from clients on any greening efforts. Thanks.","Larry Prior","Thanks, Ed, for the question. It's a great example of why we created the ITC in city, Louisiana. As we do job fair there we're working it in two ways. So one is recruiting off of barksdale Air Force base and across the military community in Louisiana that bring clearances and tech. Second, we're working very collaboratively with the local universities, bringing folks into our internship programs, starting them out in our shared services leveraged facilities on programs that don't require clearances, get them into the process and start moving them up that chain.","And it won't answer all of our problems, all of our questions, but it gives us a really important lever. Not just to find talent, but to make sure it's competitively priced, compared to what you see in the beltway. We still remain competitive within the beltway and as I talked to the kind of 90% acceptance rates. As you've noticed and others have commented on, it's a very competitive environment. We have to attract and we think that mix of commitment to mission, passion for mission with all of the things that are really necessary when you think about automation and going to a digital future is attractive and competitive.","So we're working hard on it. It's good that we've got enough of an investment in the culture where we're shifting our emphasis and building on business development to think about people first as it fuels the growth of the Company.","Edward Caso","My other question is on the cloud, the cloud phenomenon in general. Obviously you're very active in that area. Does that hurt your business at all as some of your older contracts run off and they're put more into a cloud scenario? Or is the opportunity to get fresh work with the cloud then making up for that? Thank you.","Larry Prior","I mean, I'm of the belief that most of our Federal Government customers first look to a hybrid capability where they have an on-prem within their four walls and may look to another private cloud where there's good insight as to where the data at rest is. We do have some aggressive customers on the Fed side just pushing work packages right out to agluer or Amazon. That's the future you've got to recognize and embrace.","Yes, you could cannibalize some of your own work. The classic model is where we're using remedy inside a facility with lots of people and we kick it out to service now with software as a service and get phenomenal improvements in labor savings. That provides a much lower cost to our federal government customer but it allows you to price it competitively and guard your margins. So we'll always opt for leveraged services with automation to guard our margins and at times we'll put some of our own cannibalized revenue at mix. You can see we're pretty passionate about that model. We think it is the future. And you've got to rush to it as opposed to avoid it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Co. Go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","No problem. It's nice to have such an open discussion. I had a couple questions that weren't addressed. I guess first, just if you can update us on what the status of the greenway, ground breaker recompete is and if you have a better sense whether the sum of the three will have enough work scope to equal or exceed the current 7% of revenue the contract represents, if you were to prevail in all three pieces.","Larry Prior","So first, relative to the main GES bid, the government's come back to us as well as our main competitor. It appears the adjudication of it is slipping from like late spring to late summer of next year. And with the transition period it's moving from being an FY18 event for us to being an FY19 event. I also think the context is important that you've seen some debate and discussion of whether or not you separate the leadership of NSA from cyber command and then whether or not you have a civilian leader at the helm at NSA.","And when you think of the work that President-elect Trump wants to do with a review of all the cyber defense and vulnerabilities he's going to look at joint task forces that walk across federal, state, local government. He absolutely wants to look at enhancing cyber command and then he's spoken p at length about improving offensive capabilities really focused on deterrents. So I think that when you think of GES as well as Riz1 and Riz2 as. There may be additional delays as they reset but we'll take it in stride and continue to perform.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And then if it does indeed slip a year, does the interim contract extension carry similar terms to what you're doing now or is there a price reset that we should be mindful of? That would affect fiscal 2018?","Dave Keffer","It's Dave. So we're under contract through part of fiscal year 2018 already. The exact structure of an extension beyond that period is very much TBD, to include what the pricing would look like of that extension. When we say it's mostly an FY19 event, it's essentially because if the government's stated at what timeline is nearly halfway through our fiscal 2018 and there's a significant transition. We're fortunate enough to be the winner, the new contract structure really only takes effect throughout most of FY19. The details of the later portion of FY18 would look like are very much TBD, as is the final sizing of the overall greenway program across those three pieces you mentioned. It's not only competitively sensitive but frankly too early to have a really clear sense for what that total package would look like.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. One thing that caught my attention in your opening comments was the 40% win rate in the quarter and I wanted - just kind of reverse engineering, it looks like the $1.2 billion roughly of the bookings were new and the OPM presumably accounted for a big slug of that. Was this just a function of a couple chunky wins in the quarter or - I just wonder how we should you assess the original theory of 25% as being kind of an acceptable level or are we at a point where the funnel is targeted such a way that you think north of that is actually sustainable or was it just a function of a couple chunky bids that went your way this quarter.","Dave Keffer","I think it's too early to know the answer to that question. What we've seen so far certainly makes us really pleased with the performance of our business development engine and all of the people that worked tirelessly on the bids that went into that pipeline and that generated the volume of awards we're talking about. And as we said in the scripted comments, September was really the first quarter where the vast majority of what was awarded had been bid as a CSRA bid, not as a legacy Company bid. Best information to date in terms of validity of data to project what the long term win rate of the combined Company will be but far too early to say 25% is understated and it will be closer to the Q2 40% rate. We're really pleased with where it was in Q2 but need a lot more data before we can get confident in anything higher than that.","Stuart Davis","Just to pin those numbers down, so if we look at just the new business, that's $1.5 billion in new business. So if you take the OPM out of that your you're still talking about $1 billion of new business wins, all of the things that Larry walked through to include the big cyber win and so on is essentially new business for us. So it was not just one win but it was really strong performance across the business.","Gautam Khanna","That's helpful context, Stuart. Thank you. And one last one, maybe Dave if you could just run through some numbers with us. The gross margins you mentioned a little higher in the quarter and wanted to know if you could give us any quantification of award fee pick-ups. You also mentioned some pull-forward of Q3 and Q4 sales into Q2. How large that is and just so we calibrate correctly in Q3 and Q4 with respect to the top line. So first the margin and then second the pull-forward.","Dave Keffer","Sure. We're a few quarters into life as an independent public Company and in each of those quarters we've talked about the solid execution on fixed price programs. So we're still settling into figuring out exactly what a typical quarter looks like in terms of EAC improvements. This quarter was a few million higher than we were expecting it would be entering the quarter in terms of EAC benefits and a few million higher than the first quarter was as you'll see in the 10-Q that we file overnight tonight.","Big picture, though, every quarter will look a little bit different in terms of fixed price program performance and we'll continue to try to drive outstanding delivery on every one of those programs as Larry mentioned in his earlier comments, fixed price program execution is really a hallmark of the Company at this point and we'll continue to drive for outsize performance every quarter. Gross margins and then the overall 18.1s% EBITDA margin, though, are not what we're projecting over any future period.","They were particularly strong in this quarter. To the second point on - of your question about what was pulled forward in revenue from Q3 and Q4, we had projected going into the quarter on our last call that our numbers would be down slightly in the top line from Q1 to Q2. Instead, they were up about $10 million in revenue. If you were to think of having projected down $10 million or $20 million consistent with consensus and delivered $10 million of upside instead, that $20 million or $30 million is not an unreasonable kind of volume to associate with what was pulled forward from Q3 and Q4 into Q2.","Larry Prior","That's a good point. And we mentioned it earlier. Last year was a $50 million decline from Q2 to Q3. I think it was even higher than the prior year. Depending on contract types with the seasonal leave taking patterns you're always going to see a bit of a dip from Q2 to Q3.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Singh with Jeffries. Please go ahead.","Amit Singh","So on your guidance for the year on the top line, you spoke about already securing the $150 million of go get business to get to the bottom end. It seems like you're going after more and more of digital related projects which I believe are shorter term. So as we look at the rest of the year, you still got half a year left, is there any reason to believe that if you don't maintain the same - the bookings rate, the win rate and the trend, even the top line should be somewhere in the mid to high end of the range?","Dave Keffer","Just to clarify a couple things on your points, Amit. I'm glad you gave us an opportunity to shed some further light on it because there are a lot of moving pieces there as you'd imagine. We talked about needing $150 million or about 3% of our revenue guidance to get to the low end of guidance this time last quarter. And on my scripted comments we didn't exactly say that we had filled that entire bucket but that we filled most of it.","So think of us as being in that last 1% of the 3% we needed this time last quarter. Exactly what the Q3 and Q4 revenue results are will depend on a few factors. One, the ongoing pace of new business award activity and our success on recompetes. Certainly we're pleased with Q2 and as we mentioned a couple of wins in early Q3. The right kinds of momentum are in place but we need to continue to win new business to continue to fill the rest of the less than 1% gap to get to the low end of guidance and then to fill into the guidance range. Second, the continuing resolution has an effect on certain programs across the business and can influence our customers' thoughts on things like whether this is the right couple of months to do a direct material purchase or to engage in a surge in labor support.","Across a couple thousand programs, you can imagine that a million here and a million there add up and the exact timing of the resolution of the CR and what the new administration's priorities look like as they take place over the winter months will also have an effect, particularly as we enter Q4. So that combination of factors is what continues to influence our thinking every day. We think we've still got the right guidance range and we're pleased with the business development progress of the last few months.","Amit Singh","And then on your location, I think previously you had discussed that as you approach sort of the 1500 employee limit over there, you might start looking at some other locations. And it seems like most of the 1300 hires that you did were in that region. So are you already exploring a few other locations to expand your near shore capability? And also what is the capacity limit in.","Larry Prior","I can address that. The 1300 employees that we hired in the first quarter were spread broadly across our business and across locations as well. We were pleased with the volume of them that did occur in city. It certainly wasn't the majority of the 1300. As we mentioned, a few of our particularly valuable contract wins of the last three months, the DIA contract we talked about as well as the most recent commerce win, both have a substantial presence down in as do some other programs that we've been awarded in recent months.","So we're pleased with the momentum there, but we're not filled to capacity yet. To get to 1500 down there we would have the ability to expand our current facility footprint. We would look at doing so as soon as we come close to reaching the current footprint and its capacity. We'd love to have that problem sooner than later. To your earlier point, we'd consider other locations if and when we reach that 1500 mark down in.","Dave Keffer","And we're really excited that we've got a win that's going to perform there with leveraged services in support of the intelligence community. And then again, building on that with leveraged support for the Department of Commerce. So the model of having core talent there, leveraged across multiple programs where you're doing fixed price delivery and then bringing in all the circuits, all of the transport layer that is just critical that when you're supporting these customers and you're on their networks, it really opens up a wealth of opportunities for a Company trying to differentiate with this on-shore delivery capability. But I also caution, we're just cutting the ribbon next week so give us a few days to ramp that up.","Amit Singh","If I can sneak one more in, just a clarification question. As you talk about organic revenue growth in fiscal 2018, are you assuming that the ground-breaker contract remains in place for the full year?","Larry Prior","Sure, it's early yet and there are obviously a number of moving pieces. Ground breaker just one of them. But yes, our assumption around an organic growth outlook for next year, really any planning we would do for next year, would have ground breaker in place throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Loomis with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Bill Loomis","Looking at the OPM contract, I know you just from when khaki had it they hired a lot of people to staff that up. Is that a good portion of the 1300 related to that contract?","Larry Prior","We haven't even scratched the itch on that one yet. We're just beginning the infrastructure buildup, the initial processes and it's a new start for us. We're one of the two new providers for that specific customer set. So no, the 1300 were related to other parts of the business.","Bill Loomis","Okay. And then I know you're going to have the EAC benefit in the Q but can you just tell us what it was for the quarter?","Larry Prior","The net number between the favorable and unfavorable was in the high single digits this quarter, Bill. So not as high as a couple of prior quarters, but higher than the first quarter.","Bill Loomis","Okay. And then one thing on the starts. You said you're getting some of your contracts are starting faster than you thought. If we go back a couple quarters they were a little bit slower to start. What do you think's changed? Is it because we were later in the government fiscal year or was there anything else changing with customer behavior or is it just timing?","Larry Prior","I'll start and let Dave weigh in as well. So first, we've seen every year since 2013 where the government's gotten better at the discipline of awarding. There's a couple of vehicles where there's less opportunity for protest and a quicker start-up model and then I think just recognition on the part of my peers and myself to be thoughtful about when you protest. I think that's evolved a little bit. Now, we also mentioned we've got a big one that we're doing for the Army that was protested and we'll see if that's resolved this quarter. And we obviously want to start out OPM work well and make sure we invest the time and the effort to come out of the gates and really perform to that customer. So it's I think generally really good performance on the part of certain aspects of the government's acquisition force as they've matured. And then our ability to work with them cooperatively.","Dave Keffer","It's really a broad mix when you look across our contracts at the pace of start-up. Some of which to Larry's point is dependent on the level of protest activity which has varied across customer segments certainly and with the new regulations. But it also depends on the nature of the work and some contracts in our Q2 award total have already ramped up to full operational run rate while others as we've mentioned are slower and will gain that full run rate in the third and fourth quarters or even beyond. We expect a similar mix every quarter. The key is to win that large volume of new business such that FY18 and beyond really benefit from that full run rate and that's what we're really looking forward to.","Bill Loomis","Okay. Great. Just one quick last one. What was the impact of receivable sales on cash flow in the quarter?","Dave Keffer","It was a detriment in the quarter, between $25 million, $30 million, in that range. Compared to the first quarter factoring balance.","Stuart Davis","Austin, it looks like we've got no more questions in the queue so I think we'll call it a day here and thank you for your help with today's call. And then obviously thank you for listening in and your interest in CSRA. We look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming weeks and continuing the dialogue as we deliver mission success and hopefully create compelling opportunities for our employs ease and shareholders. And we'll be seeing you on the road.","Operator","All right. Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"6318":["CSRA, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.","Stuart Davis","Thank you, Nicole. Welcome, everyone to today's quarterly earnings conference call. Larry Prior, our CEO; and Dave Keffer, our CFO, are here to discuss our financial results for the quarter and the year, our position in the market and our forward outlook into fiscal year 2018.

The slide deck for today's call includes the reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. ","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Larry who'll begin on Slide 4.","Lawrence Prior","Thanks, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody and welcome to the call. We're excited to finish this year on a strong note and even more excited about what's to come in fiscal year 2018. The fourth quarter was highlighted by superb earnings, with adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS both well ahead of plan and we, again, had robust bookings. These achievements are the direct result of building brilliant teams, something I've been talking about since we launched. ","On earnings, it's all about program execution by dedicated project teams, working tough technical challenges and being aligned to around delivering shareholder value is a really important strategic imperative. The bookings are delivered by really good proposal teams that bring together customer insight and technology understanding to create innovative solutions under really tight time pressure. Our people really make a positive difference each and every single day. I simply couldn't be prouder of the efforts of the entire company and I thank every employee for all their hard work this last year.","Most importantly, the successes of last year give us confidence that we'll achieve organic growth in revenue in fiscal year 2018 while also maintaining strong profitability and free cash flow generation. ","With our first full fiscal year now on the books, I want to take a fresh look at where we're on the 3 major points of our investment thesis that we laid out when we formed. Specifically, I'll address our views, first, on our end market; second, revenue growth profile; and then third, our capital allocation. I'll then ask Dave to speak to our guidance for next year and our long term earnings growth outlook. ","First, our view of the market. We remain focused on the federal government and the state and local and international government markets related to it. At the time of the spin, our view was that the federal spending would grow very slowly, maybe 1% or so per year. We now expect a slight improvement in the level of spend and we're more optimistic about the long term market opportunity for CSRA. We're well positioned with many of the new administration's priorities, including defense, border security, cybersecurity, care for our veterans and driving efficiencies through technology and shared service delivery. To that point, we won major new business in FY '17 in each of these areas that are so important to the Trump administration. ","Earlier this month, President Trump signed into law a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September, the end of its fiscal year. The budget adds $15 billion towards defense and $1.5 billion for border security. Noticeably absent were the $18 billion in cuts for domestic spending that the administration had initially proposed, with discretionary budgets for the civil agencies now being generally flat. This is positive for CSRA and it's positive for our industry. ","Certainty around budgets and increased spending levels should lead to stronger-than-usual award activity in the June and September quarters. Our customers have relatively little time to put money under contract, so we're proactively reaching out to our customers with white papers and solutions that meet their mission needs and using existing contracts and available contract sealing to cover. The quick-turn nature of the services market makes it the primary beneficiary in an environment of this type.","Just yesterday, the administration published its budget request for government fiscal year 2018 which generally follows the outline of the skinny budget laid out in March. I see the FY '17 funding negotiations as a blueprint for the way forward in FY '18. The administration has called for increases in funding for its priorities and Congress will likely work compromises that address portions of those priorities without serious cuts to other agencies. We'll continue to see dramatic headlines and dramatic policy statements, but the Congress has turned to governing and we expect the budgets won't change as dramatically as the headlines might suggest. ","We'll probably begin fiscal year 2018 with a little drama given how much work needs to be done. I expect that we will begin the year with a continuing resolution but will be off of a higher FY '17 budget and we do not expect a government shutdown. At some point in the fall, Congress will also have to increase the debt ceiling and reach another spending compromise to avoid the sequestration caps, but there are strong bipartisan consensus around both of these actions. ","In total, compared to the time of the spin, we expect a more positive macro environment for CSRA in our industry, with more budget certainty, increased spending on national security and then protected budgets in the civil agencies as we see the Senate engage in the process which brings me to the second point, our revenue outlook. ","At the spin, we spoke of long term organic revenue growth rate of about 2% to 3%, meeting a point or 2 better than the market growth rate. We've been working through some of the churn that was built in at the spin and portions of that will continue, but we're forecasting organic growth in 2018 and we're now more bullish on the long term growth outlook than we've ever been. ","Business development is the foundation for growth and George Batsakis and his BD team, working hand-in-hand with our group leaders, have been putting up strong numbers all year. In the fourth quarter, we booked $1.3 billion in awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x, our ninth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. ","Through the hard work of our go-to-market teams over the past year, we were able to overcome the slowdowns from administration transition and budget uncertainty that we had previewed on the last call. 56% of the bookings in the quarter were for new business and our win rate on new business was once again above our target rate of 25%. Over the full year, we booked $6.9 billion in awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x. Moreover, we won $3.8 billion in new business during the year which should yield north of $700 million in annual revenue when we're fully ramped.","Bidding remains at a furious pace. At the end of the quarter, we had $11 billion in submits outstanding. In the first quarter, we expect to submit another $7 billion in bids and we could have about $6 billion adjudicated. Looking only at new business, we have about $6.5 billion awaiting decision, including 16 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. ","This quarter, our 2 largest new awards were with the Environmental Protection Agency. The first is a $266 million 5-year contract to develop and operate the EPA's infrastructure and application platforms. Key tasks on this effort include data center management, application hosting, application deployment and maintenance, geospatial service support, network security, cybersecurity and cloud computing.","The second win is a 5-year $58 million contract to provision, maintain and support the EPA's high-performance computing environment as well as its scientific visualization hardware and software. Kevin Connell, who leads our science and engineering business within the civil group, has done a great job in positioning us with the EPA under its changing mandate. ","We get many questions from investors about the potential for reductions to our EPA business. While we do have some policy-related work that could be at risk, most of our work with the EPA and throughout our portfolio is around enterprise and next-generation IT. In fact, these 2 new contracts are both takeaways and are essential to agency operations, plus IT is seen as an enabler for cost savings. ","We expect to grow our EPA business based on the compelling value proposition that we offer. Competitive excellence generally trumps market pressure. ","A key part of our revenue growth outlook derives from adoption of next-generation IT across government. As the technology bridge to the government, we leverage our alliance in emerging technology partners' investments in R&D and next-generation products to improve our clients' mission, productivity and cost efficiency. We have master service agreements in place with both Microsoft and Amazon Web Services as well as the capability to resell Azure and AWS services on GSA schedule 70. This reach allows us to select the right solution at the right cost point that meets our clients' missions. ","Another developing growth area centers around background investigation, insider threat and continuous monitoring. This is an area that is ripe for technology innovation. In addition to our recent OPM win which is ramping nicely, we're performing work in this area in all 4 of our groups and we recently received a new award in our intelligence group with more awards expected shortly. The demand for these services is massive, as evidenced by the number of our peer companies who cited the shortage of cleared staff on their most recent earnings calls. I believe that CSRA is the company that can best attack this problem and address the huge market opportunity with a technology edge. ","We're also seeing a slight pickup in downrange activity, consistent with the increase in defense spending and the current global threat environment. We will manage our risk well as we support our defense and intelligence customers in the theater. ","Across all of our markets, we're seeing more large and consolidated opportunities. We're focusing more of our resources on these larger deals which generally have less competition and higher returns. Given our scale, there's really no services contract that is too large for us to bid, to win and to execute. ","Last year, we had 2 adjudications north of $500 million in contract value for new work and we won both of them. We're currently targeting 16 bids for new work in excess of $500 million each that the government is expected to award in fiscal year 2018, 4 of which are already pending. Our team is truly energized about the investments in these opportunities and we expect to win more than our fair share of these megadeals and further accelerate revenue growth as we look at FY '18. ","Revenue growth translates into more opportunities for our people, enhancing our culture, improving morale and enabling investments in continuous learning and development. We continue to have success in staffing as we pivot towards growth. In the fourth quarter, we had a highest number of hires to date, including large numbers of talented millennials attracted to next-generation technology. We've grown headcount over our last 2 quarters and expect that trend to strengthen in fiscal year 2018.","So fiscal year 2017 set the foundation for our return to growth. Every quarter, we got a little better in year-over-year revenue compares and we won substantial new business. In fiscal year 2018, we expect to be in our 2% to 3% organic growth target range. And looking further out when we win our Greenway and TSA impact recompetes and our share of new megadeals, we have the opportunity to do even better than our original growth target. In terms of competitive positioning, I wouldn't trade places with any company in our industry today.","That brings me to my third and final point. I see allocating capital as one of our key strategic responsibilities. At the spin, we had $3.1 billion in total debt and we laid out at that time a balanced capital allocation plan of 50% debt paydown, 40% shareholder return and 10% M&A. Since the spin, we actually spent 79% on debt paydown and 21% on shareholder returns with no M&A. Over the next few years, we'll likely take down debt a little bit slowly, gradually dedicating less than half of our free cash flow towards debt reduction and bringing our capital allocation more into balance.","Within that context, I'm pleased to report that we're -- signed a definitive agreement on our first acquisition as a public company. NES Associates will bring us strong competitive advantage as we compete for large network opportunities in upcoming years, another example of how we live our tagline Think next. Now.","Though small, NES provides very specific expertise in defense telecom, infrastructure and applications architecture as well as implementation services. NES has hands-on expertise with nearly every military base network infrastructure, both CONUS and OCONUS and this experience can directly translate to other security-sensitive customers, such as Homeland Security as well as the intelligence community. ","NES Founder and CEO Andy Gomer has built an outstanding company and will be an important part of our network business going forward. Andy is a real roll-up-your-sleeves leader, acting as chief network engineer and working directly with customers to design high-performance, low-cost network solutions. ","There's a great team at NES. We can't wait to have all of the employees join us and we're looking forward to competing together. ","We expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to our fiscal year 2018 results, but the real upside potential is in driving organic revenue growth. ","Deeply understanding the network that connects the mission to compute will enable us to eliminate many of the barriers to adoption of next-generation IT. Digital transformation efforts rely on the availability of secure, high-bandwidth highly resilient and low-latency network infrastructures that can enable hyperscale functionality to accelerate cloud operating models. Becoming this network-transformation leader will accelerate the adoption of CSRA's next-gen digital solution offerings. Even more simply, we believe the key capabilities, the innovations and the past performance from NES will significantly improve our win probability on several very large pursuits across the company beginning almost immediately.","Now Dave will provide more detail on our financial results and our forward outlook.","David Keffer","Thanks, Larry and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had a strong quarter across the board and completed a very productive year in the life of our company. We met Q4 consensus for revenue and significantly exceeded our plan and expectations for profitability. I'm pleased to post such strong earnings growth in the quarter and the year, underscoring CSRA's commitment to long term earnings growth.","Turning to Slide 5, let me hit the high points of the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion or $8 million above the midpoint of guidance given on the last call. Quarterly revenue was up 3% sequentially and down 3% from revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The year-over-year decline was our lowest, going back several years. And in every quarter this year, the year-over-year revenue comparisons improved.","Revenue for fiscal year 2017 was $5.0 billion, down 4% compared to pro forma revenue for fiscal year 2016.","Our contract mix was relatively unchanged, with 45% of quarterly revenue on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. ","As I walk through the earnings performance, please keep in mind that as laid out in our Form 8-K filing on April 10, 2017, we've taken recurring pension income out of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets out of adjusted EPS. ","For reference, fiscal year 2017 included $92 million of recurring pension income and $50 million of acquisition-related intangibles amortization, excluding the amortization related to SRA contract backlog. The Q4 amounts were $20 million and $11 million, respectively.","Adjusted EBITDA was $207 million for the quarter which was up 5% year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5% was consistent with our high watermark in Q2, driven by strong contract performance and disciplined cost management as well as some non-recurring pickups. ","You'll see in the 10-K tomorrow that net EAC adjustments on fixed-price contracts for the quarter totaled $8 million which was several million dollars above our expectation and our view of the sustainable performance level. In addition, SG&A in the fourth quarter was several million dollars lower than our sustainable level due to some onetime offsets. ","For the year, adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to fiscal year 2016 and substantially above our long term margin target which I'll address later in my remarks.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.49, up 7% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. ","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 36% which was down about 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Our tax rate for the full year was also 36% which is 1 to 2 points below our expected long term rate. ","For the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $1.91 which was up 10% compared to fiscal year 2016. ","Using our previous definitions, adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter would've been $227 million or $18 million above the top end of guidance from the last call. Similarly, adjusted diluted EPS would have been $0.54 or about $0.06 above the top end of our prior guidance. ","Beyond the pension income and acquisition amortization that I noted earlier, key Q4 GAAP expenses included $16 million from the mark-to-market of the pension plans and $72 million in separation and merger costs, the majority of which was a $61 million expense related to our IP Matters Agreement with CSC.","Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $50 million and free cash flow was $62 million. Free cash flow exceeded operating cash flow because the IP Matters Agreement payment is excluded from free cash flow as a non-recurring separation-related payment. ","Days sales outstanding were 54 days which is an improvement of 1 day compared to the third quarter of 2017. ","In Q4, we deployed $20 million to pay down debt and $16 million in dividends. ","As of March 31, 2017, we had $126 million in cash and cash equivalent and $2.6 billion in debt.","On to the forward outlook. With a year of strong bookings success, we're forecasting organic growth in revenue and free cash flow and robust performance in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. ","As shown on Slide 7, we now project fiscal year 2018 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $770 million and $800 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.88 and $2 and free cash flow between $330 million and $380 million. ","At the midpoint of guidance, revenue growth would be 2.1% with adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. Earnings would be relatively flat as the result of significant outperformance in fiscal year 2017, especially in the fourth quarter. Compared to the midpoint of our prior guidance for FY '17 which better reflects sustainable profitability, FY '18 guidance implies EPS growth for the year of about 5%. Free cash flow is up 8% at the midpoint of our guidance, driven in part by the $25 million reimbursement from the 2013 divestiture of assets that we referenced on our Q2 call. We expect to receive that payment in the first half of our fiscal year.","In terms of revenue visibility, at the midpoint of guidance, we expect that about 85% of our revenue would come from existing business. Of the remaining 15%, over half would come from recompetes with the remainder from new business. ","On the recompetes and new business, we expect profitability to generally be below our corporate average for the first year or so and then to rise as we complete startup activities, introduce innovation and deliver more efficiently. ","The expectation that we've built into our guidance for fiscal year 2018 for new business revenue is lower than in the guidance range we originally gave for fiscal year 2017 even though our new business momentum is significantly higher today than a year ago.","We're still ramping up some of our larger FY '17 wins, so we expect quarterly revenue and earnings to step up through the year, with the first quarter being slightly below the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, driven by the continued wind-downs of our STRATCOM and LMP contracts and some equipment purchases that were pulled forward into the fourth quarter. The year-over-year comparison for the first quarter will also be our toughest as a result of the pickup on a DHS program that we've discussed on our prior Q1 call. ","Looking over the rest of the year, we see strong year-over-year performance in the back half of the year, leading to organic growth for the full year. ","Margins have stayed relatively constant over the course of the year.","Let me touch on some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. First, we're assuming that we win both of our major recompetes. On that topic, the timing on Greenway seems to be holding around late summer or early fall, but the decision on TSA impacts has pushed out and we're still awaiting the award announcement. On all other recompetes, we're assuming win rates consistent with our experience in fiscal year 2017. ","Second, we're assuming adjudications of new work follow the time lines we've seen over the last 2 years, so we're building in a reasonable amount of time for normal delays and protests. We're also assuming a 25% win rate on new business, though we were at 35% for last year.","And third, we assume that we close on the NES acquisition in the second quarter. The acquisition contributes relatively little to our guidance, assuming no top line synergies. If we're able to leverage NES into some large program wins, we'll update guidance as appropriate. ","To close my section, I'll pick up on what Larry started and provide an update on our views on adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS growth. ","Our long term adjusted EBITDA margin target at the time of the spin was 16% to 17%. Of that, pension accounts for about 180 basis points. So on an apples-to-apples basis, we're currently guiding for our margins to be above our long term target again in FY '18. ","As we look to the future, we will balance our demonstrated commitment to sustain high margins, with a rising likelihood of acquiring companies and winning large programs to grow our earnings. We're firmly committed to both growing our EBITDA and delivering industry-leading profitability. ","All of the factors that Larry and I discussed today support our long term objective of high single-digit earnings growth. Compared to the original model, relatively more of that will come from revenue growth and capital deployment which is well supported by our business-development trends and the opportunities we see on the M&A front.","Now back to Larry for some closing remarks.","Lawrence Prior","Thanks, Dave. In closing, I want to communicate the commitment of this management team and recognize the energy and creativity of our CSRA employees to address the challenges and to take advantage of the opportunities that arise in our business. ","As we stood at this company, there were several items that were mandated by the complex nature of the transaction. In each case, we've taken concrete actions to improve them. We renegotiated the terms of our original IP Matters Agreement with CSC, eliminating $55 million of future payments and acquiring the rights to certain technologies. We expect to complete a sale and leaseback transaction in FY '18 with our corporate headquarters facility that will provide a small influx of cash and upgrade our employees' work environment. We've substantially lowered our debt load so that our balance sheet can be used to our advantage. We've lowered and, in many cases, fixed the interest rate on our debt to simultaneously reduce expense and risk. We've changed some of our non-GAAP measures so that the cash attributes of the business are more transparent and comparable to our peers. We've lowered our unfunded pension liability by offering and paying lump sum buyout packages for eligible participants.","All of these financial management moves are in addition to the primary thrust of the company, including deepening our partnerships with our key strategic partners like AWS and Microsoft, forging new relationships with emerging technology companies and developing new solutions that can be sold across our customer base. ","You can count on this team to relentlessly address the elements that are in our control for the benefit of shareholders, including making a market for next-generation IT, aggressively targeting new work, appropriately controlling our costs and actively investing in talent.","With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from Ed Caso of Wells Fargo.","Edward Caso","Curious, one of your competitors came out and is now doing a Bossier City-like facility in their bid process. Is -- are you seeing more competitors doing that? Is that any risk to your competitive advantage in this area?","Lawrence Prior","No. I applaud any and all of our industry that look to invest in onshore capabilities so our whole industry of market is competitive as we try to move to next-gen IT yet. I was at that company and we had started that endeavor to move work to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in fact, 10 years ago. I think it's great they're taking that on and I think it's good for our customers, good for our market.","Edward Caso","Within the revenue guidance, what's the swing factor with the Greenway and ITIP?","David Keffer","It's difficult to put a pinpoint on that, Ed, given the timing questions around both. And while we expect award announcements this summer, as we noted earlier, potentially early fall, the actual timing of a transition to a new contract is still very much up in the air. We'll work with those customers to finalize that thinking and so I'd hesitate to put a specific number on a swing factor on either, much less the combination of the 2.","Edward Caso","Real quick one here, average share count and guidance?","David Keffer","Consistent with our FY '17 share count in the 164 million to 165 million range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Vafi of Loop Capital.","Joseph Vafi","I was wondering if you could give us an idea on the omnibus spending bill. Do you expect to see awards hit based on the active vehicles that you have now or do you expect more contract announcements or a combination of both?","Lawrence Prior","Yes, I think it's C, all of the above, Joe, that there is, we think, a dam about to break of bids awaiting decision that's of significant magnitude for ourselves as well as the industry. We also think that the amount of money they've got to obligate, put to work between now and the end of the year, there's no better vehicle than the contracts of the service industry. We're actively out there with customers, working on great IT ideas to help them with that. And there was an explanation for it. When the Trump administration put out there an executive order on cybersecurity, there's a real emphasis on looking at the infrastructure, the new hardware, the new software just to bring yourself up to a modicum of capability to defend the network and then an emphasis on moving shared services. So we think with that catalyst of the Executive Order, the omnibus funding, I think our industry and our company, especially, is well positioned to take advantage of it.","Joseph Vafi","Okay. And then just one more follow-up on the omnibus there. Obviously, I think the omnibus bill had good spending levels in it for the civilian government agencies as well as DoD. How does that -- I guess, does your outlook change at all on the civilian business as a result of what came in on the omnibus bill versus kind of where we were before that spending bill got enacted?","Lawrence Prior","Well, when you think of -- when we saw the skinny budget, there was a bit of trepidation over how well funded the civil agencies would be and the omnibus did a great job, I think, in a balanced approach of funding across all of the federal government. So our comfort level increased with the omnibus as compared to the skinny budget. And then even with the current FY '18 submission, it's good to see an investment in overall federal IT spending and it's great to see the technology modernization fund. So all of the work being done by Will Hurd and Gerry Connolly and the leadership on the Hill is resonating in this White House and I think that's a positive theme regardless of where the budget goes next over the course of the summer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar of Evercore.","Rayna Kumar","Could you discuss the drivers of the revenue acceleration you expect in the second half? And then separately, could you tell us how we should think about FY '18 headcount growth and utilization?","Lawrence Prior","Yes. So to start on the revenue, we talked at our last call that as we won the background investigation work and then the large army contract to support C4ISR, it wasn't ramping as fast as we had hoped. It's beginning to pick up momentum. We think it will continue throughout the year. We also see just a healthy pipeline of new work. So when Dave talked about the 15% of the work both, half about recompete, half new, you'll see that one with our conservative estimation of the ramps for those and that's what tends to drive the second half performance.","David Keffer","On your second question about headcount growth and utilization, we've seen relatively steady labor utilization rates in recent quarters and would expect the same moving forward. We're being careful to continue to invest in the growth of the business and sufficiently fund business development and B&P investments in the business but at a relatively constant rate throughout FY '18. So you should see headcount growth increase at about the same level that we see revenue increase over time. And obviously, the further that we get into the year, the further that STRATCOM and LMP are going to be in our rearview mirror.","Rayna Kumar","Great. And could you quantify pricing trends in the fourth quarter and your expectations for pricing going into FY '18?","David Keffer","I wouldn't say we've seen a significant shift in pricing trends over any 1 or 2 quarters, in aggregate. Over the last couple of years, we've seen a gradual decline in the LPTA trends that have grown in years prior but nothing earth shattering over the last quarter or 2. Larry?","Lawrence Prior","We do have a phenomenon, where we're bidding so much we're going to win more than our fair share of it and will bias ourselves to starting lots of new programs. And you think of 5- to a 10-year history of a program, its profitability is lowest in year one. And then as you go to year 2, 3, 4, you're moving them to fixed-price delivery performance options and you're gaining knowledge. So as we really double down on bringing in new, new work, we'll have a bit of a headwind on profitability of that work transitioning it within a year or so to where we'd like to see the glide path to be, but that's very purposeful. And Dave talked about how our base is going to sustain the margin, our efficiency and cost management will sustain margin, but our one headwind is we're going to try and grow and take on a lot of new work that will require that discovery phase.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna","I had a couple of questions. So first, in the guidance, is there any contribution contemplated from NES? And if so, how much in terms of revenue and perhaps EPS, if you can give to us?","David Keffer","Gautam, it's Dave. Yes, our guidance does include the assumption that the NES acquisition closes in the second quarter. It's not a large acquisition. And given that it is a small, very strategic tuck-in and Larry can touch on the strategic fit further if you'd like, the financial impact is very small. And by our practice, we don't comment on the specifics of it, but it's a partial year and a tuck-in deal, so not the driver of the organic growth that you're seeing in our guidance.","Lawrence Prior","Yes. I mean, where the real value is, is the improved P win on a host of bids, where Andy Gomer and his team, Jack Curran and the Army team, have tremendous value add on the set of opportunities. So we expect at each call, we'll be updating on the contribution in the growth of organic revenue as we benefit from their competencies around network design and implementation. That's just fundamental. I mean, the network fabric has been so stressed. Think of Amazon creating the snowball and the snowmobile to have to use hard drives in reality to move data and we've got to do better with a network fabric if we're going to accelerate adoption of cloud. And Andy and Jack on the team, they absolutely have the secret sauce.","Gautam Khanna","Is there any way you could help us frame how large it might be? I'm just -- I mean, I understand it may be immaterial in the scheme of $5 billion of revenue, but is it $20 million, $30 million? Just ballpark it for us.","David Keffer","We'll announce in the 10-K. That'll hit the wires tomorrow morning that the purchase price is around $100 million, Gautam. I wouldn't -- I'd hesitate to give you the exact -- kind of the profit impacts in the partial year timing.","Lawrence Prior","And we need to close it first.","Gautam Khanna","All right. I understand. Okay. The other thing I was wondering, obviously, the bookings -- the awards were strong in the quarter, yet the backlog was down sequentially in both funded and all-in backlog. Could you speak to was there any de-scoping of work or anything that explains the downtick in funded and unfunded?","David Keffer","Sure. On the total backlog side, Gautam, there were a couple of aged contracts that came out this quarter through the usual quarter cleanup process that we go through. The funded is really just a matter of the timing of certain funding events and recompetes. Obviously, you're aware of 2 of the larger ones. We have other sole-source extensions that are in process now. So some of our largest contracts are kind of in that phase and will come with funding in the process, so that's really just the normal kind of quarterly perturbations of the funded backlog number. I wouldn't read too much into that.","Lawrence Prior","And then as we transition to the new LMSS contract, there was an older preceding one, where we've got new ceiling, new work so we cleaned up the backlog of the old contract. We also just won another army IDIQ contract, so it looks like the army's well positioned to manage any downrange contingencies they need.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And just last one, the Fed civil margins, it looked like they were like north of 18% in the quarter. And obviously, you mentioned the $8 million of aggregate positive in catch-ups. Is there anything that we should be mindful of as we move into fiscal '18 and beyond of programs that were extraordinarily profitable that are potentially winding down that could be headwinds that -- or is it -- because, obviously, the question is the over-under on the margin as you transition to new work. Is there anything where the big programs, very profitable programs right now that are entering a phase over the next year or 2 that may be less rich in terms of profitability?","David Keffer","No, Gautam. I think the -- that's the short answer is no there. You've seen from FY '16 to FY '17, the volume of net favorable EAC adjustments has come down significantly as we reached kind of a more steady state on those large fixed-price programs. So I wouldn't say there was anything particularly unique in the FY '17 results on those programs. And when you look at the segment operating income numbers that you mentioned, we're just now kind of reaching a point where those have relevant comparability year-over-year. We do have some strong-performing, really exceptionally efficient programs on both sides of the business helping in civil market as well as in the defense and intel market. Nothing worth noting on the call.","Lawrence Prior","Yes. And the only place I see the headwinds, Gautam, is on the magnitude and the number of the new wins we're going after and that if we win more than our fair share of those, that will be a bit of a headwind, but we're pretty good at improving that over time. To that point, Gautam, if you think about the real success that, that civil organization has had in wins all year, we've actually got some of those large programs that are in their infancy. You've got the OPM background investigation, you've got the SEC work, you've got the Department of Commerce work and those are programs we would expect their margins to expand as we gain knowledge and deliver innovation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Krishna Sinha of Vertical Research Partners.","Krishna Sinha","I have two questions. One, you said for your key assumptions on the guidance for next year that you expected recompetes to be at a rate similar to FY '17. What was your FY '17 trailing 12-month recompete win rate?","David Keffer","We've said over the long term, we expect that win rate to be in the 85% range. That's about what we had for most of the quarters of FY '17 and what we would anticipate going forward.","Lawrence Prior","Yes, the anomaly in '17 was the lingering loss in '16 of STRATCOM. So that took the number down to about 75% for the full year '17 when it finally hit after the protest period. We expect to get that back up to 85% or north of it as we go into the new year.","Krishna Sinha","Okay. And then on free cash flow, so your guidance is for $330 million to $380 million. I know that in your definition of free cash flow, you had excluded some onetime items and, going forward, you talked about a little bit from the sale-leaseback. Is there any other onetime items included in that free cash flow number? Or how should we think about that free cash flow number going forward? I just want to -- I'm just trying to get a sense of what the sort of operating cash flow minus CapEx number really is.","David Keffer","Sure, to your specific question, the sale-leaseback is not contemplated in the $330 million to $380 million number we talked about today. And we had a unique item related to the $65 million payment in the fourth quarter that was excluded, but we don't anticipate anything similar in FY '18. The only kind of onetime item that might bear mentioning is the $25-million-or-so item that we've talked a few quarters ago that was an outflow in FY '17 that should return to us in the form of an inflow related to a divestiture from years ago. That inflow should return to us in '18. So again, about $25 million relates to that. Nothing else rises to the level of unique or onetime item that would go into that guidance.","Krishna Sinha","Okay. So it sounds like there's -- there'll be some tailwind from a sale-leaseback, no DXC payment and then a $25 million inflow that's also not included in that $330 million to $380 million. Is that correct?","David Keffer","The $25 million is included in the $330 million to $380 million. So we expect that in the first half of the year. Again, that'll come in the form of a change in working capital from one quarter to the next. It's one of the reasons why we're optimistic about a favorable change in working capital from '17 to '18, if you want to look at it that way.","Lawrence Prior","And to that point, the FY '17 free cash flow was decremented by that $25 million outflow in '17.","David Keffer","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur of Drexel Hamilton.","Brian Ruttenbur","Just first question is on the margins. Do you expect kind of adjusted EBITDA margins -- you're talking 14% to 15%. As I back in everything, you're going to be about 15% in '18. Assuming you win Groundbreaker and the TSA program, you'll -- what I'm hearing -- I'm just trying to piece it all together, that you're going to see a slight downtick in '19, maybe 20, 30 basis points. Is that kind of the right way to think about things kind of going forward? Is that you'll be hovering around this maybe slightly above 15% and slightly below if you win the Groundbreaker as you have these new wins come on?","David Keffer","Brian, I'd hesitate to provide an FY '19 outlook for margins as specific as that. Certainly, the Groundbreaker to Greenway and ITIP to impact transitions will be 2 of the factors that influence our thinking about FY '19 margins, but likewise, we have billions of dollars of pending new business opportunities that we're enthusiastic about our chances on and we look for every one of those to be a great opportunity for us to grow into FY '19. The margin profile of those is obviously still yet to be determined. We'll continue to invest in growth and we'll continue to do everything we can to expand margins in current programs. Exactly how that shakes out in FY '19 is still too far into the future for me to give you a good gauge on.","Lawrence Prior","And I think you'll here on the part of the team a commitment to focus on EBITDA and EPS growth in absolute terms. I mean, obviously, we're going to deliver the margins that we can. I mean, you've seen that from this team, but we're going to go after growth and we're going to deliver growth.","Brian Ruttenbur","Okay. And then, in terms of a macro question. On the '18 budget, anything -- on the proposed '18 budget, besides hearing that you expect a CR likely for probably the first -- the fourth calendar quarter of this year, what else do you expect and what else do you see in that budget? Is it encouraging? Is there any red flags that you see and cuts in critical areas or critical departments?","Lawrence Prior","No, I mean, I start with looking for major themes, so looking at the support for the Defense Department and national security; the commitment to our veterans in the VA; Homeland Security, with a real emphasis on protecting our borders; infrastructure around DoT; cyber across the board, but especially with FBI. I think they are all positive themes. And when I talked about that blueprint from '17, focus on the positive themes that will fare well in the congressional process as we think of getting to a CR and an omnibus. Yes, there's a lot of drama about reductions to civil agencies. What we saw in '17 was that got muted during the negotiations and looked more consistent like a CR in year-to-year flatness. I really love the theme around cyber IT investment and I think they also see it as an enabler to get the kind of labor savings that, at some point, they're going to have to take on. And I don't see it as a year 1 initiative, but I do think you're going to see some re-engineering and business process improvement across every one of the agencies.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Frank Atkins of SunTrust.","Francis Atkins","I wanted to ask a little bit about the segments? Can you give us any color on the bookings by segment, where, as you look at the budget, anticipated growth on civil versus defense and intelligence as you see that throughout to '18?","Lawrence Prior","We see it fairly balanced across both segments and all 4 groups. They all built robust pipelines. They've got similar amount of energy in bids awaiting decision. So no, that was a pleasant surprise as we looked over the course of the last year going into a new administration that -- and it's really the most energized environment I've seen in 10 years with the number of opportunities out there, so many of them megadeals north of $500 million that require complex teaming, incredible past performance hurdles and I think next to field, but is really great for all of our groups.","Francis Atkins","Okay, great. Can you talk a little bit about the decision on the IPMA and what impact that has on 2018 guidance?","David Keffer","Sure. It's Dave, Frank. We -- the impact on our FY '18 guidance is about $22.5 million of profitability improvement from year-to-year, given that we had about $22.5 million, about 3 quarters worth of the IP Matters Agreement in our adjusted results for FY '17 and that goes away in FY '18. It was out of the free cash flow number that we talked about because of that $65 million payment being a onetime item in '17. So no change in the year-over-year comparison for our guidance there. In terms of the agreement, it struck us as a win-win for both sides and we're pleased with the result.","Lawrence Prior","And we saw this as a great opportunity to invest in the growth of the company and then the talented people who do all the hard work. So we really looked at how could we take the advantages of that renegotiated agreement and look at adding solution architects, look at adding investment and time and resources with the enabling technology companies that we work at -- work with. We just did an offsite 2 weeks ago where we had several hundred people attend to include 50 customers, introduced 8 of the best companies out of Silicon Valley all focused on artificial intelligence and really thinking about data analytics to do better for enterprise IT; and then just looking at investing in our employees, whether it's mirror pay or education. They're going to fuel our growth. So we know we're burning hot with our margins today. We're looking at defending them as we grow in the new year and we just wanted to invest to fuel that growth.","Francis Atkins","Okay, great. That make sense. And last couple for me, can you give us anticipated separation merger and integrated costs and guidance? And then, can you talk a little bit about driving improved capital intensity in the model?","David Keffer","To your first question there, Frank, we would expect a few million a quarter of merger and separation-related costs for most of FY '18 as we finalize the system integrations and the remaining IT investments. You broke up a little bit on your second question. Can you walk through that one again for us?","Francis Atkins","Yes. What are some of the initiatives you're doing to drive improved capital intensity of the business lines?","David Keffer","Sure. I can talk to that a bit. I mean, as we've discussed in the past, much of the capital intensity in our business today relates to direct program support and -- as opposed to back-office IT investments. In terms of those direct program investments, going forward, we see occasional bids that involve some capital intensity. It's not the norm, but we don't shy away from them when we do see. Certain of our large bids moving forward, we'll have capital intensity to them and we love those opportunities. They're some scaled, really exceptional opportunities for us to bring our next-gen IT models to government. With that said, I wouldn't necessarily expect the IT -- or the capital intensity of the business to grow over time, if anything, to moderate a bit.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that the event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead, sir.","Stuart Davis","Thank you, William. Welcome everyone to today\u2019s quarterly earnings conference call. Larry Prior, our CEO and Dave Keffer, our CFO, are here to discuss our financial results, business momentum and forward outlook. Today\u2019s call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you will also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we will be using during today\u2019s call.","Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation please note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. For a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K from May and our most recent Form 10-Q. In addition, the statements represent our views as of today and subsequent events may cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.","Finally, as shown on Slide 3, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. The slide deck for today\u2019s call includes the reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Larry who will begin on Slide 4.","Larry Prior","Thank you, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. We are excited to report another strong quarter. The clear highlights for the third quarter were superb cash flow and another set of large, strategic new business wins. In addition, revenue was in line with consensus, and EBITDA and EPS were both a little bit ahead of consensus. Our EBITDA margin of 17.3% still leads the industry and is above our long-term target.","I will leave the financial results for Dave to do in detail so I can focus on four key points. Point number one to prepare for our fiscal year 2018, we crafted a clear and differentiated strategy to drive growth in our public sector markets supported by a new brand and tagline, Think Next. Now. And the three remaining points are that the key enablers of this strategy are all in place and all working today. So point number two, our growth engine continues to lead the industry. Point number three our technology leadership is creating key differentiators in the market. And point number four, our talent management approach is building a motivated workforce to execute our strategy.","Let me go a little bit deeper. Point number one on strategy. For a year, we have just been heads down and focused on the tasks in front of us, executing on programs, delivering on the synergy case, integrating two companies and two cultures, writing proposals and yes, each and everyday, collecting cash. I am product of the team\u2019s hard work and tremendous accomplishments on all of these fronts. We are stronger today than we were a year ago as a result of the determination, the energy and the creativity of all 18,000 employees who show up to work everyday with a passion for our customers\u2019 missions. In particular, we now have a much better balance sheet and a backlog of new programs that provides us strategic flexibility and growth momentum.","Over the last few months, we have taken the time to look beyond the horizon and chart our direction for the next 3 years. It\u2019s been a very collaborative effort across both line organizations and leverage teams, with the board both fully engaged and rolling up their sleeves to help. We now have a holistic view of strategy and vision and our cultures and values are aligned and we are gaining buy-in throughout the company. Strategy is all about where you compete, how you compete and how you measure success. Our strategy is to drive sustainable industry leading organic growth across our federal and state local markets through customer intimacy, rapid innovation and an outcome-based experience.","Let me unpack the statement a bit. Our primary focus is profitably growing the company. We are the most efficient company in our space and we will remain so, but this is a dramatic shift. We have moved from the legacy mindset of only improving the bottom line by cutting costs to one centered around and devoted to a growth culture. We will measure our success, first and foremost through revenue growth, which provides better career opportunities for our employees, more solutions that we can provide to our customers and greater returns to our shareholders. Next, we will remain focused on our current markets where we have about a 3% market share. The federal government and related state and local and international markets provide plenty of opportunities for us and the market dynamics are improving after years of government budget cuts. We will support the United States and the vital interest of our allies across the globe. We are well positioned with many of the new administration\u2019s priorities, including defense, border security and the critical care for our veterans.","We will compete through three primary differentiators: first, customer intimacy; second, innovation; and third, outcome-based delivery. Our customer intimacy derives from talented teams who deliver flawlessly, who build trust-based relationships with our customers and provide mission and technology thought leadership. We deliver rapid innovation through partnerships, shared delivery models and cross-agency capabilities. Our customers are looking to move towards paying for outcomes instead of inputs, and we are the industry leader in delivering outcome-based experiences through developing, bidding and executing the shared delivery methodologies. Our mission, vision, strategy and importantly, our culture and values are then encapsulated by our brand of Think Next. Now. This message is one the entire company created and can rally behind, enabling us to approach the market with a unified purpose and direction. It imagines a better future and delivers it today for our customers, our partners and ultimately, all the people our missions touch.","Point number two, our business development engine continues to rev at high RPMs. We posted our eighth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. In what is typically the slowest quarter for awards, we achieved $1.9 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio was still tracking at 1.3. Our backlog of signed business orders at the end of the quarter was $15.8 billion, which increased 3% year-over-year. I firmly believe that if we continue to post industry leading book-to-bill rates, we will lead our industry and organic growth, which is our goal. The $1.9 billion in awards were rich with new business. 73% of bookings in the quarter were for new business and our win rate on new business was 46%, again, well above our target rate of 25%. So far this year, we have won $3.1 billion in new business, ahead of our target run-rate of $4 billion each year even though we are just now seeing the full effect of our accelerated bids submissions.","Our bid pipeline remains robust. At the end of the quarter, we have $12 billion in submits outstanding. Looking only at new business, we had about $5.7 billion awaiting decision, including 15 opportunities that are each greater than $100 million in total value. This quarter\u2019s awards showcase how we are combining deep domain knowledge of the customers\u2019 mission, expertise in our IT enterprise and next-generation capabilities and partners to deliver compelling solutions for our customers.","Let me highlight just a few of the major wins in the quarter to give you a sense of what I mean. Our largest win was the $744 million award that was in protest at the time of our last call. With that protest resolved in December, we are now supporting the Army\u2019s communication electronics command, providing a wide range of mission essential logistics, maintenance and sustainment work for current and future C4ISR systems around the world in support of this administration\u2019s priorities. Building on the delivery excellence of our program manager, Larry Crop, our General Manager for this business, Alan Smith, was instrumental in crafting the strategy for this consolidated procurement. We expect our work growing from current revenue levels of $30 million a year to well over $100 million each year as we ramp over the next few quarters. In another consolidating contract, Kamal Narang led a team that engineered a wonderful technical solution on a $323 million program called HIGLAS to host, operate and maintain the general ledger system for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.","Our world class database team has been working on the application side for 5 years, but taking over the infrastructure work was a tall task, one that was perfect for Rebecca Miller, our Civil Group BD lead overseeing the capture. We were able the team well with Oracle to engineer a compelling solution using the Oracle Exadata that was low risk, innovative and cost efficient and improved performance by a factor of 10. On this program, we will introduce and implement DevOp methodologies and potentially migrate the application to a cloud environment.","Final example, we received a new single award blank purchase agreement \u2013 blanket purchase agreement with $150 million ceiling to help the Department of Commerce reduce costs, enhance customer service quality and prepare for the 2020 census. Under the leadership of Chris Hegedus, SRA will develop and implement cloud based services in the areas of acquisition, financial management, human resources and information technology. This is a shared service deal with the foundation and a solution that leverages both service now and our own integrated technology center in Bossier City, Louisiana.","These wins are largely driven by next generation thinking enabled by strong technology partnerships, which takes me to my third key point. CSRA works really hard to attain technology leadership. The breadth and the depth of our partnerships with key technology innovators is unmatched because we offer unmatched access to the federal government IT enterprise and we bring a focus and a passion for technology insertion that will help missions be successful. With the full involvement of our line organizations, we develop and invest in our partner relationships, especially our seven strategic alliance partners; Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and Service Now. For example, our recent Greenway submission under Leigh Palmer\u2019s leadership with the intelligence group leveraged six of these strategic partners in the bid and clearly differentiates our technical offering.","We are already a premier consulting partner in the AWS partner network. And this quarter, we successfully completed the independent third-party audit to join their elite managed services program. That enables us to deliver added value to cloud solutions by offering proactive monitoring, automation and management of our customers\u2019 environments. We also recently added Amazon\u2019s commercial and Amazon\u2019s Gov cloud services to the GSA IT Schedule 70, which is the largest most widely used acquisition vehicle across the federal government. These added qualifications and channels will even further our leadership in cloud migration, especially within Paul Nedzbala\u2019s health and civil group whose customers are often the most forward leaning in adopting next-generation technologies.","Now our other strategic partner in the cloud, Microsoft, we just signed with them a 3-year enterprise agreement to use their products for the Azure cloud platform. We are proud to be a gold partner in the Microsoft partner networks and we are now the first government systems integrator to migrate its own workload to the Azure government cloud platform. By investing in ourselves, we minimize risk and then accelerate solutions for our customers as we act as customers of Azure. We believe that the market for Microsoft\u2019s cloud services will expand rapidly, especially within the Department of Defense. The DoD just granted Level 5 accreditation for Azure and Office 365, making them the only commercial cloud provider at that level of security and trust. Ken Deutsch and his defense group team are working hand-in-hand with Microsoft on many large and strategic bids that could be major drivers for both of us in this critical market.","Microsoft was also the major sponsor along with Splunk of a hackathon that we hosted in December. Led by Sally Sullivan\u2019s Homeland Security Group, this hands-on competition style training event brought together technologists from across the company to engage in collaborative computing, challenge conventional thinking and solve real-world problems in the cloud and really leverage data analytics, which brings me to my fourth key point, our talent. This is the driver behind really improving customer intimacy, earning trust based relationships and delivering flawless execution. We continue to up our game in hiring, retaining and developing our workforce. In the third quarter, we had more job applicants than we have ever had and 42% of our new hires are millennials. Our voluntary attrition rate in the quarter was the lowest we have had since going public. Employees are seeing enhanced opportunities through growth and the culture is evolving in all sorts of positive ways. Our employees like the opportunity for continued technical education and more than 400 of these employees added new technical and professional certifications in the quarter.","Before I turn it over to Dave, let me briefly address how we are thinking about the market under President Trump\u2019s administration. For context, let\u2019s keep in mind that we are less than three weeks into the new administration, so we are in the very early stages. For example, just seven members of President Trump\u2019s team have been confirmed by the Senate, which means we have only got 1,235 to go. Transitions after two term Presidents are generally a little chaotic and they all take time. So I expect industry book to bills for the March quarter to be a bit dampened, but all of us remain convinced this is a growth opportunity for the marketplace. We have seen a steady flow of forceful executive orders, tweets and interviews. Nothing has changed our fundamental view that the market for our services and solutions will grow in the coming years. The administration has signaled a willingness to engage in deficit spending to fund a strong commitment to the military and the border security. And with the freeze in hiring for non-military government personnel, service contractors stand ready to enable mission success.","Given our efficient onshore staffing models, CSRA can be an engine for American job growth, clearly a key priority for President Trump. We may face headwinds in some areas, such as our support for the EPA, but on balance, we believe we are well positioned for future growth with this administration. Perhaps most importantly, CSRA should benefit from a more businesslike approach to contracts with more fixed price contracts and a greater focus on cost efficiency, both major advantages for us. Ultimately, this environment will favor those who are ready to move quickly, who are agile and act like a business and we are doing that on all cylinders.","Now, Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and the forward outlook.","Dave Keffer","Thanks Larry and good afternoon, everyone. As Larry said, we had another strong quarter across the board, but especially around cash flow, which is the life blood of the company. Turning to Slide 5, revenue for the quarter was $1.22 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 4% from pro forma revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. The sequential decline was consistent with normal seasonal leave taking patterns and was in line with our expectations. Our contract mix continues to exhibit a high concentration of fixed price work, which is a key driver of our profitability. As a percentage of total revenue, 46% was on fixed price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 33% on cost plus contracts. There were a few unique items impacting the expense and earnings lines, though for the most part they affected the GAAP treatment, not the adjusted numbers and we are able to preview most of the larger items on our last call.","I will now walk through these major drivers as I progress through the income statement. First, we extended a voluntary offer to former employees who participated in qualified pension plans to receive immediate lump sum payments. Based on participant elections, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we made lump sum payments of $320 million and reduced pension obligations by $333 million, so a net improvement of $13 million in the pension funding status. This roughly 10% change in the overall size of the pension program necessitated a pension plan re-measurement as of December 1, 2016. We recorded a non-cash mark to market benefit of $101 million in the quarter. We do not project making any meaningful contributions to the pension program in the foreseeable future and we reduced the GAAP underfunding of the program by about $136 million. With the lower asset base and higher projected interest rate, the remeasurement costs recurring non-cash pension income to fall from $24 million in the second quarter to $23 million in the third quarter and a $21 million quarterly run-rate thereafter, although this could change again with our usual annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter.","Second, GAAP stock compensation expense during the quarter was $18 million, $14 million of that was a non-cash charge from performance-based awards for former SRA shareholders. The performance targets for the awards were met when Providence Equity Partners, formerly SRA\u2019s majority shareholder, sold its CSRA Holdings after our second quarter earnings call. We were delighted that our existing and new shareholders purchased more than 15 million shares with no visible disruption to the market. Compared to the time of the spin, we believe our investor base is now much more focused on CSRA as a long-term holding.","Third, pre-tax merger and integration costs were $5 million, down $3 million from last quarter. Despite relatively modest EAC adjustments in the quarter, profitability continues to be strong with an EBITDA margin of 17.3%. This is down from last quarter\u2019s record margin and consistent with the view that we have laid out for some time that EBITDA margin as we have defined them would end up in the low to mid 17% range for FY \u201817 and over the longer term, land in the 16% to 17% range as we drive top line growth. On a volume basis, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $211 million. Below EBITDA, the quarterly variances were more muted. We completed the re-pricing of our term loans, consistent with the plans we laid out on our last call. In connection with the re-pricing, we incurred a non-cash charge of $8 million for a write-off of deferred financing costs in the third quarter. Going forward, the re-pricing will reduce interest expense by approximately $5 million annually. Excluding the charge, interest expense was $28 million in the quarter, down about $1 million from last quarter.","Depreciation and amortization, excluding the intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA\u2019s funded contract backlog, was $50 million or $3 million more than last quarter. The intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA\u2019s funded contract backlog, which is included in GAAP earnings per share but not adjusted EPS, was $11 million or $5 million less than last quarter and it will go to zero in Q4. Our effective tax rate was 37%, which is close to our long-term target rate, but up about 2 percentage points from last quarter. With that, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48, unchanged compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.","Now turning to Slide 6. Cash flow performance was our best as a public company. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $227 million and free cash flow was $191 million or more than 2.4x adjusted net income. My thanks go out to our entire team of invoicers and collectors for their hard work in generating this tremendous outcome for the company. In addition, we did not make the $30 million intellectual property maintenance payment to CSC in the third quarter as anticipated under our original separation agreement. We are currently in discussions with CSC regarding a variety of matters related to our separation agreements. Note that during the question-and-answer period, we will not take questions regarding these discussions with CSC.","Days sales outstanding were 57 days in Q3, which is unchanged from last quarter. We will look to shave a couple of days off DSOs over time through continued strong collections performance. We followed our balanced capital allocation program in Q3, deploying $50 million to pay down debt and $38 million to return to shareholders, $17 million in dividends and $21 million in share repurchases. As of December 30, 2016, we had $162 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt.","Now on to the forward outlook. As we approach the end of our fiscal year, we have modified guidance as shown on Slide 7. Specifically, we now project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $4.96 billion and $5.01 billion. Including the lower non-cash pension income, we project adjusted EBITDA between $857 million and $867 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.98 and $2.02. Our free cash flow guidance remains between $300 million and $350 million. For adjusted EPS, specifically, this guidance equates to fourth quarter performance of $0.44 to $0.48. Compared to our original guidance ranges, we expect to land near the low ends for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and near the high end of our adjusted earnings per share range. The pension re-measurement has lowered our FY \u201817 adjusted EBITDA guidance by about $4 million and our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.02.","Our fourth quarter outlook reflects slow startups on some large programs, such as the OPM background investigations contract and the large Army C4ISR program as well as potential interruptions on current contracts at a few agencies and fewer Q4 awards as a result of the administration transition, but it does not change our fundamental view of an improving picture for CSRA. It takes some time for new wins to reach their ultimate revenue run-rate, especially during an administration change. When they do, our growth will surely follow. We continue to see an opportunity for FY \u201818 to produce organic growth in line with our long-term model of 2% to 3% and EBITDA margin slightly below current levels, but on the high side of our long-term model of 16% to 17%, including pension income, which brings me to my closing point.","As we introduce guidance for fiscal year 2018 on our call in May, we plan to exclude recurring pension income from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Pension income will still be in our GAAP numbers and the adjusted numbers defined in our credit agreement. Many of you have requested that we remove pension income from what we report in our non-GAAP measures. And we want to enhance the comparability with our peers\u2019 results and limit confusion for potential new investors. As we have said repeatedly, pension income is non-cash in nature and should not change the fundamental valuation of the company.","By way of comparison, our updated fiscal year 2017 guidance assumes $92 million of pension income within adjusted EBITDA, which equates to about $0.35 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. So if we hit the midpoint of our guidance, fiscal year 2017 performance excluding pension would be $769 million for adjusted EBITDA and $1.65 for adjusted earnings per share, which should be the basis of comparison when we introduce FY \u201818 guidance. Another point of consideration is our long-term EBITDA margin target, which translates to 14% to 15% excluding pension income. Naturally, there would be no impact to our free cash flow guidance. We hope that signaling this change now will help all of our analysts and investors prepare their models going forward and avoid any confusion.","With that, operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first questioner today is Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Caso","Hi, good evening. Congratulations. Can you give us any update on Groundbreaker\/Greenway and how that\u2019s progressing?","Larry Prior","Yes, Ed. We have done another submission. I think it only took one truck this time as opposed to two. The government is still in the evaluation mode. We are hoping they will be doing something towards the latter end of summer. It is incredibly complex, especially as the administration goes through transition. So it may get delayed a bit. You heard my reference to our technology team with all of our partners that we think is critical in the solution that\u2019s cost effective for that customer, but we also just love the experience that we have done with the 123 SLAs that are all performing well and the risk that the government can avoid as they really take advantage of our technical solution and our hands on experience.","Edward Caso","Can you talk a little bit more about the fourth quarter sort of lowered expectations for revenue here, is the \u2013 has your view changed on the Trump administration impact and will that extend out for some of the contracts, the big ones you mentioned, are they just ramping slower than you thought, I mean just help us out why the view is changed versus three months ago? Thanks.","Larry Prior","Yes. I mean the principal driver is OPM didn\u2019t ramp as fast as we would have liked. And when you think of getting an authority to operate, having the cyber capabilities as a new participant as well as I think the government is doing a really good job of adding some layers of security, so that\u2019s taking a bit longer and I think well worth the time. The second was working through the protest for the C4ISR work and getting through that and doing the ramp, both are slowed a bit relative to what we thought the planning would be. There is a little bit of noise. There was a week where EPA was freezing contracts on a Monday and then freeing them up by a Friday. We put that in the category of yes, we had administration for 8 years and there is always going to be growth pains. The good news is they didn\u2019t steal the tees off, the typewriters, so I think we are in better shape than the last one.","Dave Keffer","Ed, it\u2019s Dave, I can add a little bit to that as well. Over the last few quarters, we have been noting that our revenue was trending towards the lower end of our prior guidance, right around $5 billion, which is not far from the midpoint of our updated guidance. It is as you pointed out, related to the timing of ramp-ups on some of our current new business awards as well as the state of the market as we go through continuing resolution environment coinciding with an administration change. So we are every bit as optimistic about long-term growth and looking forward to the quarters and years to come.","Edward Caso","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Our next questioner for today is Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Hi. Good evening guys.","Larry Prior","Hi Gautam.","Dave Keffer","Hi Gautam.","Gautam Khanna","So a couple of questions, first on the \u201818 commentary with the transition to organic growth with some margin pressure coincident, does that net a relatively flat adjusted EPS year in your view or should we expect better?","Dave Keffer","Hi Gautam, it\u2019s Dave. So obviously, we are three months away from providing our \u201818 guidance. I think you have heard the right signals on our call today in terms of what we are seeing today which is, in our scripted comments, the fact that we see revenue inflicting towards growth. So far this year, we have been hovering in that minus 4% to minus 5% range, Q3 now a little better than minus 4 and our Q4 guidance, roughly minus 1 to minus 5, so you are seeing that gradual inflection. We see as we pointed out earlier, the opportunity for growth in \u201818 to reach the long-term range of 2% to 3% that we have mentioned. That will take the form of gradual sequential growth over time. And the compares get a little bit easier when we get into Q1 and that will certainly help as well. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about the pace of new business award activity continuing, the really strong book to bills that we have produced over the last three quarters, four quarters continuing into FY \u201818 and our ability to ramp up each of those as well as we have today. So on the bottom line, as you pointed out, we have got confidence that as revenue and flex towards growth that, that should lead toward earnings growth as well. Even if in a year where EBITDA is flat, we should see EPS growing. If EBITDA grows, we should see EPS grow even faster. So that\u2019s the kind of the dynamic that we should look at going forward, given net interest and other lines between EBITDA and EPS should be helpful.","Larry Prior","Right. But I guess, the point \u2013 I am just trying to make sure we are calibrated, it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that as fiscal \u201818 transitions to growth, we might see a more flattish earnings curve and then obviously \u201819 and beyond gets better as the new work seasons, I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth but make sure I have\u2026?","Dave Keffer","Well, you are also a quarter ahead of us in guiding \u201818. So as we come into that, we are expecting revenue growth. We have got the business engine that\u2019s fueling that growth. And as I have said several times, as we start to see sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, that\u2019s the beginning of the change in the curve. We have got relatively fixed cost and we continue to work to improve a lot of those. But when you see interest amortization come down as a percentage of growing revenue that will help us and we will also, I think \u2013 I talked to the great work done by Dave and the team to turn our balance sheet into a real lever to give us certain advantages and we will be able, I think to take down share count through opportunistic buybacks as we strengthen that balance sheet.","Gautam Khanna","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then could you guys refresh us on some of the other outstanding re-competes in the near-term and did you win or retain all of your re-competes in the December quarter, if you could just give us a refresh on what we should be looking out for, besides Greenway, of course?","Stuart Davis","Sure Gautam, this is Stuart. Obviously, the two big ones that are out there are Greenway, but also I have mentioned the TSA ITIP growing to impact procurement, so that\u2019s again a 3% kind of revenue contract. That should be early in our fiscal year \u201818 where we will hear about that. This is in adjudication right now. And again, we think we are delivering great value and great proposal, but we will have to see that plays out. I wouldn\u2019t say that there are any other \u2013 anything nearly of that size that\u2019s out there, specifically to your question around re-competes, I mean the re-compete rates in the third quarter themselves were a little depressed, but that\u2019s actually STRATCOM came in. We have been a little bit below our target for this year, but in the kind of 75%-ish range as opposed to the 85%-ish range.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And my understanding is there was a large NASA consolidation, is that one of the contracts you are incumbent on, is that meaningful?","Stuart Davis","Not a meaningful driver of any of the results or guidance we have provided today, Gautam.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. Last question for you, Dave, sorry to take up all this time, EACs in the quarter and if you could give us what the underlying gross profit dollar level was because I know there were some items that ran through, the cost of sales this quarter, so what sort of the clean cost of sales and gross profit number and what were the EACs?","Dave Keffer","Sure. The net EAC pickup was $5 million in the quarter, roughly in line with the average of the first two quarters, Gautam. Those are tough to project looking forward in any given quarter, but that\u2019s been fairly consistent with the year-to-date trend line. In terms of the cost of services, SG&A breakdown, you are right. This is a tricky quarter to parse out all of the non-GAAP items, particularly the pension mark to market gain. But I think you should notionally think of our SG&A as a percentage of our revenue running between 3.5% and 4% on a kind of run rate adjusted basis and that you can back into our cost of services, depending on how you want to calculate it from there.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. I guess just to be very specific about it though, so with SG&A on an underlying basis around $45 million in the quarter to get to the $0.48, I am just having a hard time following the adjustments here and then gross profit dollars on a reported level, but...?","Dave Keffer","We haven\u2019t presented it in exactly that fashion, either in the Q or the press release as well, but you are notionally in the right ballpark with those figures Gautam.","Gautam Khanna","Okay, thank you.","Dave Keffer","You bet.","Operator","Our next questioner today is Amit Singh with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Amit Singh","Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. Now with just two months left for the year to finish, could you tell us like what is driving this range in the top line guidance? Do you guys still need to win some business to reach the bottom end of this updated top line guidance?","Dave Keffer","No, there is no new business required to get to that bottom end. In any given quarter for us, you have contract specific requirements, material buys on certain contracts or contracts ramping up or down in a given quarter where a few million here or there across over a thousand contracts can really add up to a meaningful range of possibilities and that\u2019s why we will never be ultra-specific down to a $5 million or $10 million range or anything like that. We have narrowed it meaningfully from our original guidance range down to a $50 million range in Q4 and I think that\u2019s a reasonable approach at this point in the year.","Amit Singh","Alright. And just for the EPS guidance, I mean, if you look at the midpoint of your top line and adjusted EBITDA guidance, the midpoints are brought down for both of those with the midpoint of EPS guidance was raised, so to speak. So anything change in your tax rate and share count expectation since last quarter?","Larry Prior","I mean think of it as a narrowing of earlier ranges. We were trending toward the high end of the EPS range over the last couple of quarters, trending lower on EBITDA, given that as the year has progressed, the tax rate has been better and share count and interests have been improved by our deployments of cash. And so this is just the results of the trends we have seen over the first several quarters. EBITDA on a volume basis has come down in line with revenue given that our margin has been, as we projected, in the low 17s for the year-to-date. And EPS, certainly, we are pleased that it\u2019s toward the high-end of the original guidance. And if you adjust the $0.02 of non-cash pension reduction from the original guidance to the re-measured level that we mentioned on the call today, it\u2019s even $0.02 better on an apples-to-apples basis compared with the original guidance.","Amit Singh","Right. And just one last one quickly, how many employees net-net were hired in the quarter?","Larry Prior","Yes, there was not a significant change in headcount in the quarter on a net basis.","Amit Singh","Alright. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next questioner today is Frank Atkins with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Frank Atkins","Thank you for taking my questions. I want to see if I could get any color, you have been putting up some strong bookings on bookings by segment. Any trends among the two segments that you see?","Larry Prior","No. It\u2019s pretty consistent across the businesses and you will get a swing quarter-to-quarter where they will bring in like defense did with the C4ISR work, but we have been favorably impressed by both the qualified pipeline and how consistent it is across the segments as well as the energy they are putting into new submits as well as the wins. So, it\u2019s been fairly broadly distributed across the company, so it was a pleasant surprise this year.","Frank Atkins","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then you announced a few cloud relationship, I guess, incremental news on those. Can you talk a little bit about how cloud is impacting your business and what demand and what you are hearing from clients on that front?","Larry Prior","So I mean, first, in both releases, it just shows how deeper we are going. Internally, we are moving the majority of all of our own company workloads to the cloud where we have got just a ton of compute and storage on the Amazon cloud. And as we look at our own 365 with Microsoft, we are going to move that to the Azure environment. So we think as a company committed to next-gen IT, you have got to walk the talk and all of your workload ought to be in the cloud. We love working with Amazon. We love working with Microsoft Azure. And we think you couple that with our own private cloud capability, it\u2019s a nice troika that gives any government customer really good choices. We are seeing greater adoption. I have mentioned what Paul, Batsakis and the healthcare, civil guys have been doing in their arena. Now you have got to really obsess on the security around it. So the authority to operate the parameters and the understanding of where is your data at rest, how do you touch it and how do you make sure that all the cyber professionals are as comfortable with their infrastructure as the folks who are advocates for better performance. So I think you are seeing greater adoption, but with the caveat that you have got to obsess and really pay attention to the security professionals as you do it.","Frank Atkins","Thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next questioner today is Brian Ruttenbur with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Brian Ruttenbur","Yes, thank you very much. I just want to understand a couple of things. First of all, on revenue, the lower guidance is because of slow startups in the new administration. Just want to make sure that that was the reason for the lower? And then on the EBITDA side, the lowering was partially due to pension and what else, because pension only accounts for about $4 million. So if you could answer those two real quick?","Larry Prior","Yes, I will take the first part and then hand it to Dave. So yes, the slow starts were the main reason for where we are with the revenue guide. Those slow starts would have happened in any administration. Now, there was some minor noise around a couple of our programs as you think of the first weeks of this administration. Most of those have self corrected. So I think you are going to see in this fourth quarter kind of that normal 8-year change of leadership as you change parties in the executive branch and a slow uptick when you think of nominations. But for us, really, the substantive aspect of the revenue was OPM didn\u2019t go as fast as we wanted, C4ISR didn\u2019t and they are both doing great now. And we think as we go into fourth quarter, first quarter, they will ramp with all of the expectations that we have had for them.","Dave Keffer","EBITDA is a similar story, largely volume-driven beyond the pension income change that you mentioned. So the revenue being in the range of the low end of our prior guidance brings EBITDA into the same range given that our margins have been coming in where we expected them on a year-to-date basis, so largely volume-driven.","Brian Ruttenbur","Okay. And then two other quick follow-ups. The cash flow for the year, is cash flow going to be weaker and this fourth quarter will be negative?","Dave Keffer","Our guidance implies positive cash flow, free cash flow performance in the fourth quarter, and so that\u2019s what we are anticipating. Certainly, we had an outstanding third quarter for free cash flow and wouldn\u2019t project that level to be maintained going forward, but we have got good momentum in the invoicing and collections process, good working capital management discipline and we anticipate continuing that going forward.","Brian Ruttenbur","Okay. And then last question on Groundbreaker, you mentioned the TSA is going to be early fiscal \u201818 decision as in the first or second quarter of \u201818. Groundbreaker is going to be when will be the decision?","Larry Prior","We were first surmising that it be August or September of this summer. It may delay just due to the immense complexity of it, but sometime around summer or fall.","Brian Ruttenbur","Okay, thank you very much.","Larry Prior","William, it looks like we no longer have anybody in the queue, so I would like to bring the call to a close. Thank you for your help on today\u2019s call and obviously thank everybody for their interest. Larry and I are going to be hitting the road. We will be at the Cowen Conference on Thursday and we look forward to talking to as many of you as we can. That concludes our call.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."]}}
