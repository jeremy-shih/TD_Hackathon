At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the MasterCard First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Thank you, Laurie. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion about our first quarter 2016 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the question-and-answer session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question. Even if you think you have already dialed into the queue, you need to register again following our prepared comments.","This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. The documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one month.","Before we get started, I'd like to point out a change we have made around reporting the impact of currency on our business. As Martina mentioned on our last earnings call, we realize it has become more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. Therefore beginning this quarter, instead reporting FX adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of two functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, we are now reporting currency neutral growth rates which include both the impact from translating functional currencies into US dollars for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ajay.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning everybody. We were very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter, despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency neutral basis, we reported net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 1%. But when you remove the impact of the nonrecurring discrete tax credit and the balance sheet remeasurement related to Venezuela in last year's first quarter, our EPS growth is 12%.","So now let's take a look at the global economy, and I think it's largely unchanged from what we discussed last quarter with the US economy remaining solid with inflation and wages growing at a similar pace and the unemployment rate kind of holding steady at 5%. We just saw the unemployment rate numbers coming out this morning as well. However, as we know from the Fed comments yesterday, uncertainty remains about when they might take action as well as the potential impact from the global economy.","So looking at the rest of the world, the economic outlook continues to be mixed. In Europe, both consumer confidence and economic sentiment declined slightly this quarter. However, recent stimulus measures by the European Central Bank and steady improvement in the unemployment rate I think should continue to drive growth across the region, particularly in the UK and Germany.","Asia is still challenged by the continued slowdown in China. Consumer confidence remains cloudy with the exception being India where both consumer and business sentiment remain high.","In Latin America, Brazil is still in the worst recession in the country's history, and of course, economic conditions in Venezuela are deteriorating further. But Mexico is stable and it seems to be driven by solid consumer spending and declining inflation.","So none of this surprises us, but it does seem that we are likely to remain in a period of economic uncertainty. And so that said, we've continued to work hard to ensure that our business maintains its strong growth trajectory and we are seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. In addition, we are benefiting from the successful integration of our recent acquisitions and continuing to grow our services business. As I told Barbara yesterday, at this time, steady as she goes is what our focus is.","So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I want to give you a few examples.","In Europe, we extended our contract with Nordea, which is the largest bank in the Nordics for their consumer credit and their commercial card portfolios and we added the rollout of MasterPass and In Control with them. Staying in Europe, we also renewed and extended our contract with DSGV, the largest banking group in Martina's home country of Germany, for their credit business. We also included the rollout of MasterPass. Further, we added a new debit portfolio with UniCredit, a leading European financial group based in Italy.","In Asia, we just recently renewed and expanded our contracts with both Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS, which is one of the largest issuers in the region for their consumer and their commercial credit business, and with Maybank, the largest bank in Malaysia, for their credit and debit business.","And finally, I'm going to talk a little bit about an example of working with a number of our merchant partners and I'm going to give you a specific example. This one is of McDonald's. We've talked in previous calls of a partnership with them in the Middle East, now in South Africa as well, where McDonald's is leveraging MasterPass to simplify the ordering process as well as utilizing contactless functionality at their restaurants. Of course the idea is to improve the drive-through and the dining experience.","But our McDonald's partnership actually has now gone beyond the core business. Now they're also a customer of Applied Predictive Technologies, or APT, the cloud-based data and analytics company that we acquired last May. McDonald's use APT's software to analyze a variety of strategic initiatives, including new food and menu items, determining which items should be on the menu and other business priorities. And that's just one of the many examples of the value we can provide to our merchant partners when you combine products that we have with the data analytics that we are capable of analyzing with them.","So next I'd like to give you an update on how we are advancing our strategy in the digital payments space, and I'm going to start with MasterPass. So remember, we're in a marathon here, and we're making great progress with our digital by default strategy. Now that's about enabling issuers to auto-enroll cardholders onto the MasterPass platform without any additional effort having to be made by the consumer. We're looking forward to announcing some bank partners who will be leveraging this ability in the near future. And as we continue to drive new acceptance of MasterPass as well, we are closing in on signing up about 270,000 merchants representing more than $160 billion in addressable volume.","Earlier this month, Vodafone Egypt migrated nearly 2 million Vodafone Cash wallets from their closed loop system to our mobile Payment Gateway platform, and that enables us to process all of their transactions. This migration builds on our goal of creating an interoperable network across the Egyptian mobile payment ecosystem that I've spoken to in an earlier call and helps to drive our strategy of financial inclusion and of course accelerate the conversion of cash.","And then moving on to MasterCard Digital Enablement Service, or MDES. We continue to make significant progress around making digital transactions more secure via encryption and tokenization. In Asia, we're pleased to now have more than 30 issuers signed up for the MDES service. We also launched the first NFC-based wallet in Latin America with Citi Banamex in Mexico utilizing our cloud-based payments technology. And by the way, this wallet, the Citi Banamex one, was created by developers from our C-SAM acquisition, which actually gave us access to a very talented pool of engineers who are enabling us to build out capabilities for issuers and merchants exactly like the example of Citi Banamex.","And finally, we continue to support our digital partners by helping Android Pay launch in the UK, and both Samsung Pay and Apple Pay are expanding to Singapore. We are also pleased to be partnering with Facebook as they leverage MDES to test tokenization by enabling pilot participants to interact with sellers and advertisers directly on the platform to complete their purchases all without ever having to leave the Facebook app.","So moving on to safety and security. You know there's a lot of effort from us and others going into this space and as a result of successful biometric trials in the Netherlands and the US that we announced last August, we're actually launching MasterCard Identity Check, fondly referred to as selfie pay, in the US, Canada, and parts of Europe this summer with more countries to be announced soon. Much of the initial interest in Identity Check has come and been attached to the consumer side of these businesses. But interestingly, we're actually currently working with BMO Financial Group, that's the Bank of Montreal in Canada, to roll out the first corporate credit card program using selfie pay in both the US and Canada.","In addition, we recently launched IQ Series. That's a suite of products which uses real-time intelligence to impart issuers to make more informed fraud management decisions, as well as most importantly, potentially decrease the growing problem of false declines. Industry studies are showing that one out of every six cardholders have experienced at least one decline because of suspected fraud in the past year. And that by the way adds up to false declines of $118 billion a year, or several times the actual amount of true card fraud.","Next, we worked with our issuers to deliver additional benefits to our cardholders and kind of protect them even more from fraud. As of two weeks ago, all MasterCard consumer and small business cardholders are now covered by the industry's first global, all around the world, zero liability promise, ensuring they're not responsible for any unauthorized charges.","And while on the topic of safety and security, let's spend a minute on the status of EMV in the US. We now have about 67% of our consumer credit cards and 24% of our consumer debit cards with chips in them. Roughly 1.2 million US merchant locations are now accepting these cards. And while that's good progress we are seeing across the industry, and also in our own numbers, I think everybody recognizes that checkout times at the terminal may appear longer when using a chip card. And to help address that concern, we announced M\/Chip Fast, which is to help speed EMV transactions, you'll leverage the capabilities of our existing contactless technology, which as you know, has been deployed in various transit and other applications around the world. Using that, cardholders will experience mag stripe transaction speed but with the added security of EMV and chip. At the same time, we've got to make this happen in collaboration with the industry, including other networks to look at how to bring a consistent approach to the market and best support the EMV checkout experience.","And the point of all these examples is that people shop with all sorts of devices and through multiple channels. And they expect technology to simplify that process while keeping the transaction safe and secure. Now I gave you all these examples to demonstrate and reinforce our commitment to protecting every transaction. It doesn't matter whether it took place in the physical world or the digital world. We are committed to doing this.","Just for the last several minutes talking to you about how we have grown our business through a series of organic investments, and it's important to recognize we have also been growing our business by integrating the various acquisitions we made over the past few years, trying to expand our presence across the payment value chain. So let me give you a couple of examples across information services and processing.","So let's start by information services, that business within Advisors. I mentioned APT earlier when I talked about McDonald's. One of the great things about their subscription-based business model is that it generates a recurring revenue stream with an average contract length of about three years. And since the acquisition, we've integrated the sales and product organizations of APT with Advisors to drive some pretty good benefits. Let me give you an example.","Since their acquisition, 30 organizations have subscribed to the APT platform in long-term contracts, and in addition to McDonald's that I talked about, I'll give you a few more: Asahi Breweries in Japan, Sunoco in the US, and in the UK, KFC. We have also signed more than 15 new deals incremental to APT's earlier business as usual efforts. In other words, using MasterCard's client relationships and coverage, including by the way one of the largest airlines in Europe, one of the largest retailers in Brazil, two of the largest financial institutions in Asia and several in the US.","What's exciting about all these deals is that they include expanding relationships with long-time APT clients who now also license newly created product modules, leveraging insights derived from MasterCard data.","Now finally we launched APT Engage, which is a suite of products which leverages aggregated and anonymized MasterCard payment transaction data combined with APT's proprietary analytics to help issuers and merchants better understand customer spending behavior, so which products have higher loyalty as well as planning for new retail locations. That's about information services.","On to processing. The idea there being to extend our capabilities beyond switching, getting beyond authorizing, clearing and settlement. Through our Payment Transaction Services business, we signed a deal with BNP Paribas in Poland to provide issuer processing services, which by the way has also enabled us to become one of the major third-party processors in the country.","Here in the US, our year-old partnership with Green Dot to process all of their debit and prepaid cards has resulted in the successful migration of now approximately 50 million account files with another 50 million to occur over the balance of 2016. And lastly in the same business, we enabled several transit operators in Turkey to begin using NFC capabilities by processing contactless cards and thereby allowing us to increase our share of domestic processed transactions.","Staying with processing on the Prepaid Management Services side, we've just implemented a card program with British Airways to facilitate compensation payments to BA passengers for delayed or canceled flights or lost luggage. We also launched the first dual purpose travel insurance and multi-currency prepaid travel product with Flight Centre, which is one of the world's largest travel agencies.","And lastly as a result of integrating our acquired assets into our Payment Gateway Services business, we are now able to offer products globally, which include integrated fraud and risk management solutions to both merchants and to acquirers. We're already seeing several new wins including four new deals with key acquirers and resellers in Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, who can now offer these capabilities to their merchant base and in turn, that kind of helps us expand our footprint in these markets. We've also worked to ensure that our Payment Gateway provides acceptance of the latest digital payment methods. We now support both Apple Pay and Android Pay in addition to MasterPass.","Look, we all recognize these acquisitions require a certain amount of time, investment and resources to integrate. We've worked very hard to ensure this happens seamlessly and efficiently. We're now clearly seeing the benefits that come from them, both in our dialogue and in our engagement with our customers.","So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with page three, where you see the difference between as reported and currency neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at the start of this call, we have now changed how we report the impact of currency. So instead of reporting FX adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of the euro and the Brazilian real functional currencies, we are now reporting currency neutral growth rates, which exclude all impacts of foreign exchange rates. This is both the impact from translating functional currencies into US dollar for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into the functional currency. We hope that this change will make it easier for you to understand the underlying performance of our business. And all of my comments going forward will pertain to our new currency neutral growth rates.","Net revenue growth was 14%. While operating expenses grew significantly, this was mostly due to the difference between FX hedging and balance sheet remeasurement gains that we had in the year-ago quarter versus foreign exchange losses on our hedging contracts in this quarter. I will talk more about this when we get into the detail of operating expenses. As expected, net income was also impacted by a higher tax rate than in the year-ago quarter due to the non-recurrence of a discrete US foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the first quarter of 2015.","EPS was $0.86, up 1% year-over-year. But as Ajay said, it was impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete tax item that I just mentioned and the Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. When you exclude these two items, EPS grew 12%. Share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share, and as of April 21, we have $2.9 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.2 billion.","So let me turn page four, and here you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Included in these numbers is a positive lift of about 1% due to leap day on all of our metrics. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 13% on a local currency basis. That's about up 1% from last quarter. Overall, our US GDV grew 10%, made up of credit and debit growth of 11% and 8% respectively. Total US GDV had a continued 1% headwind from lower gas prices.","Outside of the US, volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, also up about 1% versus last quarter with mid to high teens growth in each region except Canada, which was impacted by that lapping of our Costco win. Cross-border volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, and that's similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Turning the page five, processed transactions grew 14% globally to $12.6 billion, a 2% increase from what we saw in the fourth quarter, with higher growth in all regions except Canada, again due to the lapping of our Costco win. Globally, the number of cards grew 7%, with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued.","Let me turn to page six for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 10% as reported or 14% on a currency neutral basis given currency headwinds. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, particularly in the US and Europe, and some of which was due to the impact of leap year. Rebates and incentives were slightly higher than what we expected due to deal renewals.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on a currency neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 13%, in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 14% while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 2% gap is due to a number of pricing actions partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 18%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenues grew 22%, driven primarily by our APT acquisition and our Safety and Security product offerings.","Moving on to page seven, here you can see that total operating expenses increased 25% in the quarter or 29% on a currency neutral basis. Most of this increase is due to FX movements recorded in our G&A line. I mentioned on our last earnings call that we recorded a large amount of FX gains in the year-ago quarter, mostly due to one-time gains related to Venezuela. The absence of those gains plus the unrealized losses we recorded this quarter on our FX hedging activity due to the weakening of the US dollar relative to year-end 2015 resulted in an almost $130 million increase to expenses. Excluding this and a 4% impact from acquisitions we did not have in the year-ago quarter, G&A grew 11% as a result of our continuing investment in areas such as digital, data analytics, and safety and security. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisitions.","So now I'm going to turn to slide eight. Let's discuss what we have seen in April through the 21st. While many of our business drivers are similar to the first quarter, direct comparisons to the first quarter are a bit difficult since it had the benefit of both leap day and Easter. The numbers through April 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, the same as in the first quarter. In the US, our processed volume grew 10%, down roughly 1% from the first quarter with slower growth in both credit and debit. Gas had less than 1% negative impact on our April growth, down slightly from the first quarter impact.","Processed volume outside the US grew 16%, up 1% from the last quarter with higher growth in most regions and primarily driven by Europe and APMEA. Global processed transaction growth was 14%, the same as we saw in the first quarter. Processed transaction growth outside the US was up a bit with increases in APMEA and LAC while the US growth was down almost 2% due to slower growth in both credit and debit. With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 11% globally, down 1% from last quarter with slower growth in Europe, primarily due to the timing of Easter.","Let me start out with a quick comment about our long-term performance objectives for 2016 to 2018, which excluded the impact from our two major functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, as well as excluded any new M&A activities. Since we are now making the change to recognize the impact of all foreign exchange on our business, we reviewed these objectives and determined that no change is required from what we issued previously because we had baked in very little local FX impact over the three-year period. Therefore our 2016 to 2018 objectives remain as follows but are now on a currency neutral basis. Net revenue CAGR of low double digits, operating margin of at least 50%, and an EPS CAGR in the mid teens and measured off a 2015 pro forma EPS figure of $3.12.","Now moving specifically to this year, there's really no change in our outlook for the business from what we discussed with you on our earnings call back in January. The US and European economies are showing some sign of improvement, but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, FX headwinds will continue to be with us into 2016, although likely not as significant as 2015 given current FX rates. And our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. We will continue to run the company for growth both on the top and on the bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management.","As we look at full-year 2016 and after factoring in our new currency neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our three-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as reported basis, you will need to adjust to the impact of all currencies and at the current rates, we estimate that it would mean about a 3% headwind on net revenue growth and about a 4% headwind to the bottom line.","And let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. So for rebates and incentives, we continue to expect to see growth in the high teens, slightly lower than the 20% as reported growth rate we saw in 2015. On expenses, we still expect total operating expense growth in the high single digit range on an as reported basis. And finally, you should assume a tax rate of slightly less than 30% for 2016.","Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period, and in order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Nice results. I guess I just wanted to ask the first question on somewhat of a slowdown on US volume growth. Obviously still strong, but the January update you had given was 12%. We sort of have the leap year benefit, the timing of Easter. Anything to sort of call out in terms of the gradual slowdown in the US?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Well look, first of all, I think what you saw in the first quarter was very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter, so there was really a continuation in terms of how the US consumer feels. The first three weeks of the second quarter, so that is April, first of all as I tell you always, it doesn't really make a quarter. But you have the effect of Easter in there, right, because Easter was in March, not in April, and that typically happens to be a bigger effect in the United States.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And in Europe, probably. Those are the two places where Easter has some impact. You'll see less impact from Easter in the other regions of the world. So right now, we got no further conclusion for you, Glenn.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And any impact at this point from USAA rolling off? Or is that sort of, the timing of that's sort of?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Very early days, small impact right now. But I'm sure that will build as we told you over the course of the year and into next year.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Can you give some color around the trajectory of your investment spending as we progress through the year, and maybe any thoughts on when we can expect positive operating leverage to return? Thank you.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Bill, look, first of all, a couple of thoughts. Our investments does bounce around by quarter or quarter, but we don't give really a quarterly outlook for you, so you're really going to have to think about the high single digit as reported numbers for OpEx in total that I was just telling you about. And that does include all of our operating expenses, including the foreign exchange losses that we booked in the first quarter. So hopefully by knowing the first quarter, you are able to chart out the next three quarters for the year given that we're giving guidance for the high single digit number.","In terms of operating leverage, what we have said when we looked at our business, and we do that actually every year, that we feel very comfortable with an operating margin in excess of 50%. Remember, we are really running the business for revenue growth, so for top line growth, which means that we are having to make a number of investments in on the OpEx side in order to generate the bottom line growth. So we are holding that as a metric, and at this point in time, the heavy duty investments that are happening is in the digital arena, is in the data analytics arena as well as in the safety and security arena.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","At the end of the day, if you take out the currencies, our revenue growth was 14% in our G&A growth if you take out these one-timers was 11%. That's kind of how we are running the company on a daily basis. We may have quarters when the gap between the two will be wider. We may have quarters when it's a little narrower, because that's the point that Martina was making. We don't really manage that on a quarterly basis. What we try and do for the year as a whole is to make sure that we have good revenue growth and put money back into the priority areas. That's kind of what you're seeing in our underlying business. FX and balance sheet remeasurement and stuff of that type, it's important. It matters to a shareholder, but if I let that interfere with the way I'm investing in digital and data and safety and security, I don't think that would be the right thing to do. So that's how we're trying to run the place.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, and in fact, the underlying G&A growth of 11%, when you actually extrapolate that to operating expense growth, so same basis, taking out the acquisitions as well as the foreign exchange losses, it was 8%.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There you go.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","So you would look at the operating expense growth of 8% versus a revenue growth of 14%. So you can actually see that there is positive leverage.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line's open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. I just had a question just on Europe, how things are progressing there as Visa is getting closer to its deal with Visa Europe and then maybe just a little bit about the M&A opportunities out there. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Sanjay, got to wait for Visa to get through with acquisition processes. You heard on their call, they have got some timing change and some construct changes in that. I think the construct changes actually make it simpler for the banks to evaluate what they are getting and what they are not. And so that's actually a good thing for everybody. And the timing change will just have an impact on how these deals progress over time. So we're working our way through it and we're working hard in Europe.","And M&A, I presume you're asking about broad ideas on M&A. And broad ideas on M&A aren't any different from what I've told you in the past, which is some deals have come across. We see deals every quarter. We end up probably seeing sometimes as much as 15 to 20 deals. We end up doing one or two, if we're lucky, in the course of a period of time. A couple of years ago, we did more than that. It just depends. It depends on if it's what we need for product or geography or expansion of capabilities. But we are actively looking all the time.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the areas really haven't changed in terms of what we have told you before, which is in the processing arena, in the information services arena, in the loyalty arena. Technology is really important for us. But those areas really have not changed.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. I guess there have been some press reports about the potential for an acquisition. Could you just talk generally about what types of assets would be kind of interesting at this point, and how you're thinking about the acquisition front?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Moshe, so there is actually a little bit of that, as Martina was just referring. We're trying to build out capabilities in the areas we've identified over the last three years in our strategic plans and our investor days. Basically, that's in processing, so we get to see more transactions and we get beyond the clearing, authorizing and settlement space of the existing card kind of business.","So that's why you saw us doing, and you saw in my opening remarks the commentary on the different processing entities and how they fit into what we are doing. It could be in the DataCash kind of space, which is the Payments Gateway area. It could be with things like Provus and Trevica. Those are all in the regular transaction processing spaces, or it could be in any space that allows us to get to see more transactions. When six, seven years ago, we used to see under 40% of our transactions, we now see close to 50%. That enables us to do a better job with our core products, but even more importantly, with our Information Services and Advisors and Safety and Security products, which is where we're putting some emphasis. So that's the second area beyond processing.","Anything that gives us capabilities, strength, geography, product knowledge or skill sets in data analytics, in safety and security, in information services, in loyalty and rewards, hence the acquisitions in Australia that we've done. That's all about those spaces. And we haven't wavered off that. And you know, you read speculation every once in a while, and speculation is speculation until we can announce anything to you. So don't take it to the bank.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you, and thanks for moving to the FX neutral. It's great.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I told Martina you'd be the most happy boy there.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, my head's always spinning, so a little less spinning is good. I wanted to I guess ask on the US I guess credit overall actually, just credit purchase volume. I saw that US credit volume accelerated a little bit from the metrics sheet. and it outgrew international credit I think for the first time that I can remember. So and the international credit looks like it's slowing a little bit. How much of this is cyclical or are there some other things to consider, some win\/loss dynamics maybe that we should be aware of?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So Tien-tsin, some of it is just that remember for a while, our issuer mix was underperforming soon after and for many years after the crisis. If you look at the reports, you'll find it so happens that our issuer mix is back into growing its volumes and its businesses, and so we're kind of riding that tailwind in our sales in addition to all the other stuff that's going in and out. But the wins and losses you're well aware of. There's almost nothing that you don't know other than smaller institutions, which won't move the numbers the way you think about them. They could move yield but they are unlikely move transaction numbers. And so you'll find our consumer credit and our commercial credit in the first quarter actually both are up over the fourth quarter and both are also kind of doing okay of the course of the year. It's ins and outs, that's in all of them. But most of it would have to do, just exact number for this quarter, would have to do with issuer mix rather than anything dramatic in terms of wins or losses.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So nothing to call out with Europe volumes? I can see the data in general, but just from what you can tell with new regulation in place, has there been any impact on volume?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not yet, Tien-tsin. As I said, that's why I use that comment of Barbara about steady as she goes. I'm really keen to make this period run through in that form of steady focus.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Look, I just want to follow up a bit on the spread between the revenue growth and transactions processed and the volume or the transactions themselves, the growth rate, as well as the cross-border side, the volume there. And I know you mentioned pricing. Typically, we've seen the intra-European volume obviously have a big impact on revenue growth versus volume. I mean it seems like pricing is maybe offsetting that. I guess for me to get an understanding going forward, is there some sort of a shift that's occurred in the level of volume intra-Europe versus other areas? And is pricing big enough and sustainable enough that we should really forecast the revenue growth rate to outperform the volume growth rate cross-border going forward, just given that's a pretty big tailwind.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","So, Darrin, first of all, these were pricing actions that were introduced last April, April 2015, so that means they have anniversaried now with the first quarter. So you're not going see that in any significant way in Q2. And secondly, from an intra\/inter European mix, that means the relative growth rates of those cross-border volumes, we really haven't seen much of a difference there. It was a little bit less of a drag than we had in the prior quarters, but it was still a drag.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And by the way, in the cross-border business, in fact, I think that's the other thing you'd like to get a little insight into, the markets that are suffering in terms of our recognizing cross-border business from them are no different from what you would think. Brazil is slower. Nigeria is slower. Canada is a little slower. That's kind of what you would have expected. And China for example, actually is slower into the US but not into other markets. The Chinese cross-border travel seems to be up in a Japan, in an Australia, a little slower into the United States. So all of that is inside the numbers that you see. And that's kind of how you should think about cross-border. We work very hard on cross-border because it's an important part of our business, and the results of our cross-border effort is literally a result of 35,000 different initiatives happening all over the world in different countries on helping to make cross-border be a predictable and good part of our business.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So thanks. So Martina, should we be modeling cross-border revenue to outperform volume in the next few quarters?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","No. I think you should be going back to what we had before.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Moshe, are you there? Are you on mute?","Moshe Katri - CRT Capital Group LLC","Yes, can you hear me now?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Moshe Katri - CRT Capital Group LLC","Hey. So rebate levels remain pretty elevated in terms of growth rates. How should we think about in general the competitive environment? And then on top of that, do we have any large renewals coming up? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Look, Moshe, first of all, the competitive environment has not changed, right. I mean, we have really said that it's always competitive in terms of winning a business. Price is always one factor, but what really plays is what kind of product suites you can offer and how we sell in to a customer. But the price equation has not changed, and you can actually see that from our rebates level in terms of what we're saying for the whole year. We have not changed our view whatsoever, but you do know that we can never perfectly forecast when we sign a particular deal for renewal. So that happens to be here in the first quarter. We have a few more renewals that we signed that we had charted out for the rest of the year.","Moshe Katri - CRT Capital Group LLC","So we don't have anything significant in terms of large renewals this year? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","So I think we got pretty much, I mean, every year, we have one or two significant renewals. But at this point, I think we pretty much have gotten our hands around these renewals. Remember, when renewals happen, you typically work at least 12 to 18 months ahead of the renewal of that particular customer, so we got our hands around that pretty well for this year.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","They're all factored into the guidance that she gave you that during the conversation when she was speaking about the fact that our rebates and incentives as a whole, which also include by the way the impact of better volumes. Remember that we are also paying for volume. So there's not just deals, although that's what you're asking about. There's also volume. And volumes are that, just said in reply to Tien-tsin's question, some of our issuer mix is doing better than they used to. So that's all inside that, and she's factored all that in when she said that you should expect rebates and incentives for the year as a whole to be a little lower than what you saw last year, which was around 20%. In the high teens I think are the words that Martina has been using.","Moshe Katri - CRT Capital Group LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. Ajay, I wanted to get your reaction to Walmart Pay and the potential for other similar mobile wallet solutions, whether it ends up being a Target Pay or what have you. Because on the surface, this does seem like a different approach from the merchants as opposed to the MCX approach, because it will offer the consumers opportunity to use all tender types including the traditional networks rather than being hyper-focused on reducing acceptance costs and trying to force the use of private label and decoupled debit payment types. What's your perspective? Did you see an actual change in how the merchants are thinking about mobile wallets?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think this whole mobile space, Jason, is such a fluid and moving space that everybody's trying to figure out what will be the next holy grail. And in truth, I think nobody actually knows. And I think, as I've said many times, it's going to take a few years for this to settle. That's why even companies like ours in mobile, you've seen us place effort, energy, money, bets in everything from whether the transaction data is on the handset or it's in the cloud, whether we are working with mobile network operators or hardware manufacturers or distributors and that stuff. It's all mobile space. It's such an evolving space, and I don't think anybody knows the answers.","And I think that's what's going on even with the retailers. I think they're trying to find a way to offer a product and a wallet that their consumer can be connected to for loyalty and not just let a digital player own that space. Also, not just let the banks own that space. The banks, by the way, are doing the same thing. They're trying to make sure they offer products that get the consumer loyal to them and not just let the digital player own that space or the merchant own that space, and of course, the digital player is doing the same thing.","So they're all doing a dance right now, and I don't think anybody knows the real answer. But I do believe in two or three underlying factors. The first one is we as a network, we believe that a focus on the person who owns the consumer relationship, in this case the bank or the merchant as it may be, that they are the ones who should be developing the loyalty with that consumer. People like us that are, we're a B2B2C company. We operate through them, and therefore, our role is to facilitate that and do it in a way that drives our business with them and enables our value-added services to be used. So we're very focused on going through them, whether it be through a Walmart or through a Citibank or through a different bank.","The second rule that I think applies universally is that more consumer choice in tenders and payments is better than less. And I think that's just to reduce the friction. And there's one large merchant in the United States who doesn't think that way, but otherwise, every other merchant around the world is keen to basically offer more tender choice to their consumer rather than less. And I think that's going to be even more important in the mobile world to reduce friction. I think those kinds of rules apply.","And so my view of this is, Jason, don't conclude too much yet, but be prepared to see many efforts going on in different places. I think the days of one model, you know when only one big mobile network or one, or sorry, one big mobile wallet or one big e-commerce wallet existed, those days are going away. There's going to be a lot of competition in that space with multiple tenders, with choice for consumers, and it's going to be interesting to watch where this settles.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. All right. It sounds like there won't be just one winner. We'll stay tuned. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't think there'll be. That's a very good way to end it actually, Jason. I don't think there's one winner in this game. And I don't think you'll even know who the winners are for a few years to come. I mean, a mobile phone is such a small surface area. If everybody had launched all their wallets, you would have no place to sell a product to anyone. You have places to make payments with, which probably is not where the mobile guys are going, and so.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow up on cross-border. Martina, I think you mentioned that it slowed a little bit on the update due to Europe, so just looking for color on that. And then obviously when you compare your cross-border growth rates versus peers, they seem to be quite a bit higher. Just trying to again reconcile some of the differences there. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Bryan, look, in terms of the slowing on the cross-border, we obviously see a number of factors. One, certain countries have certain economic issues, so you can put in there Brazil, Venezuela, Russia, Nigeria. So there's a swath of countries who just economically having a really tough time, and you don't see a lot of outbound travel from there. Secondly, there are a number of other countries that just impacted by the stronger dollar, right. So you can see Australia, Canadian dollar. So that number of, those economies that are actually doing okay, but they're not traveling in dollar-indexed countries as much just because the dollar is so strong. And even though we saw a little bit of a weakening of the dollar for the first quarter, it's still at a very, very high level. So I think you will see all of that coming through this year, albeit at a lower level of impact than what we saw in 2015.","In terms of reconciling it to competitors, that's a tough one, right. I mean you're going to have to ask them how they do their methodology, but I would presume that outside of Europe, we're seeing relatively similar trends, other than that I hope that we have a little bit of a better growth rate given all of the activities that Ajay has mentioning we are undertaking with various portfolios.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The only other thing I'd add for you is the opposite side of that weakening currencies there has been that we have seen over time some increased US travel into some of the European countries. But all of this kind of washes in and out of the numbers you're seeing. And you do see an impact caused by destabilizing world events. So it so happens that Europe has, back to your European question, Belgium and Turkey are both in our European numbers, and both Belgium and Turkey have had a somewhat difficult time with their security situation over the last few months. And Paris, which got impacted so unfortunately in November last year, has still not recovered to what it used to be prior to November. And so there's a little bit of that inside Europe as well. But at end of the day, it's a little slower than it was in the first quarter, and then of course, there's Easter.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. You have Easter.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so it's really hard to give you a broken up pattern of all those. All that's washing through the number that we're talking about.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler of Stifel. Your line's open.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks, good morning. Question on Europe real quick. I know you mentioned that you haven't seen any real impact from the EU regulations. But any shift at the margin from credit cards to debit cards as rewards products leave the system? And then an unrelated question quickly, your major competitor in Europe changed the terms of their acquisition on the earnout. Does that have any impact competitively? Thanks.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's too early to see the impact of those EU regulations yet in the kind of numbers that you would want to look at. I think no doubt you will see impact over a period of time. I have every expectation that acceptance will expand because of lower merchant costs.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","And we have seen that.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we've seen some it already. But the results of their acceptance expanding in terms of impacting our volume in a way that I can give you tangible numbers, you got to just give it a few more months. I have every expectation that the separation of scheme and processing is going to require some work. We're doing that work. It may not impact us enormously in terms of expense in the first quarter, second quarter.","But you know what? These are things that all add to work. And I would be loath to tell you that the EU regulations are going to have no impact. I think it's a pretty serious industry move, and it will have an impact for a period of time in the way the consumer behaves, the merchant behaves and the way we construct our business there.","The second part about Visa and its Visa Europe stuff, as I said to the first question when I got asked in the beginning, it's still early. It's just been announced by them that they're changing the terms of the manner in which the exact deal's priced as well as the timing. I think over the next two or three months, we'll see what that does in terms of how issuers are thinking. My general sense is it'll make it easier for an issuer to know exactly what they're going to get paid from the exercise of the put, and that'll make it a little easier for them to comprehend what they're getting and what they're leaving behind if they make a decision, which in a sense is a good thing. That's transparency. And the second part of it is it's going to be three months or so later, so it's just going to make it a little longer out on gestation periods. Meanwhile, we're all working away like busy beavers here.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, Ajay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So a lot of discussion around kind of gaining local market processing, I think globally and in particular in Europe. I'm wondering, just as a broad rule of thumb, can you give us some sense about implications as you capture more of that for revenue yields?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Well look, when you talk about local processing, I presume you're talking about issuer processing and acquiring processing, the assets that Ajay was talking about in his script. And we have told you before that typically those kind of assets produce a lower yielding transaction than what we see in our switch transaction, so in off-clear and settlement. But the purpose for us is not just to be making money on that processing piece. The primary purposes is that we're doing this in countries where we typically don't switch the transaction. So that means it's a different means for us to be actually seeing the transaction, and then what we do with the transaction is utilizing it for additional services. So as soon as we see a transaction, we can for instance put our safety and security products in it. We can do data analytics in it. So you kind of have to look at this whole picture holistically, not just at the yield that that processed transaction actually produces.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","One thing you know for sure is that, as I've said in previous investor days as well as over time, we are clearly investing in building out our capabilities in these value-added services. We believe those are important for the next decade and two in the business. There's a lot of runway in seeing transactions and processing, because 85% of the world's retail transactions are still cash. So yes, there's a lot of runway, but there's also a lot of runway in building ancillary services that are connected to the transaction. I'm not interested building services that are not connected to our core business. Neither am I interested in building services that have a very high proportion of annual renewal in them. We're trying to build it the right way so that out 10 years and 15 years, it will be an outstanding asset for our company. We told you in, I think the last investor day, Martina, was in September?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we told you that close to a quarter, a little less than a quarter, of our revenue was now coming from all these services, and we are continuing to focus and grow those.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Now, you had a specific question on revenue yield. Remember how we do revenue yield, right. You're actually looking at switched transactions when you look at the transaction processing fee. That switched transaction does not have included the processed transaction that's coming out of our issuer and acquiring processing. So when you just calculate normal yields, albeit on the domestic assessment side, be it on the cross-border side, be it on the transaction processing side, you're not going to see that impact.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then if I could follow up on Ajay, your point you're making on information services that I think at analyst day you said, like you said, around 20%. I think you also had mentioned the margins on that business were around 40%. And I'm just wondering if we think about the update, is there a structural reason why you can't get those to be at or above kind of typical MasterCard margins, or is that just structurally going to be lower longer-term? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so let me just take this one moment. First of all, what we said that our services business roundabout are approaching about 25% of our total revenues. And yes, we did say that the margin is around 40% at this point in time.","There is a whole mix of different businesses in there. So what I just said about the processing business, typically that is a much lower margin type of business. When you look at some of the information services businesses, it's a higher margin, and when you look at the safety and security business, it's an even higher margin.","So Dan, I can't just mix them all together because there's just a number of facets in there. But what we are doing, and this is what we said, is given that we have done a number of acquisitions, folding them together with our assets, we have made, and you remember maybe the restructuring charge that we took 15 months ago or so, we have actually made some really good progress to be increasing the margin of these businesses over time.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And that's kind of what the point that's in the September time or sometime in the fall I think Martina made the point that, yes, the margin is now 40%, but scale does bring a higher margin. Just as, by the way, scaling our core business has been improving our margin over time. So I don't consider these to be inherently lower margin businesses, if that's what you're trying to get certainty on. They're in the mix. There are some that will be inherently lower. There are some that will be inherently higher, just like in our current core business there are different yields and different margins even in our current core business between the different kinds of payments involved and the different kind of things that we do involved there. So it's all about our mix.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Thanks. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. I was wondering if you could give us any perspective on corporate commercial cards? Are they accelerating, decelerating, and is there an opportunity internationally for those? Thank you.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so we talked about commercial a little bit as well. But I, honestly I consider the whole commercial business to be a continuing area of growth, and I am sure so do my peers. Because it's not just about us or our peers, it's the marketplace. This commercial business has a nice opportunity for all of us. We signed a deal with Barclays in the UK recently. We've expanded our global agreement at Citibank to include their commercial card portfolios in Asia, in Europe, but also in the United States. We've kind of seen continuing strong adoption of Smart Data, which is our reporting and reconciliation tool. We are seeing continuing adoption of In Control for commercial payments, that's virtual cards.","And most interestingly, we're starting to see increasing interest beyond the typical bankcard issuers. You're looking at technology providers, who embed their commercial payment solution into their software and platform. We're working with them. They're working with payment aggregators in insurance and healthcare. It's an interesting space. We're in the early stages of a long run in commercial, but we feel good about where we're going. And we're continuing to see good growth in the, not just in the US, by the way. This is this commentary that you heard me talk about has a number of overseas geographies that are picking up business volume and effort as well.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Your last question today comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on the question around expenses and particularly changes in Europe. I'm just wondering how much and we should expect and when we should expect expenses to start to be incurred around preparation for compliance with EC regulation or potential impact on separation of brand from scheme, et cetera? And I guess just get a gauge from you as how much of an impact we should expect that to have on your P&L. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","James, so first of all, any impact that we expected from the separation of scheme and processing in Europe was already folded into our performance objectives as well as any commentary that I made about 2016 in terms of operating expenses. So it is all folded in. What we really have to do is we have to separate the switching business into an isolated unit. It's not a legal separation; it's a functional separation. It reports separately from our European President, Javier Perez. It has to have obviously enough of a substance in there so that the unit can go to market as well as that it can do its middle office and back office functions. And so you should expect that while it is a smaller unit, that it will be very well seated with the right kind of people, and it will have some impact on our operating expenses, but as I said, this is already all factored into our commentary.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And I appreciate.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And by the way, just to be clear on that, that's part of what I said in an earlier call. The way Martina manages our expenses is that we're going to do what we've got to do. We've got to do what we do strategically as well as what we are required to do by law in a place. But then, like NSPK for example in Russia, in our G&A line of 11% includes the impact of the Russian processing which is now coming through our expense line, which by the way, is just what it is. We've got to manage it, and it's part of what we're going with. There's no point in my pulling that out separately for you and saying ex-that, I would have been even better. The way we manage this, like we manage acquisitions, once it's ours, it's ours. And we've got to find a way to cut expenses elsewhere while investing in the right things. And you will see us do that on Europe. You've seen us do that on Russia. You will see us do it with all these acquisitions and with the strategic investments. That's kind of what we're trying to do, manage our expenses in all aspects of our lines.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. That's great.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So thank you all for your questions. I'm going to leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. And the first part is, I think our business is performing well. You see that reflected in our strong volume and transaction growth, and that's despite the somewhat uneven global economy. We are growing revenues from our core businesses but also from our services as we just had a discussion of, both organically and through the ongoing successful integration of our acquisitions for the last few years. We're pleased with our progress across MasterPass, across the MasterCard Digital Enablement system and our partnerships with many of the digital players.","But as I said in the answer to Jason, there's a lot of things that will evolve there, and this is a marathon not a sprint. We continue to build on our momentum in safety and security. We are committed to making sure that is what consumers get, no matter which channel or which instrument or device they choose to use to shop on. And we remain very focused on creating a better experience for both cardholders and merchants across all these channels.","So thank you for your continuing support of the company, and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Christine, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us for a discussion about our second quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer.","Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question. Even if you think you have already dialed into the queue, you will need to register again following our prepared comments.","This morning\u2019s earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. These documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week through August 7.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our most recent SEC filings.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Ajay Banga. Ajay?","Ajay Banga","Thank you, Barbara, and good morning everybody. So for the second quarter, we are very pleased to report a net revenue growth of 13%, both as-reported and adjusted for currency. That increase is driven by healthy volume and transaction growth, which resulted in net income growth of 10% as-reported or 9% adjusted for currency and an EPS growth of 14%. And these results include the impact of all the acquisitions that we\u2019ve completed so far this year.","So let\u2019s start with looking at the underlying global economic trends with the United States where the economy seems to be improving but not without some challenges. Our second quarter SpendingPulse data showed U.S. retail sales, ex-auto, growing at 3.8% and that\u2019s a noticeable improvement over the first quarter number of growth of 2.3%.","However over that quarter, the monthly trend decelerated partially as a result of lower gasoline spending, which consumers did not appear to rollover into additional discretionary spend. Having said that, overall we think that current U.S. economic recovery is very much a work in progress. We see some favorable indicators, the continued improvement in unemployment figures, consumer confidence levels and so on.","But in fact early indications for July retail sales, again ex-auto, are showing further improvement over the second quarter. But there are some factors that could weigh on that economic recovery, like the slowing recovery in housing and the improvement in unemployment coming in part from an upswing in part-time workers rather than just full-time positions.","So despite those mixed segments, our U.S. business saw an improvement in the quarter, primarily driven by stronger growth in our consumer credit volume and continued good growth in commercial credit.","Europe. Europe continues a slow recovery path. PCE growth projections remain unchanged for the year at 3.5%. Consumer confidence, economic sentiment, unemployment rates all continue to improve across the region. And if you add to this in the case of the U.K. in particular, our SpendingPulse data showed retail sales, ex-auto, growing by 4.8% in that quarter, one of the strongest rates in the last four years with growth specs evenly across the sectors.","So MasterCard\u2019s total European volume growth for the second quarter was in the low-teens, process transaction growth was in the high-teens, both a bit lower than the first quarter. The region\u2019s growth was driven by number of countries including Russia, Turkey, Sweden and Italy.","In Latin America, full-year GDP growth expectations for the region have been revised down from 2.5% to 2.3% because of slower than expected performance in some of the key countries including Brazil and Mexico. And our second quarter SpendingPulse data for Brazil shows that retail sales grew 4.1%, down from the 5.9% growth in the first quarter. And this by the way is the weakest growth rate since August of last year.","On the other hand, the Mexican economy showed some improvement in the second quarter, and we believe that will continue as the U.S. economy improves. Our business in the region remains healthy, but it has slowed somewhat over the first quarter with second quarter GDP growth in the low-teens and process transaction growth remaining in the high-teens.","Across the Asia Pacific region, business sentiment and consumer confidence were up with improvements in many countries tied to changes in their political environments. And our business in Asia Pacifica, Middle East, Africa continues to do well with process transaction growth remaining about 30% and GDP growth in the high-teens for the second quarter.","So before we go to some of our business highlights, let me say a few words about a couple of legal and regulatory matters.","And first with regards to the proposed European Interchange Legislation. Not much has changed since last quarter. We are actively engaged with all parties, while the Council of Ministers continues its review. And we still believe that the proposed legislation is most likely to be adopted sometime in the first half of 2015.","Second, let\u2019s talk about Russia. As you know, the Russians are implementing changes to their domestic payments market in the form of a new payments law, which will impact MasterCard. We are pursuing multiple options to comply with the new law while fulfilling our U.S. obligations. And according to that law, ownership of domestic Russian switching has to be majority controlled by a Russian entity and should use Russian technology in order to relieve a foreign payments network from the collateral requirement that is now been delayed by the way till October 31.","The law provides some flexibility. And you were all aware of our RFP process to find the local switching partner as one part that we are pursuing. In addition, the processing center we currently have in Russia, we believe gives us the basis to build our own on-soil switching capabilities and we are exploring options to leverage that as well.","Overall, we expect only minimal impact from the current Russia situation for our 2014 results. So that situation is still fluid as you all know, it\u2019s difficult to put any future annualized impact into precise dollars, but if you look for a number, press for a number, our estimate today would be that our revenue could be impacted but something less than $50 million in its full calendar year of this effort. The exact amount along with any investment requirement for our on-soil switching capability will obviously depend on the final form of our operating concept in Russia.","So let\u2019s move on some of our recent business activity. First, talking about Russia. I want to tell that as we continue to work through the challenges there, our business continues to move forward. For example, we just renewed our business agreement with Alpha Bank, Russia\u2019s largest private bank, and that should help us expand our existing partnership in issuing affluent cards and accelerating the growth of contactless technology in the Russian market.","So let\u2019s go beyond that to talk about how we deepen our relationships with merchants and leverage these into partnerships to grow our business. I am going to highlight some recent additional activity in that space, but not only with merchants but also with mobile operators and with governments.","We\u2019ve been investing in our merchant relationships over the past few years. They are now 40% of our customer facing people, sales people in the United States are dedicated to that space. Last quarter, I mentioned the Wal-Mart, Sam\u2019s Club and Target wins. And this quarter, we got a few more to talk about. At the beginning of spring of 2015, BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club will be converting their entire credit business to chip-enabled MasterCard credit cards. And we are very pleased to be chosen as BJ\u2019s partner to help them deliver most secure solution for their cardholders.","We\u2019ve also had a couple of important renewals in our merchant co-bank business with Sears and Expedia, continuing our longstanding relationship with both of them.","Outside of the U.S., MasterCard was selected as the co-brand partner for the Landmark Shukran credit card in the U.A.E. Landmark Group is one of the largest retail organizations in the Middle East, 1,800 stores. They also are the region\u2019s largest retail loyalty program in seven countries with almost 6 million members.","For us, our goodness of merchants is not just about co-brands. We are also working with merchants in a number of activities that leverage our other assets; Advisors, MasterCard Labs and so on. So using our Advisors\u2019 data analytics, we are working with Expedia to help them improve the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns by identifying the best people to target, and with Shell and Williams-Sonoma to enhance their loyalty propositions.","Another example, we work through the major cruise line to identify opportunities for them to reduce their costs by moving their B2B payments from check writing to ACH to purchasing costs and virtual card numbers using our in-control capability.","And finally with MasterCard Labs, we\u2019re bringing our partners together to help solve some of that business challenges. And one example, earlier this summer, MasterCard worked on this first ever in-flight wearable technology, Hackathon with American Airlines, where we gave our technology and our mentorship. We used technology tools like Simplify Commerce and MasterPass to develop wearable solutions for travel.","Moving onto mobile. Last quarter, we talked about mobile as being just one of the many ways that consumers are shifting from physical to digital payments, and now it represents one of the most significant changes in our space. In this quarter we continue to develop and expand our partnerships with both, handset manufacturers and network operators.","So a couple of examples. We worked with Samsung in Australia last year, if you remember, we continue to deepen that relationship by launching Russia\u2019s first contactless mobile payment service with Russian Standard Bank using Samsung phones, Russian Standard\u2019s mobile banking application and MasterCard\u2019s Mobile NFC technology, our prepaid products and enhanced processing services. This partnership kind of brings our products and services together to deliver innovation in yet another market with Samsung.","In Canada, Rogers Wireless, which is that country\u2019s largest wireless service provider, they have got 9 million subscribers or so, recently launched their suretap wallet, and that\u2019s got a MasterCard prepaid card embedded inside. That new application allows Rogers\u2019 subscribers to use their NFC-enabled smartphones to make contactless payments which were already accepted for example in Canada in the 18 of the 20 largest merchants.","Moving onto MasterPass. We\u2019re continuing with our global expansion of MasterPass. MasterPass, as you know, is our got digital acceptance platform connecting consumers and merchants. In this quarter, MasterPass launched in Singapore, in Poland and South Africa. We are now up to 10 markets. We expect to do four more by the year-end. It\u2019s more than a wallet by the way. It\u2019s a platform which provides a safe and secure foundation to support multi-channel shopping and the ability to create innovative tools that you could use to enhance the consumer buying experience before, during and after the actual purchase.","Over the next two years, we think we will be in all the markets that represent about 75% of our total volume. MasterPass have been designed from the start with tools that make it very easy for merchants and issuers to integrate with it. Last quarter, we launched our in-app payment capability. Now we\u2019ve got a number of merchants. One example is Starbucks in Australia committed to including MasterPass in their apps.","So finally, partnerships with governments and our efforts in financial inclusion. To drive this expansion, you\u2019ve got to connect the right technologies and platforms. You\u2019re going to prepaid and mobile payments with the network and then adapt them to a local marketplace. And the only way that happens is you have the right partnership between the public and private sector.","We\u2019re actually seeing the results of some of that work happen today. In the last two years, we\u2019ve launched over 100 new programs, designed to bring access to millions and security to over 350 million people around the world who didn\u2019t have access to financial products before these programs were launched.","You already know what we\u2019ve done in South Africa and Nigeria. And let me give you some more color with a few more examples this quarter. So in Pakistan, we are partnering with the Bank of Punjab to issue millions of prepaid cards with biometric recognition to the nearly 90% of the Pakistani population who are unbanked and receive funds from government disbursement programs.","This program has helped the government of Pakistan improve their service, reduce inefficiencies, reduce leakage in the process. And in June, we announced the launch of the first Arabic mobile money implementation with the National Bank of Egypt and a mobile network, Etisalat. This service is called a Flous wallet, I hope I get that right, will allow Etisalat subscribers to transfer money, pay their bills, top-up their mobile phones and make purchases, either online or face-to-face.","And also in June, Tabung Haji, the first and largest Islamic non-bank financial institution in the world launched their first Shariah-compliant debit MasterCard. So cardholders can use their card anywhere MasterCard is accepted including on their pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. This event marks the beginning of broader collaboration with Tabung Haji in the Islamic payment space, and together we are supporting Malaysia\u2019s economic transformation program to drive financial inclusion and to accelerate that country\u2019s migration to electronic payments.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you see the as-reported as well as the FX-adjusted growth rates. All of my comments pertain to the FX-adjusted figures, which are almost the same as the as-reported numbers.","So we are very pleased with our strong performance this quarter. Net revenue growth was 13%. This combined with operating expenses growth of 14% resulted in a 9% increase in net income. While acquisitions had minimal impact on net revenue and net income in the quarter, they did contribute 3 PPT to operating expense growth.","EPS growth was 14% and share repurchases contributed $0.04 per share. During the second quarter, we repurchased almost 16 million shares at a cost of approximately $1.2 billion. Through July 24, we purchased an additional 1.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $106 million, and we now have $728 million remaining under the current authorization. We will continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.","Cash flow from operations was $729 million, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $5.7 billion.","So let me turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 13% on a local currency basis, down slightly from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 9% which was essentially the same as last quarter.","On the credit side, we had strong volume growth of 10%. This was an increase from last quarter, driven by improvements in consumer credits with growth in high-single-digits and continued strong growth in commercial credit which was in the mid-teens. Similar to last quarter, our U.S. debit growth was 9%.","Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis. This continues to be driven by APMEA with high-teens growth. Cross-border volume grew 16% on a local currency basis, just slightly lower than the 17% we saw in the first quarter. Growth in both, APMEA and Europe was in the high-teens. Key contributors to this growth included the U.K., Italy and Sweden. The deceleration of cross-border volume growth in Canada and Brazil continued into the second quarter. And in addition, we saw a deceleration in Australia, Russia and China, with Australia likely due to currency.","Turning to Page 5. Process transaction grew 12% globally to more than $10.6 billion. We continue to see double-digit growth in most regions. And globally, the number of cards grew 8% with over 2 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards.","Now let\u2019s turn to Page 6. And here we\u2019re going to go through some insights on a few of our revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 3 PPT gap is primarily due to higher volume growth in markets with lower than average revenue yields. This lower yield continues to be impacted by two factors. The first is lower fees in some markets as a result of either local market structure, or the existing domestic schemes that we compete against. And the second is a higher proportion of cash volumes, particularly in emerging markets.","Now the second factor actually does provide us with a good opportunity for future growth as we work to influence consumer behavior to use electronic forms of payment directly at the point-of-sale instead of cash.","Cross-border volume fees grew 13% while cross-border volume grew 16%. After excluding the 4 PPT contribution from pricing, the resulting gap between revenue and volume growth continues to be due for the most part due to higher mix of intra-European activity. Transaction processing fees grew 14%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in process transactions.","Overall, net revenue growth was 13% both, as-reported and FX-adjusted as the impact of the euro and the real al essentially offset each other. Beyond those two currencies, we still experienced some headwind, although a little less than last quarter from the weakening of the other local currencies, such as the Russian ruble, the Turkish lira, the Argentine peso and the Canadian dollar, and that was reflected mainly in the domestic assessment category.","Let me move to Page 7. And here you can see total operating expenses were up 14% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. As I said before, 3 PPT was due to expenses related to acquisitions, which were mainly in the G&A line. So when looking specifically at the 19% growth in G&A, our acquisitions primarily C-SAM and Provus, along with the consolidation of our majority-owned HomeSend investment contributed 3 PPT. The balance of the growth is primarily due to the continued organic investments we are making in strategic initiatives.","The decrease in advertising and marketing was mostly due to lower media spending relative to last year.","And finally, the $20 million increase in D&A is the result of our growing level of capital expenditures, mainly associated with additional investments in technology to support initiatives like MasterPass and Priceless Cities. It also includes the impact of the amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions we made.","Turning to Slide 8. Let\u2019s discuss what we have seen in July through the 28th. Each of our business drivers is slightly down compared to the second quarter, but most are still in double-digits. All of this has been factored into our full-year outlook. So the numbers through Jul 28 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 11%, down slightly from the second quarter.","In the U.S., our processed volume grew 8%, down 2 PPT from what we saw last quarter. As expected, we are now seeing more of an impact from the Chase migration. Process volume growth outside of the U.S. grew 14%, about 1 PPT lower than the second quarter, primarily due to some continued deceleration in Brazil, Russia and Canada. Globally, processed transaction growth was 10%, also by 2 PPT lower than what we saw in the second quarter including the Chase migration.","And now with respect to cross-border. Our volume grew at a healthy 14% globally, about 2 PPT lower than second quarter. For the most part, this deceleration can be explained by three factors. The first is the timing of Ramadan, the impact of which we expect will reverse in August. Second, the impact of foreign exchange on consumer purchasing power in certain travel corridors, such as Canada to the U.S. And lastly, the impact of some government imposed taxes on foreign purchases, particularly from Brazil.","Looking forward, let\u2019s begin with our long-term performance objectives for the 2013 to 2015 period. We continue to believe that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR and at least 20% EPS CAGR. This includes our views on the developments related to Chase, Russia and the European regulations that we talked about. We also remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%.","Remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude new M&A activities.","As we discussed at last year\u2019s Investor Day, we are looking to add capabilities in strategic spaces such as loyalty, processing, mobile, information services and safety and security, both organically and inorganically. Over the past four to five years, we\u2019ve looked at a large number of opportunities but only a few have met our strategic and financial criteria.","Although it can often take many months to evaluate and close a deal, it just so happens that several have come to the finish line within a relatively short period this year. Our past acquisitions like Datacash and Access Prepaid, along with the five we\u2019ve done so far this year. So that\u2019s Provus, C-SAM, ECS, Pinpoint and our majority investment in HomeSend, all of these deals are un-point from a strategic perspective and help us grow our business. You should expect us to continue to evaluate more such investments.","Now moving on, let me offer some commentary about 2014. So while M&A activities are not included in our performance objectives, we continue to get a lot of questions about how they will impact our as-reported financials. So let me take this opportunity to provide a little more color on that.","As I discussed on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, EPS dilution is expected to be $0.06 to $0.08 for the full-year 2014. Specifically, most of the impact will show up in the G&A line, and we expect G&A to increase by about $80 million in each of the two remaining quarters before considering any organic growth in G&A over last year.","Including the impact of these acquisitions, the expected growth rate in G&A for the second half of the year will be in the high-teens.","Now here are some additional thoughts about 2014 which are essentially unchanged since our last call. Our expectations of full-year net revenue growth remains at the low end of our three year range. The strong underlying close trends we are seeing in volume and transactions is allowing us to absorb the minimal impact expected from the Russian situation, as well as a good portion of the attrition that we anticipate from Chase this year.","The pace of the Chase attrition during the second quarter was essentially in line with our internal projections, and we continue to believe most of it will occur in the latter half of this year with the remaining flowing over into 2015.","In addition, we also continue to expect a 1 PPT contribution to our 2014 as-reported net revenue growth from our M&A transactions.","Overall, we haven\u2019t our changed our view about total operating expense growth from what we said in May, that we expect the as-reported growth rate for full-year 2014 to be in the low-teens after including the impact from M&A activities. Along with the growth in G&A that I just talked about, we continue to expect D&A growth in the 25% range for full-year 2014 due to our higher level of capital expenditures as well as the impact of amortizing intangible assets related to acquisitions.","As a reminder, you should be reflecting roughly $10 million per quarter to account for the interest expense associated with the debt offering we launched in late March. When we look at the sell-side models out there, it appears that many of you still have not accounted for those in your other income and expense lines.","For now, you should also continue to assume a full-year tax rate of about 32% but recognize that we\u2019re still working on a number of initiatives to better align our tax structure with our business footprint which will likely result in a lower tax rate over time.","Finally, with respect to foreign exchange in 2014. If those rates remain similar to where they are today, so that\u2019s the euro trading at the 134 level and the Brazilian real at the 223 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and the real would be a slight tailwind for the full-year.","Further, beyond the functional currency impact of the euro and the real, we have already seen almost 2 PPT headwinds to net revenue growth year-to-date from other currencies depreciating against the U.S. dollar and the euro. As I said before, we carefully manage those exposures, but we have also assumed some impact for the rest of the year.","Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?","Barbara Gasper","Thanks Martina. We\u2019re now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. Don\u2019t forget my earlier comments, that if you dialed into the queue when you first joined the call, you will need to register again to ask a question. And in order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Christine?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JP Morgan","Great, thanks. Thanks for all the details. Just want to ask on the cross-border yield, which was stronger than we expected. I heard there was some pricing that helped there, but can you also just comment on how sensitive your revenues can be from the FX volatility? I know that Visa has put that in our minds quite a bit, so curious how much settlement trading has an impact on your business, and also if this new pricing that you\u2019ve put in is sustainable? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So I am going to take this. Tien-tsin, it\u2019s Martina. First of all, we said that we had in the quarter 4 PPT impact from pricing in the cross-border fees. Quite the majority of that is actually going to roll off next quarter, okay.","Secondly, with respect to foreign exchange volatility. Our cross-border volumes are really only impacted from a foreign exchange volatility in terms of what the exchange rates are in terms of where people are actually transacting. What we do from a settlement trading revenue point of view, when we actually affect that exchange that is not reflected in the cross-border fees, it\u2019s actually reflected in the transaction processing fee.","And when we look at the foreign exchange volatility, it did go down over the last year or so, but in terms of an impact on our settlement trading fees, what\u2019s relatively small, we\u2019re talking about $10 million or so. So it was not a big factor for us at all.","Barbara Gasper","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes, hi guys. Just wanted to follow-up on the cross-border. Just trying to understand when we look at the competitors in your volume, your volume seems to be so much higher. Just trying to figure out how much of that is share gain, or is that just business mix? Obviously Europe plays a part in this. So if you can just help us understand kind of volumes versus the industry? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, Bryan. So when we look at our cross-border, as I said, it was 16% this quarter. In the prior quarter, it was 17%. And when we pull out Europe in the prior quarter, we basically said it was the same number, 17% growth. When you look at this quarter, in the second quarter, and you pull out Europe, actually for the rest of the world, we grew 14%. So it all depends on mix in terms of where people are traveling to and what the overall mix comes out.","Operator","Thank you. Okay and\u2026","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So I was just going to ask, any share gains there before \u2013 is share gains explaining a lot of this besides mix? I mean are you gaining share and taking away from competitors?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Look, I think it\u2019s a number of factors. One is obviously what are you doing with the existing portfolio that you have of banks, and in terms of how you are pointing the portfolios to be able for people to really use those cards across borders and transact in other countries. Two, obviously there are some share gains in it, but I think you\u2019re going to have to look at those very comprehensively that there are number of drivers.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, helpful. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, I just want to correct one thing. When I said I pulled out Europe, it\u2019s not all of our European regions, it\u2019s really Western Europe, which is anonymous to where Visa Europe is operating.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","Thanks. I wonder if you could just provide some more color on the consistent increase in growth in U.S. purchase volume we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters. Is most of that Citi reinvigorating the American Airlines co-brand or there are other things that are big contributors?","Ajay Banga","It\u2019s Ajay. It\u2019s a bunch of things. We\u2019ve been winning some co-brands over time. Citi American is clearly one of them, but there are others too. And going against it is the roll-off of the Chase book, that\u2019s been relatively slow in the first half, but its picking up as we expected in the second half. So it\u2019s kind of an in and out over there that\u2019s going on in the consumer part of the book. And our commercial traded book continues to do well. It\u2019s a higher growth rate in the low to mid-teens kind of number compared to the number for the consumer book, but it\u2019s a mix of two things that\u2019s going on.","David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","Thank you. I was hoping to just get a little bit more cadence on the rebate line given the Chase conversion is now underway. Could you just talk about how we should think about how that progresses through the rest of the year? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Sir, I don\u2019t think that you should be expecting any major surprises on that. So when you look at this year versus last year on a quarter-by-quarter basis, the only thing that you saw last year is that we had a little bit less of rebates in the second quarter, and a little bit more in the fourth quarter. So I think for this year, you should just expect a little bit more of an even distribution of that, i.e., you\u2019re not going to see the fourth quarter going up in such a significant way.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","And then maybe just for the year. It\u2019s kind of comparable then?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Very comparable.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","All right, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. I wanted to kind of turn back to the acquisitions because I guess the guidance you gave us on revenues, 1% for the full-year. So that\u2019s roughly $140 million. I mean, it sounds like the costs are still higher than that kind of on a run rate. So could you talk a little bit about how you see that progressing into \u201815 and ultimately \u2013 I understand that some of the acquisitions don\u2019t have a ton of revenue coming with them. So could you just talk a little bit of how you think about them in terms of the returns that they are going to generate for the company?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, look, we are separating acquisitions really into two buckets. One bucket is capability set and the things that we really need to do in order to affect some of our strategies. I would put for instance a company like C-SAM in that. To be honest, C-SAM did not come with a lot of revenues, but they came with a huge amount of capabilities, over 200 engineers in India that are really very well trained in the mobile platforms and helping significant on our execution on the MasterPass arena.","The other part of the acquisitions are buying fully fledged businesses like the business that we just closed, which is Pinpoint, and that came in literally at the end of the quarter. So you\u2019re not seeing a lot of revenues there. That\u2019s a fully vest business. It comes with revenues. It comes with expenses. And you will be seeing that coming in over the next couple of quarters, a more still given the other acquisitions on the expense line on the revenue line, but you should be accepting that over a number of years will be really helping \u2013 that these businesses really will be helping aiding our growth.","From a dilution point of view, I already talked about the 6% to 8% in 2014. I think you should still expect some dilution in 2015, probably to the tune of half of that number.","Ajay Banga","Just remember that these acquisitions are lapped during the year. Different ones are done at different times of the year. The impact of that dilution will depend on that portion of the impact in the calendar, and that portion will run over into the next year as well. That\u2019s what Martina is referring to.","By and large, most of the deals we do, you would get \u2013 even if they\u2019ve got revenue, there may be a dilution in the first year, because they are ending up either putting an investment into their capability to either raise that safety and security capabilities or their accounting and compliance capabilities to what we would feel comfortable. We have just given how that interfaces with the rest of our company.","And so a lot of money goes into that effort, into upgrading the accounting, into upgrading the compliance, into upgrading their firewalls, into upgrading their safety systems, their capabilities inside with security, hiring of a few new people. That\u2019s what goes into the first slot. That tends to create some dilution.","Companies like C-SAM on the other hand are all about rolling out MasterPass and all that you want to do in the mobile space. As I said we\u2019re in 10 countries already. That\u2019s way more than anybody else is in. And by the way, we are adding four more by the end of the year. And in two years, we\u2019re going to be in 75% of our GDV. I doubt we could have done that without the acquisition of C-SAM, and its inmate capability of that very talented workforce that they have.","Operator","Thanks.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just as to follow any comment on the current pipeline of future deals?","Ajay Banga","You will listen to us when we have a day to tell you about it.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks so much.","Ajay Banga","Honestly, we \u2013 I\u2019ve been here these five years now almost. I think Martina and I have probably looked at 100 plus deals, right. And we have done two before this year, three maybe including Truaxis, which has capability small. And now you\u2019ve added these five here. Some of the five we\u2019ve done just now, like ECS, we\u2019ve been \u2013 we bought a share in ECS two years ago and we\u2019ve worked with them for two years before entering into this transaction.","We\u2019ve been working with C-SAM for well over two years as well. So lot of these deals, they are in the hopper for a while, and there are others in the hopper. I have just no ability to predict to you when exactly they may come to fruition, or frankly we\u2019ll just get away from them because they don\u2019t work either in a return sense or a management capability sense or a geography sense or a product set sense or \u2013 it\u2019s going to fit one of those strategic means and that\u2019s kind of how its constructed.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just comment on the domestic assessments yields that you mentioned, the lower yield trend you saw in Q2. How should we think about that trend continuing or reversing over the next few quarters, please?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Look, I think you should be thinking about that trend continuing. This is not a new trend. We had been seeing that for a number of years actually. And you will continue to see it as we are really growing in a major way in markets outside of the United States in many emerging markets where they have certain structures, and in some markets you have domestic schemes where you have to compete against. And so you\u2019re going to have to align your pricing structure in that way.","In addition to that, look at all of the things that we\u2019re doing in the financial inclusion space. Ajay was talking a little bit about it. When people get an electronic payment means in their hand first. Typically, they\u2019re accessing ATMs first and pulling cash out of the ATMs, and then they walk across the street to be buying something in the store. That is typically a lower yielding transaction for us.","As we are actually working with those countries and with those consumers to be migrating them to be not going to the ATM but directly to the store, that is where you are going to see some movements from us in terms of being able to get a higher yield, but I think you should continue to see that trend for quite sometime to come.","Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Co","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Is it possible to quantify the impacts on the Chase conversion in terms of what\u2019s embedded in your guidance for the year? And any sort of color on the potential margin or a yield impact from that? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes. So, Moshe, actually all of that is comprehended in what my thought said about 2014 revenues. It\u2019s also comprehended in the 2013 to 2015 performance targets that we laid out. It\u2019s just \u2013 we saw only a little bit in the second quarter, right. You saw a little bit of an impact when you look in particular in our U.S. credit numbers even though they are very strong at the 8% range.","And you are going to see more in the third and the fourth quarter. We think that a fairly large portion of the portfolio will be rolling off, but we also believe that some remaining portion of the portfolio will be rolling off in the first and the second quarter.","As we told you before, we do not have a schedule from Chase so we don\u2019t really know. This is all our own internal projections. And as we\u2019re having in these earnings calls, we\u2019ll update you.","Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Co","And anything on yield or margin impacts?","Martina Hund-Mejean","On the yield, I think you should see some relatively same yields that you saw over the last couple of years. I think you should see very similar yields development going forward. There is not going to be too much of a difference.","Ajay Banga","Yes, remember our yield is comprised of many different things. It\u2019s just not just one client, even if they are a decent sized one. It\u2019s all to do with geography. It has to do with mix of products. It has to do with mix of clients. It has to do with so many factors that, trying to isolate that one client\u2019s yield impact on MasterCard\u2019s total. That\u2019s the rat hole you\u2019re going into.","Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Co","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin\u00a0Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin\u00a0Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks guys. Trends, I mean even beyond cross-border on the top line look pretty strong, at least versus our estimates. I mean notably the transaction processing line in particular also, I mean it grew. And it grew materially faster than the actual transaction process growth itself again. Just so if you can give us a little more color on sort of what drives that difference? And then secondly, on the other revenue line. Anything that is notable there from the sequential revenue increase?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, okay. So first of all from a transaction processing fee point of view, you have a little bit of pricing in there which is by the way coming off in the third quarter, as you have a little bit of the acquisition revenues in there, okay. So while that is not a real driver on the total top line, at some acquisition revenues as in the transaction processing fees.","And by the way some of that \u2013 some little acquisition revenues is also in the other growth line, but the over revenue growth line is really driven by a couple of factors. One, our Advisors consulting business is doing extremely well. This is the business that is really helping many, many banks as well as merchants around the world to be executing on the projects that they have to execute on.","Secondly, you\u2019re seeing our information services business, that is where we are actually doing the data utilization and really helping people to be analyzing some of the things that they would like to do. That is really coming to fruition.","And lastly, we are also seeing some very nice growth with Access Prepaid. So for instance, we talked to you last quarter or the quarter before about Qantas. Some of these deals that Access Prepaid are doing are actually going into the line item.","Darrin\u00a0Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital","All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask sort of a large \u2013 a broader strategic question on pricing. It seems like you had a little bit of tailwind this quarter that is lapping and sort of gone away next quarter it sounds like. So not much pricing for the rest of this year. But as you look out, and I know you\u2019re always opportunistic, but it seems like one of your largest competitors has been more drawing a line in the sand on pricing. And I was just wondering if that in anyway impacts your thinking and how you view pricing going forward relative to how you use pricing over the last four, five years? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Well, we have to look at pricing in isolation. Pricing has to be part of the business and we have to be sure in terms of the value that our products develop that we put the right kind of pricing in the market in order to make sure that people are using our products.","And from thereon, that is our pricing stats. And that has really not changed over the last few years I would say. So you see so for some years where we have fairly small pricing for some years, we have a little larger pricing. And I don\u2019t think from a strategic point of view, we have seen changes in the market that would lead us to believe that we are changing our thinking on that.","Ajay Banga","My view is \u2013 by the way just to be clear, the impact of pricing in the second quarter of this year. Yes, there as some impact leftover in the cross-border area, but if you look at our total revenue growth for the quarter, there was very little impact from pricing. Just to be clear. That is there in the first quarter, it was not there in the second quarter.","The second part of this is that if you look on our strategy on pricing. Our strategy on pricing is that we effectively look \u2013 there is so many lines of pricing in so many countries that people are always looking like Martina said for the opportunity at the right place where the value equation makes sense. I very consciously took pricing off the table as part of our guidance when I came, because I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the strategy for the company. The strategy for our company to grow our franchise and to grow our revenue, and keep taking some pricing benefits as they come.","And that\u2019s what we are doing. And could you talk about how our numbers are doing this quarter or last quarter vis-\u00e0-vis any other competitor. I don\u2019t even look at it as a traditional competitor. I look at our growth in the space of how much opportunity there is in our industry. And I think 13% revenue growth is a good place to be.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","I agree. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask about the commercial product. Ajay had alluded to the progress there in some of your prepared remarks. Two questions there. Do you believe you\u2019re taking market share in commercial? And secondly, is it biased more domestically versus internationally? Thank you.","Ajay Banga","Hi. So first, I am very glad you use the carefully word, prepared word, prepared. Barbara thinks I don\u2019t follow my prepared remarks and she was making jokes about it before we started the call about my ad living [ph]. So anyway I will remind her of that and I will ask her to talk to you in great detail.","Now, the actual commercial product thing. Yes, we are gaining share. We\u2019ve been gaining share for a few years now, two to three years. I actually think there is more opportunities up ahead. If we can keep executing on the hard work that our product teams have done to put together a value process that make sense, and there is more to be done in that space. We are really on a journey on this whole commercial space.","I don\u2019t believe MasterCard had adequately worked in this area five, seven years ago. So I think we\u2019re really getting to our right place there. Just [indiscernible], is it biased on the U.S.? Not really. Actually to make sure I answer the question correctly, we are growing in commercial around the world. The U.S. was the one that first jumped on to executing against the improved product quality and using all our tools like Smart Data and Virtual Cards and Purchasing Cards and all those pieces and they worked on it.","They now move overseas as well to other regions, but it started in the U.S. The commercial card tends to be used not just domestically but also cross-border, just by nature of the kind of the book it aims at. So it\u2019s got a mix of everything inside there.","James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co","Thank you. Good morning. I want to go back to maybe Martina for the pricing, just to clarify the impact in the quarter and going forward. And I realize I guess it was the 4 point benefit on the cross-border, which I guess was a little bit more than I would have thought, but I think more importantly just to sort of make sure we\u2019re on the same page for the back half. Are we fully anniversaried on the cross-border going into 3Q, and should the delta on volume and revenue growth would be something like maybe five points of overall revenue growth and volume growth going into the back half. Is that the right way to think about it?","Martina Hund-Mejean","So first of all, we had \u2013 yes, the pricing was pretty much in cross-border. I call it as the 4 PPT. That was much lower than what you saw in the first quarter. In the first quarter in that line item, it was actually 10 PPT. And yes, that is anniversarying in the third quarter. So you are not going to see that going forward. And then there was a little bit as I said from a transaction processing fee point of view, but when you look at the overall net revenues and you extrapolate those line items to overall net revenues, overall pricing in the quarter actually was a relatively small, very small contributor.","And how you should be thinking about that is, all of these thoughts that we have about pricing roll into what we are saying about 2014, what we see from a net revenue point of view, as well as roll into our long-term performance targets. That\u2019s where we are wrapping it into.","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co","Yes, I was thinking more about you\u2019ve had a delta on the volume and revenue growth negatively because of the strong intra-European volumes?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes. And you\u2019re going to continue to see that likely, just because when you see the growth of the intra versus the inter-regional volume developing. So Europeans, and the fact that was little bit even has changed when you look versus the year ago volume, Europeans are staying closer to home, both, it looks like from a pleasure point of view as well as from a business point of view.","And as long as they stay closer to home, our European cross-border transactions are priced lower than the inter-regional transactions. So that\u2019s where the mix is coming in, and the relative growth of inter-regional versus intra-European numbers impacting those mix. I don\u2019t see that changing for at least a number of quarters to come.","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co","Okay, thank you.","Ajay Banga","Let me answer this. It\u2019s just really interesting if you look beyond this a little bit and to understand what\u2019s going with the Europeans for example or other \u2013 if you look at all our data on which are the hottest travel places around the world, you\u2019ve got London, you\u2019ve got Bangkok, you\u2019ve got Paris and cities like that. If you look at that data, tourism into Southeast Asia has been impacted over the last six, eight months because you\u2019ve had some unrest in Thailand, you\u2019ve got problems in Vietnam with the Chinese situation. You\u2019ve got people canceling trips into that part of the world.","It\u2019s similar inside Russia for all the obvious reasons that we\u2019ve been talking about. So what\u2019s happening also I think in this last quarter or two, is that people are staying closer to where they are comfortable, and the Europeans in particular are relatively intrepid travelers outside. They have been \u2013 and they travel frequently. They take a few holidays a year, in case you sort of look at how many holidays the Europeans do get in their course of the year, they have cut back as Martina is laughing at me. She is half German, half French. So they take the most holidays in the world.","But the fact is that if you sort of look at what\u2019s going on there, there is a genuine difference right now in the way people are traveling. It just is \u2013 and that\u2019s an addition to what\u2019s going on with the China where you can see the impact of a change in policies and growth on the ground to what\u2019s happening to cross-border volume and trade outside of China. So this is something you\u2019ve seen.","Having said that, I think we have a pretty strong transaction growth rate in our cross-border, and we do a lot of work to make that happen, both from share, but also the kind of work we do with issuers and merchants to make that work in the right way.","Barbara Gasper","Christine, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Okay. Our last question is from Bob\u00a0Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob\u00a0Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Thank you. Good morning. Martina, did I hear you suggest a tax inversion, but my real question was\u2026","Martina Hund-Mejean","Not really, but we like to align our tax footprint to our business structure, given that most of our revenues and profits are still rolling up into the U.S. and into Belgium, which are high tax countries, but 60% of our business is really in many other jurisdictions.","Bob\u00a0Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Right, okay. But my real question was\u2026","Ajay Banga","No tax inversion.","Bob\u00a0Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Okay. With the changes in technology with the EMV, higher focus on security. Do you think that \u2013 has MasterCard benefited \u2013 do you think you\u2019re gaining some market share head-to-head when it comes down to bigger focus on technology?","Ajay Banga","I don\u2019t know. I do know that we\u2019ve put a lot of effort in the space on both innovation and technology. Look at MasterPass. I consider MasterPass to be the wallet part of it. There is more to come. As I said, it\u2019s an old platform. And the fact that we\u2019re live in more countries that we\u2019ve actually got tens of thousands of merchant signed up that we\u2019ve got some momentum on the ground in terms of MasterPass being both an online and in-app and a physical space play.","And the fact that it was designed in a way that allows banks and merchants to integrate very easily, much easier than many competing wallets. All of that\u2019s helping us when we go to sell. The focus on security is helping us when we go to sell. But I don\u2019t know that I could pick one of those and tell you that a client or merchant or a bank or a government is turning business to me just because of that.","I actually don\u2019t think that anybody thinks so single patterned way. It\u2019s always a very complicated discussion. It always has pricing built into it as you know, but also always has all these other aspects. And I think all I am trying to do in the company, what we are doing is to assemble a portfolio of assets there the security part, the EMV part, the innovation part, the loyalty and rewards, the processing. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing us invest in those areas. That\u2019s where our organic and inorganic money is going.","It\u2019s going into those very specific areas, because we think they help us build a portfolio to go top line [ph], and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.","Bob\u00a0Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Thank you.","Ajay Banga","That was it? Last question done. Back to me. Okay. Closing remarks I guess. So we delivered strong results for the first half of 2014 in spite of this mixed economic environment. And we are focused on delivering yet another good year. We have worked through the regulatory challenges in Russia and Europe. We\u2019ve got a track record of managing through these situations in other markets. Every situation is different, but we have managed our way. We feel confident we will be able to navigate our way through these most recent one results.","On the other side of this, we see many opportunities around the world that kind of provides some balances to these challenges we talk about. We\u2019re investing in new technologies I was just telling Bob, and other services, both organically and through acquisitions including our recent transactions in the loyalty, processing, person-to-person and mobile spaces.","As Martina mentioned, that pace of M&A activity has accelerated recently. There is a shortage of growth opportunities in our business frankly. And while our investments are having an impact on our OpEx right now, we believe that we are investing in a thoughtful way that ensures continued top line growth and good long-term return for all of you who invest in our stock.","I am hoping many of you will be able to join us at one of our Investor Days in September either in St. Louis or in Dublin, where you will have a chance to hear more about our strategic focus areas and you can get to touch and feel some of our innovative products and services.","Thank you for your continued support to the company.

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Barbara Gasper, head of investor relations. You may begin.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion about our third quarter 2013 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Ajay Banga, our president and chief executive officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our chief financial officer. ","Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session, and up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question.","This morning\u2019s earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. The earnings release includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. The release and the slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week through November 7.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filing.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to our chief executive officer, Ajay Banga. Ajay?","Ajay Banga","Thank you, Barbara, and good morning everybody. We are very pleased with our results this quarter. We\u2019ve had a net revenue growth of 16%, or 15% when adjusted for currency, and that\u2019s been driven by solid volume and transaction growth in every region around the world.","And I think that revenue growth allowed us to invest more back into the business, in areas such as digital products and the safety and security around them. We were able to make these additional investments while still delivering a net income growth of 14%, or 13% adjusted for currency, and an EPS growth of 18%, or 17% on an FX-adjusted basis. ","So let\u2019s start in our novel way by looking at the underlying economic trends, and you can start with the United States. Consumer spending was relatively flat from the second quarter better than expected growth. Our spending pulse data for the third quarter shows that U.S. retail sales growth ex-automobiles, is about 3.8%. Now, that\u2019s down just slightly from the 4% of the second quarter.","Over the last three or four months, we have seen a slow, steady decline in the confidence numbers, and that\u2019s probably the reason behind the slight deceleration of our spending pulse data. And of course the recent circumstances in Washington have contributed, I think, to a sharp decline in October\u2019s consumer confidence. ","What that means for consumer spending for the remainder of the year kind of remains to be seen as yet. The fact is that for us as a company, despite the relatively flat growth in overall consumer spending in the U.S., we saw an increase in our U.S. business in the third quarter where volume grew 9%, up from last quarter, driven by improvements in consumer credit.","In Europe, overall economic growth was subdued in the third quarter, and we expect it to remain that way through the end of the year. But European consumer confidence continued the recovery that it started in the second quarter, and it\u2019s now back up to the 2010 levels. ","Business sentiment has also improved over the quarter across major European markets like Germany, France, the U.K., and even Italy. And the combination of an improved environment in some markets, along with the continued secular shift, and most importantly our business wins, have driven third quarter volume growth up 17%, up from 14% last quarter, with Poland, Russia, Sweden as some of the key contributors to those numbers.","Now, looking elsewhere in the world, in Asia consumer spending in the third quarter increased in key markets. Consumer confidence levels have remained by and large steady across the region. However, business sentiment continues to be mixed, because of lingering concerns about the global economy. ","Our business in this region continues to do well. We had strong volume growth of 22%, up from the 21% that we showed last quarter. In Latin America, consumer confidence in Brazil improved, but Mexico edged down slightly in September and across the region forecasts for the remainder of the year seem to indicate that GDP growth rate will probably remain sluggish. Our business in the region continues at a healthy pace. We had a 17% growth this quarter, similar to our growth rate over the last quarter. ","So, overall, you step back from all of this and it feels like the underlying global economy is showing the right trends to get back onto a more solid footing. What we then need to see a more balanced and practical approach on the part of the political leadership to allow those underlying improving economic trends to take hold and bear fruit.","Before moving on to business highlights, I\u2019d like to say a few words on where things currently stand on the legal and regulatory front. First, on the U.S. merchant litigation, nothing new to report. Judge Gleeson held the final settlement approval hearing, as you know, on September 12. We\u2019re all awaiting his ruling, which is expected sometime later this year.","On the debit front, as you know the Federal Reserve appealed the district court\u2019s July decision. The judge issued a stay of the existing rules pending the outcome of an expedited appeal and the Fed recently filed a brief presenting their arguments in response to the judge\u2019s decision. The Appeals Court probably will issue their ruling sometime in 2014.","The European Commission\u2019s proposed legislation is the third one. Both the European parliament and the Council of Ministers need to review, potentially amend, and finally [draft] on the commissioners\u2019 final proposal. The parliament has begun the process, and though it\u2019s still early days, they have now appointed what they call a rapporteur, who has the responsibility for both drafting and then shepherding the legislation through their parliamentary process.","He has announced a draft timeline that includes a session on November 5 to officially kick it off. He will also be meeting with us next week. The commission has indicated they would like the proposal to be adopted before parliament goes into recess in the spring. As we have said before, that timeline appears ambitious in light of what needs to be accomplished before [work] can actually be taken in the European parliament.","So now let\u2019s move on to some of our recent business activities. You heard enough from us at investor day relatively recently in September. You had an opportunity to see firsthand a number of the product innovations we were rolling out, from our simplified commerce acceptance solutions, to social benefit programs, to shop [unintelligible] and so I\u2019m not going to go into all that, but I\u2019m going to talk about a couple of different items.","And the first one is that last quarter there were several new partnerships established with U.S. merchants. In addition to the agreement with Virgin Atlantic, that Chris [unintelligible] probably mentioned, I think, on investor day, we have now signed three more new credit program relationships and partnerships with Hawaiian Airlines being the largest of those three. ","The second big area of focus for us, and frankly it\u2019s true of everybody in the payments industry as you heard on the Visa call yesterday, is safety and security, the importance of which is second to none as our physical digital worlds converge. ","Historically, how this has worked is that when you develop industry standards and specs, we did it with traditional payment partners - banks, other networks. Today, we are working with those also, but with a broader group as well that includes technology companies and merchants. The idea is that by expanding this participation, we\u2019ll get to create better consumer, better merchant experiences, and at the same time ensure safer and more secure transactions.","And the drive to continually upgrade to newer technology is going to mean that all of us have to ensure that payment security standards adapt more quickly to changing consumer and merchant needs than they have in the past. ","So one interesting new development in that area is tokenization, and as you know, earlier this month we, along with Visa and American Express, proposed global standards to replace these traditional account numbers with digital tokens for online and mobile transactions. ","What that ensures is that the cardholder\u2019s bank has access to their card information and only the cardholder\u2019s bank has that access. It eases the merchant\u2019s requirement of having to keep that specific card information secure. What the merchant sees is a token. We can connect that token back to that specific information with the bank.","Work is being done in collaboration with issuers as well as other industry stakeholders, and the idea generally is, all of us, to improve cardholder security, reduce the impact of fraud, and yes, provide a good consumer and merchant experience.","So in addition to that, we\u2019ve joined the board of Fast Identity Online Alliance, an industry consortium. Members there include Google and Paypal. The consortium promotes standards in support of authentication technologies such as biometrics. And you\u2019ve heard us talk about biometrics a number of times, but along with existing solutions like chip cards and NFC, I think doing this will help us to ensure that the development of standards that happens, which everybody can innovate in, is in an environment that is safer and more secure for online commerce. ","But supporting safer and more secure transactions is more than just creating new standards. It could also deal with platforms, such as what we are doing through our DataCash business to provide a more secure environment for ecommerce merchants. For example, in Brazil - Brazil is one of the largest and fastest-growing ecommerce markets in the world - we announced a new partnership last year with DataCash and ReadyCARD, one of Brazil\u2019s largest [acquirers].","As a result of the partnership, ReadyCARD recently launched an ecommerce gateway with fraud and risk management services. They\u2019re the only ones, by the way, in the Brazilian market to offer payment processing and fraud tools together in one place, making it much simpler for merchants to accept cards without the need to sign up with multiple vendors for these different needs of theirs.","Finally, on this topic, security can also be about using our technology, our data, and the expertise around it to provide services that have [reduced the cost] to our customers in ways they sometimes cannot do themselves. Let me give you an example. We used our global network and data analytics and leveraged it, and we\u2019re helping our customers right now by monitoring inter-regional activities on all of our cards in over 150 countries and at more than a million ATMs around the world.","What that allows us to do is it gives us a chance to provide better insight to our issuers about potential fraud threats that go well beyond what they can see themselves, just through their own card activity. So we introduced what\u2019s called Fraud Rule Manager at ATMs in April, and this resulted in significant reductions in inter-regional ATM fraud on Maestro cards and that reduction is up to 70% in some regions.","Now, in the context of overall ATM volume, fraud is small, but that\u2019s not the point I\u2019m trying to make. I\u2019m trying to make the point that the level of improvement, up to 70%, represents a powerful example of what we can do with data and technology.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for a conversation on our financial results and operational metrics. ","Martina Hund-Mejean ","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone. Let me begin on page three of our slide deck, where you see that this quarter the difference between as reported and FX-adjusted growth rates is 1 percentage point for each line item. All of my comments today will pertain to the FX-adjusted growth rates.","To reiterate what Ajay said, we continue to be pleased with our performance. Even with the relatively difficult environment, we\u2019re able to make progress on the conversion from cash to electronic forms of payment and win business around the world.","Net revenue grew 15%, which, combined with operating expense growth of 13%, resulted in net income growth of 13%. EPS growth was 17%, benefitting from our share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we purchased almost 575,000 shares of class A common stock at a cost of approximately $345 million, with $925 million remaining under our current authorization. ","We did not repurchase any additional shares in October, given the parameters of the 10b5-1 plan that we set a couple of months ago. Our strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.","Cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and other liquid investments of about $6 billion.","So let me now turn to page four, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 15% on a local currency basis to over $1 trillion. U.S. GDV grew 9%, with credit volumes growing 7%. U.S. commercial credit growth was in the mid-teens, higher than last quarter, and U.S. consumer credit growth was positive, and a continued improvement over prior quarters.","Our U.S. debit growth was 11%, driven by growth from consumer, commercial debit, and prepaid programs. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 18% on a local currency basis and this continued to be driven by APMEA, with a 22% growth rate and solid 17% growth in both Europe and Latin America. Cross-border volume grew 19% on a local currency basis, including more than 25% in Latin America and APMEA, and growth in the high teens in Europe.","Turning to page five, here you see process transactions grew 16% globally to more than $10 billion for the first time. In the U.S., we saw good growth due to increases in debit and credit card transactions. And outside the U.S., process transactions grew 23%. We saw increased growth from the second quarter in all regions, with particular strength in Europe, driven by our business wins in Sweden and continued good growth in Russia and Poland.","And globally, the number of cards grew 8% to almost $2 billion, Mastercard and Maestro branded cards.","Now let\u2019s turn to page six, for some insights on our revenue. Within our net revenue growth of 15%, growth revenue grew 13%, in line with volume and transaction drivers, along with some contribution from pricing. Rebates and incentives increased by 8%. As I said last quarter, the rebates and incentive line can move around on a quarter to quarter basis. ","Similar to what we saw last quarter, there were a couple of factors impacting the growth rate in the quarter. First, while we signed a significant number of contracts during the quarter, there were a few that we now expect to sign in the fourth quarter instead of the third quarter. And second, we have a couple of contracts that paid out at a lower level of incentives than in the past, very similar to last quarter.","Similar to the prior quarters, growth in domestic assessment was again driven by strong growth outside of the U.S. A lot of this growth is coming from the work we are doing in places like Russia and South Africa around financial inclusion. These countries will initially produce lower using transactions as people first use the cards at ATMs before beginning to use them at merchants.","And just one last note on revenue. Excluding pricing, cross-border revenue growth was 9%. The resulting gap between the cross-border volume and revenue growth numbers is mainly due to the higher mix of inter-Europe activity.","So let me move to page seven, where you can see that total operating expenses were up 13% in the quarter, growing significantly higher than in recent quarters. First, given the revenue growth that we saw in the third quarter, we took the opportunity to increase our advertising and marketing. As a result, you can see that this line item is up by 16%, mainly due to higher media spend. And second, the 13% increase in G&A expenses continued to be primarily driven by investments related to all aspects of our growth strategy. ","Turning to slide eight, let\u2019s discuss what we\u2019ve seen in October through this past Monday. Each of our business drivers is slightly lower in this period compared to the third quarter, but when we adjust for the extra processing day that we had in the third quarter of this year versus last year, the growth rates are actually very similar. For our processed volume and transaction metrics only, that extra processing day provided a tailwind of about 1 to 2 percentage points to our growth in Q3. ","So here are the numbers through October 28. Globally, our cross-border volumes grew about 18%. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 9%. Processed volumes growth outside of the U.S. grew 16%, and in particular, since I know you\u2019re all very interested in that, our European processed volume growth continued in the teens, the range that we have seen throughout 2013. And globally, processed transaction growth was 14%.","Looking forward, let\u2019s start with our long term performance objectives for the 2013 to 2015 period, which has not changed. We remain confident that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR, which still includes a modest contribution from pricing over the three-year period, and at least a 20% EPS CAGR. These growth rates are on a constant currency basis and exclude any new acquisitions. We also remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. ","Now I\u2019d like to share with you some thoughts about the rest of 2013, which is slightly improved versus what we said at our September investor day. Given our continued stronger than expected net revenue growth and the level of rebates and incentives we expect for the balance of the year, we now believe that second half net revenue growth will be slightly better than the 12% growth rate that we produced in the first half. This includes an assumption of a significantly higher growth rate in rebates and incentives in the fourth quarter versus what we have seen to date this year, at least in the mid to high teens range.","We now anticipate total 2013 operating expenses to grow a bit more than the 8% currency adjusted growth rate we had in 2012, as we are able to put a little more into A&M than we planned and our G&A growth has proven to be more back end loaded than we originally expected. ","Even with this high expense level, we still expect to deliver some operating margin expansion in 2013. And for your modeling purposes, we continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 31%.","So with respect to FX, if rates remain similar to where we are today, that is, the euro trading at the $1.37 level and the Brazilian real at the $2.19 level for the remainder of the year, the net impact of the euro and the real would be a slight tailwind for the full year of 2013.","Now let me turn the call back to begin the Q&A session. Barbara? ","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Martina. We\u2019re now ready to begin the question and answer period. And in order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And our first question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead. ","Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus ","I wasn\u2019t quite sure what you said about cross-border. I think you said revenue growth without pricing was only 9% compared to almost 20% transaction growth? Is that correct, Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean ","That is absolutely correct, and you know, this is exactly the trend that we have seen in prior quarters. And this quarter was a bit more pronounced, because actually our inter-European cross-border activity grew fairly large versus the rest of the cross-border activity, as well as when you have the appreciation of the euro factored in, you see that the gap is widening.","Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus ","And so my other question on the same topic was can you give us any more color around, the cross-border volume trend, almost 20% growth, is phenomenal. Is most of that sequential increase Europe?","Martina Hund-Mejean ","You mean on domestic assessment?","Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus ","No, still on cross-border transactions.","Martina Hund-Mejean ","No, our regions contributed in a very significant way to the cross-border volumes, but when you just look at inter-European volume, just from a pure dollar point of view, it is larger than what you have in general across the world.","","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies","Just a question on a couple of metrics. Can you just go into a little more detail on the U.S. credit side of the story? Because it was obviously great to see the acceleration there. I know you mentioned both commercial and consumer accelerated, but maybe you can parse that a little further, which accelerated more, or kind of where are you running more precisely on U.S. consumer? And then can you just clarify if the process transaction growth actually accelerated in the month of September? Because it looked like the full quarter number was quite a bit better than the July\/August in the quarter update. ","Ajay Banga ","On the first part, part about U.S. credit, the commercial credit of course picked up well, but the good news is that even in consumer credit we saw continued positive improvement. In fact, last quarter we told you that our U.S. consumer credit was actually a very small growth rate third quarter, better than that. I\u2019m actually not going to give you the exact number, but it\u2019s headed in the right direction. It\u2019s not where I\u2019d like it to be, but it\u2019s headed in the right direction. ","On investor day, we told you we\u2019d won more than 60% of the [total] brand that have been up for bid in the U.S. over the past 12 months. We haven\u2019t lost any where we were the incumbent. That remains the case. In fact, we got a few extra, as I just announced as well. So we\u2019re kind of working on that. ","It\u2019s just going to be, as I said, a bunch of doubles and singles and stolen bases - quite appropriate for yesterday\u2019s World Series game, although Chris [unintelligible] is probably a happy boy given that his team won. But there\u2019s a bunch of doubles and singles and stolen bases to get our share back to where it should be for a company of our type. We have in the past lost share in that space, and I have said so, but we\u2019re making progress. And that\u2019s what\u2019s giving us our numbers here. ","Commercial credit just continues to do well, and that\u2019s just the steady, steady growth rate in what we are doing in driving our acceptance advantage, our capabilities with smart data, we\u2019ve put people on the street that actually go sell this product with our issuers to different corporate clients as well as small businesses and it\u2019s beginning to show the results of the effort.","Martina Hund-Mejean ","And with respect to your second question, actually when you look at July, August, and September data processed transactions grew fairly similar. There was a little bit of an up one, down one point, but it was very similar to the whole quarter and is very similar to what we\u2019re actually seeing in October. And this is in both the United States as well as outside of the United States we are seeing these kinds of improvements over last quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW "," ","Question for Martina. I guess when I look at the domestic assessment yield, that\u2019s been coming down quite a bit over the last couple of years, and I was just wondering at what point it might stabilize given the fact that you are seeing credit kind of pick up, and I guess the mix shift\u2019s kind of played out a little bit?","Martina Hund-Mejean ","It\u2019s a good question, but you know, we are doing the significant work around the globe, in particular in countries that have a lot of work to be happening on the financial inclusion side. And when you look at these countries, South Africa, Nigeria, or even when you go back into Russia, you know how this starts first. If you\u2019re going to put the cards out to people first, they\u2019re going to get used to how to use these cards, which will be at ATMs, and that\u2019s where you are seeing a little bit of a lower yield coming in for ATM transactions. ","And then we\u2019re working on the infrastructure for those consumers to be able to use the cards at merchants, which at that point in time you\u2019re starting to see some different pricing for those kind of transactions. So it\u2019s an evolution. And by the way, if we are doing our job correctly, that means expanding in those countries in a significant way, we should continue to be seeing some of these factors coming through over time and not stopping. ","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Can you talk about how much of the strength that you saw in your U.S. credit volume growth rate was driven by the success that you\u2019re having in the co-brand space, specifically? And how does the pipeline look for potential new co-brand wins? Has that dimmed given all the wins you\u2019ve had recently, or do you still see room for growth, specifically in co-brand?","Ajay Banga ","The room for growth definitely. The co-brand business is a relatively large business in the U.S., and there\u2019s a constant cycle of brands that come up for renewal. And we\u2019re in strong and continuous dialog as are all our competitors in the space, with a very large number of merchants, as well as airlines, hotels, and banks. So I think there\u2019s a long runway here for growth and possibility.","I\u2019m not going to give you specific numbers on the growth specifically from the wins we had, versus what came out of a general improvement in some of the underlying mix of our portfolios versus that of our consumers, versus what came out from consumers going back to credit. Those three are the big factors, and I\u2019m not going to give you specifics on that, but all three played a role. ","Some of our stronger issuers have had better sales volume growth recovering over a period of time. We have seen the consumer using credit a little more than they used to, although debit is still clearly growing very handsomely as we\u2019ve stated. But we\u2019ve also seen the results of our first efforts in our co-brands as those cards are getting replaced and changed, that their volumes are coming through. I would tell you that those volumes are smaller than the impact of the first two topics, just because it takes time after you win a deal to convert the cards onto our brand.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. ","Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research","Martina, just a quick question. Would you say a greater portion of the investments you made this quarter are related to initiatives that you expect to drive revenue growth by 2015, within your financial goals period? Or were they more heavily weighted to longer-term type return projects that are more in their infancy right now? ","Martina Hund-Mejean ","It\u2019s really a mixture. As you know, we always look at investments that in the short term bucket, which means that they\u2019re really returning over the next 12 to 18 months a return; the medium term bucket, which is more like a 3 to 4 year timeframe; and the longer-term bucket, which is kind of the 5-plus return. And so there are a number of things in there, as we did, but of course when you see all of the comments that we made about digital convergence and all the investments that have to go in there from a security and safety point of view, how you put the product together from a consumer merchant experience, we do have of course some investments going in there, and we\u2019ll see how that\u2019s going to play out for the future.","Ajay Banga ","Things like tokenization will probably only pay back in terms of better consumer experience and better fraud control out there in some period. When it\u2019s things like simplified commerce, if it gets picked up well in the marketplace, which we are very hopeful of, then you would find that to be a more interesting item closer in this period. ","So it\u2019s actually a mixed bag of stuff, but that\u2019s not just this quarter. What\u2019s going on on our G&A line is the results of continued and sustained investments organically and some inorganically which become organic in our base, as we said, after a period of time. So Access Prepaid is now in our base. The money we put into expanding the capabilities of Access Prepaid show up in our G&A line, whereas if you were to buy, once we conclude the acquisition of Provus, that\u2019s going to show up for a while as separate from being in our base. ","So it\u2019s actually a very complicated question to answer, but the way we manage this inside the company is we look at our strategy, which we lay out for you on investor day, we make sure that we\u2019ve got adequate resources going towards the basic elements in that strategy of new merchants, new consumers, digital physical convergence, and all the [space] for the safety and security, and then we put a certain amount of energy into more short term kinds of growth rate and revenue. So it\u2019s a mixed bag. ","Operator","Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Could you size for us your European debit processing pipeline, and in particular are there any large transactions that we might see on the horizon?","Ajay Banga ","So I guess you\u2019re talking about the whole stuff in SEPA, right, what goes on there? The fact is that we\u2019re now seeing domestic volumes in virtually every one of the SEPA countries. And as you know, a few years back we only saw cross-border. ","So in this third quarter, the processing of domestic Maestro transactions increased by 19% in the SEPA region. We\u2019ve grown in the Netherlands, we\u2019ve had very attractive percentages of growth in Austria and Belgium, but also lower pace. The Netherlands is actually the much higher base, as you\u2019ll remember from all the work we did. ","So we are kind of moving along in that range, and we\u2019re going to keep, I think, getting breakthroughs in a number of countries in this space. Acquisitions of things like Provus actually could be helpful in driving this number, as is all the work that we have done with a similar company that we built up in Poland over the last four or five years. And those are the kinds of things that we\u2019re trying to do to get to a better place in those domestic transactions. ","Martina Hund-Mejean ","And one other region that you\u2019re really going to see in our numbers, as we already said, is really the Nordics, and in particular Sweden. And that is on the debit [but for year 2].","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Please go ahead. ","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Regarding the cross-border volume growth, it really is separating itself from your largest competitor. The 13 consecutive wins you\u2019ve had in China and the fact that that\u2019s only cross-border, is that a major contributor to that separation? I obviously understand the inter-Europe discussion. And also, is the recent revelation regarding the NSA impacting any of your discussions with issuers around the globe?","Ajay Banga ","There\u2019s no doubt that China, as you know, is a pretty attractive cross-border spending market. Every country around the world is targeting Chinese tourists. And so that\u2019s a pretty obvious one. We have benefited certainly from that, but you know, in the context of our overall numbers, ","I don\u2019t want to overstate the importance of China to our total numbers. We\u2019ve got very good cross-border volume growth in every region, and so China contributes to the Asian growth in terms of cross-border, but there\u2019s a lot of other countries in Asia that are driving very attractive cross-border. I mean, countries like Australia and New Zealand are outstanding in cross-border volume growth. Countries across ASEAN are giving us good benefits. When you come to Latin America, you\u2019ve got growth. You go to Europe\u2026 So it\u2019s a mixed bag. I\u2019d be careful to overstate the importance of one country. ","But I love the position we\u2019re in in China in terms of winning those co-brands, and we\u2019re still winning some, despite all the changes that are going on with the WTO ruling in China, which as you know is still not completely clear where that\u2019s going, but we\u2019re still winning some brands there.","The NSA discussion is a much deeper discussion, way beyond just us, but you know, right now we\u2019re not having a direct situation with any issuers in countries overseas that impact us. I think the longer, bigger term issue for a lot of global companies is that if the fears about privacy go to a point where people would attempt to find ways to have more localization, then that certainly impacts the way that you construct your business model over time.","Now, we\u2019re a little more fortunate than some of our competitors in that when Bob Selander built the technology system in our company, he built it in a distributed way, so more than 80% of our transactions in any country are approved at local servers in that country, installed by us, called MIPs. And I have no idea what the damned thing stands for, it\u2019s Mastercard something. But they are black boxes lying in different banks and retailers. I\u2019ve been told the name and what it stands for regularly. I keep forgetting it. So basically a black box with blinking lights that helps you to clear transactions locally. ","And we download an intelligence logic into that regulatory over the course of a day that enables us to say card number so and so tends to behave like this, and therefore transactions that come in of that type get approved locally, on soil, on the ground, in that country. Very few transactions actually come back to St. Louis in our case, for being diagnosed and approved. And during the time that we had, for example, an undersea cable break between Taiwan and the U.S., we were able to dial that 80% to 100%. So our continuity of business is also better than a number of our competitors.","So, you know, we\u2019re using all those discussions as we\u2019re out there overseas, but you know that nationalistic tendencies are a tendency not just in our industry but in a number of industries. So the NSA is just one small pimple on a dimple on the ant\u2019s left cheek on that issue.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets ","I have a broad-based question. You know, both yourselves and Visa have put forth in prepared remarks on a call the safety and the security and the integrity of the network. And I\u2019m just wondering, is this approach, you know, for your token agenda? Or is there something else that\u2019s happened over the course of the past year where the technology players have come in, they\u2019ve seen how difficult it is. You guys act as the grownup in the room, and so they\u2019re kind of gravitating back towards the security of the network? If you could just elaborate on that I\u2019d appreciate it.","Ajay Banga ","The timing of the fact that Visa has this in yesterday\u2019s call and the fact that we\u2019re talking about it today is just crazy coincidence. And I don\u2019t even know, I think I should give Charlie a call after this and say was he prescient or what? But I have no idea. [unintelligible] The fact is that tokenization happened in this quarter. ","And to us, tokenization is a material change and move forward in the way that we believe as an industry, not just Visa, us, and Amex, who put this out together, but even the issuing community, with whom we\u2019ve been in very good dialog, who frankly are very interested in this themselves. ","The idea is to find a way, as you can clearly guess, to protect the weakest link in the security chain, which is the smaller merchant, who you cannot expect them to be spending the same kind of money as we would on data encryption, both at storage and in motion, on the managing of that data and so on. ","So we\u2019re trying to, as an industry, find a responsible way to help control that while at the same time allow for what I believe in the digital world will be the holy grail, which is the least friction, from a consumer\u2019s point of view, in how to execute a transaction. You know, Millennials these days don\u2019t like friction in hunting and shopping. And it\u2019s just a very important part of what we\u2019re trying to go at. ","So we talked about safety and security because of the tokenization event this quarter. I would otherwise have chosen a different topic. I\u2019m trying to pick one topic of interest every quarter to you guys, and talk about that in some depth. And then [unintelligible] other topics, and I\u2019ll start again, but that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m trying to do. And safety and security happened to be the one for this quarter.","Now, the aspect of, our networks have great barriers of safety and security in terms of what we\u2019ve built and invested over a long period of time, and there are a lot of other who\u2019ve said they could just do this business, realized that being in the payments business is more than having a network of some type that exchanges data. Yet absolutely for three or four years now, we\u2019ve been talking to mobile network operators, we\u2019ve been talking to banks, we have talked to merchants, we have talked to others, and said what we bring to the table are our assets, one of which is the safety, security, and reliability of our network. ","Because we\u2019ve got other assets too, like the one I just described about how 80% of our transactions are approved locally. And so some of our assets are common across the industry, some of our assets are differentiated for us compared to others, and we are certainly using all of them in our conversations. ","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer ","I guess from your comments, Martina, sort of talking about the extra processing day in the quarter, I just want to be real clear, because obviously it was a topic of conversation last night on Visa\u2019s call. But did you see any slowdown in volume trends toward the end of the quarter and through October? It doesn\u2019t sound like it, but want to be clear on that.","And then maybe you could just help us parse the acceleration in the European volume trends with some particulars on the Eastern Europe part of the business. How fast did that grow and what\u2019s the portion of the European pie from Eastern and Central Europe at this point? ","Martina Hund-Mejean ","First of all, for the first question, yes there was, as I said, an extra processing day in the first quarter, but when I look at July, August, and September, other than what we saw from an oil price impact in the United States, we really haven\u2019t seen any significant impact from a change in the growth rates. It was relatively even. ","You know, you could see in September just being a tad lower, but then you see it quite coming up in October again. So truly, even when you adjust for the processing day, there wasn\u2019t really impact on that. And then when you compare the third quarter versus October, just to get a sense of how the fourth quarter is starting, again, very, very similar growth rates, if you compare like for like. ","So on your second question, on the detail of growth in Eastern Europe, you know, Eastern Europe for us, because this is part of our European region, includes a lot of very high growth markets such as Russia, Poland, a number of other countries that are sitting in Eastern Europe. ","And a lot of things that are driving there is that you have a lot of uses of cash, like [unintelligible] frankly, and they\u2019re putting all of those cards out in the market, and people are getting more used to be using cards rather than cash, from a security point of view, from a convenience point of view, from an ease point of view, etc. ","And that is really what\u2019s driving our growth and we really have not seen any letting up in those kinds of countries, from a growth perspective, and as long as we continue to do our work there, you should see quite a bit of contribution from that secular trend coming. ","The economic environment is, you know, depending how it is. You guys know that we have three influences of growth, one is the economic environment, the second is the secular trends, and the third is obviously market share. But you know, we [unintelligible] the last two things, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in particular in that region. ","Ajay Banga ","You know, we are really trying very hard to influence the second one, which is the secular trend, compared to just waiting for this to happen due to population changes or urban demographics or middle class demographics and so on. ","That\u2019s why the financial inclusion angle is such an important part of what we\u2019re doing, and why we\u2019re spending so much time, effort, and energy on it. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to influence there. The share, yes, that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for, and fortunately we\u2019re doing okay there. It\u2019s the economic trends that we don\u2019t control. But yes, Eastern European countries are growing for all those reasons. ","Somebody just emailed me with what MIPs stands for. So, Mastercard Integrated Processing Systems. And let it be known that I now know what it is. [laughter] ","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","I was just thinking about rebates and incentives in the industry. I know Visa yesterday highlighted a pickup for their fiscal year \u201914 in rebates and incentives. Your rebates and incentives growth rate for the first three quarters has been pretty modest. You talk about a little bit of a pickup in the fourth quarter, but I guess the overriding question is, are you seeing a pickup in rebate in incentives in the industry? Because one of your comments was that you thought rebates and incentives were lower in some contracts than in the past. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile all these comments.","Martina Hund-Mejean ","First of all, I don\u2019t expect significant change from a rebates and incentives line point of view, when I look over the last three years, and when I look in the future. By the way, all my comments on rebates and incentives are always included when I talk about our net revenues, right? We don\u2019t really talk about growth and rebates in the sense that we talk about net revenues. So I don\u2019t see any major change. ","We just had an interesting development here for the last couple of quarters in this year, which is that we had a couple of contracts where customers did not perform to what the performance hurdles were in the contract, and therefore we didn\u2019t pay out the level of incentives that were agreed as part of the contract. That was really what was driving it. When you pull that apart, our rebates and incentives line is really going back to the kind of growth rates that we had produced over the last three years. ","And that\u2019s what I have said now about the fourth quarter. We\u2019re going right back to the kind of growth rates on rebates and incentives as what we have seen in the past. So no different. ","Ajay Banga ","So really it\u2019s an in and out issue. Those couple of clients that we\u2019ve had this conversation with about performance versus contract have made adequate difference with total numbers, as you are seeing this change. ","You shouldn\u2019t expect that that should be something which persists in the future, because the fact of what Martina is saying is that the underlying conversations, the underlying deals being signed, the kind of rebates that go into them, the construct of them may change from client to client. Some may be constructed one way, some the other way, but basically they\u2019re there and going on. ","And then the other big aspect of rebates and incentives, the damned thing is lumpy. You go sign a couple of big new deals, and they\u2019re lumpy. You will get things come in that quarter which may not be quite what we expected. It is a challenge with that line in our P&L.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead. ","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","Just a follow up or maybe a point of clarification on tokenization. I understand the rationale on it. It makes perfect sense to me, and [unintelligible] friction is an important topic in payments and P2P and other areas. ","I can\u2019t help but think a little bit in the back of my mind that tokenization also offers kind of a very convenient Trojan Horse by which the established networks can perhaps smooth the path for payments and increased security on traditional card-based payments and simultaneously, potentially throw up a roadblock to some of the disruptors who might not be able to accommodate the tokenization technology that\u2019s being advanced by the established participants. Am I way off in left field somewhere? ","Ajay Banga ","You have more devious mind than I do. [laughter] I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s a very simple issue. If you go back to the days of introducing standards and mandates around requiring a certain level of payment system integrity in the industry, which we put out, the idea was to enable issuers and merchants - and not only enable, but ask them to raise their thinking, their quality, and their capability in that space - so we could help provide protection for consumer data. That\u2019s where this is coming from.","And it\u2019s worked in some ways because a number of people have raised their bar. But frankly, it hasn\u2019t worked in others, because smaller merchants, smaller banks, smaller acquirers, are always going to find it more difficult to keep pace with what is a very well-funded industry, which is aiming at fraud. ","The digital world, the onset of a digital physical converging world, creates a whole new challenge in that space in terms of the number of different players and the way data moves around among those players. All we are trying to do is to find a way to use our capacity and our capability as banks and networks to provide a protection filter in this process. ","Now, if you take back [unintelligible], which we bought years ago, and had the ability to create virtual card numbers, or the virtual card number facility that [unintelligible] used to offer when I was still working there, for you to be able to purchase things online by using a different card number, these are all elements of tokenization, the early elements.","What you\u2019re seeing us do now is a systemic methodological process-driven getting at tokenization, where not only will you get your current payment instrument - be it a card or your account, or a fingerprint that\u2019s connected to your card, or whatever the heck it is, some account number in the sky - will remain in the sky protected, and the data that will flow out will flow out differently to different mobile devices that you choose to interact with.","So not only will your number never reach the last point in the chain, it could also reach differently for each device you work with. And therefore, it gives me yet another methodology of preventing people from using numbers on the wrong device, which you haven\u2019t registered your original account with. And so on and so forth. So it\u2019s actually planning for tomorrow\u2019s world of digitization rather than the current world of digitization.","So what we\u2019re trying to do is to create these industry standards. There\u2019s going to be a ton of open APIs and the like that we are working with. You look at MasterPass, it\u2019s full of open APIs. The idea is to allow players in the industry to get our standard as a fundamental system and then innovate on top of it, no differently, by the way, from what a lot of people do in Silicon Valley. You create a standard, and you allow people to innovate on it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. It\u2019s quite the opposite of what you\u2019re thinking.","Operator","Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Darrin Peller - Barclays","I just want to touch on the other revenue line. It increased by a little more than what we expected, and I think last quarter there were certain fees in there, the staged wallet fee and I think the acquirer fee, or one of the acquirer fees, also that anniversaried. So I might have expected that growth rate to be a little bit lower this quarter. Can you just give us a sense of what\u2019s driving that segment or that line?","Martina Hund-Mejean ","From an other revenue point of view, you should continue to see some of the things that are not really related to our volume based business and our transactions based business going into here. So, for instance, some of the acquisitions have been made from an Access Prepaid point of view, from a DataCash point of view, etc., you would be seeing increases there. Pricing actually had a very, very little impact on this, but over time you should be seeing this number going up from a growth perspective.","Ajay Banga ","Advisors revenue also comes in here.","Martina Hund-Mejean ","We have a number of information services we have in there, so we have a number of other things in there.","Darrin Peller - Barclays ","So overall that line could be growing at a faster than corporate pace?","Martina Hund-Mejean ","It depends. It depends how these businesses are basically developing and the care and the feed that we put into these businesses. They\u2019re more of our newer businesses. But you know, all of that is pretty much included in our net revenue performance objectives target for the next three years.","Ajay Banga ","For sure, if we can build our data analytics business the right way, that\u2019s one of the items in other areas, and that should get a better percentage growth rate than the traditional transaction based business, in the beginning at least. When it becomes a certain size and scale - it\u2019s getting to a decrease number these days\u2026 And so it\u2019s all there. This is all behind that other revenue line.","","Martina Hund-Mejean ","Other income expenses, we have been saying for a number of quarters now that you should really expect that line to be trending into negative territory, because really we have some of our joint venture activity in the investments that we make in those joint ventures, one of which is, for instance, the Telefonica JV that we have in Latin America, the two of them that we have. ","So you should be seeing that line trending down over time into negative territory until we obviously get the return of the investment. However, that trend has been masked this quarter. We had a couple of items in there that basically increased this line item, and you saw it in positive territory. There were really two things. One, we had some gains on some bonds that we sold. So on the investment side. And two, we actually had some reversal of interest related to our FIN48. So this was our tax reserve accruals that we do from time to time. ","But other than that, when you pull those items out, you really should, again, see that line item trending down.","","Operator","Our next question is from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. ","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research","Could you give us a little more color on what you\u2019re spending incrementally in advertising and marketing? Where are you finding opportunities? What are you doing differently?","Ajay Banga ","Actually, in addition to the [unintelligible] we\u2019re doing a lot of things around changing the way our money is spent. So a fair amount of money has gone into activation-oriented spending. That\u2019s why the Priceless Cities campaign started. We\u2019re now in 26-plus cities and headed for more. ","That costs us some money to create both the asset base in those cities but also the actual marketing locally in those cities. And we keep building the asset base, so as I get an opportunity, I\u2019ll spend some money and put another city on the map, on the Priceless Cities area. That\u2019s one kind of thing.","Another one is we\u2019re changing the way we spend our money with sponsorships. And so earlier we would pay a lot of that money to the organization that facilitated the sponsorship. We\u2019ve kind of changed that to [unintelligible] spend the money on activation in that location. ","So if you were watching the Red Sox game over the last two days with the Cardinals, you would have seen Stand Up to Cancer coming up with us a couple of times in there. That\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019re trying to do. We\u2019re trying to get exposure and benefits of that exposure through partnering with the right kind of elements and partners. ","And then we\u2019re doing some money on traditional media advertising. You probably saw some advertising on our Acceptance Matters campaign, because we believe we have a competitive advantage there over other players in the commercial and [unintelligible] card space. So these are very targeted. They\u2019re all under the Priceless umbrella, but executed based on opportunities we see at that time.","Operator","Our last question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Just on G&A, it was up a little bit. How much of that was driven by headcount? Martina, just trying to gauge how sustainable that level is. And then just as a follow up, just thinking about M&A, I know you talked about that a little bit at the investor meeting, looking at Paypal buying Braintree. Does Mastercard need to own a gateway in the U.S.? I\u2019ve been thinking about that topic a lot, thought I\u2019d ask you on the call.","Martina Hund-Mejean ","I\u2019ll take the first question on G&A. So when you actually look, you know that most of our G&A numbers really are related to investments in people. I mean, when you look at the trajectory that we are in terms of our hiring rates in the United States, since December 31 of 2012 we hired about 500 people at this point in time. And you should expect to see that coming into the fourth quarter too.","Ajay Banga ","We\u2019re hiring across the world. It\u2019s not just in the U.S. We\u2019re hiring in different parts of the world. We\u2019re hiring in London and Singapore and so on and so forth to kind of get our footprint improved, but also our technical and technological capacities. ","One little number that will give you a hint on that front is four years ago the Millennials in our population were 4%. They\u2019re now 30% of our population in our employment population. Not all caused by hiring. Part of it is caused by the acquisitions. DataCash and Access had a different age profile. But also by the hiring, and all the [unintelligible] hiring isn\u2019t incremental. Some of it is to replace the people who leave for various reasons. ","So it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag. But there\u2019s a lot of money that\u2019s going into the people. There\u2019s a lot of money going into technology. So tokenization requires investment. It\u2019s a real technological platform that\u2019s been invested and sustained, and will require investment for a little period of time to come. So there\u2019s a lot of that going on. ","As far as the gateway question is concerned, you\u2019re absolutely right. I\u2019d love to get into a bigger gateway position in the United States. The fact is, now that we feel comfortable where we are with DataCash and MiGS. We had MiGS earlier, as you\u2019ll remember. We bought DataCash, put them together. We\u2019ve got that management team pretty well organized. They are doing a very good job of executing, and they\u2019ve entered into Latin America and they\u2019ve entered into a few global merchants including some in the U.S. ","But there are lots of ways to get into that space, and one of those could be not just through buying gateways, but buying adjacent businesses that allow our gateway capability to connect well with the adjacent business to get a footprint into the U.S. And so we\u2019re working on a ton of those ideas, and just one of them hasn\u2019t [unintelligible] yet, and haven\u2019t come in at a value that I\u2019d be happy to pay for some of the things that have been acquired by other people.","So I will leave you with a few closing thoughts. We are pleased with our solid third quarter results. As Martina said, we\u2019ve used the opportunity to put some money back into A&M, but we\u2019re also continuing to invest in the most sustained way in the longer term aspects of our business. ","And she and I talked about this in some detail, she in particular, at the investor day, when she laid out the banner under which our investments were going. Those investments can be organic, in areas such as the convergence of physical and digital or in areas like technology that supports safety and security. But they can also be through acquisitions like Truaxis and Access Prepaid. ","And we recently announced Provus, which hasn\u2019t got, as you know, approved yet. Hopefully it will get all sorted out in the fourth quarter, and we can talk about it after that. But these are only a few examples of the many initiatives that we are into that should drive long term growth. And it connects back to the kind of question Tien-tsin just asked, how we are trying to grow.","Our business continues to have strong momentum. We\u2019re focused on delivering another good year, and I just want to thank you for your support through this entire period, and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Gasper, you may begin.","","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion about our second quarter 2013 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question.","This morning\u2019s earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Both the earnings release and the slide deck include reconciliations of any non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. All of these documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week through August 7.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filing.","With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Ajay Banga. Ajay?","","Ajay Banga","Good morning, everybody. We are very pleased to report EPS growth of 23% for the second quarter. Our net revenue growth of 15%, operating expenses grew 5%, and we continued to execute on our global strategy and navigate through what we all know is a somewhat uncertain economic environment.","So, let\u2019s take a look first of the U.S. consumer spending was up last quarter. Retail sales growth was better than expected. Housing indicators continued to show signs of recovery. Our spending pulse data for the second quarter showed a growth in U.S. retail sales ex-auto was 4%, that is over the same quarter of the prior year, and that is up from 2.6% as the same number for the first quarter. So, contributing to the growth was a steady improvement in consumer confidence and some stabilization in the employment levels in the country. Our own U.S. business reflected these improving trends with 6% volume growth, up from last quarter\u2019s 4% growth.","Moving on to Europe, the environment is somewhat similar to what we saw. Over the last several quarters, there are a few upbeat notes there. Economic trends were similar for the UK and for parts of Continental Europe. During the second quarter, consumer confidence increased there. Business sentiment was a little weak in the second quarter there. Although recent PMI studies indicate that business sentiment now may also be turning up. In spite of those mixed economic signals, we are still seeing opportunities to expand our business and take advantage of that secular shift from cash through electronic and that shows up in our solid second quarter volume growth of 14% in Europe.","In the Asia, consumer spending in the second quarter was on the rise. In the majority of markets, consumer confidence levels are doing well across the regions with key markets like Korea and Japan being marked improvements. Business sentiment across the region is mixed and that's kind of due to the lingering concerns about the effects of the sluggish Chinese and European markets may have on the broader Asian export dependent economy. Our business in the region however continues to do well. We had volume growth of 21% in Asia.","Latin America, consumer confidence in both Brazil and Mexico is somewhat challenged for all the reasons you read about and expectation for GPD growth in Mexico have recently been lowered. But we are still growing our volume in Latin America at almost 17% but clearly we are watching the wider economic trend there very carefully. So before we go over to some recent business highlights, I thought I'd spend a minute on the legal and regulatory front and particularly with regard to the U.S. Merchant litigation, the merchant opt-out period ended in late May and as most of you already know about 8000 merchants decided to opt-out of the cash settlement. The represents just marginally over 25% of the total purchase volume over the settlement's time frame.","The defendants as a group have the right to terminate the settlement agreement because the volume threshold of 25% was exceeded, but elected not to do so. We expect most of the larger merchants who opted-out will file separate actions to recover damages and many of them have already started to do so. The final approval hearing is scheduled to begin on September the 12th. We remain confident that the settlement will be approved. We are also pleased that the Canadian Competition Tribunal recently upheld our no surcharge Honour-All-Cards and No-Discrimination rules in Canada.","And in Europe, I know that Javier and Noah were on a call with most of you last Thursday to discuss the EC's proposed legislation.","So I'm going to spend less time on that, but I do want to offer a couple of thoughts that I have in my mind on the topic. We partner with governments around the world in many areas related to electronic payments but there will be times when the interest of some of our stake holders require us to raise concerns of our proposed action, this is one of those times. We support the European Commission\u2019s gold of a secure, efficient, competitive innovative European payments industry. We believe that they have made a good start towards recognizing the importance of a level playing field. It also appears that there is actually potential to further open up and get competition in place for domestic processing.","However we remain concerned that some of the proposed legislation could have unintended consequences of hindering competition, and innovation, and we remain concerned that it could be harmful to consumers and small merchants in Europe. And so in the upcoming debate as this legislation, the proposed legislation winds its way through the process, we are going to engage all participants in the process. We will try and ensure the best possible outcome in the best possible way.","Finally I want to reiterate Javier\u2019s confidence that our model, our business model will adapt as necessary to allow us to compete effectively and continue to provide innovative payment products and services that our customers want to offer, consumers want to use, merchants want to accept and that's where we are focused on.","So moving from there on to some recent business activity. You will get a chance to see a lot of things that are invested in September. So I\u2019m going to focus our progress here around a few key themes and keep in short.","During the quarter we continued to sign new agreements, supporting the expansion of our credit and debit business that's the first theme including the following examples. In Europe, Danske Bank, the largest bank in Denmark will be issuing MasterCard consumer debit, credit, and commercial cards in 10 countries. And together with what we did with Fred (ph) Bank, Nordea as our wins (ph) there, we expect to grow our total market share by 50% in the Nordic and Baltic region over the next five years.","In Korea we have two new debit card wins to help lock in our debit market leadership position. First is the (inaudible) Card the recent spin-off of the card division of one of Korea's largest retail banks and they are now issuing platinum debit cards with us. We also recently signed an agreement with Hana SK that will further increase our dominant share of their debit portfolio. In the U.S., we continued to aggressively pursue all opportunities in the consumer credit and co-brand space as they arise. We\u2019re pretty confident and are showing regular progress as and when they come up and we can announce them.","Moving to cross-border, which as you know is an important part of our business that's the second theme. Let me give you a flavor of some of our new travel and affluent (ph) programs around the world. In the UK our access prepaid business recently launched four new multi-currency cash passport programs, all of which are available online. One example is British Airways launching their Executive Club Cash Passport card, which is capable of having up to seven currencies loaded on the card.","South Africa, (inaudible) bank in South Africa launched the country\u2019s first re-loadable prepaid travel multi-currency card. This allows for four currencies to be loaded on to the card. And one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, the Riyad Bank in Saudi Arabia just launched a gold-plated World Elite card for their private banking client, and these benefits include everything from unlimited lounge access at our cross-border rewards program and the like.","So, the third theme, leading the transition to digital payments, we are focused on creating better shopping experiences for the consumer, more value for the merchant. And then I will give you a couple of examples. First, MasterPass Digital Wallet, that rollout has now expanded to four countries. Canada launched the past quarter. The UK is launching as you read in the media as we speak. With the addition of web.com, that\u2019s a provider of internet services for small businesses in the U.S. and Canada, this wallet is now accepted at more than 20,000 merchants globally. In Singapore with the addition of SingTel\u2019s recent launch of their mCASH program, all three telcos in Singapore, SingTel, StarHub, and M1 now have wallets MasterCard as the only open loop payment card option.","Last theme, IPS, or issuer processing platform for debit, ATM, and prepaid. As you know, IPS enables our consumers and our customers rather to decrease their reliance on their legacy systems, increase their ability to drive innovation, get to market quicker reduces some of that cost of complying with some of the increasingly complex regulatory requirements. In the U.S., e-bank (inaudible) and USAA, all recently completed conversions for IPS. Wells Fargo is completing a conversion later this year for a commercial prepaid offering. IPS also part of the access prepaid, which is our prepaid program manager to support global travel programs, such as the Qantas multi-currency card, which I have talked about last quarter.","So, just to give you a headline on this, in the last couple of years, we have increased our IPS customer base from 5 to 16. We are now in 23 countries and 17 languages. We can scale and we will scale and we will expand the platform. So, now let me turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone. Let me begin on page three of our slide deck, where you can see this quarter the as reported as well as the FX adjusted growth rate by essentially the same.","As Ajay said, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter given the continued slow growth economic environment. Net revenue growth of 15% combines with operating expense growth of 5% supported our net income growth of 19%. And EPS growth of 23% also benefited from our share repurchase programs. Cash flow from operations was $742 million, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and other liquid investments of about $5.1 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased almost 1.1 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $580 million. Through July 25, we repurchased almost 300,000 shares at a cost of $174 million, and we now have $1.1 billion remaining under the current Board authorization. You will continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.","So, let me turn to page four, and here you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis to just over $1 trillion. U.S. GDV grew 6% with credit volumes growing 3%. And U.S. commercial credit growth was in the low teens similar to last quarter. U.S. consumer credit growth was slightly positive also an improvement from last quarter. Our U.S. debit growth was 9% driven by higher growth across all of our consumer and commercial debit as well as prepaid programs. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 17% on a local currency basis. This continues to be driven by APMEA with more than 20% growth and solid 14% and 17% growth in Europe and LAC respectively. First quarter volume grew 17% on a local currency basis including more than 20% in LAC and APMEA and growth in the high-teens in Europe.","So turning to page five, process transactions grew over 11% globally. In the U.S. Retail growth of 5% which was lower than last quarter as we anniversary our pin debit processing wins. As you know, we are managing pin debit transactions to optimize our revenue and our transaction level has remained about the same over the past several quarters. Outside the U.S. process transactions grew 20%. We saw increased growth in all regions but particular strength in Brazil, Russia, Australia, Netherlands and South Africa. Globally the number of cards grew 8% to 1.9 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.","Let me now turn to page six with some insights on our revenue. Within our net revenue growth of 15%, gross revenue grew 12% in-line with volume and transaction drivers as well as some pricing. Rebates and incentives only increased by 2%. As you know the rebates and incentive line can move around on a quarter-to-quarter basis depending on the timing of deals.","Specifically in the second quarter, we had two factors that contributed to this relatively low growth rate. First, some contracts were not yet signed by quarter close and second we had some lumpiness due to the performance of a few contracts. Overall these factors represented about 2.5 percentage points of our total 15% net revenue growth.","Similar to the prior quarter, growth in domestic assessment was again driven by strong growth outside of the U.S. which comes at a lower yield. And the gap between the growth in first quarter volume and revenue continued to be due a higher mix of intra-Europe activity excluding the impact of pricing.","So let's look at the components of total operating expenses which you see on page seven. The increase in G&A expense was primarily driven by the impacts of higher compensation costs as a result of the increase in the number of employees compared to the same last year, to the same time last year to support our growth initiatives.","The slight increase in advertising and marketing expense was mainly due to the impact of new and renewed sponsorships.","Turning to slide eight, let's discuss what we have seen for the third quarter through July 28.","Globally our cross-border volume grew about 15%, so that's just slightly below of what we saw in the second quarter. And this was primarily driven by slower growth outside the U.S. due to the timing of Ramadan.","In the U.S., our processed volume grew 9%, up from our second quarter growth due to improvements in both credit and debit. Process volume growth outside of the U.S. grew 16% that's about equal to what we saw in the second quarter. And in particular our European process volume growth was in the mid-teens very similar to what we saw in the second quarter.","Globally process transaction growth was 14% to up from the 11% that we saw in the second quarter driven by higher growth in the U.S. for both credit and debit. Looking forward let me start with our long term performance objectives which have not changed. We remain confident that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR and at least 20% EPS CAGR over the 2013 to 2015 period and these growth rates are on a constant currency basis and they exclude any new acquisitions. We also remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. However, assuming that the economic environment remains similar to where it is today, we now expect that net revenue and EPS growth in the early part of this three year period will likely be at the low-end of our stated ranges for net revenue growth and EPS growth and that is slightly better than we previously anticipated.","Now, I would like to share with you a few specific thoughts about 2013. So, given our stronger than expected second quarter net revenue growth and what we see for rebates and incentives for the balance of the year, we now believe that second half net revenue growth will be similar to what we saw in the first half. We continued to anticipate total 2013 operating expenses to grow a bit below the 8% currency adjusted growth rate that we saw in 2012 as we continued to spend on the right things to support our growth initiatives while keeping an eye on more discretionary spending.","We also continue to foresee some operating margin expansion in 2013. The amount of any improvement as you know will depend on both top line growth and the investment opportunities that may surface during the year. And for your modeling purposes, we now think that you could see a full year tax rate of about 31%. With respect to FX, if rates remain the same as they are today, so that is the euro continues to trade at the 133 level and the Brazilian real at the 226 level for the rest of the year. The impact of the euro and the real will essentially offset each other for full year 2013.","So, now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?","","Barbara Gasper","Thanks Martina. We are now ready to begin the Q&A period. In order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Operator?","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We'll now being the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Craig Maurer from CLSA. You may go ahead.","","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up to the European discussion, in terms of EU assessment revenue, what percentage of that is earned on a per volume \u2013 on a volume basis versus a card licensing basis as it would seem that there might be some rules preventing you from assessing on transactions where your scheme was not used to process even though your brand was present?","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Hey, Craig, it\u2019s Martina. I think I will take that question. So, first of all, what I presume that you are actually asking about Article A8 on co-batching and the EC proposed legislation right. So, no look, we obviously know the number when you just strictly look at volume based assessment fees that we earned in Europe on domestic transactions that we do not process. And by the way, it\u2019s not material to our overall MasterCard numbers. But I am a little bit reluctant to put out this number here at this point in time and really for a couple of reasons. One, this is one of the sections of the proposal where the language is actually unclear. And second, there are number of puts and takes in the entire legislation, which makes it clearly difficult for us at this point to estimate what part of this revenue figure might actually be subject to this potential provision. It all is basically wrapped out in terms for us being difficult to understand the intent of this co-batching provision.","So, imagine, when an issuer elect to put our brand on a card they must have a reason for doing so, presumably because their consumer recognizes and values our brand and therefore uses his or her card with the MasterCard brand on it. That brings value to our stakeholders in the system. Of course, we are not going to provide our brand for free. And we don\u2019t believe that, that could be the intention of the EC. On the other hand, there are also some other provisions in the proposal, which could as you know allow for more competition in domestic processing, which we would certainly welcome. So, why don't we get more clarification from the EC, we think that we still have quite a bit of work to do given our hands around the provision and how that could impact us if at all.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. You may go ahead.","","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Thank you. I guess I had a question about the rebates and incentives volume. It looks like there was some kind of restatement as well; it was about $21 million or so for last year's number. I was wondering if Martina you can just talk about that a little bit. And then just as far as your, the assumption going forward on rebate, should we expect that those levels remain fairly low consistent with the second quarter? Thanks.","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Sanjay, so let me take the first one which is really a reclassification. So we had some of our advisor services both reflected in the growth revenue line and in the contra (ph) line all we did is we collapse them in the growth revenue line.","So from a net revenue point of view there is absolutely no difference and all we did is the, reclass the number to 2012 so that as the accounting change came in on January of 2013, you were looking at apples-to-apples, okay? So that's on the reclass.","In terms of the rebates and incentives, what you saw in Q2 was really a much lower growth rate on a rebates and incentives than we would normally see. All right and I said there are two factors. One is, we didn't get to sign all of the contracts that we thought we would sign by the end of the quarter, and those contracts will be showing up either in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, so you cannot assume this level of rebates and incentives going forward. It will go back to our, what you normally see the lumpiness; this is a little bit more lumpy of course in the second quarter than we normally have. And then secondly I think I did explain that we had a couple of performances on the number of contracts where we paid out lower incentives than otherwise anticipated.","So do not take this increase in rebates and incentives for Q2 and apply it for the rest of the year you really need to go back to my comments where I said that net revenues for the second half of the year will probably come in similar to what we saw in the first half of the year and that's baked in our assumptions in rebates and incentives.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. You may go ahead.","","Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks guys, so just wanted to ask on the revenue side of things. It looked like both the purchase volume yields on domestic assessment as well as the revenue per process transaction or I should say the TP revs (ph) or process transaction were both down year-over-year I think on the purchase volume yields and the domestic assessments it was the lowest we have seen in a while and on the transaction processing revs for process transaction it was down year-over-year in Q2, I think almost as much as in Q1 despite the Durbin routing dynamics anniversary and can you just comment on those metrics if there were anomalies in those numbers or how we might think about them for the second half?","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yeah Jason first of all this trend we have now for a number of quarters. First of all let's talk about the domestic assessment right? What we have, we have particular growth coming in terms of jurisdictions outside of the United States often enough we have to obviously compete with what's going on from a domestic pricing point of view. So where we have the growth they do come at a lower yield, that\u2019s number one.","Number two; you also see when you look at our statistics that we put out that we have a relatively larger growth on cash transactions in those jurisdictions versus the U.S. transactions and those two impact the yields too. So by the way this is nothing different, as we are going to grow in those kinds of jurisdictions and really expand our business outside of the United States even more, you will see these trends continuing.","From a transaction point of view, I think I said something as part of the transaction volume that we're seeing, we saw particular growth in Brazil, in Russia, in actually Poland, Netherlands, some Australia and those actually do drive also that differential between what you see on transaction growth versus what you see from a transaction yield point of view. Again nothing different than what we had before.","","Ajay Banga","Just think about all the, what will add to that first part of the question. Think about things like we are doing in Nigeria and South Africa with social security payments, what tends to happen is the consumer who gets an electronic card for the first time tends to in beginning go even more for cash than the average consumer in our portfolio. So, if we keep doing this well and we keep trying to intervene in the cash flow between governments and consumers, which is a large part of where the cash comes from, you will first find them growing the cash, then all the efforts taken around what we call the five-step program to take people from using cash at an ATM to eventually going more and more to delivering at a point of sales and that five step program takes certain number of years and a certain set of events to happen. So, we are going to speed this build and develop. I mean, that\u2019s an important part of the nature of what we are trying to provide.","","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Alright. So, it\u2019s the mix shift during the transition. Okay, thanks.","","Ajay Banga","Yes, absolutely. And you know Jason starting the transition that will happen in a year or two, this thing as you can imagine with 85% of the world\u2019s transaction in cash, so the whole game to be played out here. So, you are going to get this mix of cash and POS and then in some countries, the POS picks up and others cash remains strong and it takes certain time for that mix to go the right way.","","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Okay, understood. Thank you.","","Ajay Banga","You\u2019re welcome.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.","","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. I guess, as we sort of kind of discussed on previous calls, U.S. credit you had said was slightly positive and slightly better than the first quarter, but obviously the first quarter was a weak quarter because of the comparison. And it seems like it kind of accelerated somewhat less even then kind of what you had cited as overall retail spending and as your debit spending. We have seen a little bit of success in what you have done with Bank of America on the credit side. Anything else that you can kind of point to in terms of strategies and tactics, and can you also give us an update on the American Airlines contract?","","Ajay Banga","So, no update on American Airlines, because it ain't anywhere what I can tell you anything about it, and if I knew anything you can appreciate, I wouldn\u2019t tell you and recall like this. So, that one won\u2019t happen. We are in negotiations with them as is everybody else. So, there is a lot going on there, but we are all in negotiation. The first part, nothing has changed, we know that U.S. consumer credit is what we have to work on. We have got a series of things that we\u2019ve been doing over the last period of time to try and improve the trajectory of our U.S. consumer credit spend growth. Some of it is caused by deals we are winning whether it be all the things we have announced over time, we have talked to with Bank of America doing things with us.","So, there is a series of other deals from Maestro and Intercontinental Hotel Group through other banks like KeyBank and stuff we have done with Huntington and SunTrust and all that, that\u2019s going on. For all those things, they have certain time to begin accumulating in the book just as lawsuit take a certain time to reflect in the book as you know in the past. So, we are kind of working of ways to it. There is number of opportunities around co-branding. There is number of opportunities around things like we are doing with Bank of America, where it\u2019s not a wholesale cliff, but it\u2019s the opportunity to work together in specific areas as we are working with. Some of those deals couldn\u2019t get announced, because they weren\u2019t signed. Some of those got signed. And so that\u2019s one of the lumpiness in our numbers in Q2. So, stuffs going on and we will have ups and downs as we go along, but we have got a pretty clear pathway through working on both co-brand and the effort to win business with banks that are currently higher market share with other competitors. That\u2019s the work. The third aspect is that the nature of our book and its performance depends a little bit on the nature of our customers' book and their performance. And as the banking industry more and more of the banking industry comes back to a normal deal on the credit book as the economy improves. I think these are the net beneficiary of that as well. I don\u2019t think that showed up adequately as yet in our book. So, we\u2019ve got to get these three things going on.","","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks so much.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. You may go ahead.","","Darrin Peller - Barclays ","Thank guys. You beat across number of matters clearly in the quarter, including incentives and also your cross-border yield came pretty strong. When you are seeing that raised expectations obviously versus the low end of \u2013 or to the low end of your range versus obviously the early years being below that previously. Can you just give us a sense specifically which metrics are coming in now better than you initially anticipated at the beginning of the year to drive that? And then maybe more specifically on cross-border second part of the question, the volume growth of 17% versus revenues of 20%, how much of that is actually pricing versus mix, just because we want to, especially since we have seen volume growth exceeding revenue growth over the lot several quarters? Thanks a lot.","","Martina Hund-Mejean","So, Darren, on the metrics, first of all, what we are seeing is that from a domestic volume point of view, we see improvements in a number of regions versus what we have seen before. To see what's going on in the U.S even though we would still think this is a pretty slow growth environment it is feeling a little bit better than earlier this year and certainly than late last year. Look at all of the price that is coming out of Europe, it's starting to feel better. In fact all of our European countries grew except for Spain, Spain there is a little bit of an issue but if you read the recent articles, it seems like that even that country starts to feel a little bit better going forward.","So I think we\u2019re just seeing a little bit of more robust that's coming in than what we assumed before. In terms of your question on the cross-border volume versus the revenue side, what you really have to contrast is our cross-border volumes grew 17%. And you saw that our revenues grew 19%. Really what we have in there is we have this quarter the U.S. Acquirer Support fee coming in, that's the first quarter that is coming in, it will be with us for another three quarters that reflects about 8 percentage points of that 19%. So if you take that out, if you compare 11% revenue growth to the 17% volume and that difference, that 6 percentage points difference is exactly what we have before in all of our prior quarters in terms of what's happening from the intra-Europe mix on cross-border versus inter-Europe mix.","Remember intra-Europe mix comes at a lower yield than inter and so that's, again nothing new continuing trend and that's what we're seeing.","","Ajay Banga","So the only thing I'd add to that Darrin is that remember I have been saying for a while that I expected the second half in the U.S. to be better than the first half. I have said that now for three quarters, and I still believe that. The difference is the second quarter came in better in U.S. spending than we thought it would when we first made that statement. So what's happening is a little bit of that improvement that we thought we get in the U.S in the second half feels like its come a couple of months before what we had already factored in for our thinking when we spoke to you about our estimates of how this year would go some time back.","So that a little extra is what you're seeing us show up in the second quarter results, one other thing that's driving it. There is a lot of others, there is cross-border, there is stuff in other countries and all that but the U.S. is at the end of the day 40% of our revenue give or take and so that number still drives a change in what we think. And that's kind of an important part of the context.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Smittipon Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.","","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","I was wondering if you can give us an update on what you expect to see happen in China, our understanding was that the government over there was supposed to respond to the WTO by actually today?","","Ajay Banga","Yeah, so I think the way they are looking at it; my sense is that they are supposed to clarify certain things but their actual policy I think they believe they still have a month or two to respond in. So we\u2019re kind of waiting for that to come out there, periodically talking to us as well as other players and clarifying that they have certain thoughts on how to open up. But in in truth we don't have enough of a picture to be able to give you a better answer. Just we're there talking to them all the time and they're working their way through their thoughts.","Meanwhile life carries on. There is the normal issuance of co-brand cards going on and as I've been telling you we've been winning most of those deals, we're still in that same position. We've just got a couple of approvals for co-branded cards there we've issued those; work has started on those you have had the deal Alibaba, that's kind of moving in the direction. We wanted it to go, we have had that whole report about one cross-border e-commerce kind of player who used to do clearing in Renminbi in Hong Kong which the PDOC itself was not quite within what they want to do going forward that one has held up. But everything else is carrying on, so China is going along where it is today but everybody is waiting for the new policy.","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Operator next question please.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Brendler from Stifel. You may go ahead.","","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel","Can you talk about, I know we have hit this a lot on process transaction growth and transaction growth but the numbers in Europe particularly look really strong especially on a core basis accelerating sequentially, is that macro or are you still seeing the benefit of deals like the Netherlands and Italy and are there new deals that you potentially are signing in Europe, just the European transaction and core numbers look very strong. And just one additional question if I could, I just see a Bloomberg headline about a judge rejecting the debit fee regulations in the fed any color there would be helpful? Thanks.","","Ajay Banga","So, the Bloomberg headlines just talking to you, so we don\u2019t have access to Bloomberg so I have no idea what the one is about. Noah, do you know anything about it?","","Noah Hanft","Don\u2019t know about it. I separate calculation. The Europe one of the best way to answer is both. You are getting some improvement in macro, but we continue as we can tell you in our conversation, we have continued to win deals and then share both with institutions in Europe, but also remember we are continuing to get some transactions out of different places as the step of migration allows us to win some domestic processing across the country, across the countries in Europe. Martina?","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, let me just add something to that Chris, because actually mentioned the last Thursday\u2019s conference call that we process well below 50% of the POS transactions done on our cards in the EEA. And actually when we put all the numbers properly together and it's actually just below 40%, and by the way if you include both POS and cash transactions, we only process about 25% of the transactions done on our cards. And so that\u2019s why we are saying there is just absolutely plenty of opportunities for us to compete in domestic processing be standard over the last 4 or 5 years since I came in. And hopefully with some of the changes in the regulation, we might be able to do even more there.","","Chris Brendler - Stifel","Ajay, can I just ask more quickly your thoughts on whether or not the regulation in Europe would slow the progress on MasterCard\u2019s ability to gain processing share or somehow increase it or is it at the same?","","Ajay Banga","So, what Martina was saying just that would indicate that I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to slow it down, and that\u2019s kind of where we both are. We have kind of as you can imagine we have had a fair series of discussions in the company around this. The fact is that until everything becomes really clear, until it goes through the next, it could take a year, it could take two years for this to become really implemented. So, I don\u2019t know how to answer that any better, because that just to be the European legislative process will work. In the meantime, they are carrying on building domestic processing business, because there is so much space for us to win. We were a very small portion of domestic processing till a few years ago.","","Chris Brendler - Stifel","Thank you.","","Ajay Banga","Thanks a lot.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Fodor from Autonomous Research. You may go ahead.","","Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to dig into your financial goals just a little bit, I mean you made it very clear you are aggressively focusing on energizing the U.S. credit portfolio, but that takes time investment and obviously intensive, so can you just give us sense of how much improvement here such as new customer wins and such you have baked into these three-year financial goals?","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Look, Glenn, you just have to go back to what we have put up at the last Investor Day. This is just one chart, which clearly shows you the three drivers of our growth, right. One is TCE growth, right, and we assume 4% to 5% per year on average over long-term. The second one is the secular growth, which is basically the conversion from cash to check to electronic forms of payment that's 4% to 6% per annum roughly over longer term. And then in addition to that, you saw over 2, 3, 4 percentage points on top of it in terms of strategic investments. And strategic investments actually includes a number of things, it includes things that we are doing in the digital space. It includes things that we might be doing from a market share point of view. Those are all of the things that we have baked in and that\u2019s out there and we haven\u2019t changed our view on that (inaudible).","","Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research","Yes, thanks Martina.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.","","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Hi guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but just curious going back to the big news of last quarter around this Chase deal. Has there been any new perspective you guys have gotten from other bank participants and how you guys are thinking about that relationship as you know with other potential banks MasterCard works with? That\u2019s kind of question A. And then question B, still curious to know if you guys have any idea if Chase is going to move some volume off of MasterCard over to Visa as a result of this deal? Thanks.","","Ajay Banga","Hey, Bryan. So, why I wonder what the other questions were, so, the first one Visa Chase, no nothing new, there is actually the same series of conversations that are going on, a number of the other banks and obviously are concerned about what this means longer term but everybody is kind of waiting and watching to see how this gets implemented. And I know we're in those dialogues, a number of them. It does help to help open doors for us without a doubt, but beyond that I have got no new perspective for you there. Will Chase move volume over the Visa? I mean we've also got volume coming to us from Chase, the Intercontinental Hotel Group co-brand is a Chase co-brand, which we just won. So will they move volume? I assume they would move some, but I'm not sort of inside of Chase discussing this, but as being a banker in my previous life I would still like to keep doors open with more than one network, because it suits me when I'm a banker. Does that mean that the shares will not change and the proportions will not change? I would assume that the proportions will move towards the one you have chosen to put more investment with. And so I actually believe that to be the case. I just don't know factually what they will do.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","","Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs","When we are in at the last Investor Day together you had mentioned that once you show us margin above 55% it can be hard to go backwards, we\u2019re running two quarters into the year at north of 58%. The full year guidance suggests just something around 50% I mean what's the delta there for the rest of the year as you guys think about the margin profile and why should your margin step back here from the sort of 58% level or so?","","Ajay Banga","I don't think it's going to go back to 50, we never said 50 is the guidance, we just said a minimum of 50. As I told you I did that when I came in because I found that at that time we were out testing, we\u2019re going to continuously increase our margin by a few 100 basis points every year and I didn't feel that was a strategic goal for the company compared to growing our franchise, growing our revenue and converting cash. I just thought that's a much better way of thinking for what the company is trying to do than trying to put a margin growth target but you already have a relatively attractive margin in the company.","Having said that our margins tend to be a little variable by quarter. So the fact that it's about 50 years right now from what I recollect normally the fourth quarter has a relatively low margin and I think that's been the case for the three or four years now. It's been the case for these three or four years that I have seen it. So I think the annual margin tends to settle at a different number but it's really since the fourth quarter also is a relatively large quarter in many other ways.","So I don't know that you would assume that 58 is fixed, I would tell you this we are very focused on not going in and throwing away money just because the margin is higher, we would also focused as I said on taking away pricing as the only way to grow although as I have said many times we work on many lines of pricing every quarter and the results show up this quarter. There is certain amount of pricing. This pricing will give us some benefit for a couple of more quarters to come. We think at it around pricing every quarter, there are thousands of lines in 200 countries and that's a fair opportunity.","So will it be a high increase in pricing, low increase in pricing? Remember this; I am not into pricing as the way to grow revenue. I mean we\u2019re trying to fight that 85%. So, we will do what we can at the right time with pricing and margin. So, I still stick around with that 50% minimum that's to reassure investors that we\u2019re not going to throw the money away.","But I am not going to give you an estimate that it will go down or up just because we have quarterly variances and all we have to do is put some more money into a series of investments and we will take a couple of quarters where the margin will be lower than it is today. It'll still be for the year about 50 that I promise you.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein. You may go ahead.","","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein","Yeah and so I guess on a related note on the margin front, I mean it's encouraging to hear that macro is starting to improve some in certain parts of your business particularly in the U.S. and maybe even some early signs in Europe, does that at all change your view on margins going forward? In other words in years with the revenue growth is weak you seem to give some margin expansion to help with the earnings growth. But as the macro continues to get better, how does that affect the outlook on the margin front?","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Hey Rod let me just jump in here. First of all we, you know we are not running the business based on a particular margin. As Ajay just said, we put a margin minimum in place to make absolutely ensure that our investors understand that we look at every investment that we do in the company critically, and as we do it in such a way that we get returns from it. That\u2019s how we look investments. And really how we run the company is looking at these investments, making these investments every year, every quarter as we see that, and we think that based on our current business trajectory the way the business that we have today that we will be at a minimum 50% margin. We do not run them as business for margin expansion per se.","","Ajay Banga","That's across whether the economy is doing better or worse and that\u2019s not what we are doing. And so I wouldn\u2019t assume any change based on the U.S. economy looking better or not better nothing has changed in our strategy.","","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein","And just to clarify on that, does that mean as we move into 2014 your view on margins is still sort of keeping margins around 50% range?","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Absolutely, Rod, our annual operating margin minimum that we put out for three years is 50% and is the minimum, that doesn\u2019t mean that it couldn\u2019t go higher, because mostly because of revenue growth, but it\u2019s a combination of where the revenue growth comes in and the investments we decide to make in the company.","","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein","Understood. And then on the pricing front, you mentioned that pricing was somewhat of a benefit, can you quantify was it sort of a 1% benefit and you are\u2026.","","Martina Hund-Mejean","No, Rod it was 4% in total on the revenue line.","","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein","4% in total. And then that benefit, does it taper off in the next couple of quarters?","","Martina Hund-Mejean","No, there are couple of pricing in there. One I already mentioned, which was the U.S. hiring support fee, we just started this quarter. That\u2019s going to be with us for the next three quarters and that was probably about half of the price changes. And then we had a couple of other small ones. One anniversary this quarter I would just say acquire our licensee fee which we have talked about. And then there is a very small one, which you know that we have been starting to put through, which is pricing related to the digital wallet operators, but we are talking about smaller numbers again going forward. Operator, next question please.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura Securities. You may go ahead.","","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Thanks. Good morning. Ajay, I was hoping you could give us a sense of whether in your conversations you see any indication of certain groups in the industry moving closer to thinking of debit as just being debit with the distinction between hidden signature just not being as important, for example, like in your discussions with issuers is given that their economics are identical for both now or do you see the distinction continuing to be drawn? And then I guess for the industry as a whole, I guess ex-market share shifts do you have a sense for whether there has been any kind of a notable shift in the mix of signature versus pin transactions post of the Durbin regulation?","","Ajay Banga","Both great questions, Bill. So, the second one, so what about industry as a whole has there has been a move from signature to pin, actually not identifiably so, has there been a move from debit to credit, not identifiably so. Do people talk about in the banking industry and in the merchants business? Do they talk about expecting changes? Yes, but it\u2019s been about a year now and it hasn\u2019t really delivered great change. And I think finally it\u2019s not about the bank and the merchants, it\u2019s about the consumer and what they want to do. I think the consumer is un-impacted by this dialogue in most ways other than seeing indirect impact caused by an increase in checking fees that have dropped in free checking accounts and so on. They don\u2019t in their minds necessarily connect one to the other. And I think they are still behaving the way they choose to behave which to use their debit when they want and their credit when they want. They have impacted more by overall trends in the economy. So, I think as the U.S. economy continues to recover generate jobs and the like you will probably speak and increase in credit spending that may be faster than debit. But that still is out fare to be seen. That\u2019s just past cycles I am talking about. So, I would say nothing much right now.","","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful, Ajay. If I may one last follow-up here, can you comment on the Isis announcement of international rollout and we have seen a number of reports suggesting that the rollout of NFC is just pretty unexciting, but can you share your thoughts on the growth outlook for NFC as you see it over the course of next say 12 to 18 months? Thanks.","","Ajay Banga","NFC to me has opportunities, because it is a technology that is applicable not just to payments, but also delivering things around security, and things around loyalty and so on and so forth. I think anything that goes beyond just payment to the whole shopping experience, to the whole consumer experience; to the merchants experience is an important aspect in the upcoming transition that's going on between physical and digital, right? That's how I think about it, I don't think these are 12 and 18 months things built because just think of the ecosystem and the infrastructure, that needs to be built for any of these to happen and so I tend to look on it as a longer term effort and I think that most people would say if you look at contactless payments in Australia as an example I was looking at the data the other day, something like 25% or 30% of all transactions in Australia under Australian $100 comes out of contact, that's a big number compared to where they used to be two years ago. Now, will it go even higher? Probably. Will it take years to happen? Probably.","So some countries like Australia, Canada and Turkey are further ahead in NFC than others. But it's kind of, we run our business in so many countries it is a mixed bag and it's tough to generalize across all of them. But in general I think NFC has got opportunity I am not sure that I can tell it you in 12 or 18 months.","","Operator","Our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research. You may go ahead.","","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research","I wonder could you give us an update on your joint venture with Telefonica in Latin America, and sort of what's happening there and what you've learned so far?","","Ajay Banga","Sure. So we've got two different JVs with them. We've got the one that's in 12 countries excluding Brazil what we call Wanda. And then we've got Zoom which is in Brazil that's because of the way Telefonica was constructed when these JVs were signed. So in the first one Argentina was the first one to go out and they actually use the mobile wallet that exists in the joint venture we have with Smart Telecom in the Philippines called MTS. So that's the first one out there. The second one Zoom had just launched in April actually I think just around the time of our first quarter earnings call or just after or just before I am kind of forgetting, that's the first mobile program in the region that has a MasterCard prepaid Companion Card in addition to the mobile wallet.","So two different kinds of flavors, my sense is the concept of having a prepaid card as a companion card, a cash to the mobile payment will probably drive this faster than just a mobile payment by itself only because, to answer to Bill's question building ecosystems around new things takes time. The card acceptance system even if it's not completely built out in Brazil is way more built out than a mobile-only payment system. So that's the first learning we've got and I think we've got a lot of learning\u2019s about working with Telefonica, we've now actually in the, I don\u2019t know last three, four months, I forget when, we've launched two more initiatives with them both in Europe. I think there is something in the Czech Republic and there is something with them in Germany that we are doing. So the relation has expanded a little bit beyond the original construct in Latin America.","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Operator next question please.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan from Janney. You may go ahead.","","Tom McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott","Most of the questions on the quarter are answered. I'll ask a bigger picture question. When you joined MasterCard three years ago, you talked about innovations and the importance of that. And I was wondering if there is any way you kind of speak to, kind of how you are tracking to creating that culture in terms of financials like how much of our revenue for example revenue growth over the last few years was a function of new product introductions and new innovations. And as you look forward and see you\u2019re in a kind of three-year financial outlook. How much of that is going to be -- how much of the growth is going to be attributable to some sort of innovation as that MasterCard is developing today?","","Ajay Banga","So we haven't put provided a measure of an innovation index, which is kind of what you're referring to. But as Martina just explained in an answer to Rod a little while ago, if you think about our three year projection on revenue growth, those 2, 3, 4 percentage points at the end that she was talking about are from innovation in new products from things like data analytics which to me is a relatively new product all the way to the changes in market share and growth whether it be U.S. Credit or frankly U.S. Debit or all the things we are doing overseas as well.","So you can see it in that ballpark in that block of 2%, 3%, 4%. My whole attempt around innovation was to change the way we went to market, so that we didn't just sell credit, debit, prepaid and commercial but we looked at diversifying that growth from the core products both in terms of geographies and in terms of the kind of clients we worked with. So there you can see 30 odd deals that mobile telecom operators in the last two years, we had none three or four years ago in fact the dialogue used to be, how they wouldn't need the banks and the networks to be able to grow I think that demonstrates clearly that we have been able to show that our product set and technology adapted to mobile payments can work with them. I just was talking about Telefonica. So there are examples like that and a number of others. I talked about SingTel and the other Telcos in my call as well.","So that's the first part. The second part around innovation has to do with mobile payments, eCommerce and the whole aspect of information services. We are making a lot of progress on all three. Mobile I just talked about. We've done a lot of work in information services and data analytics.","So that's where we are. I don't have an innovation index that I'm going to give you publicly because the issue is what's the new product. In a consumer product company you can evaluate it in different ways, what's the new product for us, is a credit card with a new set of features a new product or a new product only that which comes in a new delivery channel and then we'll get into endless discussions about that. I'm much more focused on measuring our ability to generate new ideas in the company, do solution based selling to our clients and see the impact on our brands.","And our brands has gone from being number 87 in the brand index evaluated by clients to number 20 in four years. And we spend about the same or a little less money than we used to. That's all part, if you look at that brand index it talks about innovation as being a big driver of the change. So that's kind of how I measure it right now.","May a few years down the road, Martina will actually allow me to talk about an innovation index and I will let you deal with her on that one.","","Martina Hund-Mejean","Operator I think we have time for one last question.","","Operator","Our final question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan. You may go ahead.","","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Just want to ask a couple of follow ups. Just I guess on product innovation, at Visa's Investor Day, they talked about, I was trying to look up the number something like $200 million in the last two years in product innovation. I'm curious, how does that compare roughly to what MasterCard spent in product innovation? And then my follow-up was just want to clarify from Martina, the other line was a little bit better than we had modeled, does that capture the pricing you referred to be on the cross-broader change?","","Martina Hund-Mejean","So Tien-tsin let me first take other revenues first. So in other revenues actually what you\u2019re seeing is, showing up is some really nice growth in our Access Prepaid business as well as in our Advisors business. And you know Ajay already talked about some of the foreign (ph) structures in Australia that we\u2019re doing in both of those businesses. In addition to couple of the price increases that I talked about which are reflected in other revenues.","","Ajay Banga","The first part Tien-tsin I don't know how Charlie measured the number. So I haven't had a chance to understand what's inside that number. I kind of, Investor Day is not that far away. So we'll chat with you then on that topic. But the issue is what's inside as I was answering to the earlier question makes all the difference. So for example all the work we\u2019re doing on fraud tools is that innovation in a sense that probably is because it's developing entire new forms of technology. All the work we\u2019re doing on tokenization is that innovation probably is if it delivers a new way of dealing with safety. All the work we are doing with Truaxis to drive merchant funded loyalty programs around the world is that innovation and R&D probably, we've got MasterCard labs, we've got different portions that are delivering this answer.","I actually don't look at it that way. I look at it as I said in the earlier question of funding this in many different ways but most importantly in changing the way we talk to merchants and banks and governments about relating with them in a more solution based selling way. So the example with Nigeria where they were trying to do an ID scheme which ended up being not just that but also a payment scheme with a card that's two sided with a chip. We spend money on that, is that innovation, we spend money on biometric identification for the UID in India. So I don't want to get into, I\u2019ve counted this and not counted that and create some new metric that everybody will try and track but you should know that there are a ton of people in this company whose only job is if they want to come to work on January 01, 2014. They better have new ideas or they won't be allowed. That I can promise.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Ajay do you have some closing comments?","","Ajay Banga","I do. Okay after all that, okay. So what do I think about this, we delivered pretty solid results for the first half of this year. Driven off as we have talked about a little bit volume and transaction growth around the world and world-wide GDP across the 1 trillion level for the first time in the second quarter and Martina was reading that out I was looking at that as a milestone in some ways but on to the next trillion already. And our first half net revenue growth was a bit better than the forecasted for all the reasons we talked about. We remain confident about this three year performance objective that we have got out there and we\u2019re working hard to deliver on another good year in spite of what I consider to be somewhat unpredictable economic condition. My view is that the secular trends in our industry are just of great interest to me, they are strong drivers for top-line growth even in slower economic environments. So I\u2019m looking forward to seeing many of you in the Investor Day in September. I think you will get a chance to hear about our strategic focus areas, you will experience as you have done for the last couple of years. Some of our innovative products and services. We have got some really cool ones lined up for you this year so hopefully that will be fun. In the meantime, thank you for your support and thank you for being on the call with us today.","","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard second quarter 2018 earnings conference call.","Thank you. Mr. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference, sir.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Christa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data, and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.","Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a currency neutral basis and exclude special items unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. Please note that due to our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan entity starting this year, we are providing additional information regarding our switched transaction and card growth rates. The adjusted growth rates eliminate Venezuelan switched transactions and card counts from prior periods so that you can better understand the underlying growth rates of our business. Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted growth rates. These are the only supplemental operational metrics which are significantly impacted by the deconsolidation.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everybody.","Our strong performance continued this quarter, with net revenue growth of 18% and EPS growth of 48% versus a year ago on a currency neutral basis and excluding special items. Now even if you exclude the impact of the accounting changes and the acquisitions that affect year-over-year growth comparisons, our underlying net revenue growth was 14% and operating income was up 26%. And these results were achieved by investing for the future and reflect solid underlying business fundamentals and the continued execution of our strategy by all our employees around the world.","So let's start with the macroeconomic environment as usual, and we continue for now to see solid overall growth. However, we are keeping close tabs on the potential impacts of reduced fiscal stimulus by central banks and the increased trade barriers, which as you all know, could impact global economic growth over the longer term.","In the U.S., economic growth remains positive, with low unemployment and healthy consumer confidence. Retail sales are strong, and our quarterly SpendingPulse estimates are up 4.7% versus a year ago, ex-auto ex-gas. This did represent a slight decline sequentially, primarily due to the weather at the beginning of the second quarter and difficult comparisons over last year.","Conditions in Europe are stable overall, although we do remain concerned about the potential impacts of Brexit. Consumer confidence in the UK has been declining, and we are seeing some deceleration in UK retail sales growth rates year over year, according to our SpendingPulse data. In contrast, consumer confidence in the Nordics and Germany remain strong.","In Latin America, there are still some question marks. In Mexico, although the elections are behind us with a clear verdict, policy uncertainties remain. In addition, exchange rate volatility continues, primarily related to the NAFTA renegotiation. And in Brazil concern over the upcoming October elections I think contributed to the depreciation of the real.","We are monitoring a few potential headwinds in Asia. Trade tensions, rising U.S. interest rates, and oil prices are weighing on sentiment in some countries, including China and Korea. In the Middle East and Africa, on the other hand, recovering oil prices are generating some optimism in oil-producing countries.","So overall, there are some geopolitical and trade-related risks that we are keeping a close eye on. But as of now, they've had limited impact to date, and global economic trends remain generally positive.","Against that backdrop, we are driving healthy double-digit volume and transaction growth in Mastercard across most of our markets, with momentum across our core products and services. And let me give you a few examples, starting in the United States, where we continue to make excellent progress with co-brands. Leveraging our differentiated data and analytics capabilities, we won the L.L.Bean consumer credit program, and we also renewed our longstanding relationship with Hawaiian Air for both consumer and business co-brand cards.","We expanded our portfolio of PayPal co-brands, with the new Venmo consumer debit card, which as you know, will enable Venmo users to cash out their balances and use those funds online or in-store wherever Mastercard is accepted. In addition, we're partnering with leaders in the healthcare industry, such as Anthem, as they move their prepaid consumer spending accounts to Mastercard.","And on the commercial side, we recently extended our agreement with JPMorgan Chase, and we are very pleased to continue this strategic relationship with one of the largest banks in the market.","Going to Europe and building on some of the significant wins we've been announcing over the past few quarters, we have continued to secure renewals and new business with customers. I'll give you an example is Cr\u00e9dito Agr\u00edcola, where the team in Portugal will be flipping their consumer credit and debit business to Mastercard. Cr\u00e9dito Agr\u00edcola also leveraged our LaunchPad service, which enables them to work closely with Mastercard teams and using design thinking to rapidly develop a prototype for their new digital bank.","On the topic of digital banks, we continue to drive digital payment solutions with challenger banks, including through an expanded consumer and commercial debit partnership with N26 in Germany. In Latin America, we have customers in a number of markets who are leveraging a solution that we've developed that combines our Mastercard Black premium credit product with our cross-border travel rewards, which provides a very powerful value prop for the affluent customer. Banco Popular in Puerto Rico, for example, has chosen to leverage Mastercard's affluent solutions, including differentiated rewards benefits and marketing assets to the bank's customers as well as advisors consulting, managed services, and data analytics to optimize their cash-back airline co-brand and other Mastercard portfolios.","In Asia, we continue to pursue single-brand issuance in China by renewing relationships with large issuers, such as China Construction Bank and by winning new targeted portfolios like Bank of China's newly launched woman's card and the Bank of Communications' affluent youth card. We were also very pleased to establish an expanded relationship with Standard Chartered Bank across 11 markets in Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, and India.","Now moving to the Middle East and Africa region, we are also pleased that we have deepened our strategic partnership with several key customers. For example, we have renewed and extended our agreement with National Commercial Bank in Saudi Arabia, winning exclusive new commercial issuance and maintaining exclusivity in prepaid and credit, with advisors and loyalty services embedded as part of the deal.","On the product front, we are executing on our commercial strategy, including building our new products and scaling existing solutions, such as our inControl virtual cards, smartphone, smart data, and the Mastercard B2B Hub that's powered by AvidXchange, which as you know, optimizes accounts payable payments for small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S.","And we are expanding our accounts payable automation capabilities to mid-sized and larger businesses, and are further leveraging existing partners such as Nvoicepay. And in the second quarter, we also launched inControl for commercial payments and business travel in Italy with Nexi, a partner that will help us build scale in that new geography for us. Over time, we expect these and our full suite of commercial solutions to be very valuable tools for our partners and their customers.","We're going to be working on the fact that providing choice to customers, merchants and bank partners is essential to our business, and that includes offering capabilities that reach beyond cards, such as in account-to-account transactions. So let's give you a couple of examples on the progress we've made this quarter.","First, the example of our ability to combine our proprietary assets to offer one convenient end-to-end solution is the recently announced UK launch of Mastercard Send. That's our push debit solution, but combined with VocaLink's real-time payments capabilities. That fully integrated solution will enable financial institutions, fin-techs, digital customers, and other business to send real-time payments to UK bank accounts and also receive payments from UK bank accounts. The connection of Mastercard Send to the Faster Payments network enables a variety of use cases, including P2P payments and B2C disbursements in a seamless way.","Additionally, we expect to expand the reach of the Pay by Bank app through the launch with HSBC later this year and as Worldpay makes this capability available to its merchant customers in the UK starting early next year, early 2019. As I've spoken about in the past, the Pay by Bank app enables consumers to make online payments for goods and services via their mobile banking app and directly from their bank account with no need to link a card. Worldpay's reach together with our existing distribution arrangements with Barclays and Wirecard I think will provide a significant UK acceptance footprint for this new capability.","And finally, we continue to advance our secure digital solutions. That Worldpay partnership I just referenced is actually much broader and is focused on expanding acceptance and making digital payments more convenient and secure. As you may have seen in Worldpay's announcement last week, our relationship will extend to tokenization, Mastercard Send, push-to-card disbursement solutions, and support of EMVCo's secure remote commerce framework for a common checkout button.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.","Turning to page 3, we are very pleased to deliver another strong quarter, even when you exclude the 2 ppt tailwind from foreign exchange to net revenue and the 3 ppt to net income, which is primarily due to the appreciation of the euro since last year. I will now highlight the numbers on a currency neutral basis and also exclude special items related to litigation provisions, most of which we have already announced in late June.","Net revenue grew 18%, driven by strong underlying performance, and it includes a 4 ppt benefit from the new revenue recognition rules and acquisitions. Excluding this, underlying revenue growth was 14%. Operating expenses increased by 6%, which includes a 6 ppt increase due to the new revenue recognition rules and acquisitions. Operating income grew by 28%, or 26% if you exclude the revenue recognition and acquisition related impacts that I just noted.","Net income was up 45%, reflecting strong operating results and the impact of the U.S. tax reform, which contributed approximately 7 ppt to this net income growth. EPS was $1.66, up by 48% year over year, with share repurchases contributing $0.03 per share. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.5 billion worth of stock and an additional $279 million through July 23, 2018.","Let me go to page 4, and here you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 14% on a local currency basis, similar to last quarter. We saw solid double-digit growth across most regions. U.S. GDV grew 9%, down 1 ppt from last quarter, and was made up of credit and debit growth of 8% and 11% respectively. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 16%, similar to last quarter, primarily due to Europe and Asia-Pacific.","Cross-border volume grew at a healthy 19% on a local currency basis, driven by double digit growth in all regions, with the strongest growth contribution coming from Europe. This was down 2 ppt from the first quarter due to lower cryptocurrency purchases and one less switching day in Q2. This was in line with our expectations.","Turning to page 5 now, switched transactions continued to show strong growth at 17% globally, normalized to exclude Venezuelan transactions, as we no longer consolidate that entity. We saw healthy double digit growth in switched transactions across all regions, led by Europe and the U.S. In addition, global card growth was 7%, again, normalized for Venezuela. And globally, there are 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued.","Let us go to page 6 for highlights of a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The 18% net revenue increase was primarily driven by strong volume and transaction growth as well as growth in services. The new revenue recognition rules and acquisitions contributed 4 ppt to the growth rate. Excluding these impacts, underlying net revenue growth was 14%. This solid growth was in line with our expectations, as an increase in deal closings and implementations in Q2 caused rebates and incentives to pick up from Q1 levels as planned, and we lapped the VocaLink acquisition at the end of April.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments grew 22% while worldwide GDV grew 14%, the difference being primarily due to the impact of the new revenue recognition rules. Cross-border volume fees grew 18% while cross-border volume was up 19%. The 1 ppt gap is mostly due to higher intra-Europe growth.","Transaction processing fees grew 20%, primarily driven by the 17% normalized growth in switched transactions as well as revenues from our various service offerings. And finally, other revenues grew 13%, driven by increases in our advisors and safety and security services.","Moving on to page 7, you can see that total operating expenses increased 6% excluding special items on a currency neutral basis. Underlying operating expense growth was 7%, primarily related to investments in strategic initiatives, such as digital infrastructure, safety and security platforms, data analytics, and geographic expansion. The difference of 1% relates to the nearly offsetting effect of a 7 ppt benefit associated with FX hedging gains and a 6 ppt impact related to the new revenue recognition rules and acquisitions.","So let me turn to slide 8. And first, let's discuss what we have seen for the first three weeks of July, where our drivers are generally similar to what we saw in the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. Starting with switched volume, we saw global growth of 15%, similar to the second quarter, with solid growth in all regions. In the U.S., our switched volume grew 11%, and outside the U.S. it grew 19%, both similar to what we saw in the second quarter. Globally, switched transaction growth was 17%, the same as in the second quarter, with healthy growth in each region.","And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 18% globally, down 1 ppt sequentially, due to slightly lower growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific. This is in line with our expectations. And as a reminder, we anticipate facing more difficult cross-border comps in the second half of the year.","Turning to our thoughts for the full year of 2018, which I will describe on a currency neutral basis excluding special items, frankly, not much has changed with the exception of foreign exchange. As we've heard from Ajay, although we are monitoring certain macroeconomic factors, they have yet to show up in the numbers, and global economic trends are generally positive. Our business fundamentals remain strong, as we had a solid first half. And we continue to expect year-over-year revenue growth to be in the high teens. As a reminder, this growth includes the impact of the new revenue recognition rules that we adopted in 2018 and the full-year effect of acquisitions.","And with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect foreign exchange will be a benefit to revenue of between 0.5 ppt to 1 ppt for the year. We had previously estimated a 2 ppt benefit. And this means that we expect FX will be a headwind in each of the next two quarters.","On operating expenses, not much has changed. Although we had some foreign exchange hedging benefits in Q2, we continue to expect year-over-year expense growth to be in the mid-teens. This growth includes the impacts of the new revenue recognition rules, the full-year effect of acquisitions, and our investment in our Center for Inclusive Growth. For Q3, we do expect marketing expenses to increase sequentially and total operating expenses to grow in line with our annual expectations.","So with that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session. Warren?","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Martina. Christa, we're now ready to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you, thank you very much. Two questions if I could, one on VocaLink and then one on Mastercard Send. First of all, are you comfortable with the trends in VocaLink? And, Ajay, there are several contracts there, and I think some of those contracts are up for bid. Is there some risk of losing part of that business or in expanding it? What are your thoughts on VocaLink?","And I just wondered with Mastercard Send, do you view that as the equivalent of Visa Direct and the opportunities to be the same? Thank you.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So first of all, VocaLink is doing well. We're actually happy with all the underlying trends as well as the opportunities that we see with VocaLink in other parts of the world. We've got VocaLink in both licensed software form as well as a little more role to play in different countries, in Sweden and Thailand, PromptPay is run by VocaLink software. And in fact, our business in Thailand is benefiting not just from the relationship with the Central Bank of Thailand that comes from the ACH work there, but also on debit. And so VocaLink and us I think that's working the right way.","The contract that VocaLink has in the UK is the best guess of what I think you're referring to, we actually have an extension on the largest one out to 2022. But look, all contracts are competitive and they come up for bidding. And people are going to bid against us, and we're going to try our best to extend it beyond that and keep winning them. And there will be some that you'll win, some that you won't. Right now, things are okay with VocaLink and they look good, and the expansion opportunities with VocaLink look good. So that's the first part of the story.","The part about Mastercard Send, Mastercard Send is a loosely used term to include both the ability to move money from a card to a card, but also in combination with VocaLink's current capabilities from an account to an account, and also in combination with our JV with HomeSend on \u2013 there are too many sends in these words, but with that JV you also get the chance to move the money to mobile phones and the like around the world.","So when you look at the capabilities that we've got together, it's not just the card-to-card capability. It is the account-to-account and also to mobile phone numbers. That I would believe is far superior to what most other institutions can claim to have once you actually dig into the details of what we are capable of doing. That is what we're trying to put together.","For example, in my opening remarks, I talked about the UK. There it's a combination of the card-to-card but also VocaLink's Faster Payments network link to be able to do account-to-account payments. That's what gives you the P2P business case and the B2C disbursement business case. And so my belief is that it's the combination of assets that matters and the choice that we provide to banks and merchants and governments. With us they can get what they want out of that combination like a menu-driven approach.","So all in all, I'd say we're in a good place with VocaLink. I like what I see when we're going elsewhere. I think in the UK, we're going well with VocaLink. I think the opportunities of the combination of assets of Mastercard Send, VocaLink, and in fact the HomeSend JV, all that put together is really a good plus for us.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Bob, let me just add a couple of operational stats on the Mastercard Send rails. We have access to more than 3 billion bank accounts and over 100 countries. And we have clearly a rapid growth rate, albeit it's still on a very low base.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks. I was hoping two things you can comment, one on the UK PSR's report that was published yesterday or two days ago on acquiring \u2013 if you can, just give your thoughts on the broader industry from that.","And secondly, if you can, comment on the outage that was recently reported. What caused that, and if there will be any impact we should think about for third quarter? Thanks.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Craig. So first of all for third quarter, the UK PSR's report, by the time they actually get together, analyze all the aspects of the UK card acquiring services and their practices, that's going to take a fair amount of time to work our way through it.","Look, what typically the PSR does is they will do a broad assessment of the market, and they'll figure out is it working properly? Is it delivering the outcomes they want? And they're going to look at all the range of factors related to the services which acquirers provide to merchants. And I think this whole thing is a year to two years in the making.","So then to get to that, I'm sure they'll also want to talk to us about \u2013 even though we're not an acquirer, they'll want to talk to us about the role we play in that whole ecosystem, and that's a good thing. I actually believe that transparency and a dialogue around the role we play, the role acquirers play in the ecosystem is great in a market like the UK.","As far as the outage is concerned, honestly, our outage was for only a short period of time. It related to extra traffic on a server in certain sites got zapped off of that. We were back to normal soon after that and moved right on. So I don't even know whether you'll see an impact in any quarter out of that kind of an outage. It's not really an outage. It's a slowing down of the approval rate of transactions, the speed of approval of those transactions in a period of time lasting for an hour to an hour and a half, depending on which part of the market you were in.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just first question is really around the margin sustainability. When we back out some of the M&A adjustments, it looks like it was pretty flat. And margins were \u2013 I mean expenses were generally flat. Margins look pretty strong. And I guess just your thought process on that and rationale and I guess strategy of whether or not you still think that could just be a side effect of what you need to invest and grow revenues versus letting it expand.","And then just quickly, Martina, on the tax rate expectations for the year, if you don't mind updating us on that.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Let me do the last one because it's easy. It's just basically saying a repeat of what I said at the last quarter. It's going to be 19% to 20% given all of the benefits that are running in from the U.S. tax reform as well as on the Belgian tax reform as well as some of the tax structures that are still benefiting us out of our Asia-Pacific operation, so really no change from that.","On the margin comment, Darrin, it's really no different from what we had said before. As you know, we have been evaluating every year, given the set of businesses and the expansion of the businesses that we have, what kind of minimum margin profile should we have as a company, which is that 50%-plus that you get to hear from us when we iterate our three-year financial performance target.","What we do is we take the extra margin that we're making on the core business and investing it very significantly in terms of expanding in the other things that we have been talking about. One is the services, right? Many of these different services have actually lower margin other than safety and security fraud services. But we're investing in that still heavily, such as data analytics, such as loyalty, et cetera, and that will continue to happen.","The second expansion that we have been talking about in a fairly significant way since our last Investor Day in September 2017 is the investments that we're doing in the B2B space. Remember, the $120 trillion of opportunity which we are taking certain slices of the opportunity, and those kind of investments will continue to stay with us.","So no changes, when you see some margin expansion coming through from time to time, they're really two factors. One is our revenue line happens to be higher than what we set up in the budget, and we're not going to be able to of course-correct that quickly to be taking the extra dollar to be investing it in additional investment. And number two, you should be expecting that over time in our services line items, the margins are going up simply because we're going to run more volume over that.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","The services business, you've heard me talk about just a little while ago somewhere in the first question. I think I talked about Thailand and PromptPay and ACH and debit. By doing all those things with the Central Bank of Thailand, not only are we doing Fast ACH and the debit switching partnership. We're also running our services through them, which gives us scale, be it safety and security, be it other kinds of data analytics. What that does is it gives us a much broader, wider relationship, as that is what we're investing our money into is to create a stable system of having a broader, wider relationship beyond just the core payment transaction revenue stream that used to be in this company the primary source of revenue 8, 9, 10 years ago. That's what we're trying to build. And then if we get to scale with those services, as Martina said, you expand the margin on each of them as you go along.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. I was hoping to drill in a little bit on your purchase volume growth number. If I'm looking at it, it looks like FX-neutral purchase volume growth was about 15.5% in the quarter, which our quick look back looked like we hadn't seen a number close to that since about 2012. So could you just parse apart a little bit what's driving that acceleration? And in particular, is it \u2013 do you see \u2013 is this underlying secular cash displacement? Is this e-com related acceleration? Is this share gains? Is this some early impact from Mastercard Send? What would you call out?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Okay. So, Lisa, Mastercard Send, as I said before, that's still a relatively low base, so that is not really driving the numbers. The numbers are really driven by our core business and all the good work that many of our \u2013 all of our employees are doing around the world. So when I start with the U.S. you can look at the numbers. And I know you're talking purchase volume. I really generally talk gross dollar volume because it shows the entirety of the company and what we're going after. But you obviously see in the United States a really nice step up both from a credit and from a debit point of view as you're looking over the last five, six quarters. And that is we have been talking about the U.S. in terms of winning quite a few businesses, particularly in the co-brand space, and you're starting slowly but surely to getting all these wins coming into the numbers.","When you look at overseas, we actually had terrific growth in many, many of the regions. Europe is obviously outstanding, right? You can see those numbers every year. There's really no change in terms of how Javier [Perez] and the team are going after those kinds of businesses. We will be at it down the road a little bit more in the UK because of some of the UK businesses that we have won and a couple of other countries. But I would suspect that that will just continue to be providing this fantastic double digit growth trend that we're seeing from a volume perspective in Europe.","When you go to Asia-Pacific, Asia-Pacific, I'm throwing Middle East-Africa in it. As Ajay talked a little bit this morning, there are some ups and downs in it, right? So we're seeing China still good growth, but it's in the high single-digit kind of range at this point in time. But you're seeing from the other countries really good growth that's additive. By the way, in India, if I were to tell you this, it's almost a 30% growth rate at this point. This is still some of the benefits from the demonetization. Middle East-Africa, some of the numbers have been starting to come back simply because the countries feel a little bit better as they're oil producing.","And then when I look at Latin America, that is where you see a bit more challenges in terms of the numbers. While you might think the domestic volumes are okay, they have from a cross-border point of view a bit of a challenge because of the devaluation of the currency, in particular of the real. And by the way, my comment for the third and the fourth quarter, where I said that we probably will see tailwinds on the foreign exchange. It's mostly related to the real, not really to the euro.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","The only two things I would add to that, Lisa.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Headwind \u2013 let me just say, I said tailwind, headwind.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Okay, headwind. The only thing I'd add to that \u2013 tail and head. Anyway, the only thing I'd add to that is in the U.S., remember, we've also won affluent products like the Capital One Saver card and Bank of America's Cash Rewards card. Those issuings are beginning to happen. You will see results off that. And in India, we have actually done really well on debit growth. We have got \u2013 last quarter I talked about Bank of Baroda. This quarter actually I didn't mention it but I was there a little while ago. We signed a deal with Bank of India. These are large public sector banks. We already had the State Bank of India and a bunch of others. Our debit business in India is doing well. Our ability on debit to be seen as a real partner for growth is good.","And so I'd say you're seeing the results of both secular movement in a country like India, but you're also seeing in a lot of countries around the world some of the impact of some of the business wins of the last few years. And I would be a little cautious about cross-border in some places because of both foreign exchange. We're also a little cautious about the impact in China and Korea right now caused by what's going on with central bank actions and oil prices and the like.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Perfect, thank you.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","You had one more question, which was e-commerce. I just want to add to that. E-commerce continues to grow in a terrific way. For this quarter it was about 24%.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan","Thanks, good morning. Maybe just to build on your answer to Lisa's question, I'm just curious on the timing of some of the new wins like L.L.Bean, Santander, Bank of America, as you mentioned. Have we seen those kick in yet? And I think some of that comes in next year, I know.","And then also as a quick follow-up, I know you mentioned some challenger bank wins like N26 in Germany. Why have you guys done so well you think with the challenger banks? I know Resolute and even Venmo\/PayPal, et cetera, have all issued under Mastercard. Why is that? Thanks.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Tien-Tsin, the first part, there's the speed. Those are all rolling in. You know this business well. You know how it comes. I would tell you that the L.L.Bean stuff is very early stages, very, very. It's just begun literally. The UK wins, TSB, Santander are all early next year. They're actually just not even coming yet. That's why in Lisa's answer, I was saying we should expect to see more of these recent wins roll in later, but some of the earlier wins are showing up today. So it's the nature of the mix of our business. And I think that on the whole, the trends on our share growth as well as secular movement are helpful to us at this stage.","The aspect of digital banks, I actually believe that the reason that we are winning digital banks is just that, in addition to our good looks, we have guys who actually care deeply about the fact that the environment, the ecosystem is adapting and changing around the world, where digital banks are having a role to play. They're smaller today, but they're offering a different product set and a different construct. And you have to be capable of flexibly moving your product offering and your benefit system to suit what they want and they hold as valuable as compared to what a merchant may hold or a different kind of bank may hold. It's just different strokes for different folks.","I'm a believer that our future will be built on choice and on offering bundled solutions. And those are the two things I'm very focused on building, choice across every category of payment. So we want to digitize every form of payment and we want to allow every form of payment to be available as a one-stop shop from us. You want it, we've got it. That's the approach that we're trying to use. And you combine that with bundling both payments with all these other services solutions that a number of the newer banks want. They don't have those capabilities themselves, be it fraud management, be it data analytics, be it processing data, loyalty and rewards. If we can try to bundle these things together, then we get a good attractive conversation going with them. I think that's probably what's helping us right now.","Tien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan","All right, good to know. Thanks a lot.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. I guess following up on VocaLink, I believe there's also an initiative to overhaul the Fast ACH infrastructure, Ajay, could you just talk about how that might affect VocaLink and maybe its positioning there?","And then just one quick question on FX. Martina, I know you mentioned the cross-border volumes were in line with expectation, and they were obviously quite strong. I'm just curious if there are any signs of impact from a strengthening dollar. Thanks.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Sanjay, I was in the UK \u2013 I don't know \u2013 I think last week or the week before. And this idea of looking at the Fast ACH infrastructure is actually not something that's got either clarity or dimension to it. VocaLink, the Faster Payments system, the banks are all talking to the payment systems regulator and the others thereabout what the future of Faster Payments in the UK should look like, what other feature functionality should be built into it and the like.","So as far as I'm concerned, even if you look at VocaLink itself, the technology being used to drive Faster Payments in the UK, it's scale, scope, capability, speed, the number of transactions, the amount of data that flows back and flows through each transaction. If you compare that to what currently we are bidding with in our markets with VocaLink, and already there's a difference because that technology is moving very fast. And what we do is we build. We build in another place and we roll that technology back into the prior markets, a bit like we do with Mastercard, when new releases go back and they build the quality of the original infrastructure in the older markets as well. So honestly, we are involved in that discussion. I don't know whether they have got legs yet or not. I don't know what the dimensions will be. But we're very deeply embedded and involved with all conversations on Faster Payments in new countries.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","On the strengthening dollar question, we are seeing a bit of an impact on U.S. acquiring. So it's still double digits. It's in the low teens. It used to be high teens last quarter. And really, what we're seeing is inbound from LAC and from Asia-Pacific tempering a little bit. So early days, we'll see if that has more legs.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Christa, we're ready for the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Harshita Rawat - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Ajay and Martina, I want to ask about QR codes. As you know, QR codes drastically reduce the cost of payments acceptance, and it does appear that many emerging markets such as India evolved to use that as one of their payment methods. And I know you have a product with the QR codes standard, which you are rolling out in other emerging countries as well. So my question to you is how do you envision competing with very nimble local players and Internet giants on the QR code front when you often have to rely on banks as a distribution channel in many markets?","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So first of all, QR codes reducing acceptance cost, just quickly let's just parse that statement a little bit. What it actually does is reduce the initial capital cost of installing a terminal in a merchant store as compared to a QR code system, which could be a static QR code which is put on a merchant's counter, which by the way, has all kinds of issues involved with ensuring that it is managed well, compared to a dynamic QR code, which could be generated and put onto a mobile phone, either by the merchant or the consumer, and clearly has more security features built into it.","That capital cost is substantial in terms of an older terminal, which could cost $500. That capital cost is not substantially different when you're comparing it to a dongle like a Square dongle or somebody else's dongle. What I'm trying to get across to you is the actual story around the cost of acceptance of QR codes needs to be understood in its entirety, not in one-off buzzwords that get passed out by companies that believe that QR codes are the answer to the future of mankind on acceptance.","I would tell you that acceptance growing from current 50 million merchants to get it to the next 50 million or in India to go from the current 3 million \u2013 4 million, which is dramatic growth over 1 million of a year ago, to get to 60 million, which is the opportunity in India, that QR codes may not be the only solution. It will be a mix of dongles, QR codes, and terminals that will go through the system. And within QR codes, it will be static QR codes versus dynamic QR codes. And within dynamic QR codes, it will be consumer presented ones versus merchant presented ones. That is a fairly complicated ecosystem.","And I'm not trying to compete with somebody else building out their own QR code. I'm just trying to say when you've got that kind of complexity, there is a benefit in having standardized ways of rolling these out. And the standardized way of rolling out QR codes that EMVCo is putting out there, which as you know is supported by all the members of EMVCo, which include Visa, AmEx, Discover, but also China UnionPay, is that we are trying to put these standardized QR codes out there as a way of making it simpler for acquirers and merchants to integrate one time as compared to multiple times, not different to the story of secure remote commerce, the single checkout button online, which also is trying to take away from the complexity of merchant and acquirer integration for online payments.","So I view all this as a developing ecosystem, and I view us as being people who place bets on every one of these acceptance expansion systems as compared to picking winners and losers because our job is to create standards that the rails can be built on so that we can get to scale. And I'm participating in all of these actively, whether it's in India with Bharat QR, whether it's in other markets across Pakistan, Africa, parts of Asia, where I consider this to be a real opportunity. But I want to do it with standardization and I want to do it with safety and security. And I would prefer to do it therefore in collaboration not just with banks, but for example, in India with the payment banks. We're already out there with a bunch of offers with Airtel Bank and with the Indian Post Office Bank for quite a while in India, not now. We're doing Airtel Bank issuing and acquiring for a while.","So to be honest with you, I think of QR codes and I see it as an ongoing evolution of acceptance efforts, just as dongles were a great evolution from the older terminal.","Harshita Rawat - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Perfect, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Hi, Ajay. Hi, Martina. You guys mentioned maybe a global deal with Worldpay, so a two-part question related to that. One is any thoughts on Pay by Bank rolling out beyond the UK and the opportunity there? And secondly, maybe use the tokenization comment to parse out the monetization opportunity associated with tokenization broadly.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So I want to be clear on tokenization and monetization. We don't either try to monetize tokenization by charging a fee for it. Neither do we force that as a method of steering any transactions around. That is not our way. Our stand with tokenization is to raise the level of water in the river so that the thief finds it tougher to swim. And you don't do that by charging fees for raising the level of water.","So what we are trying to do here is to make it safer for the industry as a whole, and the effort is to get digital transactions and then card-on-file transactions and eventually every account-to-account based transaction to have the benefit of a secure cryptogram-protected token in front of it. That's the visualization of where they're going over the next few years. And that's a journey we're on, and I think that's the journey most people in the industry are on. It's a way of raising the level of the water in the river. And that's the idea.","So back to Pay by Bank, I think Pay by Bank is a really interesting idea, but you've got to make sure that it has real acceptance in the marketplace. In the UK, it's very early days because it's only now with HSBC, Barclays, Worldpay, as I mentioned, the Wirecard guys, and I'm beginning to think of the UK as having a certain amount of scale being attached rolling out Pay by Bank, at least for online purchases where consumers could pay with their mobile banking app.","I consider Pay by Bank to be an interesting app in other markets, where let's assume in our ACH, if there is an ACH of Fast ACH system in a country in which we cannot play directly, somebody else is operating that Fast ACH. Then we have a choice. We could help that Fast ACH to operate more like a scheme by providing chargeback, dispute management, revenue sharing rules, and then add the app on top of it. Or if the scheme is also running now, we then provide the app to our member banks and to merchants and non-banks, digital players, as a way to get to enable consumers to pay directly with their bank account.","So I view Pay by Bank as having many different roles, only one of which is the UK type role where we're also the infrastructure. They could be rolled in other markets where they're not the infrastructure, or when we're part of the infrastructure. And you will see over the next few years effort on this space, just as \u2013 these things have a longer gestation period because it's a difference in the way a bank or a merchant has to interact as well as a difference in the way the consumer has to think about paying.","The same thing is true of commercial B2B things. These things don't change on a dime. You put out product, you put out capability, and then you've got to work your way into the ecosystem for people to care about them and switch on to them in scale. And both Pay by Bank and our commercial efforts are things we're putting into the pipeline for the next three, four, five, six years of driving our revenue.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question, a question on your B2B strategy for a moment. Can you maybe talk about your sales and distribution strategy for B2B? You've talked a lot about the technology solutions in the past. But could you maybe talk a bit more about the ways you're going to market? Is it sufficient for you to go to market through partner banks? Do you intend to open up other distribution channels or maybe even direct distribution channels? And then collectively, when might the B2B opportunity start to be material in terms of revenue where it's noticeable to us on the P&L? Is that two, three, five, or more years out?","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","It depends what you mean B2B. B2B is a very big world. And in fact, that is stuff that is very material in our P&L today, which is our commercial cards business. Corporate T&E cards, purchasing cards, fleet cards, virtual cards, that is material today in our business, growing handsomely, giving us good margins, and in fact delivering good returns for us, not just domestically but also cross-border.","Then there's the B2B space that comprises the things we could do with Mastercard Send or VocaLink or HomeSend, as I was talking earlier, or combinations of those. Those products are both for consumer reasons but also B2B, also B2C, also P2P. That stuff is what you'll see over the next two, three, five years being developed.","The distribution channel for that as compared to the traditional commercial business, the distribution channel for that is, in fact, very effective through banks because of one very simple reason. Most banks tend to be focused on larger-sized transactions in the cross-border B2B space. And there is a great deal of space in the relatively smaller cross-border B2B space, which is inefficient both in terms of the scaling, authorizing, and settlement times involved, but also relatively inefficient in terms of the data that is exchanged at the point of payment and the fraud opportunities that exist in that system, all of which we can bring to the party through these larger banks as their partner to extend their target market as well.","But then there are also other ways of getting to that marketplace. There are ways of getting to that marketplace which go through distribution channels run through digital companies. But very often, they will need partner banks anyway because those companies are not banks. Without being a bank, how do you operate the digital or other cross-border P2P or B2B business of exchanging money? You need banks in the system.","So you've got to be careful about what you mean by distribution. Does distribution mean getting to get someone to start understanding the product to then use it, or does distribution mean that the rails still need banking to run? And I will tell you in most places the rails still need banks to run them. The question of how you get them to those SMEs or those middle-sized companies, you could do it directly through banks or you could do it through alternative chains that you could utilize over time. Bring them on, bring in all of them. But we believe that banks are great partners in this space because they need to play the role where the money needs to be exchanged. They play a very critical role in that process.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Jim, first of all, what Ajay mentioned in terms of our commercial business that we already have, I just want to remind you. It's about 11% of our global volume, so it's fairly significant. In 2017 it grew in the mid-teens. And then secondly, in terms of the distributions channel and how Ajay has described it, a real example of that is what he had actually mentioned in his remarks, which is AvidXchange. So AvidXchange works with the distribution channel of the banks, so we can obviously bring the power of those relationships to it and making sure that these great products are getting to the smaller companies and the medium-sized companies. And that does not mean that AvidXchange is not working and we are not working with other fin-techs, but it has to get distributed to those small companies, and the connection point is through their banks.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","I'm really glad you asked this. You take, for example, the work we do with commercial payments. We partnered with WEX for the last 15 years across multiple geographies and multiple verticals, travel, payables, media. We're growing our business together in both those verticals and emerging verticals. We do joint business development campaigns with them. We do virtual card acceptance initiatives. We've done research studies with them focused on travel trends and vertical deep dives. So actually partners like WEX, partners like Fleetcor, partners like CNET, these are all interesting and incredible ways to distribute this product that we've been building through the years that I can recall being a part of this company.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.

I was wondering if you can provide insight on how the B2B Hub is progressing versus your internal expectations. And I guess specifically, how is the bank partnership and merchant pipeline looking? And also, could you give any color into the feedback you've been receiving?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So, Andrew (sic) [Oscar] (57:17), first of all, as we told the market some time ago that the product that's first rolling out with Fifth Third. It has started to roll out, and so we are going to see what kind of feedback we are getting. But obviously, they're a key client. And depending on how it's going, it's very early days. We're talking literally a few weeks that it has been in the market. Depending on how this is going, we actually have a whole pipeline of clients that are also wanting to expand on this product.","Remember, this is a product that goes really for mostly small and medium-sized companies. And there are only two handfuls worth of banks in the United States who are really reaching those kinds of clients, and those are the ones that are interested in it. But first we're going to have to get through the initial couple of months with Fifth Third.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","I actually see the B2B Hub as having incredible applicability as an idea in markets in Asia and the like as well, because that's where SMEs drive a very large part of the business, both domestic and export. It's close to 60% \u2013 65% of the GDP, while some of those countries comes out of the SME export and manufacturing capability in those countries. And so you're going to have to do it differently there. And that's why this requires a rail period, both in terms of technology and partnerships, to the earlier question, and we are deep in the midst of that.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Christa, I think we have time for one final quick question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Dan, are you there? Are you on mute?","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can you hear me?","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Yes, now we can.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Hey, Dan, you went off again.","Operator","Dan, your line is open.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","We're having trouble. I think we'll just go to the next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tell us when we'll get an update an extension of the long-term guidance. I know it expires at the end of this year but we're...","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","All right. Jason. I think the question \u2013 we're having a little trouble hearing you, but I think the question was when will we update the long-term guidance.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","I just don't know if you had something in the end. So, Jason, yes, at the end of this year the long-term guidance will have run out. That is our 3- year guidance. And I told the market that I would like to make sure that we have a little bit more time with the new revenue recognition rules so that we really understand how that is going to roll into the future. And so you should be looking forward after we are closing off 2018 for our new long-term guidance. And again, it will be our long-term guidance period that we will be putting out.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Great, thank you, Ajay, do you have any final comments?","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Yes, just a few closing thoughts. We've delivered a strong first half to the year as we continued to execute on what we've been discussing as our strategic priorities with you. I think we're pleased with our deal momentum. That came up in the number of questions a little earlier in both consumer and commercial as we strike new relationships and expand existing ones.","We' are focused on building up our product capabilities, all aimed at providing choice to consumers, to merchants, to bank partners, including solutions that reach beyond cards. And the services that we provide to advisers, loyalty, data analytics, and our fraud management systems and processing continue I believe to differentiate our business and provide a great support to our core payments operation.","So with that, thank you all for your continued support for the company.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Kneeshaw, you may begin.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Tashan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open to accept registrations.","You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data, and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.","Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a currency-neutral basis and exclude special items and the impact of acquisitions unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents.","As a reminder, we've added a table at the end of both documents which provide additional information about the impact of Article 8 of the EU's payments regulation on our GDV and purchase volume growth rates. Our comments on the call will be on the basis of rates adjusted for these impacts.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind you that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga. Ajay?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everybody. So we continue to execute well against our strategy. You can see that in our strong second quarter financial and operational performance. We're really pleased. We're delivering net revenue growth of 14% and if you exclude a special item related to a legal provision that we took last year in the same quarter, EPS growth is 16%, both of these numbers on a currency-neutral basis.","In terms of the global economic environment, not much has changed since the last quarter. The U.S. economy just continues its steady growth trajectory; low unemployment, low inflation, healthy consumer confidence, and if you look at our SpendingPulse data, retail sales ex auto were up 3.6%, that's kind of similar to last quarter.","In Europe, real GDV is expected to grow by about 2% this year, in 2017. Consumer confidence is continuing to improve and that's primarily driven by Germany and Spain. But, of course, unemployment does remain relatively high in some of the EU countries.","Now in the UK, interestingly, despite ongoing concerns around Brexit, SpendingPulse showed solid overall retail sales growth of 5% in the quarter and that's partly driven by higher consumer spending due to rising inflation, the lower pound basically.","In Asia, we continue to see strong economic growth in India and several of the ASEAN countries.","In Latin America, despite all the recent political turmoil and sustained high unemployment, Brazil is showing both consumer and business confidence improving. Economic growth in Mexico has been solid, driven by consumer spending. Venezuela, of course, continues to deteriorate, triple digit inflation, high foreign exchange volatility.","With this backdrop, we're kind of pleased with the growth we're seeing across our business. We're seeing double digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. We're continuing to win deals by differentiating with services and, of course, by leveraging the work we're doing in digital.","In terms of key business updates, as you know, we recently closed the VocaLink acquisition. We're just pleased that we now have the ability to offer both card and bank account-based payment solutions to our customers.","If you look at the payment flows in the top 50 countries around the world, a significant portion of the payments are being made via ACH. With Fast ACH, in particular, we have the ability to now enable payments to and from any bank account in real time. And that expands our reach to more end points, including businesses, governments and consumers, who may only have a bank account and not a card. And as you can imagine, for consumers, that's not that infrequent in many markets around the world.","Further, VocaLink's Fast ACH is well suited for certain use cases and why is that? That's because of its enhanced data and messaging capabilities. So, for instance, it can connect to ERP systems to facilitate B2B payables and receivable management, but it can also support bill pay through its Request to Pay messaging capability.","As of now, over 25 countries are actively pursuing Fast ACH networks, a number of which have already launched. VocaLink currently provides those capabilities to the UK, Sweden, Singapore, Thailand and, of course, in the United States, with the clearinghouse, and it's also engaged in many other such opportunities.","Now, VocaLink and Fast ACH complement our Mastercard Send push payment service. What that does is it facilitates the delivery of funds in near real-time, not real-time, to virtually all debit card accounts in the United States.","In addition, by leveraging the exclusive capabilities from what we have with our HomeSend JV, we can enable cross-border payments to over 85 markets, now by connecting into cash in and cash-out locations, by connecting into mobile wallets and bank accounts.","So what we have now is a unique combination of product offerings that we believe will allow us to better facilitate consumer choice. And through that process, capture an even greater set of new payment flows.","What we will have is card rails, which we've had for years. We have Mastercard Send and now, Fast ACH rails. With this, Mastercard can become a one-stop shop for our customers, banks, merchants and governments. We're looking forward to talking to you more about our strategy around Fast ACH and our other network capabilities during our upcoming Investor Day.","Now in the safety and security space, we recently announced our agreement to acquire Brighterion, whose artificial intelligence based technology enables more accurate decision-making and fraud scoring at the time of the transaction, obviously to mitigate risk and also reduce false declines. Now adding that capability expands our advanced suite of security products and expertise in fraud migration, in authentication and decision intelligence, while trying to make sure that the consumer has a seamless payment experience.","So, with that, I'm going to move on to some of our recent deal activity. And in the U.S., we continue to have success in the co-brand space. This quarter, we're pleased to announce Kroger, the largest grocery chain in the world, will be converting their credit portfolio with U.S. Bank to Mastercard. Still with U.S. Bank, that's our partner in this co-brand.","In addition, we won a new co-brand program with Belk, a department store chain with about 300 locations throughout the United States and renewed our credit co-brand agreement with Toys \"R\" Us.","We also renewed Saturn (8:20) there in the U.S. for their credit and debit business, which includes our Decision Intelligence, fraud solutions and gateway processing services. In each of these deals, our innovative solutions and value-added services were key differentiators for us.","Building on the agreement we announced in the U.S. last year, we're pleased to extend our partnership with PayPal into Asia-Pacific, which brings similar features and benefits to this region. In fact, we've just announced and signed that in the last 24 hours. We've been working with PayPal around the world for a long time, as most of their co-brand cards globally are Mastercard-branded. And just for an example, in Europe, we have multiple co-brands with them, including a prepaid program in Italy, commercial debit in the UK and, by the way, they've also been a licensed issuer in the region since 2011.","Now talking about Europe, we continue to drive strong performance and win new deals there. I'm going to give you a couple of examples. We have renewed and expanded our agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo in Italy, which is one of the largest banks in the country for their credit, debit and prepaid business and that includes advisor services.","We're also pleased with some recent progress in the UK debit space. This quarter, we announced a deal with TSB to flip their entire debit portfolio to Mastercard, building on our existing relationship with them in credit. Now, this is a significant win for us because TSB's customers represent over 4% of all debit customers in the United Kingdom. The partnership also includes their commercial business and we'll leverage our expertise in digital, in fraud, data analytics and even our Priceless sponsorship assets to deliver an even better payment experience for TSB's customers.","China, as you know, we've been deeply engaged in navigating the potential opening of their domestic payments market. Back in March of this year, we actually submitted a draft application for a domestic bank card clearing institution. That early draft was informed by active considerations and conversations with the People's Bank of China and actually a number of potential partners as well in the market over the last two years. Now, more recent set of regulations got published, as you know, on June 30, so we're now finalizing our next application based on that new set of regulations. We're working through all our options for either a 100% Mastercard application or for a joint venture. We're going to make a decision on this and then file our next application.","Obviously, what's really important here is to get it right out of the gate. Because, remember, this is just another step in the process that will likely play out over the next 12 to 18 months as there are several review cycles from the Chinese regulators between now and that point of time.","At the same time, we've also been working on developing our technology network solution for China, which considers both national and cyber security standards and we're progressing well in that regard.","Now, in the meanwhile, what we are doing is continuing to make progress with single-branded cards and we've nearly quadrupled year-over-year single-brand card issuance, launched a total of 18 new programs in the first half of this year, including the first single-branded EMV Debit card in China with Bank of China, and a World card with ICBC, which is targeted at their affluent customer base.","So, finally, we're continuing to see growth in our commercial business, and is driven by a combination of innovation and some new deals. On the product front, we just recently announced the launch of the Mastercard B2B Hub, which is an innovative solution that enables small and medium-size businesses in the United States to automate their invoice and payment processes.","As you know, more than 50% of all B2B payments in the U.S. are still made via checks and if we can integrate this with more than our 130 accounting and back-office systems and also into inControl, our virtual card platform, now we believe this solution helps buyers and suppliers reduce the burden and the cost associated with manual payment processes and helps us to accelerate the conversion from check to electronic payment. The idea clearly is to capture new payment flows.","And in terms of new commercial payment deals in this space, we are pleased to have renewed and expanded our agreement with Citibank in the UAE for their commercial business. I think that win was basically driven by our virtual card platform as well as our ability to help drive B2B acceptance in the market.","We're also expanding our global partnership with Amadeus, which I spoke about last quarter, to the United States, with U.S. Bank as their exclusive issuer, as we continue to pursue the more than $300 billion in annual global payments that travel agencies make to airlines, hotels, and other travel providers, which by the way today are largely made via bank transfers and checks.","So turning to digital, we're making good progress with the execution of our Digital by Default strategy with issuers. We now have over 90 million enabled accounts and we're actually pleased to have partnered on the launch last week of Citi Pay in the U.S., which is powered by Masterpass. This wallet enables customers and consumers of Citibank to use their Citibank online login credentials to make seamless payments across all channels; online, in-app, in-store with their card number, which is protected through our MDES organization service.","We've also added U.S. Bank and SunTrust in the U.S. We've also added Davivienda in Columbia. That's the progress we are making. We are continuing our momentum on the digital acceptance side. We now have more than 340,000 online merchants across 38 markets in addition to the 6 million contactless locations in 96 countries, where Masterpass can be used.","This quarter, we're really pleased to have added Ann Taylor, LOFT, Hulu, Air Canada, Costco Canada. We've integrated Vodafone in Turkey, which is the second largest mobile network operator in that market to enable their more than 22 million subscribers to pay for mobile airtime minutes and other services using Masterpass.","And, finally, a good example of our thought leadership in driving the convergence from physical to digital can be seen in our partnership with EMVCo and other industry participants to enable greater choice in retail payments by creating a new global standard to ensure consistency, industry consistency in QR codes. And this builds on our momentum with the rollout of QR technology in Africa and India. In addition to the launch of BharatQR in India, which is now live with four large banks in the country, we've partnered with the Bank of Thailand and the Government of Thailand in support of their goal of creating a cashless society.","So, with that, I'm going to turn the call back to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. As you can see in the highlights on page 3, we have delivered another strong quarter ahead of our expectations.","Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out will be on a currency neutral basis, excluding a special item related to a legal provision taken last year. The FX impact was less of a headwind than expected at about 1 ppt, primarily due to the strength of the euro.","Net revenue growth was 14% due to strong underlying drivers and growth across our services, and includes approximately a 2 ppt benefit from the VocaLink acquisition.","Operating expenses increased by 17%, which includes a 6 ppt impact due to acquisitions primarily, VocaLink, and a 4 ppt impact due to FX related charges.","Operating income was up 12%. And EPS was $1.10, up 16% year-over-year, driven primarily by our strong operating performance with share repurchases contributing $0.03 per share. During the quarter, we repurchased $931 million worth of stock and an additional $226 million through July 24.","So let me turn to page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV growth, was 9% on a local currency basis, up 1 ppt from last quarter. U.S. GDV grew 3% and was made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 1%, respectively. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 11%, similar to last quarter.","Cross-border volume grew 14% on a local currency basis. Areas of real strength continued to be Europe, where we are seeing strong UK inbound and outbound volumes, as well as Russia, Italy and France. Latin America continues its recovery ,with Brazil and Mexico leading the way. And in Asia-Pacific, we see strong growth from South Korea, China and Japan. We have also seen higher cross-border growth rates to and from the United States.","Turning to page 5, switched transactions continue to show solid growth at 17% globally again this quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S. We saw continued strength in Brazil, Russia and India. Globally, there are 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.","Now let me turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Net revenue grew 14%, driven by continued strong volume, transaction and services growth, with VocaLink contributing about 2 ppt to this growth. Rebates and incentives grew 22%, reflecting higher volumes and incentives for new and renewed deals in line with expectations.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. So you may recall that last quarter I said the difference between fees charged and volumes and the domestic assessments and cross-border categories were mainly due to pricing, which was essentially offset in rebates and incentives as well as some mix. This continues to be the case this quarter.","Domestic assessments grew 14%, while worldwide GDV grew 9%. Cross-border volume fees grew 16%, while cross-border volume grew 14%. Transaction processing fees grew 18%, in line with the 17% growth in switched transactions.","And finally, other revenues grew 18%, most of the VocaLink revenues show up in this line. This more than offset the 5 ppt effect of the changes we made to our loyalty business in Asia that I have discussed with you last quarter.","Moving on to page 7, so here you can see that total operating expenses increased 17% on a currency neutral basis, excluding a special item taken last year. So this includes 6 ppt impact from acquisitions, that's primarily from VocaLink, including the impact of purchase accounting and integration related costs. And then there is a 4 ppt impact from higher FX charges related to hedging losses due to the weakening U.S. dollar and balance sheet re-measurement effects as a result of the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.","And excluding these items, operating expenses grew 7%, as we continued to invest in digital, geographic expansion and advisors capability. This also includes a 2 ppt impact from accelerated A&M spend related to the Masterpass awareness campaign.","Turning to slide 8, let's discuss what we have seen in July through the 21, where most of our drivers are similar or slightly lower than in Q2. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. So let me start with switched volume. We saw global growth of 10%, the same as what we saw in the second quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S. And in the U.S., our switched volume grew 2%, down a bit from the second quarter, with higher growth in credit, but lower switched volume in debit as we are lapping a number of 2016 PIN wins. And gas had really no impact on our July numbers.","Switched volume outside the U.S. grew 18%, up a bit from the second quarter. Globally switched transactions growth was 15%, down 2 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter, with similar growth outside the U.S. And the U.S. slowed 4 ppt, due to lower PIN growth that I was just mentioning under switched volume.","With respect to cross-border, our volumes remained strong, up 14% globally. That's very similar to what we saw in the second quarter.","So let me look ahead and our underlying business fundamentals remained strong. We continue to grow our business through a combination of new and renewed agreements as well as our expanded set of service offerings.","We had a strong first half and we are particularly pleased with the progress we are making in Europe and in Latin America. As we look forward to the second half of the year, we are forecasting this momentum to continue.","Based on current foreign exchange rates, we now anticipate FX headwinds will subside, primarily due to the weakening U.S. dollar. For the year, we continue to expect net revenue will grow at a low double-digit year-over-year rate on a currency neutral basis excluding acquisitions. And for Q3, we expect net revenue growth to be similar to what we saw in Q2, again, on a currency neutral basis excluding acquisitions.","On expenses, we expect year-over-year total operating expenses to continue to grow in the high single digit range on a currency neutral basis excluding acquisition and special items. Also of note, we're extending our support of the rollout of Masterpass through the acceleration of A&M spend in the third quarter. So in particular, we expect A&M spending to be up by about $35 million versus the year ago quarter.","And we continue to forecast recent acquisitions, most notably, VocaLink, will be about $0.05 to $0.06 dilutive in 2017, driven primarily by purchase accounting and integration related costs. Separately, you should assume a tax rate of about 28% based on our current expectations of regional mix.","So, with that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session. Warren?","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer session. In order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back for additional questions. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Congrats on the solid quarter. Ajay, just want to ask, on the whole Push Payments opportunity, seems like it's a big market for a lot of folks. And thinking about one of your competitors was recently talking about that they didn't need to purchase an ACH network or anything with ACH capability; they had it already with their capability with Visa Direct. Just wanted to get your analysis on that on why the VocaLink acquisition was necessary?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So, I think that Mastercard Send is similar in a way to other offerings in the marketplace. We could have taken that, combined it with our HomeSend JV, extended its reach to mobile wallets and cash-in and cash-out points around the world. That's one way to have built it. There would be some challenges still left with that to really enable that to compete the way Fast ACH is growing around the world. Those challenges are actually quite interesting and require a real solution to solve for. I'm not saying you can't solve for it organically and try and build it. I just think that's more expensive and a longer solution with less credibility of working than if you pick up a unit like VocaLink with its enormous reputation in the UK where it operates the payments infrastructure, but also its ability in multiple countries around the world. ACH has been a country-by-country business. VocaLink is one of the only players in the world that has demonstrated the ability to take its software and apply it in markets as diverse as Sweden and the UK and the United States and Singapore and Thailand and so on. That's the first point.","I think the second point is the nature of the data flows; now this is a little bit more in the commercial B2B payment space, the nature of the data flows that come back-and-forth over VocaLink's B2B payment enabled system is such that you get their ISO 20022 dealer standard. So what they get is far more information that allows them to integrate seamlessly with B2B ERP systems, with e-commerce systems and cross-border payments are also built in there, as standard. They have directories which combines the VocaLink IPS system with these directories, simplifies the flow of payments, simplifies payment requests. So, the aspects in the B2B space that I think with the richer data set and the better connectivity of VocaLink Fast ACH that I think are actually quite important to be able to play a good role in that space.","So the combination of these two is kind of what prompted us sometime back doing a scan across the world of the opportunity to enter Fast ACH. We kind of took the decision that if this property were not available, we probably would have tried to build something organically with its opportunities and risks and costs and timeframe. But as it so turned out, the opportunity with VocaLink came along and we were trying our best to leap on it and take it and move forward. That's broadly what we're trying to do.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Very helpful. Thanks for the details.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Could you update us on your progress in signing pan-European deals? In particular, I'm thinking about the new merchant routing regulations that went into effect in June of 2016 and how you're doing versus some of these local and national payment schemes.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Well, I'll tell you this much, that what we are looking at is the fact that all the new regulations that went in, the one part of them were the routing regulations; another part was the actual, as you know, a level of interchange. There were other parts of our co-branding and co-badging and separational switch and scheme. There were a series of these that went in. I will tell you this. The expansion of acceptance that is going on for brands like us across Europe is actually for the first time encouraging. As you can see, even in Germany, where Martina hails from, even in Germany, and I'm not holding it against her, but that's where she hails from...","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Even the Germans are using cards.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Even the Germans are beginning to use these payment systems in these stores which earlier they did not. They basically paid through the giro through their bank accounts. You can see a change coming from the merchant community as well as the consumers, which I think is a function not just of one aspect of the regulation, but of the totality, which I think is what the EC (30:06) wanted to do. They wanted to create fresh momentum and fresh competition in the market, both for us and against what we do, and I think that's fine. That's a competitive marketplace.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Yeah. We are seeing real progress on the acceptance side. But we are also really seeing progress on our winning European deals, predominantly off-course, because we have a fantastic digital suite of products and we have great consulting services. And we're seeing that a lot of the banks that have been grabbling with a lot of these issues, especially as PSD2 is coming down the road, how we could be servicing in them. And that is \u2013 we called out some wins last time. We have a couple of wins that Ajay called out this time. That is really adding to the progress in terms of our European payments volume, which as you can see, even this quarter again is at 15%.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. I guess on a related European note, obviously, a little bit more time has passed with Visa's acquisition of Europe. Ajay, I was wondering if you've noticed any discernible trends, PINs (31:08) maybe impacting Mastercard? Thanks.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Sanjay, not yet directly. Although, as I said, they are winning some deals and that's because the market is a little more open to now having these conversations as compared to prior to the acquisition when everybody was waiting for that to happen with all their obvious benefits that were tied up in that.","But I would say \u2013 you remember even that Visa is still sorting through it, as they themselves said, all their agreements with their customers. So, you've got to let this play out for a little while. But, we are seeing progress, we are winning deals, and I'm just giving you a couple of examples, I'm trying not to give you a list. But, we are winning deals along the way.","This will become, as I said over time, you should get past this couple of years and then think about this as settling into a regular competitive marketplace, where one of two or three things will happen. Either the yields of that market, which tend to be lower than global yields, will begin to come up a little bit, maybe, maybe not; we'll see. Or, the opportunity to win more deals and volume will present itself. One of those two will fall into place. Right now, it feels more of the latter than the former. But, it's early days.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","In addition to really driving secular trend in Europe. As you know, it's really only the UK that is very much enabled from an electronic payments point of view. And it just presents an enormous opportunity in many of the other countries to take advantage of the secular trends from cash and check to electronic forms of payments.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","That's why to that earlier question I'm so delighted about the expansion and acceptance, even in Germany.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Ajay, you mentioned working with EMVCo on this global standard around QR codes and driving that. Can you elaborate a bit exactly what that solution looks and feels like for the merchant and the consumer? And what's required to enable that globally? Like what's the solution on the acquiring side and is the acquiring environment activating around that? And then also on the consumer side, is this Masterpass or is this bank wallets and how do you see that playing out?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","First of all, the last part, to me Masterpass and bank wallets are one and the same thing. I'm not into building Masterpass as I've said as a B2C solution. it's really a B2B2C solution. Banks can take a wallet container from us or build their own and then ride our rails, which is what a number of them are doing. Someone like CitiPay uses Masterpass more extensively than others. I'm fine with that. That to me is our model. It's a open, engagement model with banks and others who are authorized to have financial accounts so that we can enable the path through digitization as compared to trying to build our own wallet. That's not what I'm trying to do.","The standards topic is a really interesting one. To me, if you're going to make progress in expanding acceptance and QR code is a little bit of our expanding acceptance into markets where infrastructure and the cost of having terminals as well as the running costs of managing those terminals, are challenging.","So you take in Africa, you take parts of India or you take Pakistan or other such markets, or even parts of China, at the end of the day, QR codes represent a real opportunity to enable electronic payments in smaller and more remote shops. What essentially you are doing, you can pull or you can push the payment, meaning you can have a QR code that is unique to the merchant, in which case a consumer who walks in using a phone with a camera can actually focus on that QR code and enable the money to be transferred to that merchant for the potatoes and onions and bicycle tires they bought. Or, it could be the other way around, where the consumer carries around a QR code, which is unique to them, and it can connect into the merchants system to enable the money to be sent from the consumers account to the merchants account.","Both are possible, both are feasible, both have been tried in different markets in the world. The idea of standardizing them across EMVCo is to ensure that banks and merchants don't end up with complicated multiple standards between us and the other participants in EMVCo, which include Visa and AMEX and the others. So that's the purpose of what we're trying to get done. We've actually done that and issued standardized guidelines so that the acquirers and the merchants and the banks can find a simpler way to connect to what I think could be a transformative way of growing acceptance in a number of these markets.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. And good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, maybe you could talk philosophically about your approach to margins from here on out? Is the philosophy still to kind of make sure that you maximize revenue growth and get EPS tracking with that? Or post the acquisition of VocaLink, is there a desire to potentially get a little bit more operating leverage over the next few quarters until you lap that acquisition? Thank you.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","James, it's Martina. So, no, we have not changed our view in terms of how we are looking at operating margin. First and foremost, as you said, we are growing the company for topline performance, and net revenue growth and bottom-line performance, both on the net income line as well as on the EPS line.","We continue to believe that our operating margin should be, including buying VocaLink at a 50% plus margin, we are not driving the company in such a way that we are expanding it, so it might expand from time to time as we are today, actually 56% when you exclude VocaLink, 54% when you include VocaLink, but we are already above that 50% threshold. But what we're really doing with the company is, we're taking certain amounts of money that we are earning on the top line and we are investing it in those critical areas in order to get top-line and bottom-line performance to continue to work.","Just remember, VocaLink, when you actually look at them from a standalone point of view, you can look at their 2016 financials, and if you exclude one particular investment that they have made in push payments, which is their ZAPP product, their paid-by-bank product in the UK, VocaLink has a 32% EBITDA margin. So, obviously, they have a much lower margin than what Mastercard as a whole is, and despite that we are capable and able of taking in and we are still holding firm with our operating margin level of a minimum of 50% plus.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. I just wanted to ask you about that Kroger win that you announced in your prepared remarks. So, Ajay, if you don't want to speak about the merchant specifically, maybe more comments in general about grocer. Kroger is a massive company. How should we be timing that in terms of modeling it in? And was that a flip? Some color on the grocer would be helpful. Thank you.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Sure. I'm glad you called them prepared remarks. There are days when Warren and Martina are worried about what I might say compared to the prepared remarks. But I will note that for my future.","So, Kroger. Kroger was a co-brand that many years ago actually used to be with Mastercard. I think it flipped out of Mastercard either the year before I joined, or two years; I actually don't remember correctly. But, I know about 8, 9,10 years ago it moved away, and it was with our competitor, largest competitor, with Visa. U.S. Bank is their issuer and their primary banking relationship. Kroger went through a relatively detailed process of figuring out how to renew and what to renew. And we all went through and made our usual pitches for it and it ended up with U.S. Bank and us as being the partners for their co-brand platform going forward. We haven't yet finalized the dates of the migration of the portfolio. That work is happening as we scope out the different aspects of this. Over the next few months, I'm pretty certain we will be able to give you a better date and a better guideline. And Martina will be able to help you with that.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. The question I have is on operating expenses. You had 7% growth in OpEx once you take out the acquisitions and FX. You called out another 2 points of impact related from Masterpass spending. So, I guess, net it's 5%. So the question I have is two-fold. One is, and I heard your comments a second ago, Martina. But is the run rate of core business OpEx growth around 5%?","And then secondly, you're calling out another $35 million of A&M spending for Masterpass in the third quarter. I'm wondering if you could just help us balance the investments you've been making there for the past three quarters that have accelerated to some of the early-stage benefit as to how that's driving your top-line? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So, Dan, first of all, for the whole year, we gave a guidance that we would be at the high single digits on a currency neutral basis for operating expense growth, right, and that continues to be true. And that is excluding acquisitions, okay.","So, steady-state company with the investments that we are making has high single digit for the whole year. That includes any of the FX charges. That includes any of the Masterpass cost on the A&M side, which quite frankly, quite a bit of the cost is being accelerated from the fourth quarter into the first three quarters of the year. So we have absolutely no change for that.","In terms of driving growth, when you look at that high single-digit investment that we are making on the OpEx line, that is, when you look in the detail of it, is a number of things. One, it's obviously digital. We continue to invest in digital. Number two, so this is both on the technology side, that is on helping our customers to getting up and running; that is where the A&M is going up. So that is digital.","Secondly, we're doing quite a bit of geographic expansion. You can look at what Ajay said about China. Of course, we're building the technology backbone there, so that is expense. In India, given the demonetization, we are investing quite a bit there. In Africa, there are a number of those things going on. So geographic expansion is another big bucket.","The third bucket that drives growth, which we have been calling out in a number of quarters, is of course what we're doing in safety and security, right? So a number of the things we're actually doing and until very recently, from an organic investment point of view. Look at the Safety Net feature that we had shown to you a number of times; that was actually an organic investment that this company has been making. Recently, we've been adding a few inorganic acquisitions to it, but that is a very key investment area for us.","And then last but not least, as we called out this quarter, we are continuing to invest in our advisors capability, which is really two things: One, what we are doing on the consulting side with our customers, which does pay back in spades because of better portfolio performance, additional things that our customers might be doing that really benefit our volume and transaction. But also it's what we're doing on the data analytics side that goes way beyond financial institutions. That is where we're helping a lot, the merchants, to be very successful with what they need to do to sell to consumers.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great color. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. A question just on U.S. credit. One area that has been a bit of a challenge for Mastercard over the past couple years has been market share and growth in U.S. credit. It does seem that you have some momentum and have lapped some losses, lapping some losses. Can you maybe give a little color on your thoughts on the market position in U.S. credit, market share trends and growth outlook?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","First of all, you're correct. We are lapping some of those losses and there is an improvement in both our consumer and commercial credit in the U.S. performance. You've got to remember, we've got a good presence in commercial credit as well. And we look at both as part of our credit business in the United States.","In consumer, which is I think where your question was coming from compared to the commercial side, in consumer, within the market, as I said, are looking for opportunities to grow. Those opportunities have, over the last few years, largely been through merchant driven co-brand decisions and we win some and we don't win some. This quarter, we've got a couple we told you about that we won. There are a couple of others that we won that we won't announce for another year or so till the deals become visible in the marketplace.","But there are others we didn't win. We didn't win Costco in the United States some quarters ago. So we won Costco in Canada, but we didn't win it in the U.S. We have a relationship with Costco in other markets around the world. And so there are deals we'll win and there are deals we'll not win. We will try and do them in a way that makes economic sense to our bottom line. That's the principle behind those deals.","It's the same for winning more credit share with issuers and for looking at them as part of participating in their growth. One of our biggest partners, as you know, is Citibank. And you know that Citibank has begun to reinvest very wisely in their credit business over the last few quarters. And, honestly, their own performance, as a result, is improving. And their performance, which is improving, is driving our improvement, because they're one of our best partners. And that's kind of how this works for us and we try to work our way through this in a sensible way and support our principal customers and work with them on growth, while we try and win as many deals as we can, when and if they come up in the marketplace.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. That's helpful.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Ajay, thanks. Good morning, good quarter here. I guess I'll ask about the TSB win. What drove the switch there? I know I think Sanjay asked about Europe and whatnot in general, but just given its opening up in the UK, was this tied in any way to the Visa Europe transition? Is there a pipeline of new stuff maybe with challenger banks that you're excited about?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Hi, Tien-Tsin. Yeah, well, the TSB conversation honestly had started before the Visa European transition. I remember talking to them some time ago. It so happened that the Visa Europe transition happened in between. But is there pipeline in the marketplace from large, medium and small sized banks that we are pursuing? Absolutely. But I'm not going to say much more about it.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. We'll leave it as a case study then. Thank you.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Yes. It's a good case study.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah. Hi, thanks. We've now had pay-by-bank in the market in the UK for, I believe, a full quarter even though I know that availability to consumers is still very small versus where it'll be by year-end. I was hoping you could talk about early returns in terms of things like fraud and an update. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Craig, it's very tiny yet and you're correct that it's early days. Its availability is limited. It's a couple of banks and I'm actually looking at Martina to try to figure out whether it's two or three banks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","No. It's two banks, but it's three stores and if you want to buy pizza in the UK, then you can use it.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Yeah. So, right now, it's very early. But I'll tell you a different picture about it which I think you'll be more interested in. My view is that a consumer must get choice at the front end of their decision of how to pay and that choice should be connected back to where their bank relationship comes from. And if that choice is to pay by direct debit to their bank account or by the inward receipt of a remittance through a friend, a relative or a government disbursement or with a debit card or a prepaid card or a credit card, that concept of choice is what we're trying to put together when I was describing the opportunity with Fast ACH as well as what we have, which is Mastercard Send and HomeSend and our card rails.","Whether you \u2013 pay by bank has only one way of choosing right now, which is from your bank account. I visualize that as being important and an interesting application not just in the UK but in other markets as well. It can lead to some good volume growth, but what I also visualize over time is the choice coming across to a consumer at the point-of-sale on their phone or from the terminal, whichever way, a choice to make payments from these alternative funding sources. That's what I think is where all this is going.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks and good morning. Just a question on B2B payments and how you think about the opportunity there for VocaLink versus Mastercard Send. Can you size it up? Is one bigger opportunity for the other? Just kind of help us think about that. Thank you.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","I continue to believe that the opportunity in B2B for ACH and therefore VocaLink type of Fast ACH payments is enormous. It's way beyond what a Mastercard Send or card rails can address. Why is that? Card rails requires you to have card acceptance with all these merchants on both side or the businesses on both sides of a B2B transaction. And while you can attempt to build that acceptance and we have built it over the years, we're actually building in a number of markets around the world. But I would say while that addresses a portion of the opportunity, there is a much bigger opportunity that lies outside of that portion. That outside of that portion opportunity you can address a part of it through the tools of a Mastercard Send combined with a HomeSend because you've got multiple distribution points you could reach.","But even now you don't have the right data and connectivity to the ERP systems of these B2B businesses that you can get with an ISO 20022 certified data standard system like VocaLink. That's the real difference. So think of this as layering a cake. There is what you can do with the card. I love it. We're going to do it. There is what you can do by adding HomeSend. I love it. We're going to do it. There's a little more I can do than most other people there by adding on the HomeSend capability. I love it. We're going to do it. But, boy, what I really love is the capability with Fast ACH. So I'll give you a number for the United Kingdom. In the UK alone, VocaLink's domestic real-time platform carries over last year about 1.4 billion transactions per annum and the combined value of that is $1.5 trillion. Whatever you can look at addressing through card rails and through the equivalent of Mastercard Send rails would be a fraction of that number.","Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thank you for that.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Now, to be clear, the revenue dynamics and the challenges of building that's out, I'm not discounting any of those. Please don't assume that by next quarter I'm going to have the worlds answer to B2B payments. I'm going to build it, but what I've got now is the right set of tools between card rails, Send, HomeSend and Fast ACH and as we get together and roll these out sensibly, in sensible profitable ways across the world, you should see us bringing choice and data capability through this to the front end of a B2B business.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Yeah. And, Jason, that is exactly also what we're doing with the Mastercard B2B payment hub, right. Our investment (52:56) exchange where we're basically enabling small and medium size businesses to automate their invoice and payment processes, and one way to do it is as Ajay said, to give a card offer which we are doing obviously through our virtual card offering, which will get linked into that system. But in addition to that, those businesses want to also have ACH capabilities and what's called ACH plus capabilities which is an ACH transfer with more data and what is wonderful with this B2B hub is that we will be connected into over 130 ERP systems which allows those businesses, both buyers and sellers, to be easily putting the data into their backend systems so that they can reconcile those kind of payments with the goods delivered or a Send.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Just keep this in mind, it's about choice, both commercial enterprises as well as for consumers and all I'm trying to do is to have the repertoire that allows us to do that in a sensible, practical way.","Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is open.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results, guys. Ajay, I guess I'll ask on obligatory India question. I know it's early days, but when you look at the market structure there, heavy on debit, obviously, you can do the local processing. Is there any reason why structurally the revenue yield in India shouldn't be superior to Europe? And can you envision needing to take a more direct role from an acquiring perspective a la what Mastercard and Visa did in Brazil years ago?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So, Martina, didn't send you an email on the side asking you to ask me an India question because of my poking her on Germany, right? I'm just guessing. But the India opportunity, so there are close to 850 million debit cards in that market. A large number of them, by the way, are still used essentially for taking cash out from an ATM. It's only a smaller number of them that are used at the point-of-sale and credit cards are way smaller than the debit cards, we're talking about a fraction of those. Those, of course, used at point-of-sale. There's little cash take out on those, although there is some. And when you put that together, you get a market that has lots of cards, more than they ever had, but still with a huge opportunity in the front of it.","The second side of it is the acceptance methodology. Whether it's card payment or pay by a QR code or pay by a phone or a fingerprint and all those options are being developed by different players in India, including us. I think what you'll find is that this is only as good as how the acceptance market in India evolves. Now, the acceptance market is growing rapidly in the sense that over the course of this last eight, nine months, you've had a 70%, 80% growth in merchants. But it comes to 2.5 million, 2.6 million merchants, depending on who you're counting. If you look at the total number of merchants in India, the Confederation of All India Traders with whom we have a very deep partnership, estimates there are 60 million merchants.","Now, a large number of those are going to be fruit sellers and casual merchants who I don't yet know how we will get to create electronification, although we probably could over time. But there's still a large number there that should get into acceptance expansion. Now, the acquiring community in India is actually pretty good at growing the acceptance. Their challenge has been in the past the risk underwriting capability compared to their business model because all the acquirers in India are actually issuing banks as well and their business model is not clear until the revenue dynamics of their business model is clarified by the Reserve Bank of India. For the last few months now, since the demonetization, there has been a dispute going on about the level of MDR that the banks will make out of the system. If you don't clarify that, you're going to find a lack of appetite on the part of the players there to grow acceptance. It's got nothing to do with Visa and Mastercard going into the market acquiring or not.","We ourselves won't know what our revenue model will be or what our profitability model will be till we get clarity on the pricing model in the marketplace. That pricing model was supposed to have been clarified a couple of months back. I think there have been recommendations made by the Reserve Bank of India to the Indian government. We're still waiting for them to finalize that. I am hopeful they will finalize that. I raised that recently in a public meeting with the Prime Minister as well. I know they're working through a number of puts and takes to figure it out. They will.","Once they do, I think back to the earlier question Lisa asked me about QR codes, I think you will see between traditional terminals, mobile as a point-of-sale and QR codes with dongles, I mean, mobile is a point-of-sale in dongles, and QR codes, I think you will see a reasonably strong expansion of acceptance in India. And people like us and our competitors, we can focus on enabling banks and merchants to make sense out of this opportunity.","Remember, there's one big impetus coming, which is the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax called GST in India. That GST has levels and slabs, but most commodities are at 28%. People will be paying that 28% when they receive goods in a merchant shop. A merchant is no longer incented to help a consumer not pay taxes because they are most likely to have paid a relatively high tax rate on receiving those goods from their supplier. And therefore subsidizing that to a consumer by helping to avoid taxes is probably something that we should see reducing over the next few years. And that, to me, is the real change in the (59:02) in this place.","So if we can get our stuff together in the MDR, get the acceptance expansion going, build the right digital tools and QR tools, and roll those out, while also not losing focus on cards, I think there is a really interesting opportunity over the next five to seven years in India.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","I see that we've got to the end of our allotted time. Ajay, do you have any final comments to make?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","All right. So thank you for all your questions. And I'm going to leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. We've had a strong first half of the year. We're just really pleased to have delivered record revenue and earnings per share in this quarter. I believe we are executing well against our strategy. We've added a number of new capabilities, which we were talking about during the Q&A, which I think differentiate us from competition and they add real value to our merchant and bank customers.","With Fast ACH, we now have the ability to offer even greater choice for our customers with both cards and bank account based payment solutions. With the Mastercard B2B Hub, we think we're continuing to deliver innovative solutions to help companies manage their businesses more efficiently. And with Brighterion, another company we acquired this quarter, we're extending our capabilities in artificial intelligence to create an even better and safer payment experience for consumers.","So I'm looking forward to having a number of you join us at our upcoming Investor Day in New York. You'll have an opportunity to hear about our strategic areas of focus, and you can get a chance to touch and feel and experience the various ways that we are working to capture new payment flows and help to shape the future of where payments are going.","Thank you for your support, and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Gasper, you may begin.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Heather, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for a discussion about our fourth quarter and full-year 2014 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer.

We\u2019ve added a new table in the slide appendix to the deck that breaks out the impact of various items to our financial results as an easy reference for those of you who track that detail. These documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning.

Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Ajay.","Ajay Banga","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning everybody. I\u2019m very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results for both our fourth quarter and the full year performance despite what everybody knows is a mixed economic environment. In the fourth quarter after adjusting for currency, we had net revenue growth of 17% and EPS growth of 25% driven by solid underlying metrics. For the full year, we saw net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. Both EPS growth figures exclude the impact of last year\u2019s special item for a charge related to the U.S. merchant litigation.","So in total, we had a good year where we were able to continue to meaningfully invest in growth initiatives that I think will position us very well for the future. Those initiatives included actions resulting in a restructuring charge in this past year\u2019s fourth quarter, which Martina is going to go through in some detail later.","Moving on to look at some of the current underlying global economic trends, let\u2019s start with the United States which is in relatively decent shape. Our SpendingPulse data showed U.S. retail sales growth ex-auto was 2.9% in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s down from the third quarter growth of 4.2%. Most of that deceleration is due to lower gas prices. Excluding auto and gas, retail sales growth was 4.1% for the fourth quarter versus 4.8% for the third quarter, showing just a modest deceleration in spending. Even though 4% growth is nothing to sneeze at, we haven\u2019t yet seen the extra savings from lower gas prices translate into additional discretionary consumer spending. ","While overall retail spending growth softened in the quarter, underlying economic indicators did remain positive with unemployment levels and consumer sentiment both showing some improvement. Looking at our own U.S. business, as we have said for the past couple of quarters, the Chase de-conversion is having an impact on our U.S. GDP growth rate, but if we take that out, the underlying growth remained roughly the same over the course of 2014. ","Outside of the U.S., Europe\u2019s recovery slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, it still remains challenged and across the region, consumer confidence and economic sentiment decelerated slightly. While unemployment levels were high, they remained steady with the prior quarter. There were a few bright spots - the U.K. experienced good momentum in the quarter. SpendingPulse data for the U.K. is showing fourth quarter retail sales growth of 3.6%, up from 2.9% in the third quarter. Even in Spain, preliminary indicators are showing some early signs of recovery. MasterCard\u2019s total European volume growth for the fourth quarter was in the mid-teens and process transaction growth in the lower 20\u2019s, both of which increased from the last quarter due in part to a number of our recent wins across several European markets.","Latin America, a number of indicators there that highlighted the sluggish economic performance across the region. Our fourth quarter SpendingPulse data from Brazil showed retail sales growth of just 0.9%, down from the 2.4% growth that Brazil saw in the third quarter. For the entire region, annual GDP growth is now expected to be around 1%, down slightly from earlier projections of 1.3%. Mexico, however, is an exception. It continues to benefit from improving exposure to the U.S. and actually is undergoing a slow recovery. Our business in the region remains solid. Our fourth quarter GDV and process transaction growth is in the mid-teens, about the same as the last quarter.","Across Asia-Pacific, overall business sentiment actually improved in the fourth quarter. Optimism from Indian companies following the recent elections has driven some of that, but was tempered a bit by lingering concerns over the slowing economic growth in China. Consumer confidence across the region is holding steady. Our business in the region continues to do well. GDP growth in the mid-teens, process transaction growth in the mid-20\u2019s is about the same as the last quarter.","So overall, the economic environment hasn\u2019t changed much from last quarter. The U.S. looks to be in a little better shape, challenges remain for continental Europe, for Brazil and parts of Asia. But despite all of this, you can see the strong fundamentals of our business have not changed.","So before we go to our business highlights, there has been recent news about European regulatory matters and Russia, so let me touch on those a little bit first. Let me start with the proposed European legislation related to card payments. The European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission have reached an agreement in December, and we are waiting for the formal adoption and publication of the final text. As expected, interchange caps have now been established for consumer credit and consumer debit cards. Commercial cards are excluded. The regulation provides for a level playing field by imposing interchange caps on three-party networks when they operate similarly to a four-party network. There are some possible exceptions to this, but overall we are pleased with the outcome at this point, because it is an important one for us.","Also, a network will no longer be allowed to charge a co-badging fee if it does not process the transaction, and finally the regulation requires the functional rather than legal separation of scheme and processing functions, an outcome that we had sought once it became clear that some form of separation would be required. We are now working to build this separation, the functional separation, into our operations.","The next formal step is for the language of the agreement to be endorsed by parliament and by the member states. Our best estimate this will occur in the first half of 2015. Interchange caps will become effective six months after that. All of the parts of the legislation will apply to us starting 12 months after the endorsement, so that\u2019s probably sometime in 2016.","So now a little bit about Russia. We\u2019ve been working through the challenges of connecting to NSPC, which is the domestic processing switch of the Russian Central Bank in order to meet a late March 31 deadline. Going forward, by the way, nothing has changed in terms of being able to issue MasterCard-branded cards for use in the Russian market. In terms of the financial impact to our business, our best estimate is still something less than $50 million on an annualized basis. It will now hit our GMA line, the expense line, as a data processing expense rather than the revenue line, as we\u2019d previously shared.","Moving on to some of our recent business activity, we have expanded relationships with a couple of our large global customers, and that\u2019s great news. We renewed our multi-year global partnership with Bank of America that will expand share opportunities for us, both domestically and outside of the U.S., and primarily on the commercial side. We recently won new business with HSBC, which involves converting the remainder of their U.S. consumer credit portfolio to MasterCard in the first half of this year. ","In the Middle East and Africa, we signed a number of new business agreements in the quarter. That should help us increase our credit, debit, commercial and prepaid businesses in countries such as Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, Jordan, Kuwait and the UAE over the course of 2015. It was built on the strong momentum that we\u2019ve developed in the region. Over the last two years, we\u2019ve signed close to 100 new business agreements. We now have an acceptance footprint in 50 out of Africa\u2019s 55 markets. ","We feel strongly about activities that take our services to people who were previously excluded from access to the financial system. In Africa, close to 95% of the region\u2019s transactions are still done in cash and 80% of adults don\u2019t have access to a bank account. Working on that whole aspect and reflecting our commitment to what\u2019s going on in Africa, we have also launched a number of financial inclusion initiatives, and today I\u2019m going to pick on two of those.","First, last week we announced the start of a collaboration with the African Development Bank to broaden access to financial services. We are going to do that in partnership with local governments in Africa and private sector companies. We have the expertise to design and to scale financial solutions, and the African Development Bank is a major source of funding for the economic development of its 54 member countries. We believe together we can help drive financial inclusion and economic development across Africa over the next few years.","Secondly, last December in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, we announced that we will be opening a MasterCard Lab for Financial Inclusion in Kenya. This is our seventh global innovation hub, but it\u2019s the first that we have in Africa. It\u2019s also the first to receive outside funding. The lab will be dedicated specifically to creating and incubating programs that are targeted to more than 100 million people in this part of the world who are financially excluded or underserved.","Our efforts on innovation, by the way, are not limited to one region, like we were discussing Africa, or only to the labs. We\u2019re also opening up our technology to external developers, something we\u2019ve been trying to do for a while now. The most recent example is the 10-city hackathon competition that starts next month in Sydney in Australia, and will go on to Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, Brazil, Canada, the U.K. and the United States. This competition, which has already been planned for some more cities beyond these, will bring together developers and entrepreneurs using MasterCard APIs to create a new generation of commerce applications that leverages our platforms, our product capabilities such as [indiscernible] from our information services business, our MasterPass, and our prepaid, our loyalty and our fraud solutions. ","Meanwhile, continuing with the global expansion of MasterPass, since this introduction in the spring of 2013, we now have the platform launched in 16 countries and just recently signed on a number of new merchants - Neiman Marcus, Office Depot, Blue Nile, Broadway.com - just some new names in the merchant list. We\u2019re also creating some new and noteworthy partnerships. One example is with Paylib in France. Paylib was initially formed by BNP Paribas, La Banque Postal, and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, who are by the way mainly customers of one of our key competitors, and yet they have chosen to partner with MasterPass because of what they believe is our global reach in handling all of their cross-border ecommerce transactions as well as some of the domestic transactions too. With this partnership, up to 40 million people will have access to MasterPass acceptance with Paylib wallets linked to a card from their bank. ","So before I turn it over to Martina, let me quickly update you on two recent acquisitions. In December, we acquired the payment gateway services business of Transaction Network Services, TNS. That deal gives us the ability to expand our payment gateway to the U.S. and Mexico and to position ourselves more competitively around the rest of the world, whereas you know with DataCash and our original mix platform, we\u2019ve only had a presence. So for example in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East and Africa, we will add new capabilities - tokenization, fraud management, and we will also be able to leverage what I think are highly skilled product and software teams that have now recently joined the company with this transaction.","Additionally, we acquired 5one Marketing Limited. That\u2019s a marketing, analytics and consulting firm, and their clients are basically large retailers across many different consumer sectors. 5one has some proprietary software. They have used that to develop insights from a retailer\u2019s own data that can be used for marketing, for merchandising, and for operational decisions. You take that and you combine that kind of in-depth merchant understanding with our existing advisors\u2019 capabilities, and I think that will allow us to provide greater insights to retailers and the ability to expand our business opportunities with the merchant community.","So with that, Martina for an update on financial results and operational metrics.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks Ajay, and good morning everyone. As Ajay already said, we\u2019re very pleased with our 2014 full-year performance, which delivered net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. I now turn to the details of our fourth quarter results.","Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you see the difference between as reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter is more significant than it has been in the recent past. This is primarily due to the headwinds from the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate, especially with what we saw in the FX markets during the last 45 days of the quarter and its continuation into this quarter. These figures also exclude the impact of the special item related to the U.S. merchant litigation taken in the fourth quarter of 2013.","I\u2019d like to highlight three things while on this slide and then dive into the details of the major P&L line items and subsequent lines. First, EPS growth was 25% after adjusting for currency, and share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. During the fourth quarter, we have purchased 2.1 million shares at a cost of approximately $155 million. Through January 23, we repurchased an additional 2.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $250 million, and we now have $3.8 billion remaining under the current authorization. We continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.","Second, part of the EPS growth is the result of a very favorable tax rate of 20.3% in the quarter as some initiatives only came together within the last couple of months to better align our tax structure to our European business footprint between Belgium and the U.K. We took some of that benefit to reinvest back into the business, which I\u2019ll discuss on the operating expense slide.","Third, cash flow from operations was $725 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion. ","So let\u2019s turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis, up slightly from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, similar to last quarter. Credit growth was 7% and debit growth was 8%, both the same as last quarter. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis and primarily driven by Europe.","Cross-border volume grew 19% on a local currency basis, higher than the 15% we saw in the third quarter, primarily driven by Europe. Growth in Europe was in the low 20\u2019s. Key contributors to this growth included the U.K., Italy, Germany and Sweden. All regions except the U.S. saw an increase in cross-border volume growth in the fourth quarter.","Let me turn to Page 5, and here you can see process transactions grew 11% globally to $11.6 billion. We continue to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 10% we saw in the third quarter primarily due to Europe, driven by Russia, Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands. Globally, the number of cards grew 9% with 2.1 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards. ","Now let\u2019s turn to Page 6 for highlights of a few of our revenue line items. Overall, net revenue growth was 14% as reported, or 17% FX-adjusted due to currency headwinds primarily from the euro exchange rate. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates to the functional currency billing rates was a little more than 1 ppt. In total, acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to our net revenue growth. So after excluding the impact of both local and functional currencies, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we saw very strong underlying growth of 15%.","Looking at the individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis, domestic assessments grew 7% while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 6 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency and lower than average revenue yields in some markets outside of the U.S., similar to prior quarters. Cross-border volume fees grew 8% while cross-border volume grew 19%. Of the 11 ppt gap, about 7 ppt is due to the impact of local currency. The remaining portion of the difference is mainly due to the higher mix of intra-European activity. ","Transaction processing fees grew 15% primarily driven by the 11% growth in processed transactions. This line item also benefited from additional revenues not driven by transaction count and some pricing, partially offset by mix. Other revenues grew 28% driven largely by contributions from our Pinpoint acquisition as well as our advisors business.","Moving on to Page 7, you can see that total operating expenses were up 26% in the quarter or 29% on an FX-adjusted basis. Of this growth, 9 ppt was due to expenses related to our acquisitions. The other big driver was the restructuring charge, which contributed 8 ppt to the growth, so let me focus on that a bit more.","Specifically, we took an $87 million restructuring charge to cover a series of actions. First, as you know, we have made a number of acquisitions in the processing space and we are now consolidating all of our processing assets under one organization, thus driving significant synergies. Second, we are realigning some roles within the company\u2019s business groups and redeploying resources geographically in order to invest in and enhance our capabilities in new product areas and technology, such as digital and mobile. Overall, these actions will impact over 500 people, but our total headcount will decline by a smaller amount given the reinvestment that I just mentioned.","The remaining opex growth of 12% was primarily driven by some opportunistic spend, such as adding A&M spend around our Apple Pay and Priceless initiatives, as well as continuing our digital investments such as MasterPass and tokenization, similar to prior quarters. ","Let me turn to Slide 8, and here we discuss what we\u2019ve seen in January through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter after excluding the impact of lower gas prices, particularly in the U.S. The numbers through January 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 9%, down 2 ppt from the fourth quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 3%, down 2 ppt from what we saw last quarter primarily driven by lower gas prices. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, about 1 ppt lower than the fourth quarter with growth of mid to high teens in each region. Globally, processed transaction growth was 11%, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S, which grew in the low single digits. With respect to cross-border, our volume grew at 19% globally, the same as our fourth quarter growth. We continue to see high growth in major European markets, including the U.K., Italy and Sweden. ","Looking ahead, let me start with some commentary about full-year 2015. Given what\u2019s happening with currency rates and the impact being seen by U.S. multinationals across a number of industries, I\u2019m going to start with that, especially since it was back in 2012 that MasterCard last faced such a big impact from FX. Remember that currency impacts us in two ways. ","First, we have the impact of local currency rates relative to the functional currencies, and this is the FX exposure that we actively hedge, normally on a rolling 12-month basis and typically, as you know, we hedge about 50 to 75% of our total net exposure for about 30 currency pairs. Given that many currencies have depreciated against the U.S. dollar and the euro, new hedge contracts will come on at lower rates over the year, thus we continue to expect some net headwind throughout the year, both to revenue and the bottom line. Based on the current rates, this is likely to be in the 2 ppt range, and this is already included in our FX-adjusted guidance. ","Second, we have the impact of the translation of our major functional currencies, which are particularly the euro and the Brazilian real, into U.S. dollars to consolidate our financials, and we do not hedge those exposures. When we talk about FX-adjusted growth rates, we are only adjusting for the impact of these two functional exchange rates. If the rates for our functional currencies remain similar to where they are today, so that\u2019s the euro trading at the 1.13 level and the Brazilian real at the 2.58 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and the real would be a 4 to 6 ppt headwind, and it\u2019s actually driven mostly from the euro to our as-reported results for the full year, depending on which line item we are talking about - revenue, net income or EPS, and I will get into that a little bit more.","With that backdrop, now let me get into some of the P&L line items. We expect high single digit net revenue growth for 2015 on an FX-adjusted basis, and that will be before and after a roughly 2 ppt contribution from last year\u2019s M&A transactions. Our underlying business remains strong and we are seeing traction from many of our recent portfolio wins and new product initiatives; however, this year\u2019s FX-adjusted revenue growth will be impacted by some items specific to 2015, and that\u2019s including the remaining Chase portfolio attrition mostly impacting the first half of the year, as well as the local currency headwinds I just talked about. Also included are a couple of expected significant contract renewals, some of which will likely have more front-loaded rebates and incentives than our typical agreements, but these renewals provide the foundation for future growth. ","On an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rate will likely be in the mid-single digit range as a result of strong FX headwinds primarily from the euro functional translation. Based on current FX rates, this would be about a 4 to 5 ppt impact. ","Overall, we project the growth rate for total operating expense for full-year 2015 to be in the high single digits on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth is predominantly due to a roughly 6 ppt impact from our previously announced acquisitions with more of that impact occurring in the first half of the year. The as-reported growth will likely be in the mid-single digit range after considering a roughly 2 to 3 ppt range impact, mostly again from the euro translation. ","Let me give you an update on potential dilution from last year\u2019s acquisitions. Now that we\u2019ve done a few more deals, like TNS and 5one that Ajay just mentioned, we now expect total EPS dilution to be about $0.08 to $0.10 for the full-year 2015, and a little less than half of the expected dilution is actually due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. You should now assume a full-year 2015 tax rate of about 28% due to the continued benefits we expect from the tax initiatives I discussed earlier, so this is a sustainable tax benefit for future years. ","Now given all the detail that I just went through, let me step back and summarize for you. We expect solid fundamentals to drive our business in 2015 despite the mixed economic environment and significant headwinds from FX and gas prices. We continue to sign customer contracts and invest in the right strategic areas while managing our expenses prudently. ","Finally let me move on to our long-term performance objectives for the 2013 to 2015 period. Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we now believe that we will deliver at the low end of our 11 to 14% net revenue CAGR. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the three-year period due to continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. We remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis and they exclude our 2014 M&A activities as well as any new ones that may occur this year.","As a reference point for your modeling, when looking at our performance from a two-year CAGR perspective, so that\u2019s for 2013 and 2014, on a constant currency basis we have delivered a net revenue CAGR of 12.5% and an EPS CAGR of 21.1%, which is based on the 2012 normalized EPS of $2.14 per share that we provided to you earlier.","Now many of you have asked when we will be rolling our performance objectives forward. As you can see, the underlying drivers of our business are in good shape and we are expanding our reach in areas that we are strategically targeting, such as processing, loyalty, information services, and all things digital. The overall growth prospects for the payments industry have not changed, and for now we have given you some clarity around 2015 as this is the last year of our current 2013 - 2015 performance period. Once we have worked through the many moving parts, including the impact of those resulting from the final European payment regulations and the new payments environment in Russia, both from a revenue and an expense perspective, we will provide you with our new long-term objectives before the end of this year.","Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Martina. We\u2019re now ready to start the Q&A session, and I would just remind everyone that in order to reach as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Heather?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW is on the line with a question.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you, good morning. I guess I had a question on the quote Ajay had in the press release. It mentioned new wins and renewals in the pipeline. Is it both wins and renewals, because I know you guys talked about the renewals; and then just on the tax rate, Martina, that 28%, can that come down further in future years? Thanks.","Ajay Banga","Hi Sanjay, good morning. It is wins and renewals. If you recall my earlier comments, I talked about Bank of America\u2019s commercial and some consumer, so those were actually wins. HSBC is a win - we\u2019re actually converting the rest of their portfolio. There is renewals as well. There\u2019s a combination of renewals with a deeper extension into other markets, which I would count as a part-win, so it\u2019s kind of a mix of both, and all that is happening as we speak, actually.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So on the tax rate, Sanjay, as you know, we are very much committed to be aligning our business operations to our tax infrastructure, and over the last couple of years we\u2019ve been able to work down the tax rate quite considerably, so in fact in 2014 we are ending up at 28.8%. We\u2019re planning that that will go down to 28% in 2015, and over a longer period of time we believe that we will have even more work that we can in order to lower the tax rate.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks.","Barbara Gasper","Operator, next question?","Operator","Tien-tsin Huang is on the line with a question from JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to follow up on Sanjay\u2019s question. The small rise in rebate was surprising this quarter given your comments on the deals, so just curious if there were any unusual items within that. Can you give us, Martina, some context on where rebates could trend this year? It sounds like, like you just said, there will be some renewals and wins.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, so first of all in the prior year quarter in 2013, we actually had some relatively large contracts coming to fruition, both from a new and from a renewal point of view, so this is just the year-over-year cadence. There\u2019s nothing unusual that is going on in the Q4 of 2014. Looking forward when you talk about 2015, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are expecting a number of customer renewals that will have more front-loaded rebates and incentives into the front part of the year, not smooth over the entire years of a contract. So it will have a more considerable impact on rebates and incentives in 2015, and that is all baked into our net revenue guidance of the high single digits, FX-adjusted.","Ajay Banga","And to be clear, it\u2019s renewals and wins, as I said. It\u2019s not just renewals.","Operator","Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust is online with a question.","Andrew Jeffrey ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Ajay, I wonder just from a high level if you could step back and described the acquisition strategy, just in the context of your long-term growth. It seems like you\u2019re perhaps ramping up some of your acquisition activity, and I wonder if there is some specific criteria you evaluate when you look to do a deal, and also just whether or not there\u2019s an overall or overarching narrative that we might think about in terms of how MasterCard is augmenting its robust organic revenue growth and position.","Ajay Banga","Okay, this particular year, we actually ended up doing six acquisitions and one JV. We had TNS, 5one, Pinpoint, ECS, C-SAM, and Provus, starting in January though December, and then the HomeSend JV. But that\u2019s--I wouldn\u2019t say you should take that as the norm. Deals are deals when they happen. You can look at 25, 30 deals in a year and sometimes in the previous two years, one or two worked out. It just so happened that a number of these were in the hopper, so to say, and they began to close at different times in the year. So the first thing I\u2019d say is, don\u2019t take this as trend line of how it happens. It\u2019s just the way deals work out.","Now, you deeper question was around what we\u2019re doing and where we are going for, what\u2019s the big picture here. The big picture here is we are trying to expand our presence in the payments value chain, not just in being in the clearing, authorization and settlement business but everything before, during and after a transaction, how can we expand our presence so we can be stickier and we can therefore extract better value for the services we offer, and that provides us with some new capabilities and hopefully gives us some space to become bigger leaders or better leaders in key growth areas. ","So what would those areas be? Data and analytics, which is what the information services is about, so 5one for example is right in that space. Processing, which is what we\u2019re doing with Provus and with ECS and ENS [ph] also does fit in there. We\u2019ve had the key commerce gateway businesses bought over time. That are these things that all tie back to processing. And why are we doing processing? Because the idea is to be able to see more of the transactions around the world, because that allows me to use that knowledge in my data analytics business, so it\u2019s interconnected to that space.","Then the third area is safety and security, so DataCash got us some great fraud management solutions. There are similar ones in some of these - the HomeSend JV could actually be very useful not just for moving money around the world but also for safety and security. Then loyalty, which is why Pinpoint came into it, [indiscernible] some years ago. So these are all in that bailiwick of data and analytics, processing, safety, security, and loyalty, and mostly we try and figure out if there is a good strategic fit. Are these companies giving us some critical capabilities we didn\u2019t have on our own - technology, product distribution, some geographic reach maybe, and do they have the right kind of risk profile and are we getting some talent and skills we would not have been able to get easily. So C-SAM, for example, brought us a number of very highly qualified mobile payments technicians. Hiring hundreds of them organically would be a very slow build. This gave us the ability to get with it much quicker.","It\u2019s kind of a mix of those reasons, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.","Martina Hund-Mejean","In addition to the strategic evaluation, we obviously do a financial evaluation and we do an integration possibility evaluation. So on the financials, first of all, we differentiate between those acquisitions, as Ajay said, that are really bringing us skill sets that don\u2019t necessarily bring us in the immediate term revenues that would be good over time, but it brings a skill set. Then we have acquisitions that are more the traditional acquisitions, like Pinpoint or TNS, that are bringing us also revenues. We do the very traditional cash flow modeling with the right kind of hurdle rates, vary it by the type of business, the riskiness of the business, where the business is located, and then beyond that analysis we obviously also do an analysis on the integration possibility of this particular business with our company so that we can drive some synergies on the bottom line.","Operator","Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie is on the line with a question.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thanks. I wonder if you could just give us a sense of the advertising and marketing line in Q4, and then how we should think about that over the course of \u201915 as well.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, so first of all in Q4, as I said, we took actually advantage of some of the goodness that we had on the tax side to be reinvesting that, and we did specifically reinvest that in [indiscernible] as well as in our price initiatives. So you saw a little bit of a higher number in A&M than you otherwise would expect in Q4. ","I think for the full year of 2015, the A&M spend is really embedded in my comments that I said about operating expenses, and I don\u2019t think you should be expecting too big of a difference from a overall A&M spend number for 2015 than what we had in 2014.","Operator","Bob Napoli from William Blair is online with a question.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the growth in local currency of the debit and credit businesses internationally. It\u2019s pretty impressive, the 17% going to 23% in debit, and a little bit of acceleration in credit. I was just trying to get a little more color and what your outlook is for those pieces of the business, given that the global economy doesn\u2019t seem so hot right now outside of the U.S.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Well Bob, as you heard Ajay speak, actually a big part of this is due to the terrific work that our European colleagues have been doing. A number of the countries that we called out - the U.K., Sweden and some others - have been growing terrifically in these kinds of businesses, so that obviously contributed to our bottom line growth despite where the economic environment is at this point in time.","Ajay Banga","Yes, the economic environment translates into consumer confidence translates into spending, and that does impact quickly; but we also have--what\u2019s going on here is share growth in some of these markets, and what\u2019s also going on here is conversion from cash to electronic, and it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag of all three that comes out into the numbers you\u2019re seeing. You can actually make that work faster and harder for you if you\u2019ve got the right marketing and the right approaches, so there\u2019s a lot of blocking and tackling that\u2019s going on to help us get to where we\u2019re getting. ","Bob Napoli","Great, thank you.","Operator","Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies is online with a question.","Jason Kupferberg","Yes, hi guys. I was just curious sin terms of what theories you might have as to why we haven\u2019t seen the pick-up in discretionary spending from U.S. consumers, given the magnitude of the drop in gas prices. Separately, can you just clarify your pricing assumptions in the 2015 guide?","Ajay Banga","So Jason, that\u2019s actually a very good question. I myself, I\u2019m kind of stumped with what\u2019s going on there. I think about the fact that it\u2019s $800 a month, or whatever it is to a middle class family, the gas prices are down 40% over this same time the previous year, and that\u2019s not a small number. So when we put all that into context, you would have thought it would flow through. But the way I think about it, and [indiscernible] we\u2019ve talked to so many other fields about this, I just feel that maybe it is that it\u2019s going to take three or four months for the U.S. consumer to feel that this is something that\u2019s going to with them for a little while. If you have a longer term perspective of the price of gas, not going back to $100 but maybe settling in at $75, $80, that\u2019s where we\u2019re thinking. I don\u2019t think the U.S. consumer knows whether to expect this to be sticking around or not, so I think there\u2019s some degree of, let\u2019s say, the desire to see that through before they really start spending that kind of money. That\u2019s kind of where I think this is.","So if you were to ask my opinion and my guess, I would say we\u2019re probably a month or two or three away, if this price stays where it is, for them saying, you know what? I do have $800 a month more in my pocket, and I could afford to go and buy X. I think that\u2019s kind of what I think about it.","But on pricing, Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, on the pricing side, for 2014 actually for the whole year, we had about a 1% price increase, so relatively small. We think that what we have out there for 2015, it will be relatively similar.","Operator","Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer is online with a question.","Glenn Greene","Thanks, good morning. Martina, I know you like to level-set us in terms of expectations, and there was a lot of commentary on guidance, but I just wanted to clarify and make sure I heard it right. So in terms of revenue, you talked about high single-digit net revenue on an FX-adjusted basis, including M&A. So the first question would be, how much M&A benefit is there? And I was unclear exactly what you said in terms of the expense expectation, given the FX impact and the M&A.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Okay, well let me just go through it.","Ajay Banga","Yes, she\u2019s very good at level-setting expectations inside the company too, so don\u2019t feel discriminated against.","Glenn Greene","Good to know!","Martina Hund-Mejean","So you\u2019re absolutely right - FX-adjusted, high single digit net revenue growth for 2015. That includes about 2 ppt of M&A transactions. But by the way, even when you pull these 2 ppt of M&A transactions out, you still get to high single digit growth on the underlying business, so you can probably get a good sense on the numbers on that one. ","On the expense side, what I said is also on an FX-adjusted basis, you have operating expenses high single digits, and actually most of that - 6 ppt - is due to the acquisitions, so the underlying growth of our underlying expenses is relatively small, okay? Now, when you put the FX translation into it, you have to deduct about 2 to 3 percentage points, so you\u2019re getting for the as-reported opex growth into the mid-single digit range.","Ajay Banga","So you get a benefit from the euro and expenses, just that you get a headwind on the revenue. That\u2019s kind of what\u2019s going on. The M&A transactions, what\u2019s happening is you typically get--the first year or two, you tend to get the expenses, that you\u2019ve got to either get them up to speed with our systems or with our security or the investment you\u2019re putting in to do things with their technology or their geography or their distribution, and then you get the revenue that comes in a little later. Or, you get things like C-SAM, which are really more building our capacity, our mobile and digital, and doesn\u2019t really give you a lot of revenue in the first year or two or three. That\u2019s the mix that\u2019s going on inside our company.","Operator","Don Fandetti from Citigroup is online with a question.","Don Fandetti","Yes Ajay, I had a question around tokenization. I was wondering if you can help us understand sort of the timeline for tokenization for online browser-based purchases. I think Visa had mentioned there could be some products over the next few quarters. How will that sort of play out?","Ajay Banga","You know, before digital space, if you kind of bust it up between in-app, contactless and online browser, as you read through it, contactless is still relatively small in the U.S., online browsing tends to be the large amount. A number of the merchants and retailers have been launching their own apps in an effort to get people to come straight to their [indiscernible] and then hopefully control more of the transaction as well as the relationship with the consumer when they\u2019re inside their app, as compared to coming the usual way. So it depends who you believe, but everybody is making projections based on whatever they think about where these three will go over the next few years. ","My sense is you\u2019re going to get NFC growing decently, particularly with terminalisation, and I believe terminalisation will happen with all the EMV and chip migration as well as the fact our new terminals are coming contactless-equipped, so you\u2019re probably seeing a two or three-year cycle of a fairly dramatic increase in contactless-equipped terminals in the United States. That\u2019s only happening, by the way, in Australia and Canada, Turkey, and some other countries. But the U.S., which is the large one, I think you\u2019ll see that.","In terms of browsing, browsing tends to be the large chunk, and I still believe that online browsing will remain a pretty large number for a few years to come, and I think you\u2019ll get two or three kinds of efforts made. You\u2019ll get a lot of effort made around improving the card and file experience. You\u2019ll get a lot of efforts made around improving the use of easy use checkout wallets, whether it be MasterPass or Visa\u2019s offering, or PayPal or other such offerings. And I think you\u2019ll get all of those getting a degree of capabilities built with tokenization just making it safer and safer over the next few quarters.","So we\u2019re all working on similar things, and I don\u2019t think you should read too much into a quarter here or a quarter there. These things are slow burns. You saw Apply Pay talk about their mobile payment growth, and at the end of the day, yes, they\u2019ve done a great job and it\u2019s excited the market, but it\u2019s still a very small percentage of what the total number of transactions are.","So I would take all this in that context, and not run to the races with more than that. But we are very focused on--you know, tokenization and [indiscernible], just to make sure I don\u2019t miss that aspect. It\u2019s a very important aspect of where we\u2019re going for safety and security. Apple Pay was the first version of that to come out. We\u2019re putting it into MasterPass, just regular MasterPass over the next few--period of time, let me put it that way, so I don\u2019t give you information that\u2019s beyond what is likely, and that will be--you\u2019ll see in a year or two\u2019s time, tokenization will become kind of fiddlesticks in the game on ecommerce. [Indiscernible]","Operator","James Friedman with Susquehanna is online with a question.","James Friedman","Hi. I was hoping you could share some perspective on the relative performance of debit and credit domestically, excluding the gasoline vector. Is there any evidence of steering in the market? Thank you.","Ajay Banga","No, I don\u2019t--the last part of your question is about is there either steering or secular change going on in the behavior around credit and debit, and I\u2019d say there\u2019s no evidence of that. But you should know this, that the growth rate of debit versus credit, there are changes that are going on between that over time, and there\u2019s no doubt that as credit histories and credit positions are improving, banks are becoming more willing to go out and push credit acquisitions again, and that in itself will change over a period of time some degree of behavior between debit and credit. But there\u2019s no real pushing or steering or anything going on that I can see, not in our numbers, anyway.","Operator","Bill Carcache from Nomura is online with a question.","Bill Carcache","Thank you, good morning. Martina, you talked about how you actively hedge, I believe you said 50 to 75% of your FX exposure. Can you discuss some of the trade-offs behind why you wouldn\u2019t hedge an even greater percentage? Wouldn\u2019t forward contracts be relatively inexpensive? And then finally, if you could offer any thoughts at a high level on some of the more significant differences between your hedging strategies versus that of your large competitor, which last night discussed how they layer in their hedges on a rolling 12-month basis.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, so first of all with the last comment, of course we listen to each other\u2019s comments from time to time, and I would believe that we do a hedging strategy and have a hedging philosophy that is extremely similar. We layer in our hedges over a 12-month rolling period, so we never run, so to speak, naked during any type of period. We do it for the most significant currency pairs. You know that we are doing actually business in 150-plus currencies, but we really pick the most significant currency pairs in order to do our hedging. ","In order to do hedging, you have to have really appropriate exposure forecasts coming out over the next 12 months rolling period, and that is where you typically step back and take a little bit of a more conservative view and don\u2019t layer in 100% of the exposure in terms of hedges, you do 50 to 75%. So we don\u2019t take a view--the 50 to 75% is not taking a view in terms of hedging a particular currency pair, but it is in terms of making sure that between the exposure that we know and the hedges that we layer on, that we have the right kind of balance.","The one other thing that I wanted to let you know is just to make sure, we are hedging things on a net basis, which means we take revenues in that particular currency and we deduct the operating expenses that we spend in that particular currency, and then we do a hedge on that, and you would not see the gain or the loss on the hedge showing up in the revenue line. Most of that is actually reflected in our GMA line item.","Ajay Banga","By the way, this layered hedging is kind of the way that I used to work it, even in my previous job in the banking industry. When you go to companies--and that\u2019s exactly what you do. You go in and you attempt to hedge more of the exposure in the immediate quarter out there, a little less in the quarter after, a little less in the quarter after, and even a little less in the quarter after. So when Martina talks to you about the 50 to 75%, you\u2019re probably looking at a higher level hedge in the immediate quarter because you have more certainty of that net exposure within those currency pairs that she just referred to. You hedge a little less out four quarters because you have less certainty in those currency pairs that she\u2019s referring to.","Also remember, the euro and the real are not being discussed in those currency pairs. The 2 percentage point headwind that we\u2019ve already put in our revenue growth estimate for next year, it\u2019s from these currency pairs. The euro and the real goes over and beyond that, and kind of could be a far more significant one, particularly because of the euro, as Martina was pointing out.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s extremely helpful, thank you.","Operator","Tom McCrohan from Sterne Agee is on the line with a question.","Tom McCrohan","Hi Ajay. You talked about the commercial business in the past as having some good momentum. Can you just give us an update how the year ended out and what your prospects are in looking at 2015? Thanks.","Ajay Banga","That business exciting. We\u2019re doing well, and it\u2019s across the world, by the way. The U.S. has got the most traction in some ways, but there\u2019s good growth in Europe, there\u2019s good growth in Latin America. Asia, the Middle East, Africa remain real opportunities for us. I\u2019m not going to give you separate numbers for that, but you should know that it still is a big focus. We\u2019re focused on--T&E [ph] is focused on fleet cards, it\u2019s focused on purchasing, it\u2019s focused on some B2B payment streams. It\u2019s not just our own effort with individual clients like Bank of America and Chase and Citi that you heard me talk about our other global clients, but it\u2019s also focused on partnerships with companies in the travel space, partnerships with companies in the fleet management spaces. All of these are giving us opportunities in commercial.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Actually from a growth perspective, just to jump in here, it\u2019s really a nice mid-teens kind of growth worldwide.","Ajay Banga","There you go. Martina is willing to give you more information than I am. That\u2019s an exception.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Isn\u2019t that interesting? ","Operator","Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets is online with a question.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. Can you just speak a little bit to the nuances that we might expect to see as you get more and more of this mix shift in ecommerce? Inherently, it seems a little more credit-centric. The interchange categories are quite a bit different, so maybe there\u2019s a bigger pool from which everyone could draw from. I want to be thinking about this as this mix shift accelerates.","The other thing, if you could just kind of explain, the $50 million shift into G&A versus revenue from Russia, how did that come about? And I\u2019ll hop off - thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes Dan, so let me take the Russia question first. So what actually happened is the last legs of the legislation in Russia is that we continue to be a direct partner to our clients and that we actually will be facing our clients on all products and services that our clients need. Then we then subcontract in particular [indiscernible] in switching to the local processing entity, and therefore we still get the revenues from our clients but we have to pay a servicing fee which will be showing up in the data processing line to the local entity that would switch [indiscernible].","Ajay, on ecommerce?","Ajay Banga","I don\u2019t know how to answer that in a way that\u2019s different. I would say to you that what\u2019s going on in ecommerce right now is that you\u2019ve got--as you grow, there is no doubt that credit has a greater share than debit in ecommerce, although I\u2019d say that\u2019s also because the U.S. is a larger ecommerce market than most other parts of the world. In Europe, it\u2019s not as similar as it is in the U.S. Now remember, the U.K. and Spain, Portugal are more credit-sensitive now, northern Europe is more debit-sensitive, so a lot of it depends on the originating market from where the transaction is placed into the ecommerce system. So what we are seeing right now is also a function of mix, and I wouldn\u2019t try and draw more conclusions than that right now.","Dan Perlin","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank is online with a question.","Bryan Keane","Hi guys. Now that the European regs, the agreement seems to be in place between the three parties, just trying to get an idea of--you guys have probably looked at it for \u201916, what kind of an impact might there be. Secondly, Martina, just on operating margins for the year, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces. Should we expect fiscal year \u201915 operating margins to increase, and then what does that all total out to be for EPS growth as reported for fiscal year \u201915? Just want to make sure I have that right. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","On your first question, look - the European regulations, the text is finalized but there is a lot of work that has to be done in order to implement that, so I\u2019m not prepared to be giving you guidelines for 2016 at this point in time. That\u2019s why you are going to hear only later this year about our long-term performance targets as we are going to be renewing them for a period. ","Secondly on the operating margin, of course when you have high single digit revenue growth and high single digit opex growth on an FX-adjusted basis, you should basically assume that the operating margin, which is terrific for 2014, will be roughly a similar operating margin in 2015. We are not giving guidance for the bottom line. ","Operator","Let me now turn the call over to Ajay Banga for closing remarks. Ajay?","Ajay Banga","Great. Thank you all for those questions. I\u2019m going to just leave you with a few closing thoughts. ","We ended what I think was a very good year on a strong note. Seventeen percent revenue growth in fourth quarter, ex-FX, \u201914 with that effect, that\u2019s not a bad place to be. Volumes, share, innovation, deals - we\u2019ve done all of that while navigating through what I would say was one of the more complex economic and political years that I\u2019ve seen over the last decade. Aside from the actual couple of years of the financial crisis, this was probably one of the more difficult years. ","For 2015, we see the same underlying trends, economically and for our own business. We believe that we will deliver our three objectives, and that means that net revenue growth this year will be in the high single digit range at constant currency. So your question would be, why is that growth lower than 2014? Because one, we have those local FX headwinds that we were just discussing in the Q&A in those key currency pairs, and that\u2019s before the euro, by the way, and the real translation impact, which as you know is larger. But just those local FX headwinds and because there are some very good deals in the pipeline, both renewals and wins, that are probably going to have an upfront load. But they're good deals - they\u2019re good for us.","So if you look at all that, at the same time, we plan to keep investing in our business and our capabilities. We know how to dial our expenses up and down, and we\u2019re going to keep a very close eye on that if needed. I just don\u2019t overdo that through a short-term cycle. We took advantage of the tax benefits that, while sustainable as Martina talked about, they came to us in the latter part of the quarter and got finalized, and she and I sat down and said, you know what? This is a good time - Apple Pay is out in the market, price initiative [ph] out in the market. It\u2019s a good season and quarter for us - let\u2019s take some of this benefit and put it back into the system. Those kind of decisions are taken every week and every day by us together as a team. So overall, we haven\u2019t changed our thinking about our business prospects from what we indicated at our investor day a few months ago--or rather, the two investor days. ","The payments space is a terrific place to be. We are very confident in our ability to guide this company through the current mixed environment. We\u2019re going to keep growing share and we\u2019re going to keep driving the conversion of cash to electronic payments around the world. We expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance in the foreseeable future.","So thank you so much for your continued support of our company.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, Mellisa, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only the end of the queue will open for questions.","You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted.","As a reminder, in Q2 we updated our non-GAAP methodology that exclude the impact of gains or losses on our equity investments. We are excluding these items as we believe this will facilitate a better understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. Our non-GAAP measures also exclude the impact of special items, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items. In addition, we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency with the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance.","Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of the earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that I will now turn the call over to Ajay Banga.","Ajay Banga","Thanks, Warren, and good morning everybody. So we drove strong results this quarter, revenue up 16%, EPS up 23% versus a year ago. On a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, growth was broad-based and reflects our focus on execution, robust business drivers across the board and ongoing investment in our business for the long term.","On the macroeconomic environment, our view is kind of unchanged. That is that consumer spending remains relatively strong with some moderation versus 2018. We obviously, like everyone else, is monitoring ongoing trade negotiations and other economic and geopolitical factors which are showing signs of weighing on business sentiment in particular. And the U.S. economic growth remains stable with low unemployment and solid consumer confidence. Retail sales were pretty consistent with the prior quarter, growing at 3.8% versus a year ago ex auto, ex gas, according to our SpendingPulse estimates.","In Europe, we see modest growth overall. Third quarter total retail spending in the UK were solid according to our SpendingPulse estimates while uncertainty around the potential impact of Brexit obviously remains. It's a daily drama being played out on television. In Asia Pacific, we are monitoring the impact of the U.S.-China trade negotiations, which are negatively affecting business sentiment in the region. We are however seeing accommodative monetary policies in several markets there to support growth.","And in Latin America, the outlook is mixed with countries like Brazil and Colombia showing some positive signs from weakness in Argentina and Mexico. That's the backdrop, and against that, we are driving healthy double-digit volume and transaction growth for Mastercard across most of our markets with momentum in our core product areas in services and in new payment flows.","So let's dive into some recent business highlights. First, core products, we are driving growth in our core products with new and renewed customer relationships across credit, debit, prepaid and commercial. I'm pleased to announce that we have extended our global agreement with Citi for an additional five years through 2029. With this we will remain Citi's exclusive global partner in Citi branded consumer credit, debit, and small business. We're also continuing to build upon our strong partnership with Citi's Treasury and trade solutions group where we are working together to expand the breadth of services provided with Citi's corporate clients, including through the use of Mastercard's payments gateway. And together, I think these position us to partner even more closely over the next decade on digital initiatives, on driving consumer credit and debit growth on B2B and the development of new payment solutions and joint marketing efforts to continue growing our businesses together.","We've also extended our global deal with HSBC for its premier credit portfolio focused on the high-net-worth segment and that builds on our existing partnership which includes products like the HSBC Rewards card that we launched in the UK and the multi-currency debit card launched in Hong Kong last month. HSBC is another great example of a customer that leverages several Mastercard services like Advisors, MasterCard Lab and Loyalty to bring value to its customers and drive growth across its account base.","With Bank of America, we have renewed and expanded many of our business lines across consumer and small business credit and debit in the United States, including brand exclusivity on the forward issuance of small business credit and the small business travel card. We will work together towards continued growth in our debit and commercial business, in particular with Mastercard as the primary network on new commercial business outside of the United States. Additionally, Bank of America has committed to being our next Mastercard Track B2B Hub customers bringing enhanced account payable capabilities to its clients in the United States.","H&R Block has renewed its agreement to offer Mastercard prepaid cards and additionally, we'll be piloting our APT Test & Learn capabilities and new data fraud tools.","On the U.S. co-brand front this quarter, we won a flip [ph] of the BMW consumer credit co-brand portfolio and they're making further progress in Europe, extending our debit agreement with Intesa Sanpaol in Italy which is committed to converting more than 6 million Maestro cards to Mastercard debit. We've also expanded our relationship with UniCredit to become its preferred Pan-European partner.","In other markets, we are building on our momentum of issuers, merchants and diverse partners like telcos. You can see that in Latin America where we've executed a regional deal with Scotiabank and we'll be converting debit cards in several Caribbean markets to Mastercard. In India, where we won an exclusive consumer credit co-brand with IndiGo Airlines, the country's largest airline; and in Africa where Airtel will exclusively use Mastercard's network for it's prepaid virtual cards and QR capabilities from mobile wallets across 11 markets there.","Now specifically related to our core commercial business, we've expanded our relationship with Brex. You know them as an innovator in the corporate space, and now we will be their preferred network in the U.S. We've also inked a 10-year deal with Emirates Islamic Bank to be its exclusive commercial credit network across the UAE.","And to our efforts to partner with local switches to increase the transaction that we switch, we are the first Internet national network to receive central bank approval and have begun domestic switching our Mastercard branded debit cards in Indonesia through an agreement with the largest domestic switch Artajasa.","Our current digital initiatives click-to-pay, which is the name for the EMV secure remote commerce standard is now live in the U.S. aiming at enabling a faster, most secure checkout experience across the web and mobile sites, mobile apps and connected devices. Rocket Time, Movember, Cinemark are the first merchants to the launch together with distribution partners such as IDM, FIS global payments, and Stripe. We are planning for a broader market launch in the first half of 2020 with click-to-pay, Mastercard's merchant partners would benefit from automatic access to NuDetect, a Mastercard artificial intelligence and merchant machine learning solution that provides an added layer of security when a consumer has to check out using Mastercard on click-to-pay.","On the fintech front, we've strengthened existing partnerships and winning new deals around the globe by leveraging our technology and relationships in new ways to support these customers who have very specific needs. And a couple of examples include an expanded global partnership and Revolut which has been a Mastercard issuer for several years in Europe and will first launch its cards in the U.S. with Mastercard by the end of the year, followed by other markets across Asia-Pacific and Latin America.","Monzo has selected Mastercard to be its exclusive debit partner for its U.S. launch. And SoFi has also chosen Mastercard for its credit and debit programs. Now, additionally, we expanded our Accelerate program to the U.S., providing local fintechs with support through all stages of growth with easy access to a range of programs including our digital fund solutions, our API and development programs and our start-up engagement platform Start Path.","In our new payment flows and as you know we've developed and acquired a broad set of capabilities, which together with our card rails allow us to differentiate our offerings and address new payment flows and operate as a one-stop shop for our customers providing choice across multiple rails. In this quarter, we announced our intent to acquire the clearing and instant payment services and e-billing solution of the Nets' Corporate services businesses in the Nordics as we capitalize on the large global real-time payments opportunity.","Real-time payments provide a smarter and faster alternative to traditional ACH cash and checks to bring efficiency, much richer data, and a much better user experience. We believe Nets will complement and strengthen our existing capabilities across all three layers of our strategy, which as you recall from Investor Day would offer infrastructure applications for end-users and value-added services for account payment trails. Now this builds upon prior real-time payment wins, including in the Philippines, Peru, Saudi Arabia and our partnership to P27 to deliver real-time and batch payments in the Nordics. We've talked about these in prior earnings calls and on Investor Day.","In the meantime, we are progressing our B2B initiatives. I already mentioned Bank of America signing up for the B2B Hub in the U.S. First Hawaiian Bank has also agreed to be their customer. And as we discussed at our Investor Day, we are addressing business payments more comprehensively, both accounts payable and accounts receivables, with Mastercard Track Business Payment Service. To solve for the complexities involved with B2B payments, this service will help companies find businesses that they need to pay, operate within a known set of standards and rules, provide full and rich remittance data, and offer a single connection with access to multiple payment types and rails.","We showed you one of the use cases that runs on real-time payment rails, payments on delivery, and this is the one where drivers who are delivering goods through a physical store can be paid electronically real-time by buyers who can manage all of their invoices and payments more efficiently. I'm pleased to announce that BNC is the first bank to pilot this capability with its customers in the U.S.","As a multi-rail network, we're also able to offer services to our customers based on account-to-account flows. So for example, we already have customers in the U.K. benefiting from data insights, we are able to provide with our broad view through VocaLink. This helps them with anti-money laundering compliance and identification and prevention of other financial crimes. Continuing with the idea of expanding these services outside of the U.K., the clearing house has just announced that it will launch our Phase [ph] financial crime solution for AML compliance in the U.S.","And as previously announced, we will be launching these services in the Philippines as well as part of our real-time payment infrastructure there. Before I close, I wanted to mention the announcement we made about acquiring SessionM, a U.S.-based technology company that provides end-to-end loyalty solutions for merchants. We expect this acquisition to strengthen our ability to provide a complete platform-based loyalty solution, starting from data management to campaign execution and program measurement to our merchant customers, doing all of this while delivering a seamless digital experience for the consumers of those merchant customers. SessionM has a growing base of leading customers that includes McDonald's, PepsiCo and Lowe's among others. We expect to close this acquisition this year.","With that let me turn the call over to Sachin for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Sachin?","Sachin Mehra","Thanks, Ajay. Turning to Page 3, you will see we delivered strong performance this quarter. Here are a few highlights on a currency-neutral basis and excluding both special items related to certain legal and tax matters in 2018, as well as the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments.","Net revenue grew 16% driven by solid momentum in our core and was slightly ahead of our expectations due to stronger-than-expected services growth. Acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to net revenue growth in the quarter. Total operating expenses increased 16%, which includes in 3 ppt increase related to acquisitions. The remaining 13% was related to our ongoing investment in strategic initiatives and was slightly lower than expected.","Operating income grew by 17% and net income was up 20%, reflecting our strong operating performance. Each includes a 1 ppt reduction due to acquisitions. Net income growth was also positively impacted by approximately 2 ppt due to a one-time tax benefit and approximately 1 ppt due to certain non-recurring gains, within other income and expenses.","EPS grew 23% year-over-year to $2.15, which includes $0.04 related to the one-time tax benefit, and $0.01 due to the non-recurring items and OIE that I just mentioned. The remaining $2.10 includes a $0.05 contribution from share repurchases and $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions.","During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.8 billion worth of stock, and an additional $449 million through October 24, 2019.","So now let's turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 14% on a local currency basis, up 1 ppt from last quarter, primarily due to the impact of the differing number of processing days between periods.","U.S. GDV grew 12%, up approximately 2 ppt from last quarter with credit and debit growth of 15% and 9% respectively. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 16%, up 1 ppt from last quarter. Cross border volume grew at 17% on a local currency basis in line with expectations and driven by double-digit growth across most regions.","Turning to Page 5, switched transactions showed strong growth at 20% globally, reflecting in part the ongoing adoption of contactless payments. We saw a healthy double-digit growth in switched transactions across all regions. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued.","So now let's turn to page for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The 16% net revenue increase was primarily driven by strong transaction and volume growth, as well as particularly strong growth in our services offerings, partially offset by rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt due to this growth.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 12% while worldwide GDV grew 14%. The 2 ppt difference is driven by mix and the impact of an additional processing day on GDV growth in Q3.","Cross border volume fees grew 16% while cross border volumes grew 17%. The 1 ppt difference is mainly driven by mix, partially offset by pricing. Transaction processing fees grew 18% while the switched transactions grew 20%. The difference is primarily due to mix. And finally, other revenues were up 34%, including a 4 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was higher than expected and was primarily driven by growth in our data and services and cyber and intelligence solutions.","Moving on to Page 7, you can see that on a currency-neutral non-GAAP basis, total operating expenses increased 16%, this includes 3 ppt related to acquisitions. The remaining 13% of growth related to our continued investment in strategic initiatives such as digital enablement, safety and security, geographic expansion, and new payment flows. This was lower than expected due to the timing of certain investment initiatives, which we now expect to occur in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 8, let's discuss what we've seen through the first three weeks of October where each of our drivers are broadly consistent with what we saw in Q3. The numbers through October 21 are as follows. Starting with switched volume we saw global growth of 15%, down 1 ppt from Q3. In the U.S., our switched volume grew 11% down 1 ppt sequentially in part due to lower PIN debit growth. Switched volume outside the U.S. grew 19% similar to the third quarter.","Globally, switched transaction growth was 20% similar to the third quarter. With respect to cross border, our volumes grew 16% globally, down 1 ppt.","So as we close out 2019, our business continues to perform well as we have had another solid quarter featuring several new and renewed deals, as Ajay just mentioned, as well as strong services revenue. Consumer spending remains healthy with some moderation versus year ago as expected.","In terms of net revenues, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, we now expect to grow at the high end of the low-teens rate for the year, up slightly from prior expectations. Acquisitions will add about a half a ppt to this revenue growth for the year. In addition, due to the stronger U.S. dollar, we now expect FX to be a 3 ppt headwind to revenue for the year. For our operating expenses on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items, we continue to expect growth at the high end of high-single digits for the year.","On the same basis for the fourth quarter, we expect growth in the high single-digits range versus a year ago. Acquisitions will add about 3 ppt to OpEx growth for the year and 6 ppt to the fourth quarter, primarily related to purchase accounting and integration-related costs. In addition, we expect FX will be a tailwind to OpEx of about 2 ppt for the year and 1 ppt for Q4.","And now just a quick comment on acquisitions. Overall, our acquisitions are progressing well and our approach towards managing them has not changed. We expect them to breakeven within 24 months of close, after which the acquisition is included in the base and the respective manager responsible for delivering on the revenue and earnings growth targets within that context.","As a reminder, Q3 other income and expense included some one-time benefits that are not expected to recur in Q4 and investment income has been trending down due to lower interest rates. In terms of the non-GAAP tax rate for the year, we now expect it to be approximately 18% due to the discrete tax benefits taken year-to-date.","With that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thanks, Sachin. Melissa, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.","Warren Kneeshaw","Let's go to the next one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","Hey, thanks guys, nice trends again. Can you just first start off talking a bit more about the cross-border trends continue to hold up well? We're hearing a lot of questions macro-wise, but it seems like it's not really affecting you. So first, maybe a little more granularity of what you're actually seeing there. And then quickly on the expense side, again, it beat us, and I know you mentioned some one-time items, Sachin, just what are your thoughts on the growth profile? Is it consistently like modeling wise high single-digit the right way to think about it?","Sachin Mehra","Sure, Darrin. And let me take that. I'll take the cross-border question first. So, what we're seeing from a cross-border standpoint is very much in line with our expectations. We continue to see double-digit growth across most of our regions, and we continue to actually expect mid-teens growth for the full year 2019. They drill down a little bit more into it, what we're seeing is that U.S. inbound and outbound cross border volumes are very much in line sequentially, China cross border growth continues to be also stable in that low double-digits range. Europe continues its strong trends there The fintech leadership position that we've got in Europe and in particularly in the U.K. as well as our commercial travel programs are too particularly strong contributors that we're seeing here. So all in all, actually, what I tell you from a cross-border fence standpoint, in line with our expectations, we continue to believe that we'll deliver mid-teens growth for the full year of 2019 and really things look pretty good.","On your question as it relates to expenses, you're right, in Q3, the expenses did come in lower than our expectations. We now expect that those expenses will be incurred in Q4 as per what I just shared with you. Holistically, what I would tell you is that for operating expenses, on a full year basis, we continue to believe that we'll be at the high end of high single digits very much in line with what we've shared with you previously as well.","Warren Kneeshaw","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi, good morning, good results. The services line, you mentioned Sachin was better than expected, so what can you give us a little bit more on what surprise to the upside and maybe some guidance on the growth from here in the short and mid-term. Thank you.","Sachin Mehra","Sure, Tien-tsin. So, yes, you're right. Services came in stronger than expected. We had, you know, good performance across both our cyber and intelligence solutions as well as our data and services solutions. The one thing I'll remind you about services is they tend to be lumpy. Quarter to quarter depending on the customer deals which we've signed and those which we've executed on, the number is kind of -- move around based on how the execution plans are going on in that. All in all, the performance in services continues to be strong. We've had a couple of, what I would say, stronger than expected quarters between Q2 and Q3 but nothing other than that that I would report as being unusual. There is very good receptivity for the capabilities that we're putting out into the market. As you heard Ajay talk in the script, he mentioned about how some of the wins we've had recently have been enabled by what we deliver from a services capability standpoint and you're seeing all of that manifest itself in the numbers coming through right now.","Warren Kneeshaw","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning, Ajay and Sachin. I had a question about the investments in more sort of strategic or the holistic question around fast ACH. One topic that doesn't get a lot of attention when it comes to fast ACH or push payments more broadly, it is around fraud, which I imagine [Technical Difficulty] on the poor payment side like what we're accustomed to with card payments. Can you just talk about as you're building out VocaLink and now it's like what's the nature of fraud exactly when it comes to fast ACH and how do you think that or how do you differentiate versus other providers? Thank you.","Ajay Banga","Hi, Lisa. Your voice came and went a little bit in between but I got the idea that you are checking on fraud to do with fast ACH as compared to cards is very different. So my -- the first thing is if you get invoice fraud, that kind of happens as part of the game. You get not just the payment fraud, you invoicing fraud as well. So it's kind of got two sides to the story in commercial payments and one of the things that we can do using AI and machine learning is we can help with both aspects of that transaction, the presenter of that invoice to be accurate, being able to search through the invoices they are getting, to be able to find and track invoices that don't fit the pattern or don't fit the trend you should be getting and as well as on the payment side. And then, of course, you get the opportunity for managing authorization levels and approval authorities and the like inside a corporation as well with the tools we can build.","And then there's the bigger picture, which is the one we talked about, which is around anti-money laundering at a level in a market as a whole in VocaLink's case in the U.K., because we see so many of the transactions, principally all of the transactions in the U.K. I think once we get P27 and Nets done in the Nordics, that will be the same case there as well as in the Philippines and others. We can actually apply these AI tools to find pockets of money mules and nodes of money movement that you cannot easily find otherwise. Of course, the Holy Grail here would be to be able to connect us across markets, so we can find anti-money laundering trends that also are happening cross border and cross markets. Those are harder because as you know ACH has tended to be whether batch or real-time has tended to be country by country. And so, it's a little more difficult to, to get the cross-border trends as of now.","Lisa Ellis","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Harshita Rawat","Hi, good morning. Sachin, a question in switched transactions [Technical Difficulty] nicely from last quarter and it's probably the strongest we have seen in many quarters. So can you talk about the drivers there in terms of increasing contactless penetration as you noted, but also grade [Technical Difficulty] change of transaction side [Technical Difficulty]? And also, how does the contactless rollout in the U.S. impact this in 2020 and beyond?","Sachin Mehra","Yes, thanks, Harshita. You're right. Switched transaction growth continues to be moving along at a healthy pace and there are a few factors which are kind of impacting that. There's certainly the adoption of contactless payments globally. We are seeing good strength in markets in Europe. We're seeing good strength in Canada and in market strength in Australia, but also in the U.S., right. So with the recent launch of contactless payments in the transit systems particularly in the New York area, you were starting to see good adoption come through both from a acceptance standpoint, but also from a card issuance standpoint. So that's kind of one facet which is contributing to switched transaction growth, but I would remind everyone here that besides contactless payments, the fact that we have market share gains and those market share gains are occurring in markets where we have more switching taking place, it is also a contributing factor to our switched transaction growth.","And then the final piece, which I'll mention is, as we are working actively to win more switching from what was previously being done on domestic switches, case in point as what Ajay mentioned as it relates to the work bidding in Indonesia, those are all contributing factors which are helping with this trajectory from a switched transaction growth standpoint.","Ajay Banga","We are now seeing about 56-odd percent [ph] of our transactions. And that's up from 40-something percent 5, 10 years ago. And that's a very conscious effort to see more transactions so we can do more with them in the form of our services business as well, as well as increase our relevance domestically in each country. Once you start seeing more transactions, you're playing a better role in the transaction flow of that marketplace.","Harshita Rawat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.","Ramsey El-Assal","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about B2B payments. And the addressable market there has been large for so long and it feels like the ecosystem is gaining momentum and you guys have launched track. What has constrained B2B broadly speaking before and what is changing now? What factors are changing now that are allowing you guys to go after it more aggressively?","Sachin Mehra","Yes, Ramsey, it's Sachin. I'll take that one. So he're what I'd tell you. I'd say, you've got to think about B2B payments in the context of things which we, as a network, have been doing for some time now, which is addressing them at the point of sale because there are business to business payments we take just at the point of sale, which is our traditional commercial business which has been growing at a healthy clip [ph] and has been any decent revenue contributor over many years. This is our typical T&E products, our small business propositions, our Bcard [ph] products. And then there is in the accounts payable space, which is the opportunity which has and historically been penetrated in a meaningful manner. But over the last four or five years, starting with our merchant card capabilities, we've been making good advances out there.","All of that still happens to be on card rails related to payments. The problem statement in B2B actually extends beyond just moving money from point A to point B. It's also about delivering data effectively between the buyer and the seller of goods and services. And as we go down the path of our Mastercard Track capabilities, you will see that a lot of what we are doing in addition to delivering payments is enabling more seamless transmission of data to allow for better reconciliation of those payments. So it's about creating the right ecosystem to be able to capture the data, transmit the data, and deliver it in a manner where the use or the receiver money can apply that data in a useful manner. So that's what things like Track do. So that's kind of one piece you should think about.","The other piece comes around the importance of safety and security in B2B payments. And as we've been building new services capabilities in the safety and security space, it will be -- what will help us, also expand the B2B universe. The bottom-line is the following. This will take some time. There is an ecosystem which has got to be built out. There is capabilities which we have invested in and continue to invest in, we will be able to to rollout. Like, the point really is, it's not just about the payment. It's much more than the payment when you think about B2B payments.","And then there's real-time payments, which comes into play. Everything I've spoken about right now relates to cards and data. But as we go into the real-time payment universe you will see things like payment and delivery. It's a B2B solution. We just announced that we are piloting that with PNC. That is about leveraging our multi-real strategy to participate in those accounts payable also well beyond cards.","Warren Kneeshaw","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. Your line is open.","Brett Huff","Good morning and congrats on the nice results. Can you guys embellish a little bit on the Mastercard Track? It's sort of interesting you said that there is an ecosystem that needed to be built out, I think you were referring specifically to that. This is a product that we've been particularly focused on. Can you tell us kind of where we are there in terms of signing people up and when we kind of reached the tipping point for when that growth -- we can see that growth really start to take off?","Ajay Banga","Brett, it's Ajay. I think this is not an easy answer that will be done in your x month or y year. This is a [indiscernible]. I think of in the consumer payments space where are all the network plays is to create that ecosystem. Start with a directory. Basically, merchants and consumers are two sides of a directory. We need such a directory in B2B payments connecting millions of buyers with millions of sellers. Mastercard Track has got a directory of 200-plus million businesses on it. There is still more to be added. It's been a fragmented system across many countries with many different players. Bringing it together and making it less fragmented is a job that will take years before it actually gets to fruition in its full form. But then you can start building with what you've got. And inside that, we are building with it a set of payments optimization engine on multi-rails. So the buyer and the seller can decide whether they want credit or they want to pay in advance and\/or a frac of the bill or they want pay later. All that comes out of that optimization engine. And for buyers and sellers to understand that and to begin to incorporate that, remember, we are not talking big companies here. Those guys are very sophisticated in what they do. Just the big mass of middle market and small businesses that actually need help on this front.","And then there's the whole issue of what Sachin talked about, the information and the richness of the data that enables reconciliation of payments to be much more seamless. That's a fairly large tasks and they aren't as easy as connecting points and switching people on. You've got to find your way through all these aspects. So we are working our way through it. So when you see us launching a B2B Hub in the U.S., and I think more banks and other companies into it, those are buyers' agents and sellers' agents, you can see us getting scale by adding more people there. Similarly, in Australia, we launched the B2B Hub with what was MYOB and there's more coming into that that's all part of getting scale. So, as I said often, we are doing a lot of things in this space. You should think of this as a two-, three-, four-year effort to get to scale and size. And that's what we are investing in it.","Brett Huff","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Christopher Donat","Hi, good morning. I had a question about click-to-pay or secure remote commerce. I'm just wondering as you move from the soft launch that's going on now to the more serious launch in 1Q 2020, can we expect a big uplift in marketing spend or will this be sort of within the context of your typical marketing efforts?","Ajay Banga","Yes, I mean, we'll play that a little bit by ear as we normally do with an event like this. I think you'll see us do some spending on marketing because, we are keen to get this established, but we're going to start the marketing in a bigger way when there is enough distribution off the button and enough merchants, so that the marketing dollar we'll spend is spent well amortized over many merchants. So I don't know that will be a 1Q event. You might see it later in the year. It just depends on the pace of installation of this button through our distribution partners. You heard me talk about FIS an RDN and global payments and Stripe and others like that, and of course, through all the efforts, we as an industry make directly as well.","Warren Kneeshaw","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hi, Ajay. Hi, Sachin. So the question is could you shed more color on the health care unit announcement from yesterday that primarily a formalization of capabilities you already had because I thought you're already doing some of the analytics and billing work there. And more broadly, clearly, healthcare is an important quarter call [ph], but should we expect more of a verticalized push, I noticed here in Vegas, you guys have a major presence not only at Money 2020, but also at the digital health event.","Ajay Banga","Hey, what happens in Vegas should stay in Vegas, so [indiscernible]. You're making it on a public call for God's sake, I don't know. Okay. I'm just kidding. So yes, healthcare, so yes, we participate in healthcare through Flexible Spending Account and healthcare saving account, and Health Reimbursement arrangement and all those three-letter acronyms that we've got in the U.S. around health care payments for consumers to the cards, we do those. And you will see us continuing our effort to gain share in that space because that's kind of a lower hanging fruit in the healthcare space to take away one of the pain points in the healthcare payment and reimbursement system. But it's only one. There are plenty more. And the real issue we're trying to do with this announcement is to show you that we are beginning work on those other pain points. We've got a few clients already who have worked with us over the last six months to one year on some of these topics. They include providers like hospital systems. They include payers like individual sort of the insurance companies. And what we are trying to do is to systematize that and make that a business opportunity for our company and take our analytics as well as our payment capability and apply it across this very obvious paint point industry in the United States. For the time being, it's U.S.-centric.","So to give you examples, we are talking about getting into what we call a patient payment assurance, which is really predictive analytics to enable the hospital, the provider, the doctor in it to get more effective billing strategies that are tailored to the kind of patient they're getting. So if you look at segment patients basing on payment burden, on individual payment behaviors, and you would develop new billing strategies customized to that patient's unique profile.","The second one is to use AI and machine learning to detect suspicious claims and if you go to the insurance companies, they will tell you that fighting suspicious claims is one of the most important things, that's why you as a consumer very often get these detailed inquiries from your insurer, which gets you to be unhappy. All they are trying to do is to fight the issue of suspicious claims. And again, we can help new providers reduce on-boarding risk. We can monitor provide behavior and risk levels. We can manage daily transaction fraud risk in real-time. That's kind of what we do in the payments business. That's why our cyber and intelligence business are growing well. I think we can apply the same knowledge and capability to this marketplace.","And then thirdly, we are focusing on data security. And there, the idea is, to use bio-metrics which will allow patients to be identified better and of course behavioral analytics to protect health information. So it's through mobile access being authenticated better to access [ph] the accounts and call centers and patient portals auto-detect cyber threats in real time, so we can lower operational investigative costs, those are examples. So think of us as taking our current capability in payments and data, adapting into the need of a specific sort of vertical called healthcare, both for payers and for providers, and then finding a way to get that into distribution. That's the real task. We will get it out there with enough providers and with enough payers. That's the work we are undertaking now and probably what you heard in Vegas.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thanks, Ajay. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Don Fandetti","So, Ajay, interesting comments on the Citi renewal around Treasury and trade solutions. Just wanted to get your sense on how B2B is really impacting negotiations with issuers on renewals, and then kind of makes me think out loud that, if you look at digital and B2B, the integration is becoming deeper and things like switches are much more unlikely going forward. And then will we see any type of impact to the economics, whether it's rebates, etc., or will it not really be visible to us what's going on behind the scenes on B2B?","Ajay Banga","Yes, so, I mean, I wouldn't conclude that the Citi deal renewing the consumer aspect of 2029 including small business, I wouldn't conclude that that deal had economics from the B2B aspect of our relationship built into it. That's not what I said. What I said was we renewed the Citi consumer deal for 2029 exclusive for Citi branded cards both consumer debit and small business. We are continuing our partnership with the trade services business on things like the Mastercard payments gateway. And frankly, a bunch of other things that I haven't even talked about and as part of our B2B payments, including what we are going to do with real-time payments and cross-border possibilities with the company.","Your question is deeper. Your question is that, does this help us go to institutions with a more holistic discussion? I think Don, as you recall from your days even in other institutions, it depends a little bit how well-stitched together their org structure is. In a number of the larger banks around the world, the institutional client group, the corporate banking business tends to be isolated from the consumer group. In others, they don't. And so, in some institutions, they started coming together in portions of it like in acquiring or in a payment gateway and others they're quite distinct. Commercial cards tend to be in one space. Corporate T&E cards [indiscernible] while consumer tends to be in the other. That is kind of how these institutions are run.","And so, there is a opportunity over time for us to stitch together our improving B2B capabilities with our consumer capabilities. Certainly, the institutions look at it holistically, but over time, even as others as they come together. And clearly, at the right level of management, we do that all the time. So if you talk to the CEO or the CFO of somebody up at that level -- Mike Corbat was at our office the other day, obviously, we're discussing all aspects of Citi because he cares deeply about the whole of Citi's P&L and that's how it should be. So I wouldn't conclude right now that this has made so much progress that you will be able to get insights that are different in them. It's kind of like two efforts going alone in the company.","Don Fandetti","Thank you.","Ajay Banga","But your point about will it make switching harder, I don't know. We'll see. By gentle belief is that the more you do with an institution, the more your value is visible to that institution. And that's kind of how we've approached it. And if you have value that you bring, whether it's a merchant or a bank or a telco or a government, they will tend to be more thoughtful on their transactions with you.","Don Fandetti","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is open.","Robert Napoli","Thank you and good morning. The -- just want to dig a little deeper into the services business and the organic growth of that business and then what -- and I know you mentioned, Ajay, that data and cyber in particular were strong this quarter and then what you're looking to add to that additionally through the M&A side?","Ajay Banga","Bob, the organic growth is great. I mean, I'll give you an anecdotal example but Applied Predictive Technologies, APT is the company that helped us understand what it can do on Test and Learn through their patented [ph] processes, which we've now put into almost all our data and services business. We actually did revenue bookings in them in one month, a few months ago which is equal to what we did in the year we bought them. That gives you a sense of the multiplier factor that a good business with outstanding people can get through the distribution that we can give them and the link to our client base that they we can provide. That's the -- we bought them and then we've grown them organic. So there's that going on.","The same is true of new data and what we now call NuDetect. So they get bought as inorganic. Then they get merged into us and then it becomes part of our organic base two years later then it's basically being put through our distribution system to get access to much larger scale. And then we keep adding capabilities into that business through our own team of AI and machine learning and data scientist people who can help us build out the repertoire that that company is willing and capable of offering.","Where do you see us doing more of this? Well, as I've said, sometimes we are very keen to continue to expand in everything we do with cyber security and predictive modeling of that space. I continue to believe that digital identity, cyber security, identifying fraudulent transactions, the capacity to identify people correctly companies correctly you you heard me say that on the B2B payment answer a little while ago, that's going to be very important. Similarly, loyalty and rewards, and we've added scale to that and we continue to build that out as part of our managed services business. I continue to believe that to be an area where you will see us focusing. You will see us focusing on anything that can help us with AI and data analytics as we go back. These are to me all important spaces in services as distinct from what we might want to do in real-time payments and B2B. I think that's the kind of space you'll see us focusing on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman","Hi, thank you for taking my question. Sachin, in your prior answer, I thought that the inference was that there are some services pull through from B2B. I want to make sure that that was right. You mentioned safety and security and you mentioned Mastercard Track. Is that true that that's a place that where we would see B2B being populated? And I just -- I'm going to try it. So you reported 34% FX-neutral in other revenue. Is that a good proxy for services or is that too simple? Thank you.","Sachin Mehra","Yes. So I'll take the second part of your question first. And I think I need a clarification on your first question. But on the second part, other revenues does comprise services-related revenues. But services revenues also show up in our transaction processing fees. So I think, you've just got to be careful about assuming that there is a one-to-one correlation between other revenues, and our services revenue. Other revenues has other stuff going on in there as well. So that's kind of point one.","On the 30% growth rate; about 4 points of that, like I said, came from acquisitions, and then the remaining 30% came from a whole bunch of activity, primarily driven by the strong growth we've seen in our services capabilities both on deal and services as well as on our cyber and intelligence solutions. And Jimmy, I want to make sure I got the first question right. What exactly were you asking? I wasn't sure I quite understood that.","James Friedman","Yes, I was trying to figure out is just simply put is services showing up in the B2B ecosystem because it -- maybe I was exaggerating but it seemed like in the answer to one of your prior questions you had suggested there might be some pull through there.","Sachin Mehra","Yes, well -- it's like AML and the money laundering product. That will -- as a B2B solution and that's a service in terms of data analytics, right Ajay?","Ajay Banga","Yes. And again, if you go back to what we've articulated previously as part of our strategy, which is we will participate at the infrastructure level, at the application level, and the services level. So if you think about services, that is something we will apply not only to card rails, we will also apply it to our non-card rails. The question really is where we started, which is mostly our services capabilities have been focused on servicing our customers on the card side. As we keep building out our B2B capabilities on the non-card side, that is very much going to be a focus area where we go from a services capability standpoint.","James Friedman","Thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave [ph] from Baird. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, hey guys, this is just kind of a high-level simplistic question, but last year, revenue growth kind of organic constant currency revenue growth was actually the weakest in Q4, so you have quite an easy comp in Q4 this year. Are there any call outs to think of last year that might or might not make this Q4 '19 actually be the fastest growth given the easy comp on last year?","Ajay Banga","So, Dave, as I said in my opening remarks, no more real color I'm going to give you as it relates to specifics on revenue growth for Q4. We did mention that we believe our net revenue growth for the full year will now come in at the high end of the low-teens rate, which is up slightly to what we had previously shared. And look, it's business as usual, right. There's lots of puts and takes, which take place as it relates to how our revenues are growing. I think the bottom line, which I would leave you with is the following. The driver growth continues to remain strong and that's across the board, it's true for GDV, it's true for our cross-border. It's true for switched transactions. It's true for our other revenue line item. That's point number one.","Point number two is, we did talk to you a couple of weeks ago or about a month ago at our Investor Community Day and, well, I'm not updating our three-year outlook at this point in time. We did mention to you at that point in time that we still expect our three-year outlook to be as what we mentioned at our Investor Day. So look, I mean, the bottom line I would tell you is the following, we are running the business to make sure we're driving valuables in the short, medium and long-term and that's what we'll continue to do on a going forward basis.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw","Time for one final question.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Craig Moore from Autonomous. Your line is open.","Craig Moore","Yes, good morning. Thanks. Two quick questions. First on rebates and incentives, is there anything we should be thinking about either related to the Citi renewal or the cadence of renewals next year that will influence the percentage of gross one way or another? And secondly, with regards to the acquisition of Nets, can you talk about how the Omni Billing technology will accelerate what you're already doing with transactors [ph] and Bill Pay Exchange. Thanks.","Ajay Banga","Sure, Craig. So I'll take, I'll take the question you've got as it relates to deal renewals and stuff like that. Look, I mean, I think you've got to keep in mind that the renewals which you hear about every quarter are not happening primarily within the quarter. In other words, they might close in a particular quarter but they're typically in the works for a while. So when we share with you our outlook, which is what we've shared with you both on this call for 2019, as well as the Investor Day for our three-year objectives they contemplate this level of renewal to take place. So I wouldn't call anything special out as it relates to unusual activity from our previous and incentive standpoint, all contemplated in what we shared with you in these various two forums.","On your other question, as it relates to the Omni Billing solution for Net, it's a very solid capability, it is one where we see is the potential for tremendous amounts of synergies, both in terms of how we expand that capability globally as well as how we bring some of the capabilities that we will acquire at the time we close the transaction due to our Bill Pay Exchange, which we've announced in the U.S. So again, I take you back to the use case and the application layer associated with real-time payments in this instance being bill payments, sizable opportunity in a global basis. We believe we're well positioned both with our Bill Pay Exchange capability as well as with the closing of the Nets transaction with what they bring from anomaly standpoint to be able to take that and take that end mass across the globe.","Craig Moore","Thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw","Ajay, any final comments?","Ajay Banga","Yes, I was thinking of getting them -- because he was dying [ph] for a question [indiscernible]. So that is for all your questions, I'd like to wrap up with a few closing thoughts. We had another solid quarter, driven by robust business drivers and broad-based growth. We have extended significant relationship with critical partners such as Citi, Bank of America and HSBC. We are doing this while continuing to invest in our business for the long term, including our multi-rail strategy and our wide range of services.","With that, thank you for your continued support of the company. And thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"13818":["Mastercard, Inc.

My name is Kim, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Q4 Full-Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations, please go-ahead, sir.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, Kim and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open to accept registrations.","You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data, and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a currency-neutral basis and exclude special items unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.","Ajay Banga","Thank you, Warren, and good morning everybody. So, our business continues to perform well. We are very pleased to have delivered strong results again this quarter and I think that driven by our continued focus of the execution of our strategy that we laid out for you, in fact as recently as the Investor Day in September.","For the quarter, we delivered net revenue growth of 18% and an EPS growth of 30%, excluding special items, which are primarily related to the U.S. tax reform and our Venezuela operations. On that same basis, net revenue growth for the year was 15%, and EPS growth of 21%.","Major economies around the world generally improved in 2017 and we expect to see a relatively steady environment again this year although with some pockets of instability. In the U.S., consumer conference has been healthy, unemployment remains low, and holiday retail sales was solid although year-over-year quarterly growth was slightly lower in Q4 than in the previous quarter according to our SpendingPulse estimates.","In Europe, the economy has been relatively stable. Germany and France are driving some mild growth. Retail sales growth in the UK, however slowed in the fourth quarter, again according to SpendingPulse. And about the UK, we remain concerned about the potential impacts of Brexit over the medium and longer-term.","Latin America, there the region has been recovering from its economic recession, and whilst Brazil and Mexico both have presidential elections coming up, and of course Mexico has the added uncertainty of NAFTA renegotiations we are cautiously optimistic that economic growth in that region in 2018 will be similar to 2017. The political and economic crisis in Venezuela continues to worsen and Martina is going to discuss that in some detail when she comes on to her section.","Now in Asia, we have seen improvement in consumer and business sentiment in Australia and the ASEAN countries continue to be bright spots. So, overall, and although we know that the world is not without geopolitical and trade-related risks, absent any major impacts from these, we expect 2018 to be similar to 2017 from an economic standpoint.","Under that the backdrop kind of focused on continuing to execute a strategy that\u2019s allowing us to grow share across all of our product lines in 2017, and let me give you a few examples of how we are doing this.","Through the U.S., you read this morning probably that we have just announced that we have now got the combined Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's co-brand that's chosen Mastercard for their consumer credit co-brand book. It is one of the largest retail co-brands in the market. You probably know that we have been the network for the Bass Pro Shops co-brand and we will convert the Cabela's Club portfolio to Mastercard later this year. ","We also renewed our exclusive agreements with KeyBank so that consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios this quarter are now. KeyBank actually is a great example of a customer who uses various Mastercard services. They use our decision intelligence authentication tools, our loyalty platform processing services, that\u2019s a nice widespread of services.","Another example is Bank of America, and as we told you in September we had won the Mastercard cash 1, 2, 3 consumer credit cards. We were launching those exclusively by the end of the first quarter. They leveraged many of our capabilities, including fraud products, advisers, and are also one of our largest labs as the service customers. And that\u2019s where we innovate together with our customers using design thinking to rapidly co-create targeted solutions for their business opportunities.","In Europe, we're just pleased to announce that later this year we will be launching the new Virgin Atlantic Consumer Credit Card and that\u2019s issued by Virgin Money in the UK. We continue to make progress with European Banks. We\u2019ve signed a number of new deals with large issuers in France this quarter, including mowing market share with the flip of Credit Mutuel's debit business.","In addition, we are shifting share to us in credit and debit from local competitors with ING Bank in Italy as one example. ING is also launching new prepaid issuance with Mastercard and they are leveraging added benefits such as Mastercard instalments, which gives consumers financial flexibility to split their payments over monthly instalments. Now, the interesting aspect beyond this is that ING's implementation is entirely managed by our API\u2019s and of course it gives their customers an easy way to convert purchases to instalments through their mobile banking app.","Now we're also winning debit in other regions such as in Latin America, where we signed a new deal with Davivienda in Colombia emphasizing cross-border and digital capabilities. We launched a new co-brand debit programs with Amazon in Mexico. In the Middle East, a flip Doha Bank\u2019s debit portfolio is giving us portfolio exclusivity in one of the most affluent markets globally.","In China and India, we're making progress. We've signed new deals in China this quarter with customers such as ICBC, China Industrial Bank, The Agricultural Bank of China. In India, the government has finally published new merchant discount rates. And we think that\u2019s going to spur merchant acceptance and continued transactional growth over the next few years. And we're making progress with Vocalink.","Since the acquisition in May, we have launched real-time payments to the clearinghouse in the U.S., we have further scaled the person-to-merchant Pay By Bank app, and we went live with an image-based clearing system for the check and credit clearing company in the UK. In the fourth quarter, we expanded our analytics capabilities at Vocalink.","We\u2019ve successfully launched a corporate fraud alert product with RBS as our first customer. They are using analysis of corporate payment history and machine learning to help protect companies who are their clients against various types of corporate fraud, invoice redirection being an example. On the infrastructure side, we\u2019re participating in a number of RFPs around the globe and we believe these will position us well in the real time payment space over time. And in parallel, we\u2019re developing apps and value-added services that can be deployed across this infrastructure. So, a few comments on the digital space. We have expanded the rollout of tokenization, which as you know is the foundational technology for secure digital payments. ","We\u2019ve added 500 new issuers and 21 markets over the course of 2017. I mean now a total of 1,200 issuers in 46 markets. For the year, we saw tokenized transaction growth of over 500%. Now, not from a small base, but it reflects this momentum that I\u2019m speaking to. And last year, we continued to see how important this seamless digital purchasing experience is to our merchant partners as we grew Masterpass acceptance with Dunkin' Donuts, Walgreens, Verizon Wireless, and many others.","And this quarter, we\u2019re pleased to add several more partners, including in the grocery category such as, DJs and John Deagle [ph] in the U.S. In McDonald's, we are going beyond a simple implementation and helping them develop a food delivery app with exclusive Masterpass acceptance in multiple markets across Latin America.","So, now let me wrap up by saying a few things about U.S. tax reform. We see this as a very positive development for the country, particularly in the near-term. As businesses will have an increased capacity to invest, and many consumers will have more disposable income. ","What we\u2019re thinking of taking the opportunity is to make several focused investments that build on our long-standing commitment to strengthen our business, support our people, and make a positive contribution to the communities where we operate, while of course continuing to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders.","And so, I\u2019m going to lay out a couple of steps we\u2019re going to take. The first one is, we will make additional investments in our center for inclusive growth, which we launched back in 2014 as a way to focus our data, expertise, technology and philosophic investments to support inclusive growth. You know that we believe that enables more people to become financially empowered. It is therefore good for our business as well.","Over the next several years, we plan to invest an initial $0.5 billion to fuel their philanthropic contributions into the community. And among our initial efforts will be training programs for U.S. workers to help create the workforce for tomorrow. Now these additional investments in this center were beyond the impact we already delivered through other existing initiatives across the company, as well as the Mastercard foundation, which you will recall as one of the world's largest private philanthropic funds and of course our public-private partnerships with governments, which today are in over 60 countries.","We\u2019ve got 1,300 programs and that\u2019s taken us more than two-thirds of the way to our goal of bringing 500 million more people into the financial system. Our second area of focus with this opportunity around the U.S. tax reform is our employees and their retirement planning. And while we\u2019ve always been an active and generous contributor to our employee benefits, we're going to take this opportunity to enhance our employer match to 10% for defined contribution retirement plans. And this will be an opportunity for the majority of our employees, including those across the United States to benefit from this change.","And finally, we will absolutely accelerate investments both in an organic and inorganic basis in areas that are aligned with our business strategy, digital infrastructure of fast ACH, data analytics those spaces. Now, just to put this in context; yes, we will be making all these initial investments, but the majority of the tax savings will be used to invest in the growth of our business, and also to return excess capital to our shareholders.","Now with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and our operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks Ajay, and good morning everyone. As you can see in the highlights on Page 3, we have delivered another strong quarter. Foreign exchange was of a tailwind of about 2.5 ppt to net revenue, and 3 ppt to net income, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro. I will now highlight the numbers on a currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of special items, which I will explain in more detail on the next slide.","Net revenue grew 18%, driven by solid momentum in our core business and includes a 3 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses increased by 15%, and includes an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions, primarily for Vocalink. Operating income grew by 20%, while net income was up 25%, resulting from our strong underlying performance and a lower tax rate.","EPS was $1.14, up by 30% year-over-year with share repurchases contributing $0.03 per share. During the quarter, we repurchased about 1 billion worth of stock and an additional $287 million through January 30, 2018.","So, let me turn to Page 4 and here I\u2019m going to touch on the special items we had taken this quarter. The U.S. tax reform resulted in three impacts to the tax line in our P&L in the fourth quarter. This is our best estimate based on our current interpretation of the new tax laws and could still change during 2018.","The first item is a 629 million charge related to deemed repatriation on accumulated foreign earnings and is payable over eight years. The second item is related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate tax rate of 21%. Since we are in a net deferred tax asset position, we have recorded $157 million charge this quarter.","Finally, we have an $87 million impact, due to the loss of certain foreign tax credits and a change in policy regarding foreign earnings. The total of all tax impacts related to the U.S. tax reform bill was $873 million or $0.82 per share.","In addition, the economic and political conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate and therefore, similar to what other companies have already done, we have decided to exclude the financial results of those operations from our consolidated financial statements for future periods. This has resulted in a pre-tax charge of $167 million, or $108 million after tax.","However, we will continue to provide switching and other services in the country. As a result of these special items, we had combined after-tax impacts of $981 million, or $0.92 per share this quarter. So, let me now continue to explain how our underlying business performance for the quarter. ","Here on Page 5, you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide Gross Dollar Volume, or GDV, growth was 13% on a local currency basis, and that\u2019s up 2 ppt from last quarter. We saw solid double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S. U.S. GDV grew 9%, up 3 ppt from last quarter, and was made up of Credit and Debit growth of 10% and 8%, respectively.","Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15%, that\u2019s up 2 ppt from last quarter, led by Europe and Asia. And cross-border volume grew at a healthy 17% on a local currency basis, with strong double-digit growth across all regions, again led by the U.S. and Europe.","Turning to Page 6, here you see switched transactions continued to show strong growth at 17% globally, with U.S. growth up sequentially. Similar to the last few quarters, we saw healthy double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S. Globally, there are 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.","Now let\u2019s turn to Page 7, for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. As I already mentioned, net revenue increased by 18%, including approximately a 3 ppt benefit from acquisitions, and was driven by strong transaction and volume growth, as well as growth in services.","Rebates and incentives grew 23%, reflecting higher volumes and incentives for new and renewed deals. Let me quickly go through the individual revenue line items. As we've commented on throughout the year, the difference between fees charged and volumes in the domestic assessments and cross-border categories were mainly due to pricing, which was essentially offset in Rebates and incentives, as well as some mix. This continues to be the case this quarter.","The Domestic assessments grew 19%, while worldwide GDV grew 13%. Cross-Border volume fees grew 19%, while cross-border volume was up 17%. Transaction processing fees grew 22%, primarily driven by the 17% growth in switched transactions, as well as revenues from our various service offerings.","And finally, other revenues grew 15%. As a reminder, most of the Vocalink revenues show up in this line. Advisors and safety and security revenues were also up. These items more than offset the 4 ppt impact from the changes we made to our loyalty business in Asia that I've called out previously. ","Moving on to Page 8, here you can see that total operating expenses increased 15%, excluding special items, on a currency-neutral basis, and that was higher than our expectations due to foreign exchange hedging losses. Similar to last quarter, this includes an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions, primarily from Vocalink, including the impact of purchase accounting and integration-related costs. The remainder was due to our continued investments in geographic expansion in digital capabilities.","I\u2019m going to move on to Slide 9 and here we are going to discuss what we have seen so far on the drivers for January and the numbers are through the 28 of January. Starting with switched volume, global growth is at 14%, up 2 ppt from what we saw in the fourth quarter with healthy growth in all regions. In the U.S., our switched volume grew 10%, up 2 ppt with higher growth in both credit and debit programs.","In switched volume outside the U.S. grew 18%, up 2 ppt driven by higher growth in Europe to slower growth in APMEA as we lacked difficult year ago comps related to the demonetization effort in India. Globally, switched transaction growth was 16%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the fourth quarter. This decrease is the result of the exclusion of Venezuelan transactions as we will no longer be recognizing the related revenue in 2018.","Ex-Venezuela, our growth was similar to the fourth quarter. With respect to cross-border quarter volumes, our volumes grew 22% up 5 ppt with double-digit growth in all regions. So, let me explain this a little bit more. About 3 ppt of this was driven by higher growth in Europe resulting from both increased intra and inter Europe travel, as well as holidays extending further into January this year in certain markets.","APMEA also contributed about 1 ppt to this growth. The remaining 1 ppt was driven by card holders funding accounts at crypto currency exchanges, which was then used to purchase these digital currencies. You should note that these accounts can be funded from a number of sources such as Bank Accounts, wire transfers, et cetera.","With the recent interest in and the price volatility of crypto currencies, we have seen an increase in this activity. Just to be clear, we do not switch or settled crypto currency transactions over our network.","Our plans do not assume this type of activity will continue as we have no line of sight as to how card holders will view crypto currencies in the future, and given that we\u2019ve already seen some declines in our recent weekly trends.","So, now I\u2019m going to turn to our thoughts about 2018 on Slide 10. And let me start by talking about the numbers on the same basis, as we always have. That is before the impact of the new revenue recognition was on a currency mutual basis and excluding acquisitions and special items. On this basis, our business fundamentals remain strong, and we continue to grow through the combination of new and renewed agreements in our expanded set of service offerings.","We expect the global economic environment to be similar to what we saw last year with a few areas to monitor as Ajay mentioned. With this backdrop, we expect to deliver strong organic growth again this year with net revenue growing towards the high end of the low double-digit range. This is in-line with our recent trajectory though we will be absorbing a slight headwind as a result of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan entity.","On the expense front, we continue to invest in key long-term growth areas such as digital, security solutions, and geographic expansion in addition to the incremental employee and technology investments Ajay just highlighted. Overall, we expect operating expenses will grow at a mid-single digit rate year-over-year, reflecting our ongoing cost management efforts. So, as you can see, we are well-positioned to deliver strong operating performance again in 2018, slightly ahead of where we had previously expected.","Turning to Slide 11, now let me add to those growth numbers. The impact of acquisitions, the new revenue recognition rules, and the investment in the center for inclusive growth that Ajay talked about. All of these items are very important when you try to model our results for 2018. So, please bear with me, as we are going through this.","So, let me walk down the chart. First, with respect to acquisitions, we estimate that having the acquisitions for full-year in 2018 rather than just a partial year in 2017 will contribute about 0.5 ppt to the revenue growth and approximately 2 ppt to OpEx growth for the year. Second, the new revenue recognition rules would contribute approximately 2.5 ppt or $300 million to revenue growth and 4 ppt or $200 million to expense growth based on our current estimates. These amounts are driven by two factors.","First, we have recently determined that certain market development programs will now flow through the P&L on a gross basis. Resulting in a about a $200 million in increased revenues and offsetting expenses. The remaining $100 million relates to a change in the timing of when particular deal incentives are recognized.","These amounts, which are also detailed in the appendix are estimated based on our current and assumed commitments and are thus subject to change. We will be disclosing the impact of the new revenue recognition rules on a quarterly basis towards 2018, so you will be able to follow the effects each quarter. Just as a reminder, the new rules have no impact on the underlying economics of the business.","And finally, we will be expanding our center for inclusive growth. The initial contribution will be $100 million to a new not-for-profit entity to enable a variety of workforce training financial inclusion and digital infrastructure initiatives, which will add another 2 ppt to operating expense growth for the year. We expect to take this charge in the first quarter.","So overall, with these adjustments, we estimate 2018 year-over-year growth net revenue will grow at the mid-teens rate and operating expenses will growth low-double digits both on a currency neutral basis and excluding special items.","I have a few other items for you to consider for 2018. We expect operating expense growth in the first quarter to be $250 million higher than what our annual growth rate of low double-digit would imply, due to the timing of the market development programs, which I just referred to as part of the new revenue recognition rules, the impact of the acquisitions, which occurred after Q1 last year and the charge for the center for inclusive growth.","When modelling as reported numbers, foreign exchange is expected to be a 1 ppt to 2 ppt benefit to the top line, and about a 2 ppt benefit to net income for the year based on our planned exchange rates. And finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 20% in 2018, primarily due to the impact of the tax reform here in the U.S.","So, turning to Slide 12, I would like to move to our long-term performance objectives for the 2016 to 2018 period. As a reminder, these objectives are on a currency neutral basis that do exclude acquisitions and special items and are normalized for tax, they do however incorporate the impact of the U.S. tax reform in 2018. For revenue, given our expectations for 2018 that I just discussed, including the new revenue recognition rules, we now believe that net revenue will grow in the low teens on a three-year CAGR basis.","We remain committed to a minimum annual operating margin of at least 50% and we now expect EPS CAGR over that three-year period to be in the mid-20s, up from the approximately 20% we last commented on. This reflects our continued strong business performance and expense management initiatives, as well as a 4 ppt benefit from lower taxes in 2018. The new revenue recognition rules to be implemented in 2018 are expected to have a minimum impact on the three-year EPS CAGR.","With that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thanks Martina. Kim, we\u2019re now ready to start the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe start out on the healthy trends you\u2019ve seen across the globe, particularly in international debit, which I think accelerated as you mentioned quite a bit, there is particular pickup in Europe, can you maybe talk about how much of that is market share, how much of that is improving economy? And maybe you can kind of talk about the impact going forward on your yields given it seems like there was a substantial decrease again in the number of Maestro cards as you convert those to standard debit?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, James, good morning. And let me just take you through a minute. In Europe, where we are seeing really good drivers in Italy and Germany and France, number of these kind of countries and those are good economic environments, I called out that the holidays in January that\u2019s the little longer in some of these countries. In terms of where we added the market share, what\u2019s really in the Nordics, so we actually have flipped the deal in Sweden. That is coming in over this year, and that will actually benefit these kind of numbers.","From a Maestro point-of-view, yes you are absolutely right, we have been talking about that in a number of countries we\u2019re actually flipping our Maestro portfolios into debit Mastercard both portfolios. We are very well on our way in many of those countries, and what we are actually seeing is, when we do these kind of flips that are on the new debit Mastercards we see about 2x to volume that we use to see you on the Maestro cards. So, we're not just seeing cross-border volume, but we are also seeing local volume. That will continue to benefit and it will improve our yield over time.","You have actually been seeing that our yield has been improving over the last many years, both on the core business where you\u2019re seeing it predominantly because of the additional processing that were coming in, by the way we are now processing about 54% of the transactions that are done on Mastercard versus - when you just look two years ago it was just shy of 50%. And secondly, of course, the healthy cross-border trends. When you look at our word total yields, you know that is where obviously our growing services offerings are really benefiting us and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing very healthy yields across the whole company.","James Schneider","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Don Fandetti","Good morning. You know, the cross-border number, even if you sort of strip out crypto currency was notably better and I know the dollar has been generally weakening, do you expect as you think about guidance for 2018 and just look out, have a sort of stepped up into a structurally higher cross-border rate and then lastly can you talk about volume into the U.S. cross-border?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Don, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re asking this question because of course when you see for the first four weeks in the year it\u2019s 22% cross-border number, you\u2019re asking exactly the right question in my opinion. What we always say is, four quarters do not make a year, in-fact the guidance that we are giving - four weeks don't make a year. So, four weeks don't make a year, but in particular, all of the guidance that we\u2019re giving you for the top line of 2018 we are not planning on those kind of cross-border numbers, growth numbers.","We are planning much more to what we have been seeing over the last couple of years. And even with the weaker dollar, I don't think that trend will change much. So, I don't think it\u2019s prudent to be planning on this kind of number and I would like to point you back to the guidance that we had from a new revenue point-of-view.","Don Fandetti","And then the volume into the U.S.?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Volume into the U.S., we actually do is see, you now it is kind of mid-single digits, volume into the U.S., what we do see is a volume outside of the U.S. is picking up.","Don Fandetti","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. Nice job. Just wanted to touch on, when you look at your guidance for 13% revenue growth or 15% including the accounting change, just, you know versus the 18% run rate, just to make sure we have the right variables that would cause the deceleration being I guess Venezuela M&A grew over lower pricing, anything else we\u2019re missing there? I mean, just little pricing benefits? And then just quickly Martina, on the - when you look at the tax investments, I just wanted to squeeze in, what will be the steady state of investment beyond 2018, some of this just feels that it could be one-time or should we expect that to continue? Thanks guys.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Okay. And the first question, first of all you need to take into account the 0.5 ppt on the Venezuela. That\u2019s the impact on revenue. And then in particular, you also need to take into account the acquisitions that you called out. We had 8 months of acquisitions built into 2017 numbers, and so you only get the lapping asset from the four months.","So, when you actually look at the total results at 2017, we're basically saying that 2018 is just going to be slightly better in part because of course what we\u2019re expecting in the United States, even though we have a very watchful in the number of work potential risk countries around the world, right. ","Middle East, Africa, West Country, we are watching very carefully Brazil, we are watching very carefully Mexico, as well as the potential impact from a Brexit point-of-view. So overall, while the U.S. is a little better, we are actually believing that the economic environment in 2018 will be very similar to 2017. So, all of this is based Darrin, just slightly better than 2017 on the net revenue side. That\u2019s where we are.","Darrin Peller","Okay. And on the tax savings?","Martina Hund-Mejean","On the tax impact, it's your second question, so what we\u2019re doing, in terms of the center for inclusive growth, as Ajay said, we are planning over several years to put $0.5 billion into that center. The first chunk is going to go in Q1 with $100 million and then we are going to see how we are going to lay it out for the next several years. So, you are going to have do expect that you're going to continue to do some contributions in that. Not in 2018, but likely 2019, 2020 et cetera.","The employee benefits, that is a permanent adjustment of course, you know that subjects the one-time thing. We really want to make sure that our employees are focused on making sure that they are well situated from pension benefit point-of-view. So, this is going to go in this year. Sometime this year, we haven't given a date yet and that\u2019s going to continue. The other investments are also in our baseline, and I would suggest to you that both organically as well as inorganically we're going to continue to look at that and make more investments.","Darrin Peller","Okay, excellent.","Ajay Banga","Particularly in those serious that we have been talking about. From digital and technology, and data and fast ACH, the kind of things we talked about in September. Very focused on the strategy.","Darrin Peller","It makes sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Your line is open.","David Togut","Thank you, good morning. Europe continues to accelerate nicely and clearly a lot of that is due to some solid market share gains, but I\u2019m wondering Ajay if you could comment on the merchant acceptance footprint in Europe for electronic payments, especially post interchange caps a couple of years ago? And then my follow-up is on PSD2, and any update you could give us on bringing Vocalink\u2019s capability to the European continent in advance to PSD2?","Ajay Banga","The first part, the merchant acceptance, you know there is growth across the European region on merchant acceptance from large outlooks that earlier used to prefer to take either local payment systems only, or cash and goods. That changes all the way to small ones. What you do see really changing also is a reduction in suppression. So, even if the outlook says we accept, you know actual fact we have showed up for a small ticket charge or low value payment, they would encourage you to kind of lay of the idea of producing electronic payment. I think all that has changed quite dramatically. It\u2019s helpful. It\u2019s part of the secular change in the way cash is used in the European economy.","I wouldn't declare victory on that right now because I think a year or two in Europe is a relatively small time in a set of complicated countries with lots of local dynamics vis-a-vis local schemes, local players, and the like. So, I would tell you, keep your eye on the space and keep working into the acquiring community, we are talking about a four, five-year translation in a continent like Europe. It\u2019s good signs, it\u2019s helpful, it\u2019s a nice tailwind, and I am not running with it to the bank yet. That\u2019s kind of the first part.","Your second question was about, remind me what the second question was.","Martina Hund-Mejean","PSD2.","Ajay Banga","PSD2. You know, we\u2019re coming up to the timeframe of when all this starts to go live in so many ways in different aspects of implementation in Europe. We have been working both internally, as well as with the help of our largest clients, as well as in conversations with regulators about the implications of PSD2, and the things we can do around PSD2 with these European merchants and European Banks and the new European entities that will get creative as part of the PSD2. The PSD's and the various acronyms that are being created in PSD2. ","Your question was around Vocalink and PSD2. So, to get Vocalink on to the ground in different European countries beyond the software status. which is kind of what it is today in the Nordics and some other markets around the world will require us to actually participate in the RFP process of different ACH systems being opened up in Europe. We\u2019re participating, you heard me in my opening comments, we are participating in those RFPs. These stake a year or two to get resolved and settled.","After they get settled, it will take a while to get invested in and implemented, but we are very active in all of those and one of the reasons why I think you will see us using some of the tax reform money in a sensible way in our business is to keep on focusing on the opportunity with fast ACH, thanks to Vocalink\u2019s capabilities in Europe, but also outside of Europe even in the United States and other markets. It\u2019s not just an infrastructure, but it could be in the applications, it could be in the scheme rules and it could of course be in different aspects of the range of things we could do with fast ACH.","David Togut","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thanks for taking the question. Ajay, kind of a big picture or strategic question for you, especially in the way last night of pretty meaningful shift in the PayPal eBay relationship. One of the things that PayPal has asserted is its value prop to large marketplaces, especially next gen marketplaces, and I see Mastercard building a pretty comprehensive value proposition of its own and I just wonder how you think about the sort of so-called commodity nature of Visa Mastercard versus sort of the value-add of a provider like PayPal and whether or not the lines perhaps are beginning to blur a bit in terms of go to market value proposition?","Ajay Banga","So, I think in the whole E&M commerce space there is so much going on Andrew in that whole space. And I think, if you go back in time, when essentially Visa and Mastercard in those places and other brands like ours, the other card, which were called card network brands. We got into a position where we became part of a drop down on a merchant's checkout site. You drop-down you got one brand or the other and you entered a lot of details, and you entered a lot of addresses and that created its own friction and it\u2019s on lakh of branding at the checkout point. Even though the consumer was aware of the brand because they were looking at the card and entering the data. I think that\u2019s moving and PayPal is one way of that moment, but our own efforts with branded checkout points is moving. ","And we will continue to do that. I think PayPal itself, its relationship with eBay, I mean look at the IPO time, something for Dan to answer, but I'm pretty certain that all of you thought about one day that relationship will come up for reassessment, and it\u2019s come up for reassessment and eBay has chosen what it wants to do. I think Dan has done some interesting work of building out his partnerships in the meanwhile. So he has kind of consolidated his own position today with the second and third leg of the stool, and I think we are a key beneficiary of that because as you know, we\u2019ve got a great partnership with PayPal, which includes all their co-branded cards and their corporate cards and all the understanding and how their wallet is used, including visibility of the brand and the non-steering towards ACH and the data flow and basically the passthrough angle compared to the staged angle.","So, my general net takeoff on this is, this is still a wide-open field. It is going to years before you can figure out who is playing what game here. All I\u2019m trying to do with our company and all us are doing is, we want to be very much a part of that game. If we\u2019re going to keep investing in tokenization and secure checkout, we\u2019re going to keep investing in an enhanced consumer experience in digital.","You\u2019ll find us doing all kinds of things with banks, with merchants in that space, we're going to keep investing and aligning the developer community to access our capabilities at digital and poor payments. So, the simplest form of APIs and SDKs so we can get imbedded in more and more locations. We\u2019re going to keep investing in creating good R&D with our labs and making sure that they are capable of working with our clients with labs and the service you heard me talk about that with specific reference to Bank of America, but frankly it applies to many other clients as well.","So, you're going to see the strategies in digital to make us not pay anywhere other than at the for front forefront of what is going on here with simple transparent standards, and standards that are important because they enable merchants and banks to connect one-time, not multiple times. So, you see us over this period of years to come that\u2019s the focus. Simple experience, simple standards, focused on securities, secure every transaction, make sure we do good stuff that last, make sure we open APIs and SDKs are available and well used, and make sure that we focus on all forms of payment, not just guardrails, but ACH fast ACH, all those so that you enable banks and merchants to do the best thing for their customer. That\u2019s our additional strategy. Not changed. PayPal, eBay other issues will come and go, we are doing what we need to do.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg","Hi, thanks guys. Just two quick ones. First, on your rebate and incentive expectations for 2018, and then can you just give us the latest update on what you're thinking in terms of what may happen in Europe with European commission looking at some of the inter-European cross-border interchange fees, some of the potential funds, I know you\u2019ve disclosed this in your 10-Qs, and anyway you could kind of frame up, what percent of your cross-border business is actually in-bound into Europe just so we have some sense of reference in case we get some headlines on this soon?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Okay. Jason, first of all on your first question, I am not going to give you any guidance on rebates and incentives at 2018 and it is because of the new revenue recognition rules coming in. There is so many moving parts between gross revenue and contra revenue that I just feel, you know given all of the work that we were able internally to do, I just feel that the net revenue numbers is just the best guidance that I can give you, but I do want to take the opportunity to deep dive into that just a little bit more. As you know, I will call it at $300 million benefit on the net revenue line, due to the new revenue recognition fule. $100 million of that is really in relation to customer business agreements and to incentives. And there are a number of facts that we had to be estimating in this.","First of all, as you know we had amortization of incentives on previous deals that have been previously expensed. So, in prior years, we expensed those. And then we will be now expensed over the life of the deal. And that will be a negative, right. You estimate actually that roughly about $0.5 on incentives will need to be recognized as contra revenue under the new rules starting 2018 and we will, you know the average life of this recognition is approximately 7 years. So, it is not - so it is a headwind, it\u2019s not really material in the context of our size. But then in addition to that we would have had some incentives in 2018 or later that will now have to be carried back to prior years to the original deal inception or carried forward. That will actually reduce the amount of incentives recognized in 2018. So, you can see these two things are toggling with each other.","And then the last, the third thing is that obviously we will be having new deals coming in and that could impact this calculation too depending on the terms and conditions in these kind of deals. So, when you put all of this together, we do estimate the net benefit of that $100 million that I just referenced, but obviously that could change over time and then beyond 2019, we will continue to amortize the remainder of that 0.5 billion of that roughly 500 million that we have to recognize as contra revenues under the new rules. So, you can see this is a relatively complex area and that\u2019s why we\u2019re staying with net revenue guidance and we\u2019re not going to split it up in growth and into contra.","With respect to your second question, there is really not much more that we can say to you and quite frankly what our cross-border business, in-bound business in Europe has actually no relationship in terms of how the European Commission would be looking at finding us, if they find us, but they have at this point in time really no new News. So, I\u2019m still going to point you back to the last Q that we filed, that is a pretty accurate statement in there, and I let something happen between now and when we filed the 10-K on what Feb 14 or 15. If you have an update, obviously the K will be updated by that time.","Ajay Banga","Martina is in accounting heaven for the last few weeks or months.","Jason Kupferberg","Yes, between rev rec and tax, I'm sure it's been a party.","Ajay Banga","Yes, and you also got Venezuela, but she has done an outstanding job often trying to put her arms around how to manage that through the next period of time. In Venezuela, we are still very much on the ground, doing all the right things. We got a great team. We are supporting a lot of our clients there. We are not pulling out of the business from the ground. That would be a very unfortunate thing to do, and I think it will spark all kinds of humanitarian issues given the role we play in that economy. In fact, we try to work with other players, including multilateral institutions try and find a way to make this a sensible outcome because there will be an outcome one day in Venezuela.","So, this is not a, you know, you got to think-out long-term and you know what we're doing is all of these things whether it\u2019s European cross-border of Venezuela or these rules. At the end of the day, we are trying to give you guys some thought on what we are thinking in terms of what the impact could be, but Martina has laid out a pretty good estimate of where we think our 2018 revenues and expenses in EPS and our combined 2016 to 2018 goals will go. And I said you, over 2016 to 2018 we\u2019ve had a good run. We gave you an update in September when we raised our guidance.","Now, what we're doing basically is making sure the accounting flows through. Yes, there is a small improvement in 2018, which she pointed out. Some of it gets eaten up by Venezuela. Some of it gets eaten up by the laughing of the acquisitions. That\u2019s kind of where we are. We are running our business to win, share, and keep taking advantage of the secular trend in the business. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do and not getting ourselves tied up between rebates and incentives and growth revenue and net revenue at a time when there are so many moving parts and asking someone to estimate accurately would be asking for the moon.","Jason Kupferberg","It all makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Hi, Brian.","Bryan Keane","Thanks. Just wanted to talk or ask about two things. One, just the strength in U.S. credit and debit, is that just some lapping of some of the headwinds, obviously USA, but the numbers are obviously picking up there may be strengthened.","Martina Hund-Mejean","It is.","Bryan Keane","Okay. There is nothing else that call out there?","Ajay Banga","No. Most of it is just that, and all the other things you read about as winning, they are all coming on board. So, you will see some benefit in Bank of America when it starts issuing. It will take time. You will see some benefit from the co-brand, the Cabela's co-brand. But these things will take time. Meanwhile, there is the natural spending pattern that shows up and there. As I said, fourth quarter growth was actually lower year-over-year than third quarter, just to be clear.","Bryan Keane","Yes, it doesn't seem there is no flips go on in the other way, like that created a headwind like USA.","Ajay Banga","Don't go there. You're giving me nightmares, don't go there.","Bryan Keane","Yes. And then my follow-up is just on tax reform. I just was trying to quantify total tax reform investments, I got the 100 million for the inclusive growth and then just thinking about employee retirement and then some of the accelerated investments that you talked about Ajay, just in all - it seems like maybe we\u2019re getting to 20% to 25%, I am just trying to get to a number of what we are reinvesting total of the tax benefit? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So, just to let you know, the total cash tax benefit as a result of the tax reform on an annual basis is in the ZIP Code or $450 million, right. And we\u2019re doing then two things. One, we\u2019re taking the $100 million in order to invest into the center for inclusive growth, and the other part that Ajay was mentioning in terms of the employee benefits, as well as the additional investments we\u2019re doing, we have that embedded in the base line of the operating expenses. Okay, and that\u2019s all embedded in the low double digits guidance that I have been giving to you for 2018. Based on the new revenue recognition rules.","Ajay Banga ","I don't want to run a business in which I\u2019m paying employees for their retirement long-term because this is not a one-year $1,000 contribution kind of thing. This is, we are adding to our already good 401(k) and defined contribution plans around the world. And second, we were investing in data in digital and fast ACH. We don't want to run a business if that stuff is kept as a separate item. So, Martina has got those embedded in the way we look at the future of our business. ","The only thing that\u2019s not embedded in that is these lumpy contributions that will go into the center for inclusive growth because honestly $100 million is going into that center being directed for workforce training and financial intrusion in the U.S. and elsewhere that kind of lumpy contributions is the one that we\u2019ve not got embedded in our guidance to you. We\u2019re telling you about it, but it\u2019s embedded in the total, but not in the net that we\u2019re looking at. Right Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Well, it\u2019s in the low double-digit operating expense guidance. We put 2 ppt for that particular contribution.","Ajay Banga","In the total?","Martina Hund-Mejean","In the total.","Ajay Banga","But not in the organic growth?","Martina Hund-Mejean","No.","Bryan Keane","Okay, great, thanks. Very helpful. I got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Craig Maurer","I wanted to ask you on Brazil, considering recent IPO drawing attention there plus you are seeing the recovery finally seeming to be on firmer ground, you\u2019ve gained fairly enormous market share against visa there over the last few years and I believe last summer you are now the biggest new issuance brand in Brazil. I was wondering if you expect to see, a, these will be able to rebound against you there; and b, how you look at that market going forward, considering the big gains you got recently?","Ajay Banga","First of all, I will always expect my competitors to make every effort possible there. They go to a strong company. They got good people in the ground, they are going to make efforts to win back share, and that\u2019s the reality and it\u2019s - I believe that we survived by being competitively paranoid about all of our competitors. That to me is just a, I take it as a, given that they will attempt.","There\u2019s a lot of competition in the ground. It\u2019s not just Visa. It's Cielo. It's the local methods of doing a lot of work. There is a lot of competition on the ground locally. There\u2019s also a lot of regulatory changes that is going on in Brazil, including with the Bankers Association attempting to look at the idea of the way instalments are paid and the whole instalment method is managed, including the settlement time. There\u2019s a ton of things going on in a market in which we are today a very large market share player there. The political environment in Brazil, yes, this year 2017 showed an improvement, but you got to remember you are comparing 2017 to 2016, which was not a predictably let us delightful year in Brazil. ","It was a hard year, and they got some political stability, 2017 turned out to be better, good economic policies were getting put in place. Remember that 2018 has an election, and that election has currently identified two players to come there not of whom within the current government and so it\u2019s a little unclear to me what instability that could cause in economic environment. That\u2019s why Martina pointed out, and I pointed out that there are pockets of instability across the world that we\u2019re careful of. Brazil is one of those. For this reason of the political circumstance, and the longevity of that economic reforms.","I have been around a lot time long time working with Latin America and I have learnt that you cannot take for granted what happens for a couple of years because it does find its way through changes on where politics goes. So that\u2019s where we are. I am relatively constructive about Brazil. We are investing on the ground, the number of people we have in our office has increased, our capabilities in the ground have increased, our technological investments in the ground have increased, and we're going to keep seeing growth there is what I\u2019m hopeful for, but 2018 is a year to watch out for.","Warren Kneeshaw","I think, we have time for just one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Alright, thanks for including me here. I won\u2019t to accounting question. Just want to ask a bit about the deal activity may be because based on Craig and Brian's questions, how would you characterize guys the pipeline for new deals and renewals this year in 2018 versus 2017. It seems like you have had a good backlog going. So, I\u2019m curious what the pipeline might look like for this year, especially in things like B2B, if you can comment on that?","Martina Hund-Mejean","So, Tien-Tsin obviously with the numbers in Q4 that you saw in the rebates and incentives and we had given you a little bit of a heads-up in our November call that that number might be coming in a little bit higher than what we have forecasted before. That should show you that we have actually terrific deal activity in Q4 and those deals will be rolling in over the next 6 months to 18 months that depends, which deal you\u2019re looking at. I quite frankly with everything that I\u2019m seeing from the pipeline from our world regions around the world, I think that we\u2019re going to have a similarly robust deal activity in 2018. I don't think there\u2019s any letting up. I think there is a lot of players in the market that are looking to do things with us a network and it would be similarly robust.","Ajay Banga","And on B2B Tien-Tsin, you know the global travel deals that we did over the last couple of years they are actually helping us in our cross-border. As an example, back to somebody's question I forget on cross-border. But, there is all this work we\u2019re trying to do with the B2B have. We\u2019ve announced that one partner had signed up, there is a bunch of partners in the pipeline. Hopefully, a few of them will come into locking on. There\u2019s all the work we're trying to do with fast ACH and Send in different parts of the world. So, B2B is pretty active far as right now. We consider ourselves to have good access from the place. So, we are working our pipeline hard.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Alright.","Ajay Banga","I\u2019m sorry, we're going to cut you off, Tien-Tsin. We can chat another time. But thank you all for your questions and I would like to wrap-up with some closing thoughts. We\u2019re pleased with 2017 financial results. We think it\u2019s all driven by strong operating performance and execution of our strategy. Overall economic trends are positive, and as we said a couple of times in this call, we\u2019re going to monitor some risks and uncertainties that Martina and I have spoken to. But overall, we expect 2018 growth to be similar to 2017.","Meanwhile, we expect tax reform will benefit the U.S. economy and I have a positive impact on our company. We see this as an opportune time to further invest in our employees and communities and continue to strengthen our business and strategic investments in those key growth areas, while continuing to return excess capital back to our shareholders. And so, thank you for your continued support of all of us and our company, and thank you very much for joining us on the call today.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference, sir.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data, and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.","Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a currency-neutral basis and exclude special items unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. Please note that due to our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan entity starting this year, we are providing additional information regarding our switched transaction and card growth rates. The adjusted growth rates eliminate Venezuelan switched transactions and card counts from prior periods so that you can better understand the underlying growth rates of our business. Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted growth rates.

Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that, I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Warren, and good morning, everybody. Strong performance continued this quarter. We had revenue growth of 17% and EPS growth of 36% versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis and excluding special items. But if you further exclude the impact of the accounting changes that affect year-over-year comparisons, our underlying net revenue growth was 14% and our operating income increased by 19%. I think these results reflect our operational focus, our market share growth, and I think strong underlying business fundamentals while we continue to invest in the business for the longer term.","So let's start with the macroeconomic environment. We continue to see solid overall growth, although just like others, we are keeping an eye out for potential impacts related to fiscal stimulus reductions, rising interest rates, and possibly increased trade barriers, which could slow global economic growth. In addition, we are monitoring the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on cross-border flows and the economic weakness in some emerging market countries.","In the U.S., economic growth remains positive. Low unemployment, healthy consumer confidence helped. Our SpendingPulse estimate for Q3 showed retail sales remained strong and were actually up 5.2% ex-auto, ex-gas versus a year ago. Businesses are investing, and the provisional agreement on a new trade deal in North America is good news both in terms of the stability it will provide for companies as they plan their supply chains and due to some of the specific terms that it includes that we believe will be beneficial to our industry.","Overall conditions in Europe remain stable. Unemployment continues to decline. Consumer confidence remains strong in areas such as the Nordics while I think there are political concerns there in countries \u2013 some of them, including the UK, Italy and Turkey. In Latin America, the elections in Brazil and Mexico are now behind us, and the real and peso recovered somewhat, although yesterday was not a great day for the peso. At this stage, we are waiting to see how the economic and fiscal policy agendas develop as these new administrations take office.","We're also monitoring a few potential headwinds in Asia. Although consumer sentiment remains relatively positive, trade tensions are weighing on business sentiment, most notably in China and Japan and Korea.","Against that backdrop, we are driving healthy double-digit volume and transaction growth for Mastercard across most of our markets, with momentum across our core products and services. And let me, as usual, give you a few examples.","First, we have expanded our existing relationship with HSBC, including winning new business in the UK, Hong Kong, and Mexico. And like many of our customers, HSBC will now also leverage Mastercard Labs' rapid prototyping capabilities along with Mastercard Advisors and our data and analytics services to help optimize their portfolios.","In North America, we've continued to build momentum in the co-brand states, and this quarter we announced that we will be the exclusive network for the new Air France-KLM co-brand portfolio with Bank of America, which includes a suite of enhanced travel benefits.","We also expanded our partnership with Kroger, which includes joint efforts to improve the customer experience to create a safer, more efficient check-out experience. Kroger will leverage a broad array of Mastercard's products and solutions, including data analytics, fraud tools, and digital services. We're also going to migrate their commercial card business to Mastercard, and this partnership basically builds on the co-brand portfolio flip that we won last year.","In Europe, we expanded our relationship with Bankia, one of the larger banks in Spain, to flip the vast majority of their debit and credit portfolios to Mastercard. Bankia will also leverage our Advisor and Labs services as we partner to build their business going forward.","In Belgium, Mastercard was selected as IKEA's credit co-brand partner.","And we've also extended our relationship with PayPal. Now as you know, we are PayPal's partner for almost all their credit and debit co-branded programs around the world. Now, we have also been selected as PayPal's partner as they embark on direct card issuance in Germany and the UK. In Germany, for example, we will work with PayPal to support digital cards issued in Google Pay wallets, which will enable German PayPal users to have access to contactless payments at the point of sale.","In Asia-Pacific, we continue to benefit from strong deal momentum, and we are prioritizing two key areas: first, partnering with digital players to harness new payment flows; and secondly, increasing our participation in domestic transactions.","So let's start with the digital players and harnessing new payment flows. Last week we announced a deal with Grab, which is a leading FinTech platform, digital wallet provider, and ride-sharing service in Southeast Asia. The Grab app has been downloaded onto more than 110 million mobile devices in the region. And through this relationship, Grab will offer its customers both a prepaid Mastercard within the Grab Pay wallet as well as a physical prepaid Mastercard to enable online and offline payments across a wide range of spend categories.","The partnership also opens up the Grab Pay wallet for acceptance across the Mastercard merchant base using existing point-of-sale systems or QR codes. This Grab effort will initially launch in Singapore and the Philippines in 2019, and the plan is to quickly expand across six additional countries in Southeast Asia.","In China, we have strengthened our cross-border and mobile presence through an exclusive cross-border credit co-brand program with the Ctrip Group and the Bank of East Asia. Ctrip is the largest online travel agency in China. 70% of their bookings, for example, are executed via mobile phones.","Now the second part of the conversation in Asia was around increasing our participation in domestic transactions, so let me give you a couple of examples. In Thailand, in response to on-soil regulatory changes, we have built a co-badge partnership with NITMX, which is the leading domestic switch in the Thai market. That partnership enables us to deploy a range of Safety & Security and gateway services, and it will also allow us to significantly grow our co-badged debit share via flips and new issuance with four additional issuers in Thailand.","Another example is Indonesia, where we recently launched on-soil debit switching, enabling us to comply with local regs but also work with domestic networks to integrate a set of value-added services. These local capabilities and the global acceptance footprint gave us the entry point to flip the closed-loop debit business of BCA, which is one of Indonesia's largest banks, to debit Mastercard.","So those are some of the regional updates, and I'm going to highlight our progress in addressing new payment flows. On the B2B front, we are really excited about the launch of Mastercard Track, which is a global trade platform which we have developed in collaboration with Microsoft. Track basically solves key challenges in the procure-to-pay process, including managing supply chain risk and creating more transparency in the B2B payments process. We're going to deploy the platform through a phased rollout. The first phase is focused on helping corporations with the cumbersome process of compliance screening of new and existing suppliers.","Now how we address that challenge is we provide a comprehensive trade directory, which is currently at more than 150 million businesses in over 75 countries. The trade directory includes corporate industry details, business credit scores, and compliance data, including sanction notifications and other regulatory information. The directory will be regularly updated to support a business's loyal customer and loyal supplier processes and includes automated change notifications to ensure that corporations understand the evolving risk across their supplier base.","We're also going to build out additional capabilities on that platform, including the integration of our account-based payment rail. And eventually we envision that Track will enable B2B networks, banks, insurance companies, and technology providers to extend value-added services to business customers, including data analytics and supply chain finance.","In Singapore, Track has already been integrated with the Networked Trade Platform, which is a trade and logistics platform developed by the Singaporean government, and it's got card payment facilities incorporated inside to facilitate secure and efficient electronic payments between buyers and suppliers.","In the Faster Payments space, we have talked about the opportunity to leverage our assets to provide a combination of infrastructure applications and services to help solve customer needs across an entirely different set of rails, and a recent example of this is the announcement of the Mastercard Bill Pay Exchange.","That's a digital application that will enable U.S. consumers to view, manage, and pay their bills instantly from their bank accounts. And the solution basically attempts to address consumer pain points like managing multiple billing sites and passwords, and most importantly remembering when bills are due. Consumers will be able to use their mobile banking app to set up a broad set of their billers, receive notifications when a bill is due, see the bill details, and specify when and how much they want to pay from their bank accounts.","The Bill Pay Exchange will support payments over the clearinghouse's real-time payments infrastructure which, as you probably recall, is based on technology from VocaLink. It will also support traditional ACH payments, and card integration is planned for the future. The exchange includes a large community of over 100,000 U.S. billers, which is built on our existing Bill Pay network. And similar to how we distribute most products, this solution is designed to be offered through banks and credit unions, and the idea is to enable the bank or the credit union to become a one-stop shop for bill payments for their consumers.","Other services there on our Faster Payments strategy, we have now launched AML Insights, which is our network-level anti-money laundering solution, currently in the UK. AML Insights runs advanced analytics to identify potential money laundering across the Faster Payments network there, and it helps our bank customers comply with their obligations. The solution has already been adopted by 10 banks representing over 90% of the UK market. We're in active discussions with prospective customers in several markets around the world.","And finally, a quick update on our efforts to improve the online checkout experience for consumers, merchants, and issuers. Last week we announced that we are targeting to have token services on all cards by 2020, allowing consumers to store credentials at merchants without exposing their actual card details. That's the first part.","The second part is we're improving the consumer authentication experience to move quickly and accurately and allow them to verify that a consumer is who they say they actually are. Our solution is called Mastercard Identity Check, which uses the data-rich EMV 3D secure authentication standard and applies our AI and behavioral biometric capabilities to verify the consumer with a single touch or click. We worked with issuers and merchants in the U.S. and Europe to enable this technology. It begins to roll out globally in early 2019.","And finally, you've heard us talk about the importance of a safe, streamlined, and standardized online checkout experience for all key stakeholders. The Secure Remote Commerce framework, or SRC, will create a standard for a simplified and secure digital point-of-sale process. EMVCo's draft technical specs for SRC have now been finalized. We're working to complete the branding guidelines and other go-to-market considerations. We expect to begin the rollout of SRC in the second half of 2019.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Turning to page 3, despite the expected foreign exchange headwinds, we delivered another very strong quarter. Here are a few highlights on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items related to litigation provisions and the adjusted tax effects of previously recorded special items.","Net revenue grew 17%, driven by strong underlying performance and includes a 3 ppt benefit from the new revenue recognition rules. Excluding this, underlying revenue growth was 14%.","Operating income grew by 22%, or 19% if you exclude the revenue recognition rules impact. Net income was up 33%, reflecting strong operating results and the impact of the U.S. tax reform, which contributed approximately 9 ppt to net income growth.","EPS was at $1.78, up by 36% year over year, with share repurchases contributing $0.04 per share. During the quarter we repurchased about $1.2 billion worth of stock and an additional $385 million through October 25.","Let's turn to page 4, and here you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 13% on a local currency basis, down 1 ppt from last quarter. We saw solid double-digit growth across most regions. U.S. GDV grew 9%, similar to last quarter, with credit and debit growth of 8% and 10% respectively. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15%, down 1 ppt from last quarter.","Cross-border volume grew at 17% on a local currency basis, in line with expectations and driven by double-digits growth in all regions. This was down 2 ppt from the second quarter, primarily due to one less switching day in Q3 versus a year ago.","Let me turn to page 5. Switching transactions continued to show strong growth at 16% globally, normalized to exclude Venezuelan transactions, as we no longer consolidate that entity. Again, there was one less switching day versus a year ago, which impacted growth by 1 ppt. We saw healthy growth in switched transactions across all regions, led by Europe and the U.S. In addition, global card growth was 6%, again normalized for Venezuela. Globally, there are 2.5 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued.","Now let's turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The 17% net revenue increase was in line with expectations, and was primarily driven by strong volume and transaction growth as well as growth in our services offerings. As I mentioned already, the new revenue recognition rules contributed 3 ppt to the growth rate. Excluding these impacts, underlying net revenue growth was 14%.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments grew 24% while worldwide GDV grew 13%. The difference is mainly due to pricing and the impact of the new revenue recognition rules. Cross-border volume fees grew 18% while cross-border volume grew 17%. Transaction processing fees grew 17%, primarily driven by the 16% normalized growth in switched transactions as well as revenues from our various service offerings. And finally, other revenues grew 11%, driven by increases in our Advisors and Safety & Security services.","Moving to page 7, you can see that total operating expenses increased 10% excluding special items on a currency-neutral basis. Within our expense growth, we had a 2 ppt increase related to the new revenue recognition rules, offset by a 2 ppt benefit associated with foreign exchange hedging losses in the year-ago period.","I'm going to now turn to slide 8, and let's discuss what we have seen through the first three weeks of October. While drivers are generally similar, two are slightly better than what we saw in the third quarter on a normalized basis. Just remember, Q3 had one less switching day, which reduced each of the switched metrics by approximately 1 ppt.","So the numbers through October 21 are as follows. Starting with switched volume, we saw global growth of 16%, an increase of 2 ppt compared to the third quarter. In the U.S., our switched volume grew 13%, a sequential increase of 3 ppt, aided in part by the timing of certain Social Security payments this quarter. And switched volume outside the U.S. grew 19%, up 1 ppt from the third quarter. Globally, switched transaction growth was 17%, up 1 ppt from the third quarter, with healthy growth in each region.","With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 18% globally, up 1 ppt sequentially. As a reminder, we will face a more difficult comp as this quarter progresses due to the timing of cryptocurrency-related activity last year.","Turning to our thoughts for the full year 2018, which I will describe on a currency-neutral basis excluding special items, overall, not much has changed. The economic environment remains healthy, and we continue to expect year-over-year revenue growth to be in the high teens and operating expense growth to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, these growth rates include the impact of the new revenue recognition rules that we adopted in 2018 and the full-year effect of acquisitions.","A few other items of note, FX is now expected to have no real impact to revenue for the full year, and we expect Q4 to have a higher foreign exchange headwind to revenue than in Q3. We expect a sequential increase of operating expenses in Q4, due primarily to the timing of some of our marketing programs, and we estimate the tax rate will be approximately 19% for the year.","With that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Martina. Denise, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys, just two quick ones here. I guess first, one for you, Ajay. I just wanted to take your temperature macro-wise. I'm not sure if your tone is maybe softening a little bit, some caution points out there, obviously U.S. equity markets dropping a lot this month. I'm not sure what your historical data would show in terms of potential impacts on consumer spending going forward.","And then just, Martina, any comments on rebates? We were expecting the number to be a little higher in Q3. I know timing is always an issue here. Any changes in how you're thinking about full-year rebates? Is this just a timing issue between Q3 and Q4? Thanks, guys.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","On the macro, Jason, honestly, in our numbers, nothing is showing up that should give me reason to be cautious. If you look at our \u2013 even our three weeks of data that we've shown you till October 21, you'll find that consumer spending remains kind of robust or even a little better in some cases. So nothing is showing up directly. It's just at the end of the day, any of our time spent in industry and business, you do feel that if you've got trade values, if you've got discussions going on, on rising interest rates and the removal of liquidity in the system, at some point in time that should have an impact overall on the economy, if nothing else, to slow down the growth rate a little to keep the heat down, if anything else.","And so that's part of you that you're hearing me speak about because I don't have any indicator in the system that I could point to that should give you either exuberance or caution where we are today. We're going along the way we see our data, which is good spending, even in the three weeks of October that we shared with you.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","And on rebates and incentives, as you know, Jason, our first quarter was actually the low quarter from a rebates and incentive cost point of view. Second and third quarter are very similar, and we continue to expect strong deal activity into the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I want to ask a question on cross-border. Obviously, that was still strong and it looks like it improved a little bit in October. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color on some of the regional composition of that, and anything in that that have implications in terms of you taking a more cautious view on spreads or cross-border pricing, and then just in the general macro sense, in any particular region?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Cross-border has continued to be very strong. And in fact, when you look at the Q3 numbers, they're very similar to the Q2 numbers when you adjust for the switching day. And you can see that when you look at the October 21 stats, it continues to be very strong. So we put out a bit of a cautionary note on that because when you remember the fourth quarter of last year, in particular at the end of November into December, we saw all that cryptocurrency-related activity that we don't expect to repeat. In fact, that activity has gone down in a very significant way.","The areas that we're looking at very carefully is, of course, one, what is happening from a strengthening U.S. dollar point of view. So we can already see that cross-border inbound into the U.S. has been \u2013 the growth rate has been declining versus what we saw in Q2. And in addition to that, we're looking at some of the emerging market phenomena in terms of people being able to travel. So I would watch out for countries like Brazil, Indonesia, a number of other countries on this. But also we watch very carefully on Canada as well as Australia because how these currencies behave versus the U.S. dollar very much impact what our cross-border volume growth does.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Ajay, as you look out, the market seems to be convinced that there's a potential recession coming into the U.S. And if you look back at your company, you had very good revenue growth through the downturn. Can you talk a little bit about what the playbook would be in this scenario? Do you still feel like pricing could be a buffer and take cost out, or do you feel like you have a similar type of buffer?","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","I don't know about the conclusion that the market is pricing in a recession or the market is pricing in a correction caused by the reality of increasing Fed rates and reducing liquidity. I don't know that yet, so I think I'd be cautious on including that as of now.","But having said that, I guess your question really is, what's our flex in our P&L to manage our way through cycles of different types? Our revenue is built out of multiple legs of the stool, first of all. One part of it is clearly impacted by personal consumption expenditure [PCE]. It tends to be the quickest impact on our revenue. So if PCE in the U.S. tomorrow slows in its growth rate from the 5.2% that I referred to for Q3 in the SpendingPulse ex-auto, ex-gas, to, let's say, 4.5%, that impacts our revenue immediately.","What's happened in past cycles on that has been that while some countries slow down, others pick up. And over a period of two to three years, you tend to find that global PCE, supported in addition by the secular shift from cash to electronic, gives us a reasonable multiple legs of the stool to keep some form of revenue growth going through that period.","Our pricing is a function of what you think the market can bear, both on acquiring pricing and issuing pricing. But remember, we now have another leg of the stool, which is our services, and there's pricing there as well. So it's Safety & Security tools. It's data analytics and consulting, all of which tend to get used a great deal more when people feel the pressure to grow their own company's revenue or manage their own expenses or be more efficient. So I actually think our multiple legs of the revenue stool, if anything, will help us through the next challenging set of circumstances in an even better way than it was 10 years ago.","On the expense side, we've got two forms of expenses that can be dialed up or down. Remember, we are putting a lot of money consciously into strategic growth initiatives. Some of that is people, and that's a cost that you incur to get the right quality of skills and talent. But some of it is technology and the rollout of new products and new platforms.","Clearly if there's a pullback, you will find lower appetite for rolling out some of those new products and platforms. We can expect some of that to show up in our expenses. A&M is an obvious one. Marketing can be another one that can be played with and dialed with during times of crisis. But as we've shown some years back, we know how to manage our expenses tightly and down when there's a crisis as well.","So I'd say \u2013 you're going to get more of this from Martina, but on the revenue side of the stool, more legs and therefore some degree of balance; on the expense side, a couple of good levers to play with. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Just to add, every time that we put our yearly budget together, we put obviously a base plan together based on our base assumptions on what we think revenues will be and what we can afford from an investment point of view, both in the core as well as additional investments that we are making into our strategic initiatives.","But at the same time, we actually always put a couple of downside scenarios together so that the entire organization actually premeditates if a downturn were to come down the road what we actually have to do so that we don't have to scramble at that point in time. We have a roadmap. The roadmap is very defined. Obviously, when anything happens, you refresh your roadmap, but the company is able to course-correct if it needs to be course-correct.","And let me just add a couple of things to that. First of all, if it's a modest downturn, generally we would not be cutting out strategic initiatives. We would have to find our way through it because from a long-term perspective, we are obviously looking at long-term growth and garnering that. If we were to shortchange some the strategic initiatives, we would not be able to do that and really create the kind of value that you want to have for our shareholders. However, if it's a more severe downturn, then it's some of the things that Ajay said jumping in where we would evaluate very carefully which initiatives we would continue and which ones we would maybe mothball for a while.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask on the pipeline for new deals and renewals and how you'd characterize that and your win share so far. Looks like obviously with KLM, that was a nice one, so just curious what the go-forward looks like.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So, Tien-Tsin, across the board we are still continuing to win share, and just remember that this is not just against one competitor. This is obviously against domestic competitors too. And secondly, from a pipeline point of view, we look pretty strong. You can see that in the rebates and incentives number. I do expect that that will continue to grow. And the agreements that we have announced, most of them will be rolling out between the first and the fourth quarter of 2019.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks, guys. When looking at the strong trends, even into calendar fourth quarter, just how much of that is really market share? I know the switching day helps, obviously, but market share versus macro strength.","And then just as a follow-on to that, can you just touch on the contribution of the potential benefits from the Maestro conversion you're seeing? How much is that impacting numbers now? It seems like it's got a long road ahead of it, but really good benefits. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So, Darrin, it's tough for us to parse this apart. The macroeconomic environment is obviously good in many countries around the world. And it is, as Ajay was saying, driving quite a bit of our revenue growth. But every quarter, we're winning from a market share point of view, given the kind of announcements that you have. So that is an added benefit. And then don't forget the secular trend is also an added benefit. So we are not seeing any changes in terms of the three drivers of our core business besides what we're actually doing on the services side, which is another growth driver for us.","From a Maestro conversion point of view, I think you are seeing probably in this data about 9 million cards or so have gone away from the Maestro card. Pretty much all of them got flipped to a debit Mastercard. And as we told you before, the Maestro product, given that it cannot be used in a number of different ways, like on e-commerce, but the debit Mastercard product can be used, that we see much more significant volume on it as well as the pricing is different. So it's a nice contribution to what we're seeing on the debit side.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Ajay, you talked about the SRC initiative in your prepared remarks. I'm curious how confident you feel the industry players will come together with a strong solution that competes with the other players out there. And perhaps you could just talk about the value proposition to the various constituencies.","And then secondly, Martina, you guys have had obviously very strong growth in revenues on the back of all the various things you talked about. Just in terms \u2013 you haven't provided formal guidance yet, but is there any reason outside of a macro situation that you couldn't continue or sustain these trends? Thanks.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So on SRC, Sanjay, I think it's all early days, but I'm pretty confident that the issuing and acquiring and merchant community will see, say, a lot of value out of SRC. I have a very simple logic for the response we get when we talk about SRC to any of those communities. The first one is, there is plateau on our checkout page, and there are going to be multiple checkout points. The second one is, it's just harder for a merchant or an issuing bank or an acquiring bank to have to handle multiple checkout options for the purposes of digital and online purchases. And so both of those are appealing to the entire community, and that appeal is what we're hearing back from them.","So getting the standards right, which is why it took us the time that EMVCo, which is a body that comprises, as you know, the networks, the issuing banks, but also some merchants are now part of the advisory group there, they're all involved with this together with us in an effort to create the right standards that not only provide for simplicity of integration and checkout, but also for higher standards of security for the merchant and the consumer and the issuer and acquirer. So I think they're actually building this infrastructure the right way for all the different stakeholders in the system.","Obviously, the one group of stakeholders we haven't yet tested it on is the consumer because it hasn't reached them yet, and that one we'll see. And the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but at the end of the day, there's no reason why they wouldn't find it the right thing to use. So my general view of this thus far from all the interactions is very, very optimistic.","Now it's going to be a run. It's not going to be something that's going end in a 100-yard dash. So we've got to get it out, get the standards frozen, get all the work done to get it launched out there, get issuing, acquiring, and merchant systems to accept these new standards, work with them, and then allow us to roll that out over three, four years. This is not a one-year or a six-month effort. So it starts in the second part of next year. You should see this having a lot of energy and momentum from us at least for the next three, four years. And then you'll see where we get to with it. I'm reasonably optimistic about it. And the value prop is embedded in what I just told you. The reason for my optimism is the value prop.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So on the longer-term guidance, Sanjay, first of all, we said earlier this year that you have to let us finish out 2018, predominantly because of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard because there are lots of moving parts. And having said that, we will on the fourth quarter call, which is in early 2019, you will hear our thoughts about 2019, as well as you will hear our thoughts from a long-term performance objective.","And the one thing that I usually point people back to is when you look at our Investor Day back in September of 2017, you actually see that one chart that we put out for a 5 to 10-year period where it shows our drivers and what we're doing from a services point of view, and puts it together what we think from a very long-term point of view for our revenues, and it says low to mid-teens. We haven't changed our opinion in all of this, but you have to wait for the 2019 thoughts as well as for a longer-term guidance at the Q4 earnings call. I think that's end of January or so.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask about the adjusted operating margins that came in I think significantly above last year and above Street estimates. How much of this, Martina, is just leverage in the model versus timing of expenses? I know you \u2013 I think you called out some increased marketing in 4Q, but just trying to figure out how much of that was a surprise in showing leverage versus is just this a timing issue.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Look, Bryan, first of all, we're going to continue to stick to our guidance that we said. When we look at the business overall, we think the business can produce 50%-plus operating margins at any point in time, so we're not going to change that.","Every year when we put our numbers together, we basically decide what we think revenue growth will be and how much we can afford from an operating expense point of view. Obviously, you're seeing that we've been doing really well from a revenue growth point of view this year, and so we have been able to produce more profits. And it doesn't go that quickly that we can just turn on a dime and suddenly invest in some other strategic investments. So you have to have a long-term view. We're not going to change our long-term view, but from time to time, as we have said the past, depending on revenue growth, you might have a little bit of an extra contribution to operating margin.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Bryan, the way we run our system is that we took the idea of a 50% minimum operating margin to explain to our investors that we are committed to running the company with a fair degree of efficiency and profitability, but we are also committed in a growth industry because that's what our industry is with the amount of PCE that's still in cash, with the amount of B2B payments that are still inefficiently done through check and strange ways of paying, that there's an enormous amount of opportunity to enable our company to grow. In that circumstance, our long-term sights now \u2013 I've been here nine years, Martina's been here 10. I've been saying this every time. Our long-term sights are set on investing to get at that cash and to get at those inefficient ways of doing B2B payments.","The second thing we've built out over these years is the investment in services, and I'm hoping you guys are beginning to see a lot of those services embedded in our relationships with merchants, issuing banks, governments, and acquiring systems. And the embedding of those services in those relationships enables us to not only have a better, more holistic relationship with that partner, but also enables us to be seen as a value-added partner, not just a price play. Price is important, don't get me wrong. I've said this every time. But it also allows you to have more than that in addition to the service being a good revenue and good margin generator on its own.","So our approach to this whole thing has been play that game for the longer term, play it in a way that our investments make sense of where we're going, including inorganic investments, and then manage \u2013 if there's a couple of years of a slowdown in growth, manage your way through it but don't take your eyes off where you're going. And that's what we're trying to do.","So your question about operating margin in the quarter, to be perfectly honest, I don't even look at it until Martina comes and bops me over the head and informs me that this is our operating margin. I actually don't. I don't operate through operating margin. I operate through revenue growth, that's to net revenue growth. I operate through basic franchise indicating trends, and I operate through investing in the strategic portfolio initiatives that we have laid out for you. Those three things, making sure we've got great people, good technology, good brand, is how we run our company. Everything else, quarter by quarter it comes and it goes, and I'll faithfully report it to you.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks for the help.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Hey, this one's for Ajay. At Money20\/20 last week, we got a peek into the future of commerce with things like voice commerce, which is like buying through a personal assistant, and social commerce, which is like buying through a photo on Instagram, or doing things like seamless omni-channel, where you're checking out with your phone while you're in the store. So just on the theme of investing for the future, what are some of the unique technologies and investments you're making at Mastercard against those futuristic trends that are looking more like five, 10 years out?","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So, Lisa, going in backward order, the first one, the last one you talked about was about seamless multi-channel, omni-channel thinking. As you know, we've been talking about that for some time with you as well and others as well about the things we're doing in that space because consumers do exactly what you said. They actually research online, buy in store. They buy online, return in store. They research while in the store.","So for example, at our labs or our tech hub, you'll find things like these mirrors where you can both etch out things but also ask the attendant to bring you stuff from the inventory in a different color and purchase right there and have shipped to you later delivered. All that is part of the idea of the fact that consumers don't think online separate from physical. They just look at their experience. And so a ton of things are going into that seamless back-and-forth. In fact, your entire approach to managing charge-backs and disputes also has to evolve to the idea of buying in one channel, returning in the other. And so that entire work has been growing for quite a while.","Your inventory one, the one about social commerce, you'll remember some time back we launched an effort with Vogue Magazine where if you were on Vogue Magazine and you were flipping through and you found a pair of shoes \u2013 which Martina has plenty of \u2013 but you found a pair of shoes that she liked even more than the 2,000 pairs she already has, then she would just click on it and go right to \u2013 she's making faces at me. Then she would click on it and go right there and buy that pair seamlessly through a one-click, and by the way, come right back to the same page in Vogue as compared to going out to a website to buy and then have to navigate back to the Vogue site.","So it's not just social commerce, it's the ease of in-and-out that you have to manage in that process. And the all-commerce part of that is actually just beginning to move, and I think you'll find us over a period of time being very focused on evolving our brand and our signature and our capability in all these channels of all social and omni-channel commerce.","So there are investments going on in technology, there are investments going on in charge-backs and dispute management, there are investments going on in the consumer experience from front to back. There are investments going on in the brand and its evolution. It's across the whole lot. And of course, there are investments in data and analytics that help you work into that process that connect to the safety and security of transactions in that space.","So one of the things that you will find us using artificial intelligence on is taking a look at new data. New data was all about trying to figure out whether the person using the phone is the person whom the phone belongs to or not, or somebody's been able to get into their phone. And so using AI, you can send back a risk-rated score to the merchant or the bank to say this may not be Martina buying that 2,001th pair of shoes that she saw in the magazine, and instead it might be Ajay who stole her phone and her password. And that gives the bank or merchant a chance to make a conscious decision based on the value of the customer whether to let that decision go through or not. So we could keep going on this topic, but it's a whole series of efforts across all forms of commerce, across all the legs of our revenue stool that we're working on.","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Terrific, thank you.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Martina is running out to buy a pair of shoes right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Good morning, thanks, so two questions. I wanted to follow up on Tien-Tsin's question from much earlier. Visa called out 20% of their volume being renewed in fiscal 2019. Is there an increased opportunity to win share over the next, call it, 12 months?","And secondly, how much of the current OpEx is being spent on complying with data localization rules, if you could just frame that for us? Thanks.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Let me start with both of those, then I'll let Martina get into some of that as well. The data localization rules \u2013 you've got to remember, we are managing and meeting the needs of what, for example, India has announced about what it wants from data localization.","Essentially, data localization comes in many flavors. It's a bit like white bread to whole wheat bread. Which part of it do you want? And if you look at data localization, the way the Indian government has put out its original guidelines with, managing that data localization is a question of attempting to put a bunch of servers on the ground that enable their data to be kept locally. There are factors if you go further onto on-soil processing and on-soil switching, as we've had to do in some countries. That's a different cost base.","What we are referring to when we talk about our lack of support for data localization is not caused so much by expenses. It's caused by the inefficiency of what that does to the ability to provide safety, security, and analytics to India's banks and merchants. Honestly, if we are to be able to look at transactions and recognize them, the example of new data I just gave, to recognize patterns and to look at them across systems, it's common sense that more transactions give you better predictability and lower false positives. Less transactions give you lower predictability and more false positives.","Secondly, if you localize, you're unable to learn from the learnings of one country and apply them to the global platforms like ours to every country, and therefore you leverage the cost of learning by 1\/200, meaning you learn in one country and it's available to 200. And I have tons of examples of when this has paid off. What India is doing is actually enabling both those benefits to India to be turned off.","So at the end of the day, it's not a cost issue is what I'm trying to tell you. It's more of the manner in which we run the business to be able to benefit those stakeholders on the ground in India that I think we're losing out on. And I'm picking on India only because that's a live issue over the last few months. There are others like that. So it's not a cost issue as much as it is a manner of operating issue.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","On the agreements, Craig, first of all, on average, agreements are between three and seven years, so you can actually say five years. So it's no surprise that typically in any given year 20% plus\/minus a few percentage points come up for renewal. And we will continue to do what we did in the past many years. It means we're all going to go after every agreement, and hopefully we can convince clients to continue to do business with us or new clients to come over to do business with us. It's business as usual.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair","Thank you and good morning. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on the growth of your B2B business and the investments that you're making there, and just maybe general thoughts to the percentage of your business that could come from B2B payments over the very long term.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So, Bob, let me start on this one. First of all, when you just look at B2B payments, we said in the past that it's about 11% of our total volume at this point in time, and that it's growing in the low, mid, high teens depending on which quarter you're looking at. And if I can just recall for you, we think that the opportunity worldwide is actually $120 trillion. That doesn't mean that we're going to go after every $120 trillion, but we're going after the slices where we can actually bring a lot of good value proposition to bear.","You saw how we expanded into virtual cards. That is actually in these numbers and how we're basically adopting virtual cards for ecosystems such as the travel industry, et cetera. And we took that learning further and expanded basically in the United States how to figure out for smaller companies and midsize companies to be outsourcing their accounts payable process. And that is going beyond virtual cards. This is the Mastercard B2B Hub, right. And it's not just virtual cards. It's any \u2013 the whole suite of payments means, be it check or ACH, our vendors can basically make payments to suppliers. So that is one expansion which is closer probably to our core business.","This morning you heard Ajay talk about Mastercard Track. That is really to address pain points between trading partners across the whole world, right, just like know your supplier. And that solution which, as Ajay said, will be rolled out in phases at some point in time, we hope that we are also going to integrate a payment solution. So that is addressing a different pain point.","In cross-border, account-to-account, we have told you before that we have been working on a permission-based blockchain solution that we have already connected to our settlement capability, and we're currently in a pilot with several banks. And then in addition to that, you know that Mastercard Send is actually also enabled for cross-border B2B payments. And then you shouldn't forget VocaLink, which is enabling B2B payments too. So there is a number of things that we're doing and innovating on, all of which that we're hoping, obviously, to come to fruition over time.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair","Has the growth rate of the B2B business accelerated? We've seen signs that maybe it has in other places.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","As we are adding to it, you have to look at \u2013 that's why I said, depending which quarter you're looking at, it's anywhere between a low teens and a high teens growth rate, which is pretty fantastic.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair","Great.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So think of the B2B business as a little piece of Martina's speech because she obviously has imbibed the B2B business deeply. So here's the thing.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Former treasurer.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","And now there's (56:52) work for her, who used to run our commercials. I think this education process has only ratcheted up. So here's the deal. There's the card base original business that we always were in, small corporates, large corporates, T&E, B2B, SME, fleet cards, B-cards. That business continues to grow in a good rate. And frankly, you should view that as a steady stable business that we understand the most about because it's been in our portfolio for a fair amount of time.","Then the virtual card business came in after that. And that has continuously improved, not only in the form of the industries it targets, as Martina was explaining, but also in the form in which we deliver the product more and more through open APIs and through simple ways for people to integrate with the virtual card. That business is also beginning to, I would say, come to the point where it's in the first category of something we've known for a lot of years.","The Hub business, which connects to the ERP systems, and the Track businesses, we have just about launched. These are new. And I think you will see the results of these two over the next two to five years, not the next six months to one year. So I think you've got to look at our B2B business as being laid out as the foundation of the way we've built the services business. It took us four or five years to build it to some size, and then we began to really plug it hard. You should watch us doing the same with those parts of the B2B business, the hub and the Track part. And there's more to come on Track, and there's more to come on the Hub as we go along.","VocaLink and the Fast ACH capability that VocaLink gave us, along with the incremental amount of data that flows in a VocaLink message back and forth, which gives us better reconciliation capability and better capability for these vendors who are buying and selling from each other, that is just another plus in the system.","And so we are building a repertoire of assets like we built in Safety & Security, packaged together and bundled together at the front end for meeting that $120 trillion market that Martina is talking about. That's how I view the B2B business are those two distinct parts: our older, more mature type; and newer, more interesting, probably more future growth variety, and Mastercard transcends both of those.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair","Thank you very much; Martina, you too.","Operator","Your last question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, good morning. I appreciate you squeezing me here at the end. Ajay, I heard you mention in your prepared remarks at least one flip from a proprietary or closed network. I wonder if you can expound globally on the share that you think those networks have and how much opportunity Mastercard has to open them up, and in fact, what your win rates might look like as you go after that volume.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Closed-loop networks have evolved over the years. They were very strong, for example, in Europe over the last so many years. And then when SEPA and the first payment systems directive came around, it began to open up the opportunity for companies like ours to gain vis-\u00e0-vis the closed-loop networks in a number of those countries. And the Netherlands was the first big breakthrough, but you will find every quarter, every country, we begin to see some progress. In fact, if you dial back to the big picture, nine years ago we used to see about 40% \u2013 42%, Martina will remember the number correctly. 42% of our transactions went through us?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","It was less actually, I think it was more like in the mid-30s.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Okay. So mid-30s was what we saw. Now it's 50-something percent.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","55% of our transactions.","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","55% of our transactions. So we can see a large part of that is because we've been able to take on these closed-loop systems over the years and convert them into open-loop and be able to see them ourselves.","Closed-loop has many implications. There are bank-owned ones, there are government-owned ones, then there smaller closed-loop systems like transit systems. So the London Transport was a closed-loop system, where if you took a subway in London, you paid on an Oyster card, which was their own little closed loop. That has been converted to an open loop as well. So the closed-loop\/open-loop conversation has many dimensions across smaller ones for government-run systems to all the way big ones that are run nationally, and infrastructure.","I actually don't want to give you a percentage of what comes from those versus the others only because it will start becoming a quarterly question of this is not a change that happens quarterly. But I would tell you this. In our secular growth story, while there is a great deal of focus on the 80-odd percent of transactions that are still in cash, in that other 15% \u2013 20% that are electronic, there is a chunk of closed-loop; and Europe is a big example of that, Canada has that. Australia has that. Latin America, has it. It's not only a developed market, emerging-market thing, it's across the world.","So yes, we are focused on that, and we work with those closed loops very often to show them why they're inefficient. Remember the conversation I was giving about India and not having access to global technology, global data analytics. All closed-loop systems suffer from that problem. They can't even keep pace with innovation and new technology forms. And so it's those arguments that enable us to go after that volume. It's a regular, steady drumbeat of growth.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thorough as usual, thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Do you have any final comments?","Ajaypal S. Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","You're welcome Yes, thank you for all your questions. I just want to tell you, wrap up with a few thoughts. We have once again delivered strong financial performance this quarter, record revenue, record earnings growth. We are very focused on executing against our strategy. We're investing in our core products as well as in differentiated service offerings. And the idea is to embed ourselves but also to provide choice to our customers. We continue to drive solid deal momentum across products, across geographies. We've placed that momentum on our solution selling approach. We are focused on delivering the best digital experience possible over the next few years across all channels and all devices for merchants, consumers, and issuers.","And so with that, thank you very much for your continued support of the company, thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Thank you.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to your host, Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations, Please go ahead.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, Tasha. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions.","You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.","Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a currency-neutral basis and exclude special items unless otherwise noted. But the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. Please note that the growth rates we provide for switched volume, switched transactions and cross ordered volume have been adjusted to normalize for the effects of different switching days between periods. These adjustments have been made in current and prior quarters. This information is being provided so that you can better understand the underlying growth rates of these operating metrics.

A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that, I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.","Ajay Banga","Thank you, Warren and good morning everybody. We\u2019re off to a solid start this year; revenues up 13%, EPS up 24% versus the year-ago, as Warren said, on a currency neutral basis, and excluding special items. I think these results reflect our strong operation focus and our continued growth across each of our regions. And at the same time, we are continuing to invest in the business for the long term as you probably noticed with some of our recent product and acquisition related announcements.","Let me start with the macroeconomic environment as usual. You may recall that last quarter we said that we expected solid overall growth to continue in 2019 with some moderation, and our view has not changed from that. That said, we're still monitoring a number of items as long going trade negotiations and other economic and political factors that could affect growth over the medium to longer term. U.S. economic growth remains strong. Low unemployment, healthy consumer confidence, retail sales grew 3.5% versus a year ago ex-auto, ex-gas according to our spending cost estimates. And that reflects some moderation as expected, as well as some impact from the shift in the timing of Easter this year.","Now in Europe, we continue to see moderate growth. Consumer confidence remains mixed with declines in places like the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands. But despite the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, UK retail spending remains healthy again according to what we see in SpendingPulse. Asia Pacific has been impacted by trade policy uncertainty. We continue to monitor the strength of the Chinese economy. But having said that, we've seen modest GDP growth in region overall and that's underpinned by favorable monetary policies and generally stable labor market conditions.","In Latin America, the outlook is mixed with positive signs in Brazil and Chile as they're tempered by some weakness in Mexico. Similarly, in the Middle East and Africa region, we've seen healthy growth in countries such as Egypt, but some softness in the oil producing markets. Meanwhile, our business continues to drive healthy double digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets by successfully executing against our strategy.","What I'm going to do is give you a few examples of how we are growing our co-products, diversifying our customer base and building new areas for our business. Let me start with growing our co-products, where I believe we continue to make good progress in providing people with simple and safe ways to pay with credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products. And it's not a card. The physical card is just one form factor as you've heard me say in the past. We are equally focused on seamlessly delivering our products digitally. Earlier this month, Apple announced the Apple card with MasterCard and Goldman Sachs, available this summer. This is a credit product that's designed for the iPhone that leverages MasterCard's tokenization technology our fraud tool and our charge back APIs. Customers can immediately access the digital version of the card in their Apple wallet. They can also get a physical companion card. With attractive rewards and extensive security features, the user experience is frictionless.","In addition, we look forward to collaborating further with Goldman's consumer business markers to bring new products and services to market over time. Also, pleased to be the favored vendor for T-Mobile's new mobile-first checking account, T-Mobile Money, which consumers can open and manage online all with an app on their smartphones, and they can withdraw funds using a MasterCard debit card. Coming to markets outside of the U.S., again, we continue to make significant progress. We're pleased to announce the expansion of our partnership with Santander in Brazil to expand our share of the credit, debit and commercial portfolios of the fast growing customer.","We also extended our long term agreement with Rogers Bank, which is a key strategic partner for us in Canada, further expanding the services we provide on their card portfolios. And we are advancing our efforts to increase market share in Europe with BNP Paribas in France, clipping more than 4 million credit cards in a long-term deal that will be accompanied by a full suite of services, including spending controls and alerts, as well as identity check mobile security features.","In addition, we have some good examples in customers with closed loop systems who continue to see value in open loop MasterCard cards, because of broader acceptance of digital capabilities. One of these an example is credit system in Brazil, which is converting 7 million private cards to MasterCard contactless co-branded cards to open up international acceptance to their card holders.","Now the commercial side, we're pleased to be Citibank's exclusive network for its cross-border B2B virtual card program in China. And the initial focus there has been enabling Chinese online travel agencies to make payments to hotels, hotel aggregators and airlines outside of China. And that same vein to help our customers provide greater transparency and security in cross border payments. As you know, we have announced an agreement t acquire Transfast, a global cross-border account-to-account money transfer network. We look forward to complementing and enhancing our solutions with their network reach, with their strong compliance capabilities, flexible technology and some very robust foreign exchange tools. By the way, we currently work with Transfast in support of our P2P and B2B capabilities through MasterCard Send.","And while on MasterCard Send, just to give you a quick update. We continue to see healthy growth and we're continuing to develop a number of different use cases. Send\u2019s currently powered seven of the major mobile P2P programs in the United States, and we are working to grow our customer base. On the cross-border front, a number of our issuers are leveraging Send to provide faster and more cost effective and transparent cross-border payments to their customers. Bank of Montreal is the latest to announce that it will implement Send for its Canadian business and commercial banking clients, and the initial focus there is in bank account transfers. And there are additional plans for payments from mobile wallets and cards internationally.","So now from growing the code, turning to the second pillar of our strategy, the work we're doing on diversifying our customer base and strengthening our footprint in some of these new geographies. We are building relationships with merchants, processors, digital players and a number of other partners to help drive their businesses forward.","So I'm going to highlight a few specific examples on the co-brand area, including our renewal with Target in the U.S., a new program with Japan Airlines and with Falabella, which is the largest retailer in Chile. We also entered into an agreement with Mercadolibre, the largest e-commerce marketplace in Latin America to make their platform safer and more convenient with tokenization, seamless authentication tools and contactless prepaid card programs across Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.","And while doing all this, we try to find ways all the time to look for methods to improve our local presence, particularly in areas where there is no electronic payment penetration. That's why our partnerships with and the investments in Network International, which is a preeminent local processor in the Middle East and Africa region, and also Jumia, an e-commerce platform spanning 14 countries in Africa. We think these will accelerate our efforts to deliver a sustained shift from cash and check to electronic payments in these markets. MasterCard will be Network International's preferred partner for processing, acceptance and value added services with the safety and security and data analytics. And our relationship with Jumia will include program card issuance for consumers, as well as commercial payments on their platform and also the use of our payment gateway.","And finally, the third pillar of our strategy is building new areas of our business. And we do this in a way that leverages the core and differentiates our offerings, in particular with services and new payment flows, so a few examples for you. Safety and security products remain a key area of focus. We recently announced the acquisition of Ethoca, a global e-commerce fraud and dispute management network. What this does is to enable the sharing of intelligence between merchants and issuers in over 40 countries.","Whenever a fraudulent or disputed transaction is identified, near real time information is sent to the merchants so they can stop delivery and refund the cardholder and avoid the chargeback process. And as a result, both merchants and issuers benefit from reduced costs. With more than 5,000 merchants, including top e-commerce brands, such as Google and Walmart and over 4,000 issuers already participating, we look forward to continuing to scale Ethoca's network.","We're also looking for ways to help our partners improve their customers' user experiences, that\u2019s why we acquired Vyze, a platform that connects merchants with multiple lenders, opens up a wide range of financing options, including installments to consumers online and in-store and complements MasterCard's existing card and ACH base solutions. Vyze's merchant customers like","Home Depot, Microsoft, Samsung for them, multiple lenders help to increase customer financing approval rates, decrease card abandonment and ultimately, therefore, increase sales. At the same time, they benefit lenders by providing access to new customers through these channels. And just to be clear, we're not changing our model and taking credit risk. We are merely the platform provider here connecting retailers and multiple lenders.","Now with respect to our processing services, pleased that Citibank will be using our payments gateway to support digital commerce enablement for their existing institutional clients. And our gateways connection to numerous acquirers and digital wallets will provide a single consolidated payments view for these large merchants who have a relationship with Citibank and make it simpler for them to accept payments on a global scale.","And moving on to the work we are doing to capture new payment flows beyond traditional card-rails, we have this quarter reached a number of significant milestones in expanding our real time account-to-account capabilities with our VocaLink assets. First, you must have heard recently that we have been chosen to enhance the InstaPay real-time retail payment system in the Philippines. And this includes operating the infrastructure for and providing anti-money laundering tools to an institution called BancNet, which is the national clearing switch in the Philippines. We will do this through a regional payments hub in Asia Pacific, using leading edge ISO 222 messaging, which streamlines communications and provides enhanced transaction data.","Second, we are licensing our real time payment software to the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, SAMA, to upgrade their system, providing similar capabilities to what we already have in place in the United States, Thailand and Singapore. These wins build upon the announcement we made late last year about our partnership in Peru to modernize and operate the Peruvian electronic payments infrastructure. And we remain involved in a number of similar RFPs around the globe. So as you can see, we're making real progress in expanding our geographic footprint for real time payments in Asia, in the Middle East and Latin America, while adding value to governments and central banks to help their citizens and their economies.","So before I turn the call over to Sachin, I'd like to thank Martina who's not on this call, who's probably on a beach somewhere, for both her years of dedication to MasterCard's growth but also for ensuring we were left in good hands upon her retirement with a very well prepared and chosen successor. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Sachin?","Sachin Mehra","Thanks Ajay, and good morning, everyone. First, I would like to say that I am very excited about the opportunity ahead. And I look forward to working with each of you and to meeting those of you I have not met yet.","Turning to Page 3, we had a solid start to the year. There are a few highlights on a currency neutral basis and excluding special items related to certain tax and legal matters. Net revenue grew 13%, driven by solid momentum in our core and was slightly ahead of our expectations due to services growth. Operating income grew by 20% and net income was up 21%, reflecting our strong operating performance. EPS was a $1.78 up 24% year-over-year with share repurchases purchases contributing $0.04 per share. During the quarter, we repurchase $1.8 billion worth of stock and an additional $467 million through April 25, 2019.","So now let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Just as a reminder, as Warren said, we don't normalize GDP growth rates. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 12% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from last quarter, in part due to the impact of the differing number of processing days between periods, as well as some other factors such as the delay and the timing of Easter this year. This was much as expected. U.S. GDV grew 8%, down approximately 2 ppt from last quarter with credit and debit growth of 9% and 6% respectively. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 13%, down 3 ppt from last quarter. Cross border volume grew at 13% on a local currency basis, in line with expectations and driven by double digit growth in several regions. This Q1 growth was down sequentially due primarily to difficult year ago comps.","Turning to Page 5, switch transactions continue to show strong growth at 17% globally. We saw healthy growth in switch transactions across all regions led by Europe and the U.S. In addition, card group was 7%. Globally, there are 2.5 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued.","Now, let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The 13% net revenue increase was primarily driven by strong transaction and volume growth, as well as growth in our services offerings, partially offset by rebates and incentives.","Looking quickly at the individual line items, domestic assessments grew 16%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. The difference is mainly due to pricing and the differing number of processing days between, partially offset by mix. Cross border volume fees grew 15%, while cross border grew 13%. The two ppt difference is mainly driven by pricing, partly offset by mix. Transaction processing fees grew 16% in line with the 17% growth in switch transactions. Finally, other revenues were up 14%, driven by growth in our cyber and intelligence and data and services solutions.","Moving to Page 7, you can see that on a currency neutral basis and excluding special items, total operating expenses increased 5%, primarily related to the company's continued investments and strategic initiatives. This was lower than expected due to the timing on certain marketing initiatives, which we now expect will mostly occur in the second quarter.","Turning to Slide 8, let's discuss what we've seen through the first three weeks of April where all of our drivers are up versus what we saw in Q1. Please remember that year-over-year comparisons across all drivers in April are aided by the timing of when Easter fell this year, and that three-weeks does not make a quarter. The numbers through April 21st are as follows. Starting with switch volume, we saw global growth of 18%, an increase of 4 ppt to the first quarter. In the U.S., our switch volume grew 15%, a sequential increase of 5 ppt with strengths in both credit and debit. Switch volume outside the U.S. grew 21%, up four ppt from the first quarter, primarily driven by Europe. Globally, switch transaction growth was 20%, a sequential increase of 3 ppt, primarily driven by Europe and the U.S.","With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 17% globally, a sequential increase of 4 ppt in part due to the timing of Easter, as well as the tougher year-ago comps we saw in Q1. This was consistent with our expectations. For the year, we continue to expect cross-border volume growth to be about mid-teens and this is what is contemplated in our thoughts for revenue growth for the year.","Turning to our thoughts for the year that I will describe on a currency neutral basis, excluding special items and acquisitions, I will separately comment on acquisitions in a moment. Overall, not much has changed. We had a solid first quarter and our view on the economy is broadly similar with continued overall growth, albeit with some moderation versus 2018. In terms of net revenue, we continue to expect growth at a low-teens rate for the year with second quarter growth consistent with or slightly better than what we saw in Q1. We expect FX to be a 2 ppt headwind to revenue for the year and about a 3 ppt headwind for the quarter.","On operating expenses, we're still planning to grow at a high end of high single digits rates for the year. We expect Q2 operating expenses to grow at approximately twice the annual growth rate due to the lapping of a significant hedging gain a year ago and increased marketing spend. Year-over-year, FX will be a tailwind to OpEx of about 1 ppt for both the year and Q2. In terms of the tax rate, we now expect to be closer to the bottom end of the 19 to 20% range for the year due to the higher than anticipated discrete tax benefits we saw in Q1.","Now, moving on to the impact of acquisitions. As Ajay mentioned, we announced a number of acquisitions that either have closed or are expected to close this year. We estimate there will be about $0.06 to $0.08 dilutive for the year with the impact starting in Q2 and building progressively throughout the year, driven primarily by purchase accounting and integration related costs. One further item, as a reminder as of January 2018, certain equity investments are required to be mark-to-market based on observable price movements. We have been following this new standard and it has had a relatively minor impact on our results since inception.","In April, we made investments in two companies as Ajay mentioned that have since become public, valuation volatility will therefore increase as a result of the unpredictable nature of public equity markets. Accordingly, starting in Q2, we will be updating our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of fair market value gains and losses on our equity investments. We are excluding these items as we believe this will facilitate a better understanding of our operating performance and provide a more meaningful comparison of our results between periods.","Please note that our long-term performance objectives and our thoughts for 2019 exclude such gains or losses. We will provide you full visibility to the impact of fair market value gains and losses on our equity investments as we do with the impact of special items and foreign currency, which we will continue to exclude from our non-GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thanks, Sachin. Tasha, we're ready for the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess I had a question on related to some of the stuff you talked about, which was TSB banks decision to stick with Visa after committing to you guys. Could you just talk about the observations there? Thanks.","Ajay Banga","TSB is staying with us on credit and it currently in Visa and Debit and the reason is very simple. As you know, they have had to focus their attention on their technology circumstances when they were doing their migration of their technology platform. And the bank is very focused on getting that done right. And they're looking after their customer and meeting them responsibilities on that front. In the midst of that to add the migration of a debit book would have added unnecessary risk as well as customer reputational issues to them. And therefore, they thought about is, hold on and we'll see later. And I think that's the right thing to do if I was in their place and I actually respect their decision.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Just maybe couple quick ones just on the modernizing payment systems in the Philippines and Peru, and et cetera. Just curious, once you're beyond the build period. What's the run opportunity for MasterCard? Do you become an intermediary or you're an advantage position to power these intermediaries? Just trying to understand what happens beyond the build phase? And then maybe for Sachin, just incentives line with some of these Fintech deals like Apple coming in and then TSB as Sanjay asked. Any considerations throughout the next two, three quarters?","Ajay Banga","So Sachin will answer that incentive and I\u2019ll give you the answer later on the Philippines. Go ahead.","Sachin Mehra","So on your question as it relates to incentives, our incentives continue to be very much in line with our expectations. We expect for deal activity to pick up in Q2. But other than that not much in the nature of changes as it relates to our expectations on incentives.","Ajay Banga","And Sachin on the ACH platforms. So what we're trying to do it depends on what kind of RSP and what kind of deal is constructed. Even that in the Philippines and Peru, the deal is a bit more complete in the form of having infrastructure operations also included in it. In others, it could be only the software as it is in Saudi, or in the Clearing House in the United States, or in Singapore. If it's only software then it becomes a different ability to intervene in the payment flow. So if it's only software, what we're trying to do is to build apps, which was off that software but also to build value added data analytics tools like the anti-money laundering tools so on, which we've built in other markets and so we can bring them to these countries that have software. Also, we provide skilled related thinking around charge backs, disputes, fraud management that kind of stuff. So that's a software idea.","Whereas infrastructure, it's a little different. It'll be a little bit more like the UK in some ways where we actually run the basic infrastructure. And then we can build products and scheme rules on top of that as well. So these are two slightly divergent parts. And it depends on what each country wants for their local instant from past ACH payment system as these RFPs open up over the next two years. What I was trying to say today was that if this has been sometimes coming, because these RFP processes are slower than the usual but they get done. And this quarter there were two, there is others as well and there's more RFPs in the process that we're deeply in negotiation with.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Togut","What impact do you see from the two big mergers just recently announced, Fiserv and First Data and then FIS Worldpay, on MasterCard growth opportunities. And then as a related question, both companies or in both merger situations it called out growth opportunities in B2B. I'm curious how you can work with them in addressing B2B?","Ajay Banga","We've looked very closely of issue of processes in many markets and especially in the United States, which has a more fragmented payments ecosystem than a number of other markets. And I fully expect to continue to partner with these folks. We've talked to all of them, as you can imagine, including me personally. The M&A doesn't change where we've got teams working with them to determine how best to collaborate to make them win while also getting our work done.","Remember they play a really important part in the ecosystem for banks and credit unions of all sizes. And mostly they have to distribute our products and services. And so I feel like there's lots of opportunity that both came, the consumer payment side but also in the B2B side, but it's just too early to cement any of them down. They're both very busy with their own transactions, as you can imagine. And they need to get that done well, because that's their first preference. And then we can really get deeply involved in what else we could do together with the merged entity. Meanwhile, the independent partnerships with separate entities continue, to be clear. The merged entities will have a whole new game and the mergers got to finish before you can do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is open. ","Bob Napoli","MasterCard has been very active on the M&A front. And I was just hoping, Ajay, to get a little more clarity on additional potential areas that you're looking to build up through the M&A. And is there still a very healthy pipeline, maybe an update on the strategy, the M&A strategy and the pipeline?","Ajay Banga","I think Sachin's baptism by fire on this is the fact that in this first quarter, we delivered a couple of extra M&A deals to him, just to keep him happy and make him realize that he needs to do a little bit of work. It won't be an easy thing to follow in Martina's somewhat large shoes. So I hope she's not listening to that. But your question is a much deeper one, here's the deal. We have not changed our revenue strategy for the years that I've been talking about this. We're trying to use both organic and inorganic ways to grow in the spaces that we think give us possible growth areas to the next decade or two; hence safety and security; hence data analytics and information systems; hence digital identity systems; hence B2B and cross border payments. All of these AI, all of these are intertwined in the idea of building out new capabilities and new services, more or less pretty neatly placed in the third block of our strategy, which is in the grow, diversify, build. Most of these are in the build space.","And that's how we've built these services organically and inorganically to now 26%, 27% of our revenue, that's the objective. At the same time, I'm also trying to build the capability to be available and present across all rails of payment, not just cards but also non-card rails. And hence the VocaLink acquisitions and the acquisition that are going on in B2B spaces to deliver usage results against those, so that's what's going on. Nothing's changed in that. You will find us active participants in these spaces in loyalty and rewards, and those spaces over the next few periods as well. We have a relatively active pipeline, and Sachin could tell you that his team has -- I don\u2019t know, Sachin doing a year 20 to 30 such deals.","Sachin Mehra","That'll be correct, 20 to 30 such deals we could be actively due diligence. The list of deals we would actually scope out would be much broader than that. And just to reiterate what Ajay said, it all starts with the strategy and then we figure out from thereon what's the best way to achieve the strategy between build, buy and partner, as with the M&A component is one big piece of that but not the only one.","Ajay Banga","Some of these deals -- actually a numbers of them M&A from us partnering with these people on a commercial deal for us, Transfast as an example of that recently. But this has been the case in the past as well with a number of the transactions we have done. We end up -- like Brighterion, we ended up being a constructive partner of theirs, having a commercial relationship and then it changes over time into the possibility of an acquisition. So we're trying to use a mix of these outside acquisitions, as well as minority stakes. As well as in the case of fintechs and start ups a series of early investments as the way of making the company have a layer of its business exposed to all that's new and exciting, which we don't believe we have a full always a 100% right to be the only ones thinking of new ideas.","And so this is a good way to get external thinking, external quality of people, get external and maybe some product quality or some distribution strength that we may not have. So Ethoca, for example has both products software but also distribution through 4,000, 5,000 merchants and 4,000 issuers whom we're tied up with. Transfast has compliance capabilities, FX capabilities but also distribution in a number of countries and licenses to operate in a number of those countries. So different things come together in how we make the transaction, but the pipeline is robust. And if we can do one or two transactions a year out of the 20 or 30 we look at that will be a good year. It just happen that in this quarter a couple of extra ones came through.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan from Mizuho. Your line is open.","Tom McCrohan","Can you remind us how much of your cross border volume occurs in the first quarter? I think there\u2019s some seasonality. Just want to confirm that. Thanks.","Sachin Mehra","Tom, I just want to make sure I heard that question correctly. How much of our cross border volume?","Tom McCrohan","Yes, occurs in the first quarter. I think you -- I think that\u2019s one of the weaker quarters. Just want to confirm the seasonality.","Sachin Mehra","Yes, from a seasonality standpoint what I'd tell you is it used to be typically a little bit more in the nature of volume on cross border, but for the most part in the remaining quarters it's pretty stable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.","Ramsey El-Assal","I had a two part question on some regulatory items. First is on the secure customer authentication rules coming out later in Europe this year, whether you think that will be any type of -- constitute any type of pressure on European volumes later on in the year. And then second is a more broader question about data localization requirements and having to build out redundant processing capabilities in different national jurisdictions. Overtime whether that had also constitutes anything like a headwind to operating leverage, or any type of incremental pressure? If you can comment on those two things I'd appreciate it.","Ajay Banga","So the secure authentication rules, as you can imagine, we've been looking at the entire PSD2 implications for both us, merchants and banks in the system, as well as the new entrant PSDs and the ISDs entering into the European payment system. I actually think that secure customer authentication is an opportunity for a company like ours that has the capabilities, skills and toolset to provide this to all the players there, merchants will need it, banks will need it, these new PSCs and AISPs will need to connect properly into the system to ensure that the entire payments ecosystem is kept safe and secure. So for us I see this actually as an opportunity to deliver new value added services. And in past meetings, we've talked about how that\u2019s one of the plans for what we're building out as part of our PSD2 strategy. I'm sure other networks are too. This is not about trying to be competitively advantaged. This is about trying to do the right thing for the payments ecosystem.","The second part, the part of our data localization, that's an interesting question. It came up a couple of earnings calls before as well. And mostly that tend to do with India in that case. And I'd say around the world in some cases, data localization like in India has got real policy ramifications. In other countries that they engaged with us realized that data localization may not be to their benefit. And let me explain that for a second first. The challenge with data localization is actually not the expense, which is what your question comes from. It's not just the question putting up some more servers and storing the data on soil. And to be honest with you in an expense base of our type, putting a few more servers on spot in a country, even as large of India with the volumes over India, is interesting but not really a big deal.","The bigger deal is the fact that by doing so, you end up with data that loses its predictive power compared to the wealth of data that generates much higher predictive power when it's combined across many more countries, many more types of transactions, many more types of consumers, many more types of customers. If you talk to anybody in the space of AI, or machine learning, or good old fashioned data analysts, you'll find that they will tell you that the more the data the more variety of data, the more widespread and ubiquitous the data you get, the better the predictive power. The moment countries balkanize that data, they may say they are doing it for security reasons, is not completely clear to me that in actual fact that gives them better security on predicting for fraud and anti-money laundering and capabilities on that front than data, which is more widely shared.","Now, we will comply and we are compliant in India. And we will comply elsewhere but whatever rules a country finally chooses, because we operate there because that's what the rules are. But it's our job to try to educate them to what we think and their job to decide what's right for them. And then we do what we've got to do after that. So that's what we've done in India, we comply it. In other countries, we've managed to turn back that thinking way from this logic that I just gave.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Keane","Just wanted to ask about the higher expenses expected in Q2. Sounds like most of that is going to be marketing spend, maybe some of that is from acquisitions. Just trying to understand maybe where the higher expenses are going, especially on the marketing side, anything in particular? And then secondly, just on the strong data so far through April 21st. Is there a way to think about how much of that is from Easter versus easier comps versus better economy, share gains, et cetera? Thanks.","Sachin Mehra","Bryan, let me make sure I'm clarifying the Q2 comment out here, which is we're expecting double the growth rate relative to our fully year thoughts on OpEx in Q2. And that growth rate differential is being driven, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, by the fact that last year in our operating expenses we had the benefit of a very sizable FX hedging gain. So I think if you take that into consideration as you think about the marketing expenses or rather the operating expenses for Q2. In addition to that, we also expect we'll increase marketing spend in Q2. As I mentioned in Q1, our marketing expenses came in lower than expected. This is just part of what goes on. And as we run our business, we make evaluations as it relates to when's the optimal time for us to put marketing out in relation to various sponsorship assets and other initiatives, which we've got going on. And this is just part of course as part of that process, so nothing unusual that it would flag.","On your second question on April 21 data, I will tell you look, I mean, April 21, data is impacted by the timing of Easter. And I think you need to take that into consideration just especially given the fact that there's 21 days worth of data, which we're presenting to you and three weeks are not going to make the quarter. So I will tell you that by enlarge the growth trends look solid as we've mentioned for Q1 and we continue to see that going forward as well. But timing of Easter plays a big part in terms of what we're seeing in our April 21 metrics.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Moore from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. ","Craig Moore","Two questions. One, have you seen any uptick in local network competition anywhere around the world? And secondly the settlement with the European Commission that was seemingly announced yesterday on interregional cross-border, obviously, that will have an effect on the fee income of banks issuing cards that are being used in Europe. So thinking Citi for you guys. Do you -- can you foresee an impact on the rewards that those banks are offering on those cards cross-border business if you're going to see a significant reduction in net fee income? Thanks.","Ajay Banga","First, the second one. That settlement with the European Commission, as you know, we discussed it in the fourth quarter earnings call. I have Tim Murphy, my GC sitting here. He's dying to answer the question. But maybe you could -- was it in Q4, Tim?","TimMurphy","Yes, so we briefed the investors in December of last year, and really no change following what we shared in December. It's just a process update. So that's you've seen since December, nothing new.","Ajay Banga","A big part about whether it impacts the rewards that different banks offer, not just Citi but this if for all banks that would have peoples travelling into European Union territory in fact anybody, Australians, and Chinese, and Americans and everybody else and perhaps -- soon. So the fact there is it's a relatively small proportion of the total interchange revenue that most of these banks generate. It's also a relatively small proportion of the total revenue, which comes out of not just interchange but revolving and other fees. And therefore, it is not my assessment that there will be that big an impact on their P&L. Now, remember that the reduced rates of 20 and 30 apply to physical card present, whereas for card not present e-commerce transactions, the rate for debit are a 115 basis points and the rate for credit is a 150 basis points. And so that's factored into the commentary I am giving you about the impact for banking institutions.","It's not that it's not relevant, it is relevant. It\u2019s just that it's not enough to, I think, change their marketing practices directly in this form. Your question about local networks I haven't seen an uptick or downtick in any relevant strong way over the last six months to a year. Local networks have been strong across the world in different forms over the years. I mean, the EU in every country in the EU has had a local network since well before, I mean, this is 20-25 years ago; Mexico's had them; Canada's had them; Brazil and Columbia and Argentina used to have them; China's had it since a long time; Korea's had them. There's not one example here.","In fact, if you look at the number of our transactions that we actually pass through our own rails of the total, today it's 56% of our transactions. 10 years back when I joined, it was 40 something percent. So even 10 years ago, the majority of our transactions were being taken by local networks in some form for the actual processing of that transaction. We had other ways to raise revenue from the activity around that transaction. So the processing was going through local rails very often. Now, actually the number has reduced over the years as we\u2019ve made inroads in a number of marketplaces.","Operator"," Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis","Couple from me, first Ajay, can you comment on China and specifically the news reports about potential joint venture announcement with Nets Union there? And then second one is related to the Vyze acquisition and around doing enabling extension of credit transactionly at the point of sale. Just from a vision perspective, can you comment as you look out building this out, this capability out with MasterCard over the next few years? What that's going to look like or how should we be thinking about it? Is it almost like another rail and what's MasterCard's role and differentiation exactly there? Thank you.","Ajay Banga","So China, I'm not going to comment on a newspaper article. I mean I wish I was asked for comments in the newspaper articles that give me blood pressure, but nobody does. This one doesn't really give me blood pressures. It's just what somebody who wrote there based on what they've picked up locally. We are -- this much I will tell you. I'm very committed to finding an appropriate and sensible way to enter the domestic Chinese market. And I'm making every effort possible across the company to get to the right place and getting the requisite licenses to be able to do that. And I think soon as we've got something substantial or real to tell you, we will, trust me. We just don't have anything real or substantial today, because this movie hasn't played out yet. So it will take some time to play out. And even after it plays out in terms of, let's say we do get some form of an approval, even after that there's a year-long process of national security clearances before you can actually start operating domestically on the ground in China. So this is like a couple of years away at least before we can give you something that's more interesting than just desires, that's the first.","On Vyze, Vyze to me is interesting. I don't know yet know how well to answer for that question for you, because I don't yet know how big this could be. Installment lending to me is a really interesting aspect. Installment lending at the point of sale. Installment lending through a bank has been going on for a long time. But the idea of allowing the consumer as a point of sale to opt into an installment loan, in some ways it's been going on for a long time in sales finance businesses in places like Brazil, where for instance by years and years back at Citibank, we used to see this happening where the transaction at the point of sale had a automatic installment plan built into what was the card payment that was being used by a consumer.","That's kind of -- it didn\u2019t spread everywhere, it spread in different ways into the U.S., in the consumer finance business mostly. It didn't really spread to the middle class or the upper class there. But it's spreading around the world in some ways. In Australia, there are a couple of players who have launched installment lending. In the U.S., those players, one or two of them are coming here, other locally are doing this. It's banks, it's fintechs, it's merchants, everyone seems to be interested in the space. But I don't know yet how to tell you how big it could be or where it could go, because I don't clearly know yet how well it will catch on with the consumer.","We are certainly putting our foot in the water with this acquisition. Remember it's not us that\u2019s extending the credit, we're just creating the platform between the merchant and the institution, the bank or the Finfech, which may in turn pass the loan on to a bank, that's what we're really doing. I think I can add a lot of differentiated value in the form of AI, in the form of better tools to identify consumers and help to help people underwrite. There'is a lot of things we could do with our data analytics and our information services business. Remember that we could also do a lot of things with loyalty and rewards, which could be connected overtime into the installment loan system.","So I don't yet know where this will go. It's interesting. I've got my foot in the water and you'll see, it's not different from the way we entered other services four, five years ago, put our foot in the water before we took the full plunge.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom from UBS. Your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom","I was wondering, maybe Sachin. Could you help remind us about all of the components that attribute to your strength in cross border? I think you have some portfolio wins that should be helping year-over-year or some Maestro conversions. Can you just remind us of all the factors that support that figure?","Sachin Mehra","As a company, we're incredibly focused on cross border drivers. And as we said in previous earnings calls, MasterCard has setup the Center of Excellence within MasterCard where basically there's just tremendous focus on how we can do good knowledge sharing across the company on what can drive cross border volumes for this company. Really, it all starts with making sure that we have actually truly identified one of the right portfolios to go after from a cross-border standpoint. So as we sit back and we think about it, we leverage our services business with their data analytics capabilities to identify what are the right portfolios to go after. And those are the ones where there's a larger propensity of cross border.","Thereafter, we go after Frank to optimize those portfolios in the best way possible. So to the extent we identify portfolios of our customers, which might be underperforming, we work with them through our consulting practice and our managed services practice in our advisors business, you try and actually drive more better and more optimized cross-border focus there. But even beyond that, it's about focusing on the right vertical. So for example, in the wholesale travel space, this is an area where MasterCard has been historically very much focused and has been actually leader, and that contributes to cross border.","And then finally I would say on a similar basis. If you think about digital banks and things of that sort, these would be areas where we would focus. Again, going back to the theme of what are the right portfolios to go after and how do you optimize those. That's really what we're doing and it's sounds like basic blocking and tackling. But sometimes you actually really have to go down that path to actually make it come through and that's what we're doing.","Ajay Banga","I think I said last time that I'm sure that other networks do some of the stuff, so it's not rocket science. So it's in the execution and it's in getting it done. And yes the Maestro to MasterCard convergence to give us some tailwind, because clearly Maestro utilization and e-commerce is challenging. MasterCard debit allows a better utilization. And that will continue for a while, because you haven't completed those migrations in every location that we'd like to.","Eric Wasserstrom","And if I can just follow-up, Ajay, any update on the B2B hub? I know that you launched it in Australia I think a quarter ago. And any update on its international or domestic advancement?","Ajay Banga","No, not really. In fact, we discussed it in the last quarter's call, you're right. Its physical launch is actually happening as we speak. And it's very early days. But that's the one we're focused on. The whole B2B space has opportunities. The hub is one way of getting to it. As you know the directory and track and enabling that directory to be fully built out the right way across the world is another one. Payments optimization engines are getting built into it. We're just doing a series of things. And hopefully, Transfast will enable and help us even more. Meanwhile, Sense continues to chug along, that's why I talked about Bank of Montreal and what it\u2019s trying to do with Send. It's doing it for its commercial and business banking clients as well. So there's a series of tools that are being played in the B2B space.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Don Fandetti","Ajay, so a two part question. I guess in the U.S., MasterCard's had a pretty good track record on these co-brand wins. But it's been a while since we've seen any major bank portfolio flip. Do you expect to see any market share change over the next year or two there? And then separately any update on the common pay button from e-commerce that the industry had some time to digest it? How are you guys feeling about the penetration opportunity?","Ajay Banga","So, on the first, on big bank portfolios. There've been some over the last year or two that we've talked about, and we've won on from parts of Capital One to parts of Bank of America and the like. And those are still helping us grow share. In fact, if you look at the way our credit numbers are growing in the U.S., part of that is co-brand, that's Cabela's and Kroger and the like, but part of it is also these bank portfolios that have been switching over to us. I don't see any huge swings in bank books moving around right now. But we're actively in every transition and every transaction that happens. But I don't see huge ones moving around as we speak as of now.","On the SRC progress, we're looking as we said the industries have launched us in second half of 2019. It\u2019s probably going to end up first in the U.S. and then get to additional markets over the next six to 18 months. And I think that you'll find that the feedback we're getting from issuers and merchants is very constructive to the EMVCo. We're trying to adapt through that feedback and get it rolled out, all the technology build and branding work is happening, as we speak. I still remain pretty optimistic about what SRC could do for the industry, and for the consumer, and for the merchant and the issuer, simpler connect to one connection for all brands, easier to manage for a consumer, trying to replicate the physical experience of one terminal to convert that to a physical -- to a digital experience of one button idea, that's what we're trying to get to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","You had -- I think you had a 200 basis points tough compare in the quarter and the FX. It looks like you clearly outperformed this quarter, growing around 13% constant currency. So first just what drove the surprise to the outside versus what it -- I think you initially thought when you talked about your guidance from last quarter for the first quarter trends. And then do you think that the soft spot we saw in cross-border, whether it's fourth quarter or perhaps early first quarter was more of an anomaly at this point, you feel better about the trends you're seeing? Thanks guys.","Sachin Mehra","So Darren, I'll take that question. So as it relates to the first quarter, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've slightly exceeded what our expectations were as it relates to our performance from a revenue standpoint, driven by the strength in our services business. So we also saw, from an FX standpoint, slightly lower impact on FX in the first quarter relative to what we originally thought. So those were a couple of factors, which you might want to take into consideration as you're thinking about it.","On your other question for cross-border, you\u2019ve got to remember that cross-border last year in Q1 we had a 20% growth rate in cross-border. And those tough comps are a large part of what we're seeing in terms of the results in Q1 of this year. You remember when we talked about cross-border performance last year. We actually were fairly explicit about saying that we don't expect our normal run rates to be like what we saw in the first half of last year. So as you think about our business, we continue to believe that our cross-border is trending and performing as we would normally see it, actually performing. So I wouldn't make too much of swings between quarters, because you're always doing comparisons between year-over-year tough comps.","Our business continues to go grow well. We like what we see in terms of our portfolio. Just a little bit more color if it's helpful from a cross-border standpoint. The U.S. outbound volumes continue to hold up pretty nicely. And our China business from a cross-border standpoint continues to grow also in the high single digits, much like we've seen historically. So all-in-all, business carries on as we have expected to be.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thanks Sachin. Ajay, do you have any final comments?","Ajay Banga","Gentlemen, thank you all for your questions. And I'm going to wrap up with a few closing thoughts. First, we had solid start to the year, reflecting this strong operational focus and executional focus and continued growth across each of our regions. And we are executing against our strategy with a couple of potentially noteworthy milestones this quarter. The first one being the progress in expanding our real time payments capabilities in Asia, in Latin America and in the Middle East. And secondly, we announced these strategic acquisitions in partnerships we think will complement our existing products and services and position the company well for the next decade or two of growth as well.","So with that, I'd like to thank you for your continued support for the company and for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is Laura, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Barbara L. Gasper","Thank you, Laura. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, either by phone or webcast, for a discussion about our second quarter 2012 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question.","This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. Both the earnings release and the slide deck include reconciliations of any non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalent. They have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A dial-in replay of this call will be available for 1 week through August 8. And finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And now with that, I will turn the call over to Ajay.","Ajaypal S. Banga","Thanks, Barbara. Good morning, everybody.","In the second quarter, we saw net revenue grow 9% as reported or 13% on a constant currency basis. This increase was driven by healthy volume and transaction growth, which helped to fuel net income growth of 17%, and EPS growth of 19%, a very good quarter despite some of the global economic headlines that we've all seen.","And so while looking at those underlying economic trends, I'm just going to start with the United States. And our MasterCard SpendingPulse data shows that second quarter retail sales x auto for the economy as a whole grew by 5.5%, but this growth is not as robust as the 7.4% we saw in the first quarter. MasterCard's United States GDV followed that trend with 9% growth in the second quarter versus 14% in the first quarter. And this pace of retail sales growth right now is expected to slow further through the second half of this year.","Most of this anticipated deceleration is explained by tougher comps in the economy versus a year ago. However, consumer confidence could also play a role and one example of that is that the impact of lower gas prices is not yet making its way back into other sectors of U.S. consumer spending, and in fact, is adding to the savings rate of households in the United States as the FT says this morning.","The housing market seems to be showing some signs of recovery but unemployment rates have remained around 8%, as we all know, for the past 2 quarters. And given all this in the current economic situation, our perspective is we would need to see more stable growth signals before expecting U.S. consumer confidence levels to show a sustained increase.","In Europe, despite the current economic headlines, our volume and transaction growth has remained fairly steady. Growth in Northern and Eastern Europe is compensating for slowdowns in markets such as Spain and Greece. The consumer confidence levels are recovering from their year-end 2011 lows, while business sentiment, on the other hand, is still declining as a result of the current economic crisis. And these are conflicting signals and they indicate that continued market volatility is likely to continue in Europe, at least for the near future.","Elsewhere in the world, Latin America and Asia continue to show solid performance for MasterCard despite a few signs of economic softening. Brazil, our largest market in Latin America, began showing some signs of economic slowdown although consumer confidence has remained high. Both our domestic and cross-border volume growth in Brazil remains strong with growth rates well above 20%.","Looking across the major markets in Asia, we're seeing the same indications you're all seeing of economic slowdown in China and India, and while that did not seem to have an impact in this quarter, we're going to be watching this very carefully during the second half of this year.","Overall, we maintain our cautious outlook for the rest of 2012. We will continue to watch global macroeconomic indicators, particularly as they pertain to Europe. We would need to see improvement in these before we can expect sustained positive growth and spending trends. And while this economic climate is volatile, our business continues to show strong double-digit growth, and we think that we are successfully navigating through the economic challenges by focusing on what we can influence and control and executing on our business strategy against those things that we have [ph] said we can influence and control.","So before I get into our business highlights, let me give you a brief update on the litigation front. And as you know, we recently announced settlement terms for the U.S. merchant class litigation, as well as an agreement in principle with a group of individual merchants. As a result of having [ph] negotiations finally landed, we took an additional $20 million pretax charge in the second quarter to recognize our total financial obligations of $790 million under the settlement. You will recall, we took the other $770 million in the fourth quarter of last year.","This settlement represents a solution reached after years of litigation and months of negotiation. That negotiation process directly involved 36 merchants and 5 trade associations, and with the assistance of the court, resulted in a settlement framework that is approved by all parties. We recognize that some merchants may have different opinions, and the nature of any settlement is going to involve compromise by all parties. But having said that, we fully anticipate that the settlement will be approved by the court.","Now moving forward, we understand that it will take some time for passion around these issues to settle down. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that the payments ecosystem, merchants, consumers and issuers, is healthy and transparent so that electronic payments can continue to provide value for all these participants in the ecosystem.","So let me turn to our business highlights now, and I'm going to begin with our initiative to support governments around the world. Our approach in working with them highlights the positive aspects of electronic payments. My attempt here, remember, is to reduce the level of cash that is used in the economy. In particular, efficiency and financial inclusion are these positive aspects that we are talking about.","So let me give you 3 examples: South Africa, the U.S., and Canada. In South Africa, MasterCard was selected to supply debit cards for the South African Social Security Agency in partnership with Net1, our technology partner, and Grindrod, one of our local bank partners. The program is designed to help the government reduce fraud in these social benefits and also provides an introduction to bank accounts for a large portion of South Africa's currently unbanked population.","The card contain an EMV chip with a biometric application that requires the card owner to be authenticated before benefits can be loaded each month, and that's the aspect of fighting fraud. A total of 10 million people are expected to receive these benefit cards by mid-2013. 25% of those cards are already in the market as we speak.","Also in South Africa, PayPass has been expanded for the transit system in the city of Durbin. Through the use of a standard bank MasterCard mobile card, including PayPass functionality for retail and a transit wallet for the local buses, this debit card was introduced in the province of KwaZulu-Natal just last week. The card is designed to make public transportation more accessible, more efficient, supports the government's financial inclusion drive for their unbanked population. This mobile card is expected to be expanded to the local railway network, the taxi industry and other transportation operators in the future as the way to integrate that transportation system across the entire province.","And as I've mentioned, in the past few quarters here in the United States, we won a number of public sector programs with the states of California, Illinois, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina. And I'm now pleased to add Alabama to that list. MasterCard is now providing solutions for 12 of the 20 largest state programs as the majority share in the federal government prepaid space and saw 35% volume growth for the first half of this year. We expect to add more names to this list.","About a week ago, we announced a first in Canada, a municipal prepaid card program for the city of Toronto. The City Services Benefit Card program provides recipients with reloadable EMV chip and PIN prepaid cards, enabling them to receive their benefits directly to a card. The program offers SMS and e-mail alerts for balances, as well as transaction inquiries, ATM access, online account access, as well as multilingual customer service.","While on prepaid, we actually just signed an important deal in the prepaid space, a 5-year agreement with Credicard in Brazil, to use and launch our IPS platform for prepaid processing. The agreement also guarantees the exclusive issuance of MasterCard for their general purpose reloadable prepaid cards as the first IPS launch of a domestic-use only program and it will help Credicard make their debut into the gift and general-purpose reloadable prepaid market.","Now let me turn to commercial. We've been experiencing strong growth. Our commercial volume is growing at about 20%, balanced across geographies and market segments ranging from large corporates and governments to small- and medium-sized businesses. We have won new businesses around the globe with many more Fortune 500 companies. And in fact, currently, almost 40% of the Fortune 500 uses MasterCard commercial products, including Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, Procter & Gamble.","On the debit front, we are growing our overall debit business in the U.S., a trend that you've seen for a little while now. Our process debit transactions grew 58% over the second quarter of 2011, and sequentially better than the 40% growth rate we saw in the first quarter. The value proposition for our debit customers remains strong. We have seen a robust sales pipeline with significant renewals and wins, including some of our biggest earlier customers such as BMO, Harris Bank and HSBC.","Turning to [ph] U.S. As you've now kind of seen over the last couple of years, we have made great progress in prepaid, in debit, and commercial credit businesses. We still have work to do in consumer credit and we're on it.","Moving to our activities supporting innovation, particularly around mobile payments, I'm going to mention 2 new launches. The first, we recently announced an agreement with Deutsche Telekom, creating an important new European partnership. This agreement opens the door to mobile payments for Deutsche Telekom's 95 million mobile customers across 11 European markets. The first consumer rollout will take place in Poland later this year, with mobile payment capabilities embedded in the phone. At the same time, a consumer trial will be introduced in Germany, initially using mobile phone tags and cards. A mobile wallet service will be added by the end of 2013.","In Argentina, MasterCard and Telefonica's first JV recently launched a mobile wallet service. It's marketed under the brand name Wonder. This is the first commercial launch of our JV, spans 12 countries in Latin America, with almost 100 million movie-style [ph] subscribers. These mobile payment services will be linked to a mobile wallet, a prepaid account that will allow for money transfers, mobile airtime reload, bill payment and retail purchases. Mobile payment solutions, MPS, another of our joint ventures, this one with Smart telecom in the Philippines will be responsible for developing and implementing this mobile wallet technology and the services.","And finally, last quarter, I talked about the progress we've made with our DataCash acquisition. And I'm very pleased to add a new highlight. DataCash recently announced that Alipay completed integration with DataCash's international payment solution. Alipay's online payment platform is already one of the most popular in Asia, serving over 500,000 online retailers. This integration with DataCash will help Alipay expand their international reach by enabling online retailers outside of China to process transactions from Chinese consumers using Alipay's e-wallet service.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.","Let me begin on Page 3 of our Web slide deck, where I will focus on the non-GAAP figures, which exclude the additional $20 million pretax charge we took this quarter related to the U.S. merchant litigation settlement.","For the second quarter, we saw solid top line and bottom line results. Net revenue grew 9% or 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong volume and transaction growth, as well as new deals. Total operating expenses increased 6% or 9% on a constant currency basis. Bottom line, we delivered net income of $713 million, up 17% or 23% on a constant currency basis, and diluted earnings per share of $5.65, up 19% or 24% on a constant currency basis.","As I mentioned last quarter, we expected to realize some onetime benefits to our 2012 effective tax rate. Therefore, besides enjoying the positive effects of our prior tax spending initiatives, we also finalized some work which resulted in discrete benefits relating to additional export incentives and the conclusion of tax examinations in some jurisdictions.","Cash flow from operations was $641 million. And we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $5 billion.","While not shown on this page, during the second quarter, we repurchased about 1.6 million shares at a cost of approximately $671 million. And through July 26, we repurchased an additional 132,250 shares at a cost of $57 million. We have now completed the previous $2 billion share repurchase authorization and have $1.4 billion remaining of the new $1.5 billion authorization. We will continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.","So let's now turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter of 2012. As you can see, worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 15% on a local currency basis. U.S. GDV grew 9%. While debit growth in the U.S. remains healthy at 14%, we saw the impact of the lapping of one of our debit brands. Credit volumes in the U.S. grew at about 3%. Commercial credit growth remains strong in the high teens, and as Ajay mentioned, we still have work to do in U.S. consumer credit.","Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 19% on a local currency basis, including mid- to high-teens growth in LAC and Europe, and more than 20% growth in APMEA. The growth rate of volume outside the U.S. was driven by strength in both MasterCard credit and debit volumes, which were up 16% and 24%, respectively. Cross-border volume grew 17% on a local currency basis, including growth rates above 20% in Latin America and APMEA. European cross-border volumes growth was in the mid-teens, down just slightly from the previous quarters.","So let me turn to Slide 5. Here, you can see that process transactions were up 29%, similar to the growth rate we saw in the first quarter. Now you might think that most of the impact is from the new U.S. debit awards, but it's not. On a net basis, less than half of the 29% growth rate comes from the U.S., primarily due to the new PIN debit transactions. Almost 4 percentage points comes from new processing from the rest of the world, leaving about 13% as the underlying growth rate.","Globally, the number of cards grew 9% to 1.8 billion MasterCard- and Maestro-branded cards.","Let me turn to Page 6 to discuss our revenue growth in a bit more detail. On an as reported basis, domestic assessments grew 10% versus GDV growth of 9% on a U.S. dollar basis. Cross-border fee revenue grew 11% versus cross-border volume growth of 9% on a U.S. dollar basis. Taking out the impact of currency, domestic assessments grew 15% and cross-border fees grew 14%.","Transaction processing fees grew 19%, driven mainly by the 29% growth in process transactions. Excluding pricing, the gap between these 2 growth rates continues to be in the 12 to 13 percentage point range. While there is a little bit of FX impact in this gap, it is mainly driven by all the new PIN transactions that I just mentioned on the previous slide which come with a lower than average revenue yield.","Other revenue was 7%, a deceleration from recent quarters due to the anniversary of excess prepaid in April of this year. And finally, rebates and incentives increased 24% driven by the impact of new and renewed deals, as well as strong volume growth.","Moving to Page 7 for some detail on expenses. So within total operating expenses, you can see that general and administrative expenses increased 10%, driven by higher personnel costs in support of our strategic growth initiatives. These include on the ground resources of prepaid, commercial and mobile, as well as supporting the growth in various markets and expansion into additional markets.","While advertising and marketing expense was down by 7% or was lower by 7% than last year's second quarter on an as-reported basis, it was only about 2% lower on an FX adjusted basis, due to the timing of certain initiatives. Depreciation and amortization increased 13%, due primarily to increased capitalized software associated with our strategic projects.","So let me now turn to Slide 8 and let's discuss 2012 starting with an update of what we have seen for the third quarter through July 28. Globally, our cross-border volumes grew about 14%, roughly 3 percentage points lower than what we had seen in the second quarter. This was primarily driven by the slower growth in APMEA, likely due to the timing of Ramadan, and to the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar when U.S.-issued cards are used overseas, particularly in Europe.","In the U.S., our processed volume proxy for GDV grew about 7%, slightly lower than the 9% that we saw in the second quarter. This was largely due to lower credit and debit volume growth. For debit, the slower growth rate can be primarily attributed to the lapping of one of our debit wins, which I mentioned just earlier.","Process volume growth outside the U.S. was about 14%, which is similar to the 15% growth we saw in the second quarter. And in Europe, which I know that's a region of particular interest to many of you, process volume growth for July was in the low teens versus mid-teens in the second quarter.","Globally, process transaction growth was about 25%, down from the 29% we saw in both Q1 and Q2 of this year due to the continued evolving landscape in U.S. PIN debit processing, as well as the lapping of some of our Netherlands wins.","So based on what we see now, let me give you some thoughts for full year of 2012. Before considering the impact of currency, we expect net revenue growth in the second half of the year to be somewhat lower than the 13% growth rate we saw in the second quarter due to really 3 factors: the first one, the expected timing of new and renewed deals over the rest of 2012; to a lesser extent, tougher comps as a result of the very strong revenue growth we saw in the second half of 2011; and certainly, this global economic uncertainty, which could temper both consumer and business spending for the balance of this year, including the July trends that I just talked about.","Based on our first half performance, we now believe we will deliver some operating margin expansion this year. However, the total amount of any improvement will depend on several factors, including global economic conditions and investment opportunities that may surface during the second half of the year. As a result, our current expectations for full year 2012 include that G&A growth will be similar to the growth rate we saw in 2011 on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions back in 2011.","So if you pull all of this out, the run rate is about 11%, and that's what we expect for 2012, and total A&M spend will be relatively flat versus 2011, on a constant currency basis or lower on an as-reported basis. The quarterly spend as a percentage of total year will be very similar to 2011, also on an as-reported basis. So in addition, we may elect to reallocate some funding away from A&M initiatives into G&A to support strategic initiatives in the second half. And we may also use some of this quarter's favorable tax benefit to opportunistically invest in the next 2 quarters.","The comments I just made about the 2012 outlook are based on constant currency perspective. So remember, you need to adjust for the impact of currency movements when modeling our as-reported numbers. So let's just assume that the euro continues to trade around, we picked 1.22%, and the Brazilian real continues to trade around the 2% level for the rest of the year, we would expect about a 4 to 5 percentage point headwind to as-reported net revenue, net income and EPS growth for both the second half and the full year of 2012.","And when you look specifically at each of the remaining quarters, this headwind is 5 to 6 percentage points for Q3, and 3 to 4 percentage points for Q4.","We continue to expect a 2012 full year tax rate of around 31%, primarily due to the onetime benefits you saw in our second quarter effective tax rate, as well as the ongoing contribution from some of our tax initiatives.","Finally, we remain focused on our performance objectives for the 2012 to 2013 period of a net revenue CAGR of 12% to 14%, a minimum annual operating margin of 50%, and an earnings per share CAGR of at least 20%.","Let me just remind you, these objectives are all on a constant currency basis and excludes any new acquisitions.","Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?","Barbara L. Gasper","Thanks, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. And in order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourselves to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Laura?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So I had a question for Ajay. You mentioned that you'd kind of focus on items that you can control, as long as the economic uncertainty continues, and I was just wondering if you could just elaborate on those levers a little bit more, maybe specifically around the operating margin? I think Martina gave some color as to what you guys are anticipating but what happens if the top line doesn't pan out as you expect it to?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Sanjay, let's first discuss the top line for a second. I have tried to lay out that I believe what drives our top line are those 3 concentric circles, the outermost one being the growth of personal consumption expenditure. And a lot of my commentary in the beginning was around how I'm not sure where that will go, maybe not at the 5% or 6% that we have been consistently getting over the last few years. Although I don't know for a fact, I'm just assuming that things look a little dodgier on that front than they did a little while ago. The other 2 concentric cycle circles, one is what percentage of that PCE goes into electronic transactions versus cash. And currently, around 80-something-percent goes into cash, and I'm still very focused on growing the electronic share in that, hence, all the effort on government programs, prepaid programs, Social Security, social benefits, all that that you see, as well as small ticket payments, mobile payments. All that comes from trying to change the ratio in that space. And the last concentric circle is our share in the 13%. I think, if you do the math on the way our transactions are growing, not just because of U.S. debit, you will find that we're making some progress there as well, although we've always got more work to do in that space. So I kind of think of those 3 levers. I think of the outermost concentric circle in revenue being less than easy to predict today and I'm focused on the next 2. That's the top line.","Now let's talk the other way, expenses. I think what you'll find us doing is to ensure that we meet our guidance of at least 50% of that operating margin we've talked about. But fortunately, over the last 6 months, we've been doing better than that. If we find that there are opportunities for us to put money back into strategic initiatives that feed our revenue growth in 1 of those 2 opportunities, either to grow electronification or to grow our share within the electronification, we will keep doing that, because that's what we're trying to do to keep our franchise growing through all these economic volatility that you see today. Now within that, if I had a choice, the easiest lever of control is A&M. I've talked about that in the past. G&A tends to be something I want to invest in consistently, I can't start and stop the strategic initiative without losing a lot of the momentum, but A&M, I can kind of work with. And so that's what Martina was trying to indicate to you in her commentary. But we are very focused on that 2-year goal of 12 of 14 percentage points of revenue growth CAGR on a constant currency basis. We're very focused on the minimum 50% operating margin and that 20% EPS growth, also on a constant currency basis. That's what our focus is. And I'm going to play with every element in the P&L in the meantime to ensure we deliver on that focus and navigate our way through this system and keep growing our share.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri from Cowen and Company.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So if I'm looking at gross store volumes, especially in the rest of the world, in credit, it was up 8.3%. Last quarter, it was up 17.6%. Is it possible just to reconcile the differences and maybe just give us a feel on what sort of FX headwinds you had there?","Martina Hund-Mejean","The FX headwinds for volumes were really not different than what we had been calling out, right? I mean, we said when you look at domestic -- when you look at GDV, the GDV on a constant currency basis was about 15%. On a U.S. dollar basis, it's about 9%. So you have a 6 percentage point headwind on GDV. And when you look at credit versus debit, there is really not much difference on that.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So just -- so the 17.6% should be -- if you kind of look at this at apples-to-apples basis, it should be roughly -- this quarter should be, what? Like in the -- somewhere in the 12%, 13% range, if I adjusted for FX headwinds?","Martina Hund-Mejean","I think, directionally, you are correct.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just looking at the constant currency 13% growth rate, how much of that growth was from new business wins? And as we go forward into the second half to a year, how do we think about the incremental growth rate we'll get from new business wins?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Look, we really don't split new business wins out. You have to have an appreciation. Of course, you can't just get to the 13% without having new business wins but you're going to have to go back to how we build our model over the longer term. So basically, we are -- and I'm going back right to the concentric circles that Ajay has been just laying out. We're starting with personal consumption expenditure growth and that's typically, over longer period, 5% to 6% per year. This year, it's probably a little bit low, so that's lower. So that is impacting us. Then you have the secular trends. The secular trends on a per year basis can be anywhere between 4 to 6 percentage points. We haven't finished the year so I can't really give you yet where we are ending up in that 4 to 6 percentage points. Now when you add those 2 factors together, you get into the 9% to 11% growth rate. So in order to get to 13%, of course, you're going to have to have a couple of percentage points attributed by the new things that we are doing, and that could be new business wins, it could be expanding into other markets, it could be getting these kinds of government programs that Ajay has been laying out. There are a number of things in that number.","Ajaypal S. Banga","And Brian, it's Ajay. You should remember that that 5 to 6 percentage points of PC in growth which Martina was calculating into the 9% to 11% that you get to by adding that to the secular growth, we don't know, as of today, what that 5% or 6% will be. So we're trying to give you normalized thinking, and frankly, that's how we approach our business in those concentric circles. But we don't know what that 5% to 6% will be. If you ask me today, it feels lower, but 2 months later, we might have a different opinion, depending on how the world economies are performing. Right now, given all we're seeing in consumer spending, it feels lower than the 5% to 6%. I just don't know yet.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, any update on the timing you guys are hearing from the EC on potential recommendations from the Green Paper? And any impact that you could see maybe coming out of that, if they talk about routing freedom or access to cash balances with the ability to clear and settle for third-party providers? Just trying to think about the potential impact coming out of that -- those recommendations.","Ajaypal S. Banga","We don't have any update on any timing from them. We're kind of, I told you, actively engaged in discussions with them. We have given them a point of view. We are in constant dialogue with them. We don't have any update with them yet.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to touch base on, again, on rebates and incentives. I know that you shy away from really guiding towards it, but Martina, thanks for the color on the second half, at least, overall. Overall, though, in the quarter, they were at higher level than I think than we expected and it sounds like you're expecting somewhat of a similar run rate going forward, based on the discussion around new signings and overall revenue growth. While I understand there's new deals and renewals, is there any shift in strategy around incentives, maybe similar to what we've seen at one of your competitors or even from merchants or banks and where it's going? Perhaps and maybe how it was allocated in the past?","Martina Hund-Mejean","No, Darrin, absolutely not, there's no change in this. And you might recall that a year, or a couple of years ago, I laid out, actually, a split of our rebates and incentives between what is really driven from a volume perspective versus what is really driven from a new deal or a new deal signing. And we typically say, when you look at our total rebates and incentives over a whole year -- so you have to take a total year, don't just take a quarter -- about 70% of our rebates and incentives is driven really by volume and by the increased business that we are getting. 30% is typically driven by new deals or renew deals. And even in this quarter, and I don't expect for any part of this year, it will be -- there will be any difference whatsoever.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So similar -- just expect similar kind of trends in the second half that we saw this quarter, more or less?","Martina Hund-Mejean","As you very eloquently said, it's all embedded in the thoughts that I gave for 2012.","Ajaypal S. Banga","And just to make sure you get the picture around -- inside your question was aspects of other people doing things with the way they're using rebates and incentives across merchants versus issuers. We haven't changed our strategy, which is get ourselves onto the back of those debit cards, get ourselves enabled for them to be used, watch how that goes, do not try and apply rebates and incentives in a broad way. I'm not in the position of protecting a large pre-regulatory change market share. I'm in the business of growing market share in this opportunity, and use them surgically and sensibly. And nothing's changed in that picture. We are exactly where we were in that strategic thinking. Nothing's changed.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to ask, Ajay, just give us maybe some high level thoughts on some of the concessions that were given on the merchant litigation, specifically surcharging in some of the smaller items?","Ajaypal S. Banga","So I kind of, when I approach this -- I think we had this conversation with the investor and analyst community sometime back as well, and I was talking about how I would be reluctant to agree to long-term changes in the methodology by which interchange is computed and used. We did agree, as you know, one portion of this is a short-term change. But the surcharge angle, frankly, for a long time in MasterCard, surcharging has been going on in some parts of the world, partly promoted by legal changes in those countries. Discounting for cash has been going on for a long time and we have never enforced anything differently from that. I still share the belief that all these kinds of things create friction for a consumer, for a merchant, for everybody in the electronification of payments. And so, when I talked about that second concentric circle of secular change, these things create friction. Frictions aren't good for increasing the speed of that secular change. Yet, the merchants were very clear, the ones who represented [ph] us and negotiated with us, that without that, there was no conversation. So we came to the point where it's either to agree to part of that -- from my perspective. This is only mine, by the way, this is not the other parties in the negotiation. I'm not trying to speak on behalf of the banks. I'm not trying to speak on behalf of Visa. This is me, MasterCard. We believe the best thing to do was looking at our experience of surcharging in other markets where, frankly, it didn't really lead to a great deal of actual surcharges being placed other than in a couple of kinds of areas where cash isn't quite able to compete. So for example, online airline bookings and the like. And even there, in Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia stepped in recently and created caps for the level of that surcharging realizing that this was not quite what they wanted to have happened, I'm assuming, which is why they stepped in. So when I think about that here, in this agreement, we have also managed to get in some of those protections, the cap and what they could charge, the declaration to the consumer with clarity, both on the receipt and in the store, the level playing field concept that we think we've got in there. All these were attempted as a way to sort of try and box the issue while moving forward. So the bigger picture of tackling the 80-something percentage of transactions that are still in cash can keep on being pursued, instead of all our thoughts being tied up in the passion behind this issue. That's kind of how I approached it, Tien-Tsin. And so it is friction. I don't like the friction but I'm trying to minimize it with as much lubricant as I can put in the system.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Hey, Martina, just to go back to the expenses. There's a lot of puts and takes on the constant currency reported, especially on the advertising and marketing side. Can you just go back through those real quickly on the expectations for the second half as it relates to the advertising and marketing, that is both including and excluding the currency?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, I mean, what I really said that you should be expecting that A&M spend will be relatively flat versus 2011 on a constant currency basis. And that would tell you, because of the FX impacts, that it would be lower on an as-reported basis. And then also, I tried to give you a little bit more help on your model from a quarterly perspective. And really, from a quarterly modeling point of view, you should be really thinking about the same kind of rate of usage as in 2011. Now I also said, and Ajay had reemphasized, we are looking at our strategic investments, and that might entail moving things around from A&M to G&A. That is not included in these comments. We will make those decisions as we go along in the next couple of quarters. But this is what I see, this is the best that I'm seeing at this point.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then maybe, Ajay, on the credit side, just in terms of the U.S. credit and having some work to do, what does that comment entail? Like, I mean, as you think about having some work to do in U.S. credit, what exactly do you guys think needs to be done there?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Two, 3 years back, Julio -- if you looked at our position in the United States market 2, 3 years ago, in all the different product categories, we were not in the best position in terms of either debit, signature of payments. We were not doing as well as we wanted to in commercial cards. We were doing reasonably well in prepaid, although I think we could have accelerated that momentum. And we were not doing as well as we wanted to in consumer credit because we're reliant on a portfolio of banks that in that mix has been going through some degree of difficulties over the financial crisis. What I've tried to do over these years is to take each of those 4 product categories and change our position in the market. In prepaid, with all that we've done with these governments, as well as our relationships with a number of the prepaid program managers and other issuers, I think we have made real progress. From the Social Security Administration of the U.S., to these state-level programs, all those, we kind of feel good about. In debit, we've actually done reasonably well over the last one year including the wins before the regulatory change with SunTrust and Sovereign and all those pieces. In commercial, we actually feel pretty good. We are making real progress on large corporates and small businesses. It's in consumer credit that I still don't think I can tell you that I've made the breakthroughs. I have wins. I have wins with regional banks. I have wins with independent banks and credit unions. I have reconfirmations of my position in market share in some of the biggest banks. I'm winning little days along the side. I'm not losing anything contrary to what anybody else might say. I'm not losing anything. I'm gaining a little bit here or there, but it doesn't excite me. It doesn't satisfy me. There's work to be done in consumer credit. That's the finality I was trying to get across.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. So over the last year, your growth in Europe has been helped by domestic processing wins. And our assumption has been that you may not have additional SEPA-related wins on the near-term horizon, even though SEPA seemingly could still create long-term opportunities if the regulatory environment doesn't change too much in Europe. So with that as the context, can you give us your thoughts on the short term and the longer-term opportunities for wins in Europe related to SEPA, given that you've had a pretty good track record there over the last year or 2?","Ajaypal S. Banga","It's a good question. Our SEPA volumes in this last quarter -- the previous quarter, they were up 200-something-percent. This last quarter, it's closer to less than half of that. So that's because of the lapping of some of those wins. Do I -- it's very tough for me to tell you how I think about this shorter-term because the nature of this wins in SEPA tend to have a peculiar lumpiness in them. We're talking so many of these parties at the same time. Two kinds of results come out of it. One is a constant dribble of incremental transactions from many countries, Germany, France, Belgium. Those are happening even today. They kind of continuously getting some benefits from them. Then I've got the lapping effect of the big wins in the Netherlands that we had last year. In the middle of all that, if 1 or 2 of those big discussions turn into a deal, it will happen in 60, 90 days, not in 350 days, I won't get 350-days notice on it. It may not happen, by the way, in the next quarter, don't get me wrong. It's just that I don't know when to predict how the damn thing will convert from a conversation to a real deal. So I don't know how to give you a better feeling of that number for the shorter term. It's the nature of our business with longer selling cycles. And when the deal happens, it happens. But I could say that if you look at it consistently over a period of time, absolutely, we think our product and our capability with Maestro, with Debit MasterCard, our technology and the fact that we have one global platform, that you can take your Maestro card and use it anywhere in the world, let alone not being able to use it outside of Germany in Europe. Forget about going to Latin America and using it. When you can do all that, then I believe that that is a strong starting point to keep winning business on this line in SEPA. And that's the dialogue we're going ahead with. And Martina, you want to add something?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Rod, just from a nearer-term perspective, to expand a little bit from SEPA, right? When you look, for instance, at the Nordics, we've been working on the Nordics in Europe for a considerable amount of time and had just announced a number of deals, right? Last year, the Swedbank deal, this year, we think that we have a follow-on on that with another bank. And so we are starting to really work out country by country to be getting these kind of wins and putting our cards into the market. So you can't just look at each individual SEPA country. You're going to have to think about the overall strategy.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. Well, just a quick follow-up on that. I mean, when you look at the seemingly -- some uncertainty created by the Green Paper and then the underlying motivation of the EC, is that -- are those developments making it more difficult to proceed with SEPA-related wins or is there really no change?","Ajaypal S. Banga","No, no, actually. Remember, in many ways, what we are doing with all these, that actually fit directly into what the EC wanted to have done when SEPA was created, which was to break down the monopolies of the domestic debit schemes and allow for cross-border intra-EU, as well as global players to come into play in that space so that you could increase competition, increase innovation and increase efficiency. For a long while, those conversations wandered off into a local domestic European scheme like money. That's still is getting talk about somewhere in the fringes. But for a long while, that's the only question you guys ask me. And I kept telling you, I don't know for sure whether that will also happen. All I know is it's a moving landscape. We have a terrific product with great efficiency, priced right. That's how we won the Netherlands. That's how we are winning business in different parts of Europe, including the Nordics data that Martina was talking about. I'm pretty confident that that still holds true. So that's about it, Rod.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ajay, with regards to the settlement, as you stated, there's clearly a lot of emotion out there among some of the parties, so could you tell us, is there a mechanism for the defendants, either the networks or the issuers approaching the large merchants who are putting out these headlines these days and helping ameliorate their concerns? And if so, have those efforts started?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Well, I'm not going to sort of go into too much detail there. But I will tell you this, dialogue with all these parties is a consistent part of what we're doing. The fact is not everything about this settlement will suit every individual involved. And so there are those compromises and some parties on both sides are more willing to make some of those compromises, others that aren't. The -- that's kind of a first basic principle. As far as the actual mechanisms are concerned, I've got Noah here. So Noah, do you want to add something to what Glenn was asking?","Noah J. Hanft","Sure. Glenn, there's a process in court for merchants to actually express their desire to opt out of the settlement, which actually hasn't occurred yet. That will follow the preliminary approval by the court, which should take place in the fall. At the end of the day, we're confident that the settlement will be -- will receive approval from the court, both from a preliminary approval perspective and from a final approval perspective. It's just like in the Walmart case, there tends to be, in all class action cases, merchants that choose to opt out. But we're confident that at the end of the day, the settlement will be accepted by the court. And notwithstanding the fact that different merchants have different views, we will reach a resolution that should really turn the corner on the years of litigation and allow us to get back to doing business with the important merchant community.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I've got a question on buybacks. Some companies look at buybacks as simply a vehicle for returning capital. Others tend to look at it more as opportunistically if there are share price declines. Can you kind of remind us a little bit on your philosophy and whether you would view potential pressure that your shares might come under to the extent that, from a macro perspective, there are some weakness and whether you would look at that as an opportunity to get more aggressive on buybacks?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Okay. So let me just talk a little bit about our philosophy and let me start a little bit in terms of how we think about capital allocation anyhow, right? Because first of all, we're looking at allocating capital to the business, right? That is our first-most focus. Secondly, we are looking to deploy capital from an, what we call, inorganic way, i.e., making acquisitions, investing in other businesses in order to further the goal that Ajay has laid out, to really drive our revenue growth, right? And then last but not least, if you have excess cash available, we're certainly very open to be returning that to shareholders. And at this point in time, our preferred method of returning it to shareholders is really through share repurchase programs. And as you've seen, we have been doing that very consistently in the market. In fact, I think we've been spending close to $1 billion just in 2012, in terms of repurchasing our shares. And the one thing that I just want to always be sure is that we do, that we pick shares up in an opportunistic manner over a certain time period. So you can read out from that that obviously, an opportunistic pick up of shares means that we're watching very closely where the share price is going. And then we move in and do things as we can. Now we can't do that always, okay? And I just want to caution that a little bit. Given that we are a publicly traded company, there are certain trading windows that are open for us where we can do that in a very active manner. However, when we get into what we call a blackout period, which is moving closer to a quarter end and an earnings release, we have to file things like the 10b5-1 plan. That means we have to predetermine what kind of trading activity we want to have on our stock in the market. And of course, we do formula-based kind of activity, so we try to mimic in these plans what we otherwise would be doing when we can go actively into the market everyday. I hope that gives you a little bit of background on how we think about it.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful, Martina. And if I may ask Ajay a follow-up. Ajay, does your pursuit of -- you gave a little bit of an update on Telefonica. Can you talk a little bit about whether your pursuit of money transfer solutions with other partners around the world creates any kind of tension with Western Union, given the work that you're doing with them? Basically, as you look forward also, do you expect these tensions to intensify?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Yes. I look -- I actually am doing all this with great partnership with Hikmet at Western Union. In fact, I think there are ways that Western Union and MasterCard, together, could offer an even stronger opportunity to a number of these money transfer opportunities through the phone systems. I've always believed that the phone companies, the operators as well as the hardware folks, can be an integral part of how this new method evolves, rather than an either\/or. So I don't see the same kind of tensions. I actually see all of us bringing different capabilities and skills and strengths to the table. And if you can stitch those together, well, it actually works pretty well. And that's the kind of thing we've been doing for the past couple of years, whether it be with Google, whether it be with Telefonica, whether it be with a E.Tel and Zane [ph], or with Deutsche Telekom. We've kind of got issuers, telecom companies and us to work together in some ways to discover this whole mobile payment space. I think there's another set of partners, which is the future set of partners around vouchers, rewards, loyalty, e-receipts. All those will also add value to this whole mobile payment space and money transfer space. So I think what we do well is we build ecosystems. We make partners work together, that's our job. If I start doing an either\/or, I would've forgotten our heritage of the company.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first is in terms of U.S. credit, it would seem that the banks that are focused on issuing cards on your largest competitor are consistently taking share from banks that are issuing on MasterCard. At this point, is this a somewhat unavoidable circumstance in the U.S., as I'm not sure there are any major credit portfolios that are up for renewal at any point soon? And secondly, a question on Europe. Yesterday's antitrust announcement against Visa Europe had a unique twist in it, in that it was also discussing domestic interchange in certain countries. As I understand it, Visa and MasterCard both have domestic interchange rates in certain countries in Europe. And if they do happen to win this case against Visa Europe, do you see this as setting precedent to eventually approach MasterCard on domestic interchange?","Ajaypal S. Banga","So Craig, the first part, the part about credit in the U.S., you're absolutely correct that the mix of the portfolios of various competitors, as well as the Amex GNS business, all those mixes put together are part of what you're seeing in that credit marketplace. And it may change as different banks have different appetites for growing their business in cards. But it is where it is today. And one of the things that we are working with is that circumstance. I don't quite understand the commentary about no possible portfolios being available. So I think that -- I'm just kind of going to leave that out there with you. We keep getting maybe not huge portfolios, which I would like to, but we keep getting new business from a number of banks that traditionally would have been only issuing somebody else's cards. And I think that's true, by the way. Also those banks who've traditionally been issuing our cards, it's in the interest of an issuing bank to find a way to manage to work with more than one network. It suits them, it gives them a better position, it gives them a better capability of constructing their business models. And when I was a banker, that's how I thought about it. So I am somewhat less clear on that part of your question. That's what we're working our way through. And so will it change in a day or 2? No. It's a -- that's the nature of our business. It's a business that has a longer selling cycle. And within the marketplace in the U.S., there are some portfolios that are available, some that are not, newer ones that normally available at most banks. And so it's a mix of all those things that we are working our way through. We've worked our way through the same situation with commercial, in a way with prepaid, and of course, in the case of debit, in some cases, we were able to get a big deal. In others, this regulatory environment change provided an opportunity to do something. But we're kind of working our way through that. That's how I view that consumer credit question. And Noah, would you like to take on the EU and Visa question a little bit?","Noah J. Hanft","Sure, I'd be glad to. So there is a difference, as I understand Visa and their interchange fee structure setting in Europe compared to ours. So Visa's cross-border interchange fees have application to domestic jurisdictions. So as I understand the scope of the European Commission's concerns with Visa, that's why it relates to both the cross-border rates, as well as their domestic rates in some countries. We don't have that approach, so we set individual domestic rates, as well as the cross-border rate. The case that the Commission brought against MasterCard only relates to the cross-border rates. We, as you know, are appealing from the -- the decision from the general court. In the meantime, to specifically answer your question, yes, there is the potential for some pressure from domestic competition authorities. We will continue to dialogue with them. But we think we have, as I said, a strong position on our appeal.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping, Ajay, to kind of return to that U.S. credit, because given that you'd said mid-teens from the commercial side, it just seems like the consumer side might even be flat to down at this point. I appreciate the comments that you made about banks kind of switching back and forth, but maybe talk a little bit about if you've got specific plans to kind of bring some of that volume back in the second half of the year.","Ajaypal S. Banga","You've got to be kidding if I'm going to give you specific [ph] plans now. That's a good try, Moshe. I'm sorry, I can't answer that question, you know that. Just nothing that I can tell you that I will certainly produce and having all of that tomorrow morning. But we have worked very hard in the other areas and we are working very hard on this one. And we've got a constant drum rate of pipeline out there and we're at it. And don't take all this out of context. I was trying to provide that color to enable you to understand how I viewed our position in the U.S. market over the last few years. I viewed our position 2, 3 years ago, a bit like Chris McWilton laid out at one of our Investor Days, where we had -- frankly, we have lost share in debit, signature and payment. Our credit position was what it was because we were strong with certain banks that are mostly credit card issuers. We were not strong with some banks that are more debit and credit, as in a more holistic money-centered approach. We -- those banks, got sold out by -- bought by other banks that were traditional Visa banks. That didn't help our position. Our commercial position was not where I'd want it to be despite our very good strengths on the commercial product, from smart data as a tool to the fact that our acceptance is way beyond that of the largest players in commercial. And all we have to do is travel outside of the United States and feel that pain. And so in many ways, I felt we weren't taking full advantage of our capabilities in those spaces. And we were making progress in all of them. In that context, in my own personal scorecard, I don't think consumer credit has made as much progress as commercial prepaid and debit. That's the context in which I was speaking.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies & Company.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a clarification and a question. The clarification was just what was the pricing impact on revenues in the quarter? And then my question is within Europe, I know you said low teens process volume growth in July, still robust, slipping a little bit versus Q2. Can you give us any qualitative sense underneath that number between debit and credit in Europe? Just if there has been a divergence in the relative growth rates between those 2. I know you won't give us the exact numbers, but just any qualitative trends you can speak to on credit versus debit in Europe, as the macro unfolds there.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Okay, Jason, I can do that. First of all, from a pricing contribution, that was about 2 percentage points, okay? Both on the 9%, as well as on the 13% growth rates for revenues. And there's really no additional pricing in there. It all came out from what we had put in place last year, as well as in January of 2012. From a European, a little bit more clarification point of view, we're really seeing no slowdown from a debit point of view. All of the numbers that we're seeing are more on the credit side. And when I look at the underlying countries, there are really 2 countries that are still growing. They're still growing very nicely but the growth is a little bit less than what we had in the prior couple of quarters. And one is the U.K., and the other one is France.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A section of the call. I would like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks.","Ajaypal S. Banga","So let me just leave you with a few of those thoughts. We have  -- as I've just been saying in the few questions and answers, I think we've made really solid progress across the globe in the first half of 2012. We feel very good about U.S. PIN debit in particular, even though we don't yet know how those volumes will all finally shake out, for all the reasons we have discussed in the past. Of course, those incremental PIN debit transactions came at a lower than average yields as Martina talked about, but with good profitability.","As Martina also mentioned, we think that the second half of the year has got more difficult comparisons as the year progresses, as we lap our strong second half of last year. There is the potential for us to increase our level of investment, depending on how much room we have in our P&L versus the kind of commitments we have out there for our operating targets. That room could come from things such as stronger-than-expected top line growth or the potential lower tax rate that Martina has been talking about. There is no shortage of growth opportunities in this business. The key is to evaluate as many as we can and then act on the ones that provide the best potential for maximizing our long-term growth, and let everything leftover drop straight to the bottom line. That's what we are focused on.","Overall, we're working as hard as we can to deliver another good year and meet those performance objectives despite all these continuing uncertain economic conditions.","So with that, thank you for your time today, and thank you for your faith in our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

My name is Clifford, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Gasper, you may begin.","Barbara L. Gasper","Thank you, Clifford, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for a discussion about our fourth quarter and year-end 2013 financial results.","With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer.","Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question.","This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. The earnings release includes reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. The release and the slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 1 week through February 7.","All of the EPS figures in our press release and those discussed on today's call are presented on a post-split basis, consistent with the SEC's reporting requirements following our 10-for-1 stock split that was effective at market open on January 22. In order to provide a bridge for you between the pre-split and post-split EPS figures, we have added a page in the Appendix section of the slide deck that breaks out the 2013 EPS by quarter and full year, as well as the 2012 figures recalculated on a pro forma basis.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filing.","With that, I will now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajay Banga. Ajay?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. So we're very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results in 2013. And those results basically were in line with our expectations.","Our net revenue growth was 13%, both as reported and adjusted for FX. It was driven by solid operational performance in processed transactions, in gross dollar volume and cross-border volume growth. And we were able to deliver some margin growth in spite of investing more back into the business.","For the full year 2013, excluding special items, we saw net income growth of 15%, or 14% adjusted for currency, and reported EPS growth of 19% or 18% on an FX-adjusted basis.","And then for the fourth quarter, we came in about where we thought we would, even after signing more agreements than we had anticipated, some of which I will talk about in a moment, as well as putting money and investing some money back into the business. I'll let Martina get into the quarterly financial details a little later.","So let's go to the global economic trends, starting with the United States, where it seems like the economy is beginning to show a bit of forward momentum.","Our SpendingPulse data that showed that U.S. retail sales growth x auto for the fourth quarter was 3.9%, and includes the fact that holiday retail sales grew faster than last year with particular strength in the A&M commerce space. Economic indicators, such as housing and employment, also showed some improvement during the quarter, and consumer confidence bounced back from what was the low of October. We saw an increase in our United States business in the fourth quarter with volume growth of 7%, driven by improvements in consumer credit and in debit.","In Europe, overall economic growth in the fourth quarter remained subdued, although there are some indicators of a potential recovery. Consumer sentiment continued a slow but very steady climb, as did business sentiment across our major markets. Northern Europe continues at a solid footing. Southern Europe is moving up, although it's coming off a lower base. Key contributors to our 14% fourth quarter volume growth in the region were Russia, Sweden, the Ukraine and Poland.","In Asia Pacific, consumer and business sentiment levels declined in the fourth quarter across major markets, including Australia. In addition, worries about slowing growth in China go beyond being just a domestic issue and have broader implications, as you all know, for other markets that depend on Chinese demand.","In Latin America, economic growth slowed a bit in the fourth quarter with consumer confidence declining in both Brazil and Mexico. But across the rest of the region, it was fairly positive.","So despite these sluggish economic indicators in both regions, our Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa GDV growth was 20%, and our Latin America growth was 17% in GDV, with transaction growth in the high 20s and the high teens, all for -- was a high 20% for Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa, high teen for Latin America, all relatively similar to previous quarters.","The fact that we had a significant proportion of our growth in emerging markets comes from the secular shift to electronic payments, which I think is relatively uncorrelated to some of the economic cycles that we see the emerging markets currently going through.","Overall, it feels like the U.S. and Western Europe markets where we generate well over half of our revenue are slowly starting to regain their economic footing. The general consensus is the U.S. should have a decent economic growth in 2014, and there is increasing optimism about Europe. As these developed markets recover, it could be a catalyst to spark further growth in Asia and Latin America.","So now, before we go to the business highlights, let me say a few words on the legal and regulatory front. In December, as you know, Judge Gleeson issued final approval of the U.S. merchant litigation settlement. We anticipate that most of the larger merchants who opted out will initiate separate actions. And based on that analysis, we have taken a $95 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter. The cases filed to date are in the early stages, but most have been consolidated under Judge Gleeson's court.","Also, in mid-January, both the Federal Reserve and the merchant claim desk presented oral arguments to the appeals court in response to Judge Leon's July decision on the Fed regulation around implementing the Durbin Amendment. But the Appeals Court will likely issue a ruling sometime in 2014.","And with regards to the proposed European legislation, you've probably all seen the Rakuten [ph] amendments to the EC's initial proposal. But you should know that there are also more than 300 amendments submitted from other members of Parliament. So the process is quite complicated. A committee of Parliament will now deliberate and vote on all of this in late February. And a vote by the full Parliament is currently scheduled for April. Also in late February, the Council of Ministers is expected to start a separate parallel review of the legislation. So we kind of continue to believe that the time line for final adoption appears ambitious. But obviously, we are watching that situation very closely on the ground.","We were disappointed to learn yesterday that the Advocate General of Luxembourg issued an opinion siding against our appeal of the European Commission's 2007 decision regarding our intra-Europe cross-border interchange rates. The court now has to rule, and we'll find out what they'll say at some point this year. But keep in mind that we had already modified these interchange rates to 20 and 30 basis points for debit and credit, respectively, in mid-2009. So in effect, this changes very, very little in that space for either the banks or the merchants or us as of today.","So now, let me move on to some of our recent business activity. As I mentioned, we finished the year signing even more deals than we anticipated, which is good. It sets us up well for future growth. But let me just sort of call out a few of these that I personally found interesting.","So first, we were very pleased to be able to continue and, in fact, enhance our partnership with Citi on the American Airlines portfolio. That's an important co-brand for both of us. As you know, American Airlines is now the world's largest airline after its recent merger.","Second, we recently completed a new agreement with Chase for their U.S. commercial card portfolio, providing corporate purchasing and fleet cards for their customers across many industry sectors, and these customers range from midsize companies all the way up to large multinational corporations.","In December, we also renewed our agreement with the Bank of Montr\u00e9al, which for us is a very important partner in Canada and the United States. And in fact, in the U.S., we expanded our relationship to include consumer credit.","And we also recently extended our agreement with Tesco Bank. And as you know, Tesco Bank is a part of the third largest retailer in the world for their U.K. consumer credit card portfolio. That's a very good partnership for us with lots of future scope for expansion.","And finally, capping off a year of advancements in Africa, from a $13 million identity card pilot being launched in Nigeria that we've talked about to the NedBank conversion in South Africa, we have now recently signed an agreement with Ecobank. Ecobank is the largest pan-African bank. It has a presence in 23 countries in Africa, reaching 65% of Africa's population. The bank will now issue our debit, credit, prepaid and other payment solutions. And also, it allows us to expand our acceptance in these markets.","Meanwhile, MasterPass. Momentum in our MasterPass continues. And by the end of last year of 2013, we are now live in 5 markets with actually many more in the pipeline. You probably saw our U.S. advertising campaign with J.Crew and MasterPass over the holidays. But we also had a number of other major global retailers agree to accept MasterPass, including Brooks Brothers, Always [ph], Live Nation, Ticketmaster, Singapore Airlines, that brings the total number of merchants to more than 30,000 with most of them already live.","We're continuing to add new banking partners around the world as well, including Unicredit in Italy; the 3 largest banks in Sweden, SEB, Swedbank and Nordea; and Caixa in Brazil. And this adds on to ones we signed up in previous quarters, such as the [ph] one in MasterPass.","Now another big area of focus for us is processing. And that goes beyond our traditional role of switching transactions but also includes providing processing services on either side of that switch to surround the transaction. Now some of you heard from Gary Flood at Investor Day back in September, the more transactions we touch, the greater our ability to deliver a wide range of services and generate additional revenue. Touching a transaction, even if we don't switch it, can be very valuable to us.","So let me give you a flavor of a few recent initiatives in this area. We have now completed our acquisition of Provus, a provider of issuer and acquirer processing, prepaid solution and ATM processing services in Turkey. That's going to enable us to increase our processing presence in the high-growth markets in the European region.","TREVICA, an issuer and acquirer processor in Poland, will provide processing services to all the largest retailers in Portugal. In the first half of this year, that retailer is expected to roll out a new store card that will be able to accommodate credit, prepaid, private label and installment payments.","And we recently announced a partnership with BICS, B-I-C-S, a Belgian telecom company, and eServGlobal, a mobile money solutions provider. We have formed a joint venture that will enable their HomeSend platform to connect to any financial institution across the MasterCard network. That service is already offered in 50 countries with mobile network and money transfer operators. And as we build our P2P initiatives, this joint venture, along with our relationship with Western Union, gives consumers more places to send money, both domestically and internationally.","And finally, before I hand this over to Martina, let me talk about the topic of safety and security of payments, which has received a great deal of attention given all that's happened in the recent past on data breaches.","In last quarter's call, we discussed safety and security in some depth. The fact is, this is fundamental to everything we do, and it's what consumers expect and what they deserve.","In the United States, migration to EMV is a necessary and critical step. It makes stealing data much more difficult. And also, it makes stolen data less valuable to a fraudster. That's why we announced 2 years ago our plan for the U.S. migration from mag stripe to chip technology starting October 2014. Earlier this month, we reiterated that we are holding firm to that date because we believe it's the right thing to do.","Beyond the 0 liability protection, for which our rules already provide, consumers should not be at risk of having their personal information stolen and face enormous inconveniences and distress as a result.","While EMV works to protect in the physical space, we also do need to make sure that we are ahead of this issue in the digital space. And that is why we announced tokenization standards with all our other partners back in October. What we would now like to see is that all players within the payments ecosystem come together with a sense of urgency to ensure that the highest payment security standards are put into place. This is not easy, but it's key to doing the right thing and sustaining consumer confidence and trust.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. As Ajay already said, we are very pleased with our 2013 performance of 13% net revenue growth. EPS growth was 21%, adjusted for foreign exchange and normalized for discrete tax benefits in 2012, which is consistent with the calculation of our long-term EPS performance target.","I will now focus on the details of the fourth quarter results, excluding the $95 million pretax charge that we took this quarter related to the opt-out in the U.S. merchant litigation.","Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck. And here you'll see the differences between as-reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter, ranging from 0 to 2 percentage points for each line item. And all of my comments today will pertain to the FX-adjusted growth rate.","So net revenue grew 11%, driven by strong underlying operational metrics but primarily offset by an increase in rebates and incentives as a result of signing a significant number of agreements in the quarter.","Based on our net revenue and operating expense growth, net income increased by 11%.","EPS growth was 16%, benefiting from our share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 9.8 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $750 million. Quarter-to-date through Friday, an additional 4.2 million shares were repurchased at a cost of approximately $350 million with $3.3 billion remaining under our current authorization. We continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.","And cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion. And we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of $6.3 billion.","Now let's turn to Page 4, and here you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 14% on a local currency basis to over $1.1 trillion. U.S. GDV grew 7% with credit volumes growing 6%.","U.S. commercial credit growth was in the low teens, down from last quarter. U.S. consumer credit growth of over 3% was about the same level as what we saw last quarter. And our U.S. debit growth was 9%, driven by solid growth across our consumer and commercial debit and prepaid programs.","Now outside of the U.S., volume growth was 17% on a local currency basis. And this continues to be driven by Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa with 20% growth and mid- to high-teens growth in both Europe and Latin America.","Cross-border volume grew 18% on a local currency basis, including more than 20% in Latin America and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and growth in the mid-teens in Europe.","Let's turn to Page 5. Here you can see processed transactions growing 13% globally to more than $10.4 billion. We saw double-digit growth in most regions around the world with particular strength in our Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa region, driven by Australia and South Africa. And compared to last quarter, this growth rate was down slightly. However, when normalizing for the number of processing days, processed transaction growth for the fourth quarter was similar to what we saw in the third quarter.","Globally, the number of cards grew 9% to almost 2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.","Now let's turn to Page 6 for some insights on our revenue. We're very pleased with the 15% growth in gross revenues, which was in line with our expectations and driven by increased volume and transactions, along with some contribution from pricing. In addition, beyond the 2 functional currencies that we adjust for, revenues were slightly impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the euro versus other currencies.","However, net revenue growth of 11% came in a bit lower than expected as a result of signing more deals in the quarter, which Ajay already called out. So the rebates and incentives line increased by 23%, but we view this as a good thing for long-term revenue growth.","Growth in domestic assessments continues to be driven primarily by stronger volume growth outside of the United States, much of which comes at a lower yield.","And one last note on revenue. Excluding pricing, cross-border revenue growth was 12%. The resulting GAAP between cross-border volume and revenue growth continued to be mainly due to the higher mix of intra-Europe activity.","Moving on to Page 7. You can see that total operating expenses were up 11% in the quarter as we took the opportunity to reinvest more back into the business, similar to what we did actually in the third quarter.","First, the 12% increase in G&A expenses continues to be primarily driven by investments related to all aspects of our growth strategy, including initiatives such as MasterPass and tokenization.","Part of our investment was in people, and we ended 2013 with approximately 8,200 full-time employees, up 9% from year-end 2012. And what's more interesting is that the people that we've been hiring for the last couple of years are coming from sectors such as technology, retail, consumer goods and government, which has been helping us to execute in these areas.","Second, advertising and marketing was up by 8% mainly due to higher customer marketing support and media spend. And while not on these slides, I would like to note that the other income-expense line was $9 million negative, i.e., it was an expense, in line with our expectations and primarily due to a number of our joint ventures, such as the 2 with Telef\u00f3nica. As we ramp up these initiatives, you can expect this line to continue to be negative.","Let me now turn to Slide 8, and here we discuss first what we have seen in January through this past Tuesday. Each of our business drivers were flat but slightly higher in the period compared to the fourth quarter. So the numbers through January 28 are as follow. Globally, our cross-border volumes grew about 18%, and that's about equal to our fourth quarter growth rate. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 9%, about 1 percentage point up from what we saw last quarter, due to improvements in consumer credit. Processed volume growth outside of the U.S. grew 17%, and that's also a slight increase over the fourth quarter. In particular, our European processed volume growth was in the teens, a continuation of the growth rate that we saw throughout 2013. Globally, processed transaction growth was 14%, and that was also up about 1 percentage point over what we saw as a growth rate in the fourth quarter, driven by higher growth in the U.S. and in Europe.","Looking forward, let me first start with our long-term performance objectives for the 2013 to 2015 period.","We remain confident that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR, which includes a modest contribution from pricing over the 3-year period, and an at least 20% EPS CAGR. These growth rates are on a constant currency basis and exclude new M&A activities. We also remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%.","Now just one other comment about our EPS CAGR objective, which we said was based on a normalized tax rate that excluded the impact of several onetime benefits that we were able to achieve in 2012, which, you will recall, resulted in a pro forma EPS number of $21.44. But after adjusting for our recent stock split, you should now be modeling EPS growth beyond 2012 using a base of $2.14.","So now, I'd like to share with you some thoughts about 2014. With respect to net revenue, we have signed, as you just heard, a significant number of deals over the last couple of years. And as the new deals onboard, they will provide a tailwind for 2014. However, we are also expecting a headwind from 1 portfolio conversion to a competitor. As you all know, back in 2012, we lost our portion of Chase's consumer credit portfolio. And while we expected some attrition would occur in 2013, that did not happen. We don't have any specifics on how these cards will migrate, but we are now assuming an impact in 2014. Given the size of this portfolio, we can offset some, but not all, of this attrition with our wins and, as we expect, net revenue growth for 2014 to come in at the lower end of our 3-year range.","We also expect to return to more normal growth rates in rebates and incentives in the second and third quarter this year versus what we saw in 2013.","We anticipate total 2014 operating expenses to grow less than the 9% that we saw in 2013.","As we have always said, any upside to top line growth may provide the opportunity to reinvest more back into the business as well as determine how much, if any, operating margin expansion we can deliver in 2014.","As I just mentioned, the impact of new M&A activities is not reflected in our long-term performance objectives. At Investor Day last September, I talked about how we are looking more actively at potential M&A opportunities that address our strategic priorities and provide us with critical capabilities. We're pleased that we recently completed the Provus and HomeSend deals, both investments that add to our capabilities. And they will contribute some revenue, but together with their base expenses and our integration work, we expect to see $0.01 to $0.02 dilution to our 2014 earnings per share figure. We will continue to update you as we go forward on these numbers as well as on the impact of any additional M&A activities we may have.","For your modeling purposes, you should assume a full year tax rate of about 32%, which does not recognize the impact of any discrete item such as what we've seen in the recent past.","Finally, with respect to foreign exchange, if rates remain similar to where they are today, with the euro trading at about the 1.35 level and the Brazilian real at about the 2.42 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and the real would essentially offset each other for full year 2014. And as I mentioned earlier, foreign exchange had a slight impact on our fourth quarter beyond adjusting for these 2 functional currencies that we typically call out.","Given the current volatility in the FX market, especially with an appreciating U.S. dollar and euro versus other currencies, we're carefully managing those exposures, but we could see some impact depending on how these currencies behave in 2014.","Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin our Q&A session. Barbara?","Barbara L. Gasper","Thank you, Martina. [Operator Instructions] Clifford?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Brendler from Stifel.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a little color on the progression in 2014 of the cross-border price increase? I think you mentioned still about 1,000 basis points of benefit on your cross-border revenue growth. When does it start to anniversary? And is there any limiting impact from additional price increases on your cross-border revenue growth?","Martina Hund-Mejean","So Chris, we put the cross-border acquiring price increase in place in April 2013. So you will see that basically anniversary in our -- also at the end of the first quarter of 2014.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Any additional pricing actions that could mitigate that?","Martina Hund-Mejean","No. I said as part of our long-term objectives, you will only see some modest pricing. So this is still a big one that is basically going to anniversary.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - CLSA Limited, Research Division","The advertising and marketing, can you just provide some additional color on what drove that number up in the fourth quarter, what opportunities you saw? And does the Chase deal include the same kind of network separation as you're seeing from Visa?","Ajaypal S. Banga","It's Ajay. I'm not sure I understood the second part. If you are talking about the Chase commercial deal, and that's just a regular deal like we would do with any other institution in our commercial business. So that's how that's done. The part of our advertising and marketing, actually the fourth quarter has been the maximum transactions occur across most parts of the world. And we've been trying for some time to get our advertising and marketing to fit and match the right time periods for when it should be correlated to our transaction spend. And it kind of depends how it works. In some cases, you get the right opportunities. In others we didn't. In this particular one, we got a great deal of opportunity around the end of the year to sign up a few things, to participate in activities in social media and physical media around the New Year in different places. So it gave us a chance to put ourselves back into people's eyes and minds at the right time of the year. That's kind of what that is about. So it wasn't out of normal -- if you look at our fourth quarter spend on advertising and marketing. We should be spending this kind of money to correlate back to the kind of revenues and transactions that happened in the fourth quarter, gross revenues.","Martina Hund-Mejean","And let me just add a comment to 2014 because I'm sure everyone of you would like to know a little bit about the cadence of our A&M spend. And the cadence will be relatively similar to what you saw in 2013. The only thing that we're trying to do, and Ajay had","already referenced that, is maybe smooth out a little bit the first and the second quarter. So you might see a little bit more in the first quarter when we're talking just a bit more, taking it out of the fourth quarter. The second and the third quarter should be, from a cadence point of view, very similar.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So can we just get a little bit color and clarity on the full year 2014 rebates? I mean, do you think they'll be -- will they grow faster, slower or about in line versus gross revs? And do you guys think you can grow U.S. consumer credit in '14 with the Chase volumes coming off that you mentioned?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Well -- so first of all, with your last question, we are obviously growing credit because, otherwise, we wouldn't be able to offset some of the losses that we might see from the Chase portfolio in 2014, right? That was in my prepared remarks. What was your first question?","Ajaypal S. Banga","On rebates and incentives in 2014.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, rebates and incentives. So let me just tell you, rebates and incentives, we think that is -- from a cadence point of view, it's going to go back much more normal to what we have seen prior to 2013, right? So in the second quarter and then the third quarter, you see normalized growth rates. It's very tough for us to be telling you what you should be thinking about as a percentage of growth revenues. But I would -- when I look forward, I would look -- it's something not too different to what you saw in 2013, which would also suggest that, overall, the annual growth rate is not too different for 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura Securities.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","In Europe, you guys are significantly outperforming one of your key competitors who's still operating under an association structure, and it seems like you're able to offer much greater value to both banks and merchants given your much more innovative offerings. Can you talk a little bit about your confidence and your outlook for market share gains in Europe, and perhaps just give us some color around, competitively, how you feel you're positioned there?","Ajaypal S. Banga","So we -- look, we enjoy our position in Europe. And I've said a few times that I actually consider Europe to be a decent growth market for our company, even the developed markets of Western Europe, primarily because of the relatively high levels of cash that still exists in some of those economies. If you take out the Nordics, where cash is actually very small. If you come to Germany or France, there's still an overwhelming majority that's in cash, and those are very attractive markets. We have a good position. We've been gaining shares, that's absolutely correct. We're doing a lot of things with data analytics, with contactless, with fraud early warning systems, with inControl. And so all those help us win deals. And now, we're focused on trying to process more and more of the transactions in Europe as we go along. So even this quarter, our processed transactions grew by 14% or so in Europe, in SEPA. So that's a good thing for us. And we're focused on that. And a lot of the work we're doing with Provus and TREVICA are all aligned around that set aspect. So between digital and advisors and data, in addition to what we already do in our core business, we have a decent line of sight to where Europe is going. But Europe is not without its challenges. It has regulatory challenges that are unique to the way Europe is constructed and the way it functions. And I talked a little bit about those in the form of the EC legislation as well as this recent ruling by the AG [ph]. The AG ruling doesn't impact anything directly because the raise [ph] is already there. But could that spill over tomorrow into some other way of looking at regulatory arbitrage or thinking in that space in Europe? Sure, it could. And that's something we are always conscious of. And we're always trying to make sure that we work well within that environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you maybe give us a little bit about that kind of give-and-take between the 2 pieces of the Chase relationship, like how do you see the growth on the commercial side versus the -- kind of the risk of kind of deconsolidation on the consumer side?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Tough to say, because I really can't give you that much detailed information about one set of clients and books. But you should know that Chase is a very, very large consumer bank with a very large consumer portfolio. And they've got a strong corporate banking business that's growing, but there's no way that those 2 are comparable. So I don't see us making up what we are losing in the consumer side if it goes away in 2014. I have no way to estimate what will happen. I'm kind of assuming it's going away. And I've heard the earnings call that VISA had, where they talked about getting it. So I'm assuming that they're both thinking similarly, that 2014 is the year that it goes from us to them. Sidemark [ph] you're going to make up for that, but it will help, just as all the co-brands will help. And there are co-brands that we haven't been able to announce because of certain circumstances with those retailers and those issuers, which will all become clearer to you over the next few months. So I'm hoping that we'll eventually come up in the right place. But 2014 is going to be the year of transition. We've tried to factor that in when Martina said that we think revenue could be at the lower end of our long-term guidance. Now if it comes in better, that'll be great because if the attrition is slower or these co-brands come on quicker, that'll be great as well. But typically, our co-brands, after we announce it, takes somewhere between 1 year and 1.5 years to start onboarding and kicking in. So there's a timeline in our business and that's what we are providing for. Look, underlying trends in our business in the U.S. and elsewhere have been good in our fourth quarter. Our growth revenue actually came in better than our plan. And what happened is that we signed more deals and I'm actually happy to sign those deals. And so that's what I'm thinking about this whole circumstance around how to think about where our revenues and our company is going over the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on some of your macro discussion, Ajay with -- when I look at the payments volume, the purchase volume by region, there's a decent slowing in pretty much every market except for Latin America. And I mean, I think you were suggesting that you thought you were seeing a little more strength incrementally. I guess the January numbers do suggest that you see a pickup from the fourth quarter. But do you think -- I mean, given the slowdown that you see across the board in payment and purchase volume, doesn't that suggest that the economy at best is stable and, at worst, maybe we're seeing a little bit of a global weakening?","Ajaypal S. Banga","I actually don't see it that way. I see the U.S. as -- if you just look at the U.S. as a whole, if you look at the drags on U.S. economic growth that contributed to whatever happened in 2013, and 2013 turned out to end in a stronger way than people expected. So there were lots of drags, a lot of drags from the sequester to all the other kinds of stuff that happened there. So I don't see the U.S. as being slowing in any way. I see it improving. Actually Europe, showing signs of life as well. Northern Europe, even the U.K., which 1 year ago people talked about as being in very difficult and dire circumstances, has clearly showed a recovery in where it's headed. That brings us to Asia. And Asia is dominated by what happens between China, Japan, Australia and India. And if you think about China -- yes, China's growth has slowed, but China's growth has slowed first in domestic expenditure, which impacts us very little because we don't get to play in the domestic processing yet, right? Japan is actually beginning to show signs of life. Australia depends a great deal on what happens with China because Australia's economy relies a great deal on the exports into China. And India is just India. India is being India right now. It's going through all that it's doing with its elections and all that's -- underlying it. But India's economy is 2\/3 consumption. And that consumption is still growing. And while China and India may be growing slower than in the past, they're still growing in very attractive numbers beyond the 10. So yes -- perhaps the question about slowdown, you got to remember the number of days in the fourth quarter, the number of processing days. And Martina went a couple of times to explain that if you took out the impact of the smaller number of days and look at the normalized data, you will find this kind of similar growth. But if you went to Asia and you went back 4 quarters in Asia, you would find Asia today is a little slower in PCE growth than it was 4 quarters ago. That's what I'm addressing when talking to you. I'm not addressing the specifics of the processed transactions, because I think Martina addressed those a couple of times in her opening remarks.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two questions. First, Martina, you said that OpEx would probably grow a little less than 9% this year. Can you give us a sense of where you might have the most operating leverage this year?","Martina Hund-Mejean","So David, what we are doing is -- I didn't say a little less, I actually said less than 9%. There is a little bit of a difference on those kind of numbers. And what we are really doing is, as we said, we opportunistically put some more money into the business in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And when we look at our budget going forward, we are not assuming that we are going to have a repeat of that. But as we have said before, depending on how our top line will develop, right, and our top line is subject to what we just discussed on the potential migration of cards from the Chase portfolio, we might be putting extra money into the company if we can do it, okay? But it all depends on how we see the top line developing and the bottom. So at this point in time, the budget basically just said operating expenses will grow less than 9%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to dive a little deeper on the underlying trends in volume, and we saw in the fourth quarter the trend shifts from about 9% down to 7.5% and back to 9% again, you're saying, in January. If you could just explain a little bit about what's driving that first? And then really going forward, I mean, we're seeing underlying standards loosen a little more at the banks, which I think should support more credit growth going forward as well. And when you couple that with the trends you're talking about with all these deals, does that -- is that helpful for you on pricing? If Chase comes off, I imagine the pricing on that, given the size was a little bit tougher than what you're bringing on, is that a fair way to look at that? And then just one quick follow-up, what drove other revenues up 22%?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Okay. Let me take the easy one first, which is what drove other revenues up. Other revenues were predominantly driven by our advisors' revenues as well as Access Prepaid. So the other things that we are really focusing on from a service point of view, and Ajay had already said something that we are really focusing on putting advisors out on the globe. And you're actually seeing a really great benefit from that and that's why you see a 20% increase in other revenues going up.","Ajaypal S. Banga","That tends to be fee-based revenues, just to be clear.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, yes. Not volume or transaction-based, this is all fee-based revenues, right? Darrin, you are asking us one tough question on the underlying trends, okay? In terms of really figuring out why a quarter moves up or down from 1 or 2 percentage points is pretty tough to do. All we can say is when we triangulated with the data that Ajay was already referencing, from a GDP and from a PCE number, that we actually felt that the fourth quarter, both in the United States as well as in Europe, was pretty healthy, okay? So even though we had some move in the growth numbers, it was pretty healthy. And you could see that on the credit side and you could see that on the debit side. Now Latin America, Asia Pacific, we know that there was some impact, given what is happening from a China production point of view. And hopefully, if the world gets into a better footing, that will resolve itself. But it's very tough to be putting that down to very specific changes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So just quickly, on the G&A, you mentioned, Ajay, MasterPass and tokenization were 2 of the key reasons for that to be up. But there's a lot of incremental people that have put into that, and that seems to be disproportionate for those kinds of technologies. So I'm wondering is this back half kind of ramp, let's call it $161 million or so, is that a function of also putting more feet on the street with these deals that you've done in order to get the local market processing?","Ajaypal S. Banga","So we are adding people in different areas. It's not just in MasterPass and tokenization, although that did add a fair number of engineers and development teams. But we are adding people in sales. We're adding people in client delivery. We've added people in product management. And when we open new countries -- China has people in the control functions, so they open in a way that is well handled for the future. That kind of -- all those things add up. We have opened a number of new offices around the world as well over the last couple of years. All that tends to add up. What we're really doing is adding people who bring to us a different perspective on how we look at our business. So we're adding people not just from banking and consulting, although that still is a good source of people, we're also adding people from consumer product companies and from technology companies and from marketing organizations and from government background and experience. So when you pull all of that together, that's the kind of people we're adding. It's not anything specific in the fourth quarter or in the third quarter or the second quarter. We've been adding people consistently over the last couple of years, as we've tried to create the ability for us to have the right footprint and the right infrastructure to go into so many new areas. So when you see us talk about advisors and generating fee revenues from advisors, I can't get them without a certain quantum of people, to have feet on the street as well as people who are doing analytics. When you talk about Access Prepaid Worldwide, that didn't exist in our book a couple of years back. So when you sort of add all that together, our company is changing and morphing. And in that change and morph, what I'm trying to do is to maintain our operating margin at a very healthy level, but put money back into building the skills, capabilities and technologies that is going to be required for this digital physical convergence, combined with the data opportunity that our company is talking about. So that's kind of what I'm trying to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie.","Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research","I wonder if could you give us a sense, just the uptick in data breaches, how that's impacting the value proposition as you go out to clients, and ultimately, what's been the feedback on that?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Great question. Right now, fortunately, I haven't seen a great deal of impact coming out of that. And as we just told you, our first few days of January looked like they're actually a little better than the quarter that went by or similar. It's a little better in some cases. But there's no one specific data breach that causes trouble. It's an ongoing feeling that consumers get about their safety and the security of their information. And these recent data breaches are not just about cards, they were about other consumer data, tens of millions of stuff that went away. And that creates its own angst in everyone's mind. Fortunately, our technology, the technology of our competitor networks, combined with some of the great tools that the banks and merchants have built along with us over the years has meant that people are trying to keep fraud under control and trying to help the consumer. So I'm really -- that's less of the issue. I'm far more concerned about getting the right things done so we get ahead of this as we go forward. Otherwise, they're going to have this keep coming. And it -- the more often it happens, the worse it feels. So that's what I'm looking at. And it's not about who did what and it's not about finger-pointing, and it's not about I said this and they said that. I really want to get past all that nonsense to the real stuff which is, we need to get EMV in place. In January, Chris McWilton issued a letter to all our issuers and the merchant partners saying, \"We are standing by our deadline.\" We need to get this going and everyone needs to be on the bandwagon. Banks need to be there, merchants need to be there, governments are clearly there. We need to get the networks there and the acquirers there. And I think there is a lot of progress on that front. I know a large number of the big merchants are very committed to -- they have new terminals and new terminalization. I know that the terminal manufacturers have geared up for that. I know that a number of the banks have begun to issue chip cards already. You can see people are making all the right efforts. This should only redouble our desire to get this done quickly. That's what I'm talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the Chase migration. Has Chase told you guys how much to expect to come off and when? Because I'm just trying to figure out how much...","Ajaypal S. Banga","No. No.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Bryan, no. That's why we said that we are assuming some impact in 2014. And I actually said that we assume that something would have happened in 2013 and it did not.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just how much are you expecting in 2014, like 2 to 4 points of revenue or how much?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Good try. Good try. I can give you marks for trying.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I wanted to ask -- getting back to the fraud issue. With your experience and what you've seen around the world, the move to EMV, how significant is that in reducing the -- either the sorts of things you've had in the United States or just really the fraud that existed in places like Europe, before they went to EMV, or even Canada?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Very significant. It's very significant to the views of the impact of breaches. Look, every time a chip card is used, it uses the technology inside to create a unique data point for that transaction. That kind of bolsters the security and the certainty of that transaction. That's why chip transactions are virtually impossible to fraudulently replicate. And of course, because the darn chip is there, it makes it hard to counterfeit the card in the first place. So if I say it differently, EMV would not prevent a data breach. I mean, look, in the Target case, there were stuff with cards, there were stuff with data that happened in the Target system. EMV is not going to protect from that data breach. What it will do it makes that -- any data stolen, much, much, much less valuable to a fraudster because it's tough to counterfeit the card and it's almost impossible to duplicate all the unique data that flows for that transaction to get approved. So it's kind of got double layers of protection inside it. That's what it's about. But you need to understand that while it's good in addressing counterfeit fraud, it's not the only solution, a lot of single solution to drive security in the payment space. There's going to be a ton of things that will happen with how data is secured, how it's kept, how it's encrypted in motion and address things that we all do, things that very often -- you cannot expect small merchants to do in the same way, or smaller acquirers to do in the same way. That's one of the reasons why, in the future, with digital technology, tokenization is actually a key because in tokenization, that data doesn't even go to be stored in that location. It's encrypted with a key that only the networks and the banks recognize. And therefore, the concept of that data line in the weakest link in the chain will go away. So it's both EMV, tokenization, fraud tools, all the things that are going on. It's not one thing, but EMV is a really big arrow in the quiver.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You've pointed out on a number of occasions that you're moving into processing. I would like to ask specifically what you see as the strategic imperative and the financial implications beyond the EPS solution that Martina mentioned, as you are looking at the issuer and acquirer processing?","Ajaypal S. Banga","So the strategic implications really are back to what Gary and all of us talked about it on the Investor Day. If you -- of course, obviously, if you switched the transaction, as you know, we only get to do a little, around 50% of our transactions. And I'd love to be able to get beyond that because as you switch the transaction, first of all, it will be much stronger position in the system. Second, you'll see all aspects of it coming and going. And if you -- in addition, even if you don't switch it but you see it pass through, because you're either helping the acquirers process or helping the issuers process, then you'd still have a lot of data that you can then use for developing fraud scores, behavioral scores, the advisor's fee revenue, all that kind of stuff. So getting in front or behind of the transaction is useful for someone like us. I don't want to be just a payment switch, that's not the business that, long term, can give us the ability. And by long term, I mean out a decade. I'm not -- I'm trying to be more than that. I want to be using our data to create the right revenue streams from data. I want to be able to use in the digital world all the things we can do from before, during and after the payment. You can't do all that if you aren't a little smarter about processing. So that's what we're trying to do. Now in countries like the United States and Brazil, we process almost all of our transactions. However, when you get into some of the emerging markets and, of course, as you know, in China, we don't process domestic transactions. When you get to places in the emerging markets or the high-growth markets in Europe, that's where these things can help us. And as you know, SEPA opened up the ability for us to reenter the processing market in the developed countries of Europe, which we are trying our best to do and they're making very steady progress on that as well. So it's a long way to answer -- that being in the center of the transaction and being there before, during and after the transaction, being on both sides of it are very, very useful for this company.","Martina Hund-Mejean","And just add to this, we already own a processor in Poland, which is called TREVICA, and now we are owning the processor, the independent processor in Turkey, Provus. And when you look at these processes on an isolated basis, of course, they have a lower margin profile than our business. But when we found that all the work that we did around TREVICA in the last couple of years that, that really helps our main business and that we are able to win deals, that the deals are more sticky and that we're actually able to give more services to the client because we actually saw the transaction. So we really think, from a strategic and from a financial point of view, this is a very good way to go.","Barbara L. Gasper","Before we take the next question, I just got an email from somebody in our fraud area. And going back to Chris' question about how significant has EMV been in reducing fraud when it's been adopted? We have seen anywhere between 60% and 80% decrease in counterfeit fraud after EMV has been installed in markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Can you just clarify, the Chase consumer portfolio, you're talking about the old continental co-brand program or it's something else?","Martina Hund-Mejean","No. We're talking about the entire Chase consumer portfolio. Continental co-brand is different.","Ajaypal S. Banga","Continental co-brand actually has a lot -- has cards that are issued on MasterCard are protected for the life of those cards. That's different. But when Chase did the relationship that they did with VISA on the network, at that time, one of the items that VISA and Chase both announced was this migration of the consumer book inside of Chase, the rest of it, to our competitor. It didn't happen in 2013. That's what we're referring to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I don't want to -- mean to beat the dead horse, but I just want to make sure I understand the Chase assumption that you guys are making. For 2014, you're basically assuming some piece of that goes away and there may be residual impacts as we look out to 2015 and onwards?","Ajaypal S. Banga","No. I'm assuming that it goes away in 2014. And by the way, who did you call a dead horse?","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan from Janney.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","A close look on EMV, we -- I think people are aware that it reduces counterfeit fraud, but fraud migrates to the online channel. I'm just wondering if the tokenization efforts that you're working on, are they going to be packaged with any EMV implementation? Because currently, it doesn't really address that, and that's what I think merchants are kind of digging their heels on. They want some sun or line of sight into protecting the online as well.","Ajaypal S. Banga","Yes, absolutely, that's what we're doing with tokenization, and that's exactly why we're at it. And we're actually hopeful that it will all get done and start being out there in the marketplace, as we said, sometime in 2014, and then it'll keep rolling along from there. And it's going to accept everything from secured elements to SIM-based solutions to other kind of efforts to get secured information into MasterPass and the tokenization. We are very committed to that.","Operator","Our last question comes from Don Fandetti from Citi.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Ajay, just to kind of wrap up on the strategic side. We've seen Apple and Amazon talk a little bit more about payments. I was just curious what your perspective is, how that might change up the payment landscape and is it sort of in line with your expectation and timeline of what those companies might be doing?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Sure. Don, thank you. I actually -- it's actually what I expected. You all know that they're all thinking about this. And the fact that Google is out there first and actually doing something, doesn't mean that the others weren't working on it. They're all working on it. And they're all trying to figure out what the right role to play for their respective strengths and weaknesses are, as this payment opportunity evolves. And it's not just payments. When you talk to most of them, they will tell you it's about the before, during and after the transaction. So Google tends to think about it as a metric to look at enhancing their advertising and consumer outreach business, not really as a payments business. Others think differently. And everybody comes in from a different perspective. So that's why what we're trying to do is to partner with as many of them as we can. And we've managed, I think, well to shift the dialogue from one of distant mediation to one of partnership, because we bring some very strong assets to the table in terms of what we haven't possess and also what we're investing in. And so that's kind of where they're going with it. That's our -- I'm not the least surprised. I believe it's the right thing to do anyway with all the strong players in the digital world. We'll have a role to play in some way to enable payments for their consumers. It's the right thing to do.","So let me leave you with a few closing thoughts. We had a very good 2013. We delivered on our expectations. We saw strong revenue and EPS growth. We continued to invest back into our products, our technology and our people.","Overall, it seems like the economic environment is improving, especially in the U.S. and Europe. I understand that emerging markets are going through a bumpy patch, which we will continue to watch. But remember, they are starting in a much better place than they were in previous crises. And so I believe that over a period of time, that should stabilize.","Now looking ahead, for the next couple of years, the world generally seems to be headed towards a better economic cycle than what we have seen in the recent past. And I hope those are not famous last words, \"That's kind of where my head is.\"","Our business continues to have strong momentum as it shows in our GDV and our gross revenue numbers in the fourth quarter. We are focused on driving the conversion from cash to electronic payments and at the same time, very, very focused on creating solutions and working with governments and other partners to advance financial inclusion.","Investing in our core solutions remains important. So we're making investments in new products as well, in new services and new capabilities, all of which will help expand our presence in the area around payments as well, not just the payments but before, during and after. And for sure, we will continue our efforts to ensure that we make the best possible impact on ensuring safety and security for everyone in the physical payment space while carrying those competencies into the digital world as the 2 invariably converge over the next few years.","So thank you for your support, and thank you for joining us on today's call.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard first quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Warren Kneeshaw - MasterCard, Inc.","Thank you, Shelby, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the question-and-answer session. It is only then that the queue will open to accept registrations.","You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data, and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. We hope you find the enhancements we have introduced to some of these materials helpful.","Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a currency-neutral basis and exclude special items and the impact of acquisitions unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents.","As a reminder, we've added a table at the end of both documents which provide additional information about the impact of Article 8 of the EU's payments regulation [PSD2] on our GDV and purchase volume growth rates.

Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that, I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga. Ajay?","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","Thank you, Warren, and good morning, everybody.","We're off to a very good start this year. Net revenues are up 12%, EPS up 17% versus a year ago. We're also very pleased to announce that we have completed two acquisitions over the past month or so at VocaLink and NuData Security, which both complement our efforts to participate in new payment flows and enhance our safety and security offerings.","We believe that the future of payments is going to be defined by, first of all, choice, convenience, and security. And if you build a strong business based on innovation and scale in card-based retail payments, that we know, VocaLink adds key platforms to that foundation, including the technology behind the BACS ACH payments system, the real-time account-to-account Faster Payments service, and the LINK ATM network in the UK.","This combination will enable us to take a more holistic approach to retail, P2P, and B2B payments. In particular, the potential of Fast ACH is growing in the U.S., in Europe, and actually in other markets around the world. VocaLink has been successful in deploying Fast ACH in both developed and emerging markets.","Leveraging our broad footprint and our expertise, what we are planning to do is to scale VocaLink's capabilities and enhance the value of each transaction with the robust set of services that we provide. And as we execute, our customers will be able to turn to one partner to address their payment needs across the whole spectrum, from cards to ACH, and thereby further enabling the shift from cash and check to electronic forms of payments.","We also acquired NuData Security, whose technology helps businesses detect and prevent online and mobile fraud based on understanding how end users interact with devices. I'll give you an example. The technology can determine how fast a password is typed or the way a user holds a smartphone to help distinguish authentic users from potential fraudsters. The technology assesses scores and learns from each transaction to help merchants and issuers make near real-time authorization decisions. And as the Internet of Things continues to grow with whose ever estimate you believe, it could be up to 50 billion connected devices by 2020, the point here is integrating NuData's technology into our layered security strategy will help consumers pay safely and conveniently however and whenever they choose to do so.","So I'd like to welcome each of our new colleagues from these two companies to our family. We are looking forward to working together as we pursue the many opportunities that lie ahead.","Now turning to the economy, broadly speaking, not much has changed since the last quarter. We've seen modest pickup in global growth, in part due to market-specific fiscal stimulus, although uncertainty about the direction of trade policies continues to be a concern. In the U.S., consumer and business confidence remained strong. Employment is rising. Wages are beginning to increase.","And based on our own SpendingPulse report, which as you all know, includes not just Mastercard spend data but a broader spectrum of retail spend across all payment types, Q1 retail sales in SpendingPulse excluding auto were up 3.9% versus a year ago. Gas is about 1 percentage point of that increase. Like you, we're still waiting for tax, trade, and infrastructure policy initiatives to come to fruition.","In Latin America, Brazil is showing signs of emerging from its two-year recession, and we continue to see modest growth in Europe with the unemployment rate nearing a 9-year low. Germany remains solid. There's slower growth in the UK, Italy, and France, driven by rising inflation and some uncertainty around the impact of Brexit negotiations. Regarding travel, we are seeing increased inbound traffic into the UK due to the weaker pound. However, outbound consumer spend has declined in the case of the UK.","In Asia, despite some ongoing uncertainty in China, economic indicators show high consumer and business confidence with moderate economic growth, and India's growth continues to be strong. We're working collaboratively with the government there to support electronic acceptance as part of its demonetization efforts. That's a good step towards achieving the long-term opportunity in India. Much work remains to be done there over the next few years.","Meanwhile, we just continue to drive double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. They're performing well against our plan, and our strong business fundamentals position us well for continuing long-term growth.","And this quarter, we gained momentum in core credit, debit, prepaid, and commercial businesses by winning new programs. We extended some existing relationships, and we optimized the value of some of our current portfolios. So let me start with credit and debit and give you a few examples.","We renewed a number of exclusive agreements with key partners in the U.S., including Capital One, for their signature debit card business and Bank of the West for their consumer credit, debit, and small business portfolios. We also renewed our consumer and commercial credit relationship with Citizens Bank. We're actually highly engaged with them in delivering value-added services, smart data, inControl fraud tools, consulting, Rewards being examples.","We've expanded some strong partnerships like those with Ita\u00fa in Brazil. We're actually launching a new co-branded credit card program with Ita\u00fa and Multiplus, which is a loyalty points provider and partner of LATAM Airlines. That secures Mastercard's leading position in that market with airline co-brands.","Across Europe, our momentum continues. The larger banks, as you all know, are for the most part dual-issuance banks in their home countries, and what we're doing there is gaining share within their businesses. In addition, a number of the smaller and medium-sized banks have signed some interesting deals with us. A couple of examples include AvantCard, which is a consumer credit flip that increases Mastercard's market share in Ireland, and Bank Van Breda, which is a consumer and commercial win in Belgium.","China, we await clarity there still on the requirements for domestic switching. Our local team continues to win a number of single-branded card programs in China. Again, one example from this quarter is ICBC, where we are building on that existing relationship to launch an exclusive co-branded card program with China's second largest online travel agency.","So prepaid, there we're the leader globally in prepaid, and we continue to make strides with new product launches. We closed deals in every region in this quarter. What we're doing there is also to pursue some key verticals like travel, leveraging our cross-border prepaid program management capabilities that some of you will remember we acquired from Travelex a few years ago.","You heard me call out some of our initiatives there before, but let me add a couple of recent examples. Cash Passport is a multicurrency prepaid card program. We have launched it in 13 countries around the world. With Cash Passport cards, what travelers can do is they can load up to seven currencies at a time and then use the card at ATMs and POS merchant locations. This quarter, we announced an expansion of the program, the Cash Passport program, with Canada Post as a new distribution partner through its thousands of locations.","And then to give our issuers the ability to offer exclusive benefits and features to their customers traveling abroad, we have developed a Mastercard Platinum prepaid travel card, which stores balances in multiple currencies, locks in the exchange rate before you travel, and provides Platinum extras like free Wi-Fi and merchant offers and transaction alerts. We went live with Travelex in the UK this quarter with this product. The product was already available to prepaid issuers in Brazil and several countries in the Middle East over the last year or two.","Now moving on to the digital space, we have continued momentum with Masterpass through our Digital by Default strategy. We've added more banks this quarter, BMO Harris in the U.S., LaCaixa in Spain, to reach over 85 million enabled accounts. On the merchant acceptance front, we're continuing to add new partners like Expedia as well as Sage, which in turn brings us 10,000 small and medium-sized merchants. The idea is to create a variety of options for consumers to shop efficiently and safely online.","And building on our recent announcement from Masterpass QR with Ecobank in Nigeria, we're now rolling it out to multiple markets in the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. In India, we worked with the government and payment industry to develop and launch Bharat QR, which is an interoperable QR code acceptance solution, basically simplifying the ability for small and micro merchants across the country to get into the electronic payments system in a cost-effective way. Masterpass QR is just one of the many APIs available to our partners within the Mastercard Developers Platform. The idea is to make it easy for them to integrate with Mastercard technology and services.","Facebook Messenger bots also leverage Mastercard's APIs. They're now live with Fresh Direct, Subway and the Cheesecake Factory in the U.S. And as we discussed when we introduced our plans for the Facebook bots, they use artificial intelligence to enable consumers to interact with these merchants to build their orders and then, of course, securely check out via Masterpass, but the interesting thing is all this without leaving the Messenger platform.","We're also connecting our customers for digital payments through our processing services. I'll give you a very good example. Recently, we signed a new multiyear deal with General Motors for Mastercard Payment Gateway Services to enable safe and secure online transactions across GM's network of 4,400 dealers and a number of service providers and various GM business units in North America.","We're doing all this and continuing to innovate in safety and security. And this quarter, Mastercard and Samsung announced the world's first authentication technology using iris scanning to verify online purchases on a mobile phone. Mastercard Identity Check or, as everybody else calls it, selfie-pay, will use this iris scanning technology as well alongside the photo biometric when it's implemented on the Galaxy S8 later this year.","We also recently announced the first biometric card, which combines chip technology with fingerprint scans directly on the card. And that technology can be compared to do what many of us do today when you unlock your smartphone. It's now being used to verify a cardholder's identity for in-store purchases at any EMV terminal. We have just finished successful trials in South Africa with a leading supermarket retailer and a bank. We expect trials in Europe and Asia in the coming months.","So whether it's the use of tokens and digital wallets or it's innovating in biometrics and artificial intelligence, our technology is helping to drive a seamless, convenient, and secure customer experience as part of our goal to make every transaction safer, simpler, and smarter than ever before.","And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would also like to extend a warm welcome to both the VocaLink and NuData teams.","Turning to our financial metrics, starting on page 3, you will see we have delivered another strong quarter. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out will be on a currency-neutral basis excluding a special item related to the Canadian merchant litigation provision. And as you can see, there was almost no impact from FX on our numbers.","Net revenue growth was 12% year over year and came ahead of our expectations due to healthy volume and transaction growth and a slightly better than expected FX environment. Operating expenses increased by 11% and operating income grew 13%. EPS was $1.01, up 17% year over year, driven primarily by our strong operating performance, with share repurchases contributing $0.03 per share.","During the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion worth of stock and an additional $272 million through April 27. In addition, the effective tax rate was lower this quarter when compared to the same period last year, primarily due to more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings.","So let me turn to page 4, where you can see the solid operating metrics for the first quarter. When normalized for last year's leap day, all of our metrics would have been up by roughly another 1 ppt (sic) [Percentage Point].","Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 8% on a local currency basis, the same as last quarter. U.S. GDV grew 2% and was made up of credit growth of 5%, while debit was essentially flat when normalized for the leap day effect. Outside of the U.S., volume grew 11%, led by higher growth in Canada and Latin America, with Brazil in particular.","Cross-border volume grew at a very healthy 13% on a local currency basis, the same growth rate as last quarter. We continue to see strength in Europe and Latin America, which was partially offset by weakness from oil-producing countries in the Middle East.","Turning to page 5, we continue to see very good growth in switched transactions of 17% globally to 14.7 billion, with strong double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S. In particular, we saw strength in Brazil, Russia, and India. And globally, there are 2.4 billion Mastercard-branded cards issued.","Now let me turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue grew 12%, driven by continued strong transaction and volume growth as well as our services offerings.","Looking at the individual revenue line items, the difference between fees charged and volumes in the domestic assessment and cross-border categories is mainly due to pricing, which is essentially offset in rebates and incentives as well as some mix. Domestic assessments grew 15% while worldwide GDV grew 8%. Cross-border volume fees grew 17% while cross-border volume grew 13%. Transaction processing revenue grew 16%, in line with the 17% growth we saw in switched transactions.","And finally, other revenue grew 12%, driven primarily by Advisors and our safety and security services. This growth rate was lower than our recent trend and would have been 18% had it not been for two factors related to our loyalty business in Asia. First, we are in the process of restructuring certain customer contracts to reflect a change in our business practices. As a result, we are now netting some costs against related revenues. And second, we determined that certain revenues are better classified as domestic assessments. Note, each of these factors has a roughly 3 ppt impact to the growth rate of other revenues. However, both of these changes have no impact on our overall net revenue growth or to the bottom line.","Moving on to page 7, you can see that excluding the special item, total operating expenses increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis. On a year-over-year basis, roughly 3 ppt of this increase was due to the accelerated A&M spend in support of the rollout of Masterpass that I told you about last quarter. The remainder was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we continue to invest in our digital and new payment capabilities, geographic expansion, Advisors consulting services, and data analytics.","So let me turn to slide 8, and here let's discuss what we have seen in April through the 28th, where most of our drivers are similar or slightly better than in Q1. Please remember that the year-over-year comparisons in April are aided by the timing of when Easter fell this year.","The numbers through April 28 are as follows. Starting with switched volume, we saw global growth of 10%, up slightly from 9% in the first quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S. In the U.S., our switched volume grew 3%, up a bit from the first quarter, with higher growth in both credit and debit programs. And gas had about 0.5 ppt positive impact to our April growth.","Switched volume outside the U.S. grew 17%, the same as in the first quarter. And globally, switched transaction growth was 17%, the same as what we saw in Q1, with similar growth rates in the U.S. as well as outside of the U.S.","And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 17% globally, up 4 ppt from Q1, primarily driven by the timing of Easter.","So looking ahead, our expectations for 2017 are broadly consistent with our prior estimates. We continue to grow our core business with a mix of new deals, renewed agreements, and the expansion of our differentiated service offerings, and there has been no major change in the macroeconomic environment. We continue to expect net revenue will grow at a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and consistent with our 3-year performance objectives.","When you model this on an as-reported basis adjusted for the FX impact of all currencies, we estimate there would be a headwind of between 1 to 2 ppt to net revenue growth and a little more than 2 ppt to the bottom line given the current FX environment relative to last year. Although our first quarter as-reported net revenue had a minimal year-over-year FX impact, we expect bigger impacts in the coming quarters due to the year-ago comps, particularly in Q2. We expect near-term net revenue growth will be lower than later in the year due to higher incentives in new and renewed agreements and the roll-off of one agreement.","On expenses, we continue to expect year-over-year total operating expenses to grow in the high single-digit rate excluding acquisitions on a currency-neutral basis, and that FX will have about a 1 ppt benefit to as-reported operating expenses for the year. Also of note, the acceleration of A&M spend to support the rollout of Masterpass will continue into the second quarter. In particular, second quarter A&M spend will be up by about $40 million versus the year-ago quarter.","And as a reminder, we exclude the impact of acquisitions from our performance objectives for comparability's sake, but provide some detail to assist you with your modeling for the rest of the year. So in particular, with regards to the acquisition of VocaLink, which just closed, we expect it to improve the quarterly net revenue growth rate by about 2.5 ppt, increase total operating expenses at a run rate of roughly $100 million per quarter, and be about $0.05 to $0.06 dilutive in 2017, driven primarily by purchase accounting and integration-related costs.","Finally, you should assume a tax rate closer to the bottom end of the 28% to 29% range based on our current expectations of regional mix.","With that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session. Warren?","Warren Kneeshaw - MasterCard, Inc.","Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer session. In order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back for additional questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a broad update on the regulatory environment you're seeing right now. The Choice Act has been introduced into Congress and obviously includes a repeal of the Durbin Amendment in that, so any impact you would see if that would indeed pass, and then also in Europe, relative to PSD2 whether you're seeing any shift in the landscape at this point in time.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","So it's Ajay. My view of the U.S. regulatory environment is that, as I said, I still don't see the results of all the various policy initiatives come through. I consider the Choice Act and Durbin Amendment kind of thing in the same category. I am unsure in the political environment that we're seeing right now is that a lot of these will pass through in the form that original statements make them out to appear to be. And so I'm unwilling to factor too much hope from specifics of that type. I continue to believe that in overall terms, the regulatory environment will continue to improve in this administration because that's their focus. But I don't think you can pick one item out of it and say that one will certainly pass. I don't think that's the way it's going to work. So that's not the way we're looking at it.","On Europe, on the other hand, there's a lot going on in Europe, but PSD2 is at very early stages. As you know, what PSD2 does is that it basically opens up, even if fully implemented, the market to many new players who could come in and play in the payments ecosystem. It also introduces a number of things that aren't as simple for merchants or consumers to handle, for example, two-factor authentication. So my general view on PSD2 is that we've got a bunch of people in our company working very hard to make sure we take the tailwinds that it will produce for a company like ours, and I assure you there are plenty of tailwinds, while also taking into account headwinds that it produces and work with banks and merchants and these new players to make sure that we can play a role that's practical and sensible to facilitate the payments ecosystem.","You've got to remember that the two-factor authentication and things like already low interchange in Europe can create some headwind for great progress from new players to come into the system. And so this isn't as simple to figure out as it may appear to be when you first read PSD2. I think over the next two, three, four, five years, you will begin to see this have a roadmap, and we are well preparing for that, both from a tailwind and a headwind point of view.","Warren Kneeshaw - MasterCard, Inc.","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Ajay, if you look at the network results this quarter, it seems like the international markets are starting to perk up a little bit. I was just curious on your thoughts on the sustainability of that. And then if you could, maybe comment about the U.S., what your view is there, and how travel into the U.S. has been trending.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","So, Don, you're absolutely correct that the international markets have in the last, I would say not just this quarter, over the last six to nine months, things have been moving up in the international markets. Remember, Brazil was one of those big markets for us that was holding it back. Brazil turning the corner. I wouldn't yet call it a V-shape movement, by the way. I'm looking at a kind of flat U. It's stopped declining. It's improved a bit. This is a good thing. There's a lot going on in Brazil on the political and economic environment that still has to pan out for this to be a continued improvement, but it's way better than it was a year ago at this time. So that's the first one.","The second one is remember a few things in cross-border. You look at places like France that had got seriously impacted a year ago by unsafe environment. France has actually begun to come back up, not where we would like it to be, but again improved over where it was. There are other countries that are still suffering from travel and tourism issues to do with safety.","Your specific question on the United States, inbound into the U.S., anecdotal information, not yet quite visible, but anecdotal on travel bookings in the future, on hotel bookings in the future would indicate that there is some slowdown in that. I think part of it could be just the strong dollar versus other currencies. Part of it could be concerns around the political and stability of the social environment. It's tough to say. And, I wouldn't read too much into it yet. I think if it continues for another quarter, that will be a matter of some concern for inbound into the U.S. But international on the whole, you're absolutely correct. Things are looking decent there. Outbound U.S. travel is fine.","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","And even in Europe, as Ajay already mentioned, France, but it's really across Europe where we are seeing very strong, continued strong growth from a cross-border point of view. Ajay mentioned in his prepared remarks that the inbound travel into the UK is extremely strong, but it's pretty much offset by much lower outbound travel from the UK. But all of the other countries on the continent, and in fact, we've been seeing Russia starting to come up, people traveling a lot outside of Russia, so very strong factors there.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","China is interesting. There is lower growth in China, but Korea and Hong Kong remain very strong, so it moves around. But if I were to focus on cross-border, it would be Europe and North America that are showing results, with Brazil as well. And then the others come a little after that.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","But even in China, we have positive cross-border growth trends.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks, that's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys. Martina, maybe you can just explain the dynamic between how pricing is impacting domestic and cross-border fees and then how that gets netted out against rebates and incentives, just what that impact is, how that looks like. And then what is that going to look like going forward, and how should we model that?","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","We have made a number of changes over the last quarter or so, basically adjusting the pricing of our various products and services offerings, and that allowed us to obviously move some of the numbers around. But net-net, I have to tell you from a pricing point of view, that was not really a big contributor for this quarter.","So what you saw that the domestic assessment fees didn't quite grow in line with GDV, you saw that the cross-border volume fees didn't quite grow in line with the cross-border volume. And that was \u2013 I'm sorry, it grew more than the GDV fee and the cross-border volume, and that was pretty much offset in the rebates and incentive line. This factor will be pretty much with us for the next three quarters.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks so much.","Warren Kneeshaw - MasterCard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, good growth year. I just want to quickly clarify that I think, Martina, you mentioned the roll-off of an agreement. Did you size that and is that new information?","And then just on VocaLink, I'm curious. How has that asset performed year to date and maybe any metrics you can share? And how should we gauge the short-term performance here beyond just the revenue and expense?","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","So first of all, on the roll-off, the agreement we had mentioned that this is just something that had been with us for the last four quarters. You are going to see it...","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","Tien-Tsin, it's the USAA roll-off. It's nothing new.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, I just wanted to make sure. I just wanted to make sure.","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","There's nothing new. That's what it is.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","I wouldn't leave you in suspense.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, I just want to make sure. I'm nutty like that, and then just VocaLink?","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","And secondly on VocaLink, just some texture beyond just the numbers that I called out this morning. They are performing really well. So we are actually very happy as we closed the agreement. They really did a wonderful job in the market in all of their various product lines, including obviously developing the app, which is a push-debit product in the UK and starting to roll that out with a number of bank partners. So we are very pleased to see that. I think that kind of trajectory will continue. Of course, this is going to be a more complicated integration, so we have everybody welcomed now for three days. We are very hard at doing the integration over the last three days, but there's another year to come. And so you will be hearing from us more as the quarters unfold.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","Tien-Tsin, basically to me, VocaLink, at the end of the day, aside from the actual how you integrate them, I just think the opportunity to be able to go to any customer in the world and both a bank and a merchant and even a consumer eventually, and show them the ability through a Masterpass or some such event, show them from a Mastercard card to using Mastercard Send for P2P to using an ACH capability.","As we get the capability from VocaLink embedded across our system and as we can do it at different levels of complexity in different countries. In the UK, VocaLink is a full operator as well. In other countries, it's got different models there. But you'll find us over the next year or two at least at the front end trying to put as much as we can of our skills and capabilities across full payment ranges. Add to it what we can do with ESS fraud safety, artificial intelligence, decision analytics, and put all of that and bundle it together. That's our real work in the integration. That's actually probably 80% of the work that's going to happen over the next year or two.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","Warren Kneeshaw - MasterCard, Inc.","Next question please.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. Ajay, in previous calls, you talked about the timing on China and how it's unfolding there. Obviously, Visa talked about perhaps that extending out a little bit. Maybe you could just talk about your updated thoughts on that.","And then, Martina, just one quick question on the incentives; as we look out to next year, should we expect similar growth rates to this year? Thanks.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","Do you want to do the incentive one?","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","Sanjay, we are not yet ready to talk about next year. So we have been talking about the incentive line for this year, and I think I mentioned on the last quarter call that we expect about roughly a 20% increase on rebates and incentives. I think that is still roughly the number, but you're going to have to wait a little later in the year that we will be talking then about 2018. But as you have seen, rebates and incentives line has not really changed much over the last year or so, two years, and I don't expect much of a change.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","And, Sanjay, on your question on China, what we are trying to do there is probably not dissimilar to what you heard from Al [Kelly] on his call. We are working closely with the government there to finalize our application for a domestic license. We haven't got all the details you need relating to not just the application, but even more importantly, the review process. And so this is an ongoing effort with them. And I've been saying this now in some earnings calls, as you have heard, that I wouldn't hold my breath on when this comes through. It's just work, keep at it. And as they get more comfortable with opening up their domestic payments market in a way that makes sense for their market and their economy, that's when more and more clarity will keep emerging.","We're working our way through it. I've been there a couple of times in the last three, four months. I've met everybody, so has everybody else who has been there. We probably meet similar people or one person here, one person there. But at the end of the day, I don't have much more to add to you on that. I remain focused on doing a few things. One is ensuring that we get more and more single-brand agreements signed up, and we have signed 40 \u2013 45 or so of them last year. We signed more in the first quarter. And the good news is because of that, our card numbers in China are continuing to increase, even as the dual-brand card issuance or renewal rather is slacking off as some banks are moving away from dual-brand.","Now you've got to remember, not every bank is in a big tearing hurry to move away from dual-brand because they also recognize the impact on their revenue stream of moving away from it. So this is a moving target. It's a little difficult to put a numerical value to it. But the good news is our total number of cards continues to increase despite this dynamic.","And so, as Martina mentioned when I was giving the answer on cross-border, China cross-border continues to grow as well. So there's a nice little dynamic going on there. Now it's going to get a little more complicated as the year goes by on dual-brand cards, and hopefully the single-brand volume we are building will continue to give us a tailwind against the headwind of dual-brand, all this inside the ecosystem conversation of how do we get to a license in China, which to me is still some distance away. Now there are a lot of conversations going on, as you know, between the U.S. and China. With 100 days conversation to happen, I don't yet know if that will influence things materially, so we'll see.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks, just a quick follow-up around guidance. I think it was adjusted mostly around FX and maybe VocaLink being included to some extent here as well. But I guess when we look at the timing of some of the variables like USAA lapping, and we've heard a lot more about possible pricing tailwinds in Europe and others, I'm just wondering if we shouldn't expect a better growth rate in the second half than the 12% constant currency that we just saw. It was obviously 12% constant currency came in pretty strong versus our estimate.","And then just a quick question, Ajay, on India, similar to the China question, and I guess thoughts on timing and opportunities there, if you can, just quickly update us. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","So, Darrin, first of all, just to explain again the first quarter, it did come in better than expectations. We called out strong drivers, in particular in Latin America, Asia-Pacific as well as European cross-border, and some of the transaction growth that we saw outside of the United States. And FX was more favorable than we otherwise had assumed.","One quarter does not make a year. We have also guided in my remarks that in the first half of the year, you will probably see \u2013 so that means the second quarter and the third quarter, you probably will see some lower growth rates and then pulling back up in the fourth quarter. So at this point in time, I don't see a basis for actually making a change for what we said about the whole year.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just...","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","We are obviously working away. We're working away against our plans. Remember that's what I'm working on. Now India, how much time do you want to spend?","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","As much as you want.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","So India, what's going on there is that in this first quarter, the growth rate of card spend at point of sale is still very substantial but much lower than it was in the fourth quarter. I think that's partly because currency notes have come back into circulation, and so cash withdrawal at ATMs has gone up compared to where it was in the fourth quarter.","Overall, GDV is still impacted. I think if you spoke to consumer product companies that are large in India, a Unilever kind of company, they would tell you they still see an impact on total consumer volumes and downsizing of inventory in the retail system because of some non-availability of adequate cash for transaction capability. So there's an interesting mix going on. You're seeing more electronic. You're seeing a little more cash, still not back to where it was, but it's headed in the right direction, but more importantly, headed in the right direction with some tailwind on the need to fix towards electronic versus more cash. That's what's going on underlying all this.","Now let me give you a couple of numbers that will tell you the magnitude of what has to be done there. So there are about 840 million debit cards in India, and those have grown by 20% \u2013 25% over the last six months. This is a huge number. But of those, 770 million of them only take out cash from ATMs. Only 70 million of them have been used more than once at a point of sale. And therefore, the total volume of the number going through these two, the ones that I use for cash at an ATM, it's $450 billion a year, the ones that are used for point-of-sale transactions $30 billion. So we're talking a very cash-heavy marketplace with a great deal of reliance on cash as the instrument of driving the economy. That's what they're trying to work their way through.","To give a similar example for credit cards, there are less than 30 million credit cards in India. Just compared to 840 billion in debit, of which 70 billion have been used at a point of sale, there are only 30 million credit cards. In the last six months, while the debit cards grew by 25%, credit cards grew by less than 10%. So it's an interesting dynamic. And while merchant acceptance can grow, we're north of (44:32) about 2.5 million from where it used to be, which is 1.5 million, there are 60 million over there that you could get to. I doubt you'd get to a number of them because that includes a fruit seller on the roadside who probably will be among the last few to convert to electronic. But between 2.5 million and 60 million, there's a wide number. And even if you got to 5 million, 6 million, 7 million, that would be a substantial change over the coming year.","The government is very focused on driving acceptance. That's why the QR launch. That's why they're driving new point-of-sale terminals being put into the country. What they need to do is to provide some clarity on the MDR [Merchant Discount Rate]. In January they reinstated MDR, but at lower rates. Remember, there was an MDR holiday for a couple of months in the last quarter as a way of providing the right incentive and so on.","They need to get clearer. By the end of June, they promised a final rate, and there's a lot of conversation going on between the Development Bank of India, the Finance Ministry, and the banks and all of us on what that number should be. If you don't get clarity on that, how does the bank figure out what its revenue stream will be? If they can't figure out their revenue stream, whether they're an issuer or an acquirer, how do you expect them to invest in expanding acceptance and issuance? I think the government needs to make a decision on that front to enable this momentum to continue into the second part of this year.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, that's helpful, guys. Thank you.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","You can call me anytime you want. We could spend 17 hours on this one.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Warren Kneeshaw - MasterCard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Martina, with regard to the reclass for the other revenue, we get asked about that a fair amount. I know you had called us out that this was going to happen. I was just wondering if you had any more detail as to what it was that was requested. In other words, was it the security or was it selfie-pay or Advisor? Any more color on where the reclass took place would be helpful. Thank you.","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","I'm going to give you a very specific answer to this. It was in our loyalty business in Asia. First of all, we had a number of premium cards there with assessment fees. And they went into other revenues that really should be up in the domestic assessment. So it was basically just going from other revenues up to domestic assessment, and that was a 3-ppt impact.","And the other impact, which was also a 3-ppt impact, was where we actually provided in a customer engagement a particular service. And this time it was actually gift cards, where we procured the gift cards, there were costs to the gift cards, and we provided a holistic service, including program management, to that particular customer. We restructured the contract in such a way that we are not procuring the gift cards. The gift cards are procured by the customer. So that means they don't run \u2013 they run in such a way to our P&L that we can actually now net from a gross revenue point of view the cost of those gift cards. And so that is another change. We are not running it gross. We are running it through from a net point of view.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you, I appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the VocaLink acquisition and integration. And you talked a lot about how you look at integration capabilities and how you would judge that. How should we think about \u2013 and I think that makes sense from the context of your overall business lines today. How should we think about new opportunities for VocaLink once this is fully integrated? I guess one of the things that we look at is the B2B segment is quite large. Does it make sense for Mastercard to start to explore more aggressively some of those opportunities? I'm really just looking for an expansion on the thought process on the VocaLink roadmap. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","Sure, look. You're definitely going to see us expanding this capability into, first of all obviously Fast ACH and what that does with, for example, the Pay by Bank app in London and the UK that's rolling out. That basically is like a product that is a debit similar product but doesn't use a debit card to be able to make a payment from an individual to a merchant. We clearly see that as an opportunity for our company to grow our business in a number of markets around the world.","So that doesn't require us necessarily to be operating the entire payments infrastructure of a country. It's a product and an app that you can put at the front end, so long as the country has better ACH systems. So you'll see us using that in a number of countries around the world and improving it as we go along over the next couple of years. You should think about it as a two, three-year effort.","The second part clearly is that we could take their effort and attach our capability of fraud detection, early warning systems, SafetyNet, Decision Intelligence, all these products that we've been launching in the fraud and safety space, we could begin to attach those to ACH systems where VocaLink has a role to play. By the way, we're already talking about attaching these tools to ACH systems that VocaLink does not have a role to play as well because this is not determined only by what the front end is. It's determined by our ability to provide that service to ACH type of systems. But clearly, if it's VocaLink there, we've got a better opportunity to introduce these products with some value exchange built into it. So you should see therefore those two kinds of efforts being business development in some ways.","A third one would obviously be the extension of this use into both P2P as well as B2B usage. And we've already made a fair amount of effort in the B2B space as a company. We have been in the last, I'd say two years, I think the last Investor Day, if I remember correctly, we had a pretty deep dive on our B2B and commercial efforts. But even recently, we've launched Straight Through Processing. We've done a deal with Amadeus, which is a leading travel technology company. We've done the launch of Easy Savings cross-border. Our company is making a fair amount of effort in the commercial space. And the availability of VocaLink's capabilities where they are operating just makes it easier for us to make progress there.","Remember, all of this is contingent upon VocaLink either being in the marketplace as an operator or our ability to apply the front end of its capabilities, like Pay by Bank in certain markets, in which case the market must have a Fast ACH system or different aspects of our safety and security and loyalty services that we could provide whether VocaLink is there or not. And that's the range of things we're doing.","One of the good things that's happening is that we're getting some excellent talent from VocaLink. They understand the ACH, Fast ACH, back-switching, LINK ATM systems. That's a great add to our company's capabilities. David Yates, who was the CEO of VocaLink, is joining our management committee and will be focused on helping us think about how to do exactly what you asked in different markets. So I'm pretty excited about this. And if you would see me right now, you would find I have a degree of real intensity around this topic over the next two to three years.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. In terms of switched transactions, you had some pretty robust growth. I wondered if you can talk a little bit about market share by region and continued momentum, and if indeed that is one of the key drivers behind that line item.","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","Andrew, I'm going to take that. And you're absolutely right. This is now three quarters or so in a row that we had 17% switched transaction growth, which is absolutely terrific. The growth is really coming from Asia-Pacific and Middle East-Africa, in particular in Australia, India, South Africa, even in Nigeria, even though we all know that, that country and economic environment has a little bit of a tough time at this point in time.","In the EU \u2013 in Europe, our European region, there are very good growth metrics from a switched transaction point of view. The areas that I can be calling out to you is the UK, but even France, where we weren't able to be able to switch as much before, and we have been winning a number of agreements where we can now switch. In Russia, we continue to switch. And in Latin America, Ajay was already mentioning Brazil where we're seeing some growth.","The last really bright item that I can call out for you is PIN switching in the United States. That has been really well into the double-digit space over the last three quarters, and that was a combination of the kind of work that we have been doing with issuers in order to get on the back of the card as well as with merchants on the routing opportunities.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. Ajay, I have another question about India. Paytm in India was \u2013 or is I guess now classified as a so-called payments bank. And I'm wondering \u2013 which I guess appears to be somewhat of a hybrid between a traditional bank and a money transfer agent. I'm wondering. One, are you seeing these constructs crop up elsewhere around the world? And then also, how do you think about your value proposition as Mastercard to that kind of entity?","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","Lisa, the way the payments bank topic in India developed was that there was a report put out by the central bank or the Reserve Bank as it's called in India. They commissioned a report, and they put out an idea, how do you grow acceptance and electronic payments in the country. And one of the items in there was to add on the idea of payments banks, where they wouldn't have the same infrastructure and the same need as a traditional bank, but they could help to reach these underpenetrated lower volume, lower density of population areas to expand the distribution of electronic payment products.","There are other countries that have done similar things. They call them differently. In Mexico, for example, the correspondent banking network does something similar where you could put the ability to have a terminal in a retail store in a small town in Mexico, and that could be used for both simple deposits and simple withdrawals. So different countries have gone to different extents on this, and it's been going on for quite a few years.","The specifics of Paytm are the following. Paytm mostly till now has been operating as a closed-loop prepaid wallet. So they've got to build their own acceptance, which is challenging. Now the input into the wallet was credit, debit, and bank accounts, a bit like PayPal of old. That's a staged wallet. As you know, we don't think staged wallets provide transparency for either the merchant or the consumer or the bank, but that's a different challenge. But what they were basically doing was a prepaid closed-loop wallet.","When the government announced the demonetization, clearly whichever outlet you were accepted in and if you spent a lot of effort to grow your acceptance, which is one of the things they're going to do with whatever money they are now getting injected into themselves over the next few months, depending on what deal finally gets struck by new investors, they're going to try and expand their acceptance.","Meanwhile, the payment bank side of them is currently a different legal entity. I don't exactly know how that will work out over time and how it will get connected into Paytm or not. But they're going to have to use \u2013 at that point in time they're going to have to think about an open-loop system. That's part of the payment bank system.","So this is going to be an interesting movement, and we're clearly talking to them. We think they're interesting partners, as I'm sure other networks are. And that's where they are right now. So I don't know if that's a clear enough answer, but it's a moving dynamic on the ground there in India.","My general view of all such players is that you've got work with them as partners because they're a channel for a consumer to reach either another consumer or a merchant, and that puts us in the middle of those payment flows. And with ACH capabilities if you could go into countries and start offering them, it puts us even better in the middle of those the same flows while at the same time developing our own alternatives in the form of Masterpass with a full suite of capabilities over time for a consumer and bank to use, whether it be card rails or ACH rails or Mastercard Send. And that's the way can I think about this, a fully competitive, open-loop system driven on the quality of service and driven on the quality of other services that you can attach to them, whether it be fraud management or processing or loyalty or data analytics. And that's why you see our strategy the way we're working on it.","Warren Kneeshaw - MasterCard, Inc.","Operator, I believe we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paulo Ribeiro from BMO. Your line is open.","Paulo E. Ribeiro - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, a couple of quick questions here, one on the processing side. Can you tell us a little about the opportunity that you see in Europe? You've mentioned in the past that the separation of scheme and processing could offer an opportunity.","And second, in the U.S., we saw last year some problems with the Green Dot rollout. Can you give us an update where you are and again where you see opportunities here?","And if we can squeeze just a quick one on VocaLink, you guided in the past to $0.10 dilution for the 24 months after. Is that still the case because you mentioned the impact on 2017 obviously? Thank you.","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","On VocaLink, Paulo, its $0.05 to $0.06 dilution for the year.","Paulo E. Ribeiro - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, so it's just \u2013 so 2018, you're not talking about 2018 yet.","Martina Hund-Mejean - MasterCard, Inc.","No, we are not talking about 2018 at this point in time. But typically, something like this takes about two years to integrate. So I wouldn't be surprised if it's probably another $0.05 in 2018. But 2017 is $0.05 to $0.06.","I said $0.05 before, and you might wonder because we now have only eight months of integration versus 12 months that we had under the underlying $0.05. Why is it roughly still the same number? Our team is actually trying to get in eight months the same work on integration done that we had otherwise thought that we would need to take 12 months. So it's going to be very similar costs that we're going to put into those eight months versus what we had in the 12 months.","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","On the processing and switching side, honestly I'm assuming you're referring mostly to Europe. But in Europe, we're pretty confident and comfortable with the way in which we are managing the clarity that the European Commission has provided on the rules on what's meant to be handled in that space. And as you know, they insisted on a certain kind of separation. We think we've done a pretty good job of managing those. I don't feel that there is a lot of headwind against us on that topic. Our teams are aligned on the ground correctly, meaning they're not supposed to do certain things together. They're supposed to report separately. All that is set up and moving at full speed. We have not got any hesitation on that front.","For the rest of processing, we're continuing to do some really interesting things there. I read out in my prepared remarks the example with General Motors and Mastercard Payment Gateway Services. There are examples like that in the prepaid space. That's the Green Dot part that you're referring to. We are actually rolling along well with those conversions, and there are examples of that type in the Travelex prepaid program management that we bought. I read that out in my opening remarks as well to give you an example of how they're using it for prepaid travel. So in general, life is progressing well in the processing and switching space.","Paulo E. Ribeiro - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw - MasterCard, Inc.","Thank you. Ajay, do you have any final comments?","Ajay Banga - MasterCard, Inc.","Sure. First of all, just thank you all for your questions, and a couple of closing thoughts. The first one, I hope you got the sense we're off to a good start to the year. We understand what we've got to get done for the rest of the year. And as Martina has made some effort to point out to you, we understand how the dynamics of revenue for the year will move. We are spending money on Masterpass again in the second quarter. Don't forget that. That's a good thing. It's helping us build our awareness and our capabilities on Masterpass, all with good underlying fundamentals.","What I'm really excited about is the capabilities that our recent acquisitions are bringing, and we're looking forward to developing new revenue streams and driving growth. We recognize that VocaLink has a very vital role to play in the UK payments ecosystem. You should know, we have committed to maintaining the appropriate stewardship of that very important asset, hence my comment and Martina's comment about focusing on integrating it the right way. But at the same time, we are going to be looking for opportunities to leverage their capabilities elsewhere in the world, and we're just very excited about having completed that acquisition in a relatively quick timeframe.","We really appreciate your continued support of the company.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Jack. Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us for a discussion about our third quarter 2016 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d also like to welcome Warren Kneeshaw, my successor to his first MasterCard earnings call.","Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question. Even if you think you have already dialled into the queue for Q&A, you will need to register again following our prepared comments.","This morning's earnings call and the slide deck that will be referenced on the call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our Web site for 30 days.","Both the release and the slide-deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. We\u2019ve also added a table at the end of both documents, which provides additional information about the impact of Article A of the EU\u2019s recent payments regulation on our GDV and purchase volume growth rate. Since we are no longer charging de minimis fees on co-batched domestic volume that doesn\u2019t use our network in markets such as France, this volume is no longer included in our reported volume statistics.","We saw the partial impact of this in the second quarter, and now have a full quarter of impact in Q3. A table adjusts growth rates for the impact by eliminating the related co-batched volume in prior periods, so that you can see the underlying run rate of our business. Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted rates.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","Now with that, I will now turn the call over to Ajay.","Ajay Banga","Thank you, Barbara. And Barbara, thank you once again for your outstanding decade of work for us. And Warren, welcome to the Company. Good morning everybody. Our business continues to perform well. We are very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you\u2019ve seen, we delivered net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 19%, after excluding last year\u2019s special items, which was related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.","Our perspective of the economy remains largely unchanged since last quarter. You\u2019ve all seen the U.S. GDP growth report this morning. We\u2019ve continued to believe like we said in the previous quarters that U.S. is on a steady growth path with consumer confidence, unemployment, and wages holding firm, of course, unless something unforeseen occurs coming out of the upcoming elections, but basically the U.S. had a steady growth path.","Many markets across Europe are showing a gradual recovery, led by Germany, as economic sentiment holds steady. Unemployment rates are continuing to decline. Although uncertainty from Brexit and its impact on Europe remain a concern, I think it's going to take a few years to understand the full implications. Again, you saw the British GDP report, which kind of sees it holding steady. Interestingly, underlying UK consumer demand remains stable. And in fact as a result of the weaker pound, inbound travel to the UK is picking up over this last quarter.","In Asia, the picture is still mixed. In China, both exports and imports were down sharply. And you all know the concerns over inflated asset values. In Australia, however, business confidence is up, and India continues its relatively strong growth trajectory. In Latin America, Brazil, even though is expected to remain in a recession for the near future seems to be bottoming out, and the political environment seems to be stabilizing, which should hopefully improve economic conditions over the next six to 12 months. In Venezuela, the political and fiscal crisis is deepening. In Mexico, the economy continues to expand, but with increasing dependence on consumer spending growth. So in sum, the outlook from the economic side remains mixed. Even so, we\u2019re continuing to grow. We\u2019re seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. We\u2019re continuing to win deals as we execute against our long-term strategy.","So now let me provide you with a brief update from our planned acquisition of Vocalink. The first step is now complete. The European Commission has referred the transaction back to the UK regulator to perform the anti-trust review. The second step, which would be led by the UK regulator, generally has two phases. We are hopeful to complete the review in the first preliminary phase, but it's always possible that this could go into a more detailed second phase. We continue to believe that we can complete this acquisition by about the middle of 2017.","So before going on to our business highlights, let me just touch on a few regulatory and litigation items that you all ask us about from time-to-time. So starting with the United States, as you know, the merchant litigation is back in the Brooklyn Court. In the status conference held last week, the court heard arguments on the appointment of class council for merchants. Now as the court appoints that council, we expect the litigation to proceed and we intend to resume the settlement negotiation. But given its complexity, we think this process will take some years to resolve.","In the UK, as many of you know, a proposed class action was filed in September on behalf of UK consumers, seeking damages related to interchange fees. The court will set out the timeline for the case soon. We\u2019ve had good experience addressing similar claims in the United States that we believe strongly, that in fact far from being harmed by interchange, UK consumers have in fact benefited significantly. Finally, following legal submissions and an order hearing this past summer, we continue to be in conversations with the European Commission to find the resolution to the 2015 case around our interchange rates on inter-regional cross-border transactions, and the central acquiring rules.","So now moving on to some of our recent business activity, you've heard a great deal of all of this from us at the recent Investor Day. You had an opportunity to see first-hand a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling out. So I'm going to stick to very few items this time. We continue to make solid progress in our U.S. consumer business, building on our recent momentum in debit. We\u2019re actually excited to highlight through new deals that deepen and strengthen our existing relationships with both U.S. banks and Regions bank, which have now been expanded to include preferred MasterCard routing for their PIN debit business.","Outside of the U.S., we\u2019re actually pleased to have flipped a number of portfolios by continuing to leverage services as a key strategic differentiator. I'm going to give you a couple of examples in Europe. While we're building on the long-term debit-deal we announced last year in Italy with Poste Italian, we are now expanding our partnership by converting a significant portion of their prepaid portfolio. This deal also includes a number of our services such as advisors to help drive their financial inclusion and innovation agendas. Another example with DenizBank which is one of the market leaders in Turkey, to flip their credit business which also leverages advisors.","Now the domestic opportunity in China. We're awaiting a more detailed interpretation of the final PBOC regulations, particularly around the newly introduced security provisions and how these would impact our implementation of USAA switching, while protecting our systems and our data. We hope these will be available for the next couple of months. We're continuing to speak with regulators to clarify our options on how best to enter the market.","In the meanwhile, we continue to make progress in China by winning a number of new deals with banks, including HSBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC, and Postal Savings Bank. As part of these deals, they will be issuing new single-branded cards, targeted at the country\u2019s growing affluent customer segment and to drive cross-border spend.","We have highlighted several key renewals in our commercial business, including Fleet Card and WEX, both of whom are driving B2B and cross-border spends in unique and innovative ways by leveraging virtual cards. We just added two new deals in Europe; one with Credit Suisse, which is focused on the small and medium enterprise segment where MasterCard is the exclusive card provider; the other with UBS, where we're looking forward to deepening our relationship within their corporate banking business.","So now onto digital strategy, and over the last several quarters, including at the recent Investor Day, we've given you a number of updates on the significant progress we are making with MasterPass. And just to recall, we're taking two parallel paths. The first is our digital-by-default strategy, which enables issuers to auto enroll cardholders through their online banking apps and also drive scale for us, while keeping issuers at the center of their consumer relationships.","We're quite pleased that more than 80 million accounts will be automatically enabled over the next few months. The second is to deliver a digital payment service that works across all devices, all channels, whether that's in-app, online, or in store, and the idea there is to keep growing acceptance by being ubiquitous.","So today, I'll discuss a couple of use cases to give you an idea about some of the unique ways we're using MasterPass with our partners around the world. In South Africa, we're working with MTN and Vodacom, two telecom providers who by the way put together have a market share of about 70% to allow their customers to securely pay for air-time minutes from their mobile device using MasterPass. Prior to this, subscribers would either have to stand in long lines at a third-party service location or go to an ATM to transfer funds to the telecom provider and then wait for their accounts to be updated. Since it's launch, more than 4.5 million users have registered for the service, and air-time distribution cost for the mobile network operators have been reduced by as much as 15%.","Another example in Europe. We\u2019ve partnered with Czech Railways, the largest rail operator in that country, to integrate MasterPass into their booking app to better compete with new entrants in the transits phase and to modernize mobile ticketing. Again, prior to this, users would have had to enter their card details for each purchase. Since its launched in early 2015, usage has grown significantly, and MasterPass now accounts for nearly 8% of all Czech railways transactions. Both of these examples I hope demonstrate to you that through MasterPass, we're not just enabling digital payments. We're actually trying to get a better consumer experience.","From an extension standpoint, MasterPass continues to grow. It's now available at more than 300,000 merchants online and in-app, as well as more than 6 million locations in 77 countries that have now contactless payments. We\u2019re continuing to add new merchants. For example, United Airlines in the U.S., Domino's Pizza and Trenitalia in Europe, KFC in Asia. In addition, last week we signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ecobank Group to roll-out MasterPass QR, a mobile person-to-person merchant service -- the mobile person to merchant service across 33 African countries. This solution would be integrated with their mobile banking platform, will enable users to safely pay for purchases directly from their bank account using a QR code. Again, millions of micro, small, and medium enterprises across Africa will now be able to accept secure digital payments quickly and without the expense of a traditional POS server.","So our MasterPass partner centric approach, if you heard Garry Lyons talk about at Investor Day, which is aimed at delivering a seamless consumer experience, benefit issuance, digital players, and merchants. So earlier this week we highlighted that issuers, like Capital One who are already leveraging our digital-by-default approach, are further integrating MasterPass into their wallet offering. Users of the Capital One wallet can now shop online and in-app and check-out using their same MDES tokenized log-in credentials at the hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where MasterPass is accepted. Similarly, at Money2020, we highlighted an important expansion of our digital partnerships, and starting sometime early next year, Samsung Pay, Android Pay, and Microsoft Wallet, will also enable the same online and in-app consumer experience that I just mentioned.","And finally, clearly, merchants also benefit from this. Since we\u2019ve already integrated with MasterPass, there's no additional development work required. It gives them access to the millions of consumers who have already used these other wallet services or will in the future. Meanwhile, we continue to support our partners to extend their reach globally as we recently have Android Pay move into Poland, in fact, as Apply Pay expand into Japan and Russia, both currently exclusive with MasterCard.","Finally, we highlighted our recent partnership with Green Dot and Uber, as well as Stripe and Lyft at Investor Day and how they're leveraging the MasterCard Send platform to make convenient and secure payments to drivers, delivery people, and others. We just added Allstate who will leverage MasterCard Send to make claims payments to their customers via a debit card, providing nearly instant access to their funds.","So with that, let me turn the call over Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks Ajay and good morning everyone. Starting with Page 3, you see there are minimal differences this quarter between non-GAAP reported and currency neutral growth rates. The figures exclude the impact of a special item related to the termination of the U.S. defined pension plan taken last year. As you can see from our numbers, we have delivered another strong quarter. Here are a few highlights.","Net revenue growth was 14%. Operating expenses grew 12% as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives. EPS was up $1.08, up 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by our strong operating performance and a slightly lower tax rate. Also, share re-purchases contributed $0.03 per share. As of October 25th, we have $1.8 billion remaining under our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and other liquid investments of about $7 billion.","So, let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Just a reminder, as Barbara mentioned, the growth rates I am quoting are adjusted for the impact of the new EU regulations. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV growth, was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 PPTs from the prior quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 5%, made up of credit and debit growth of 4% and 6% respectively. As expected, this includes the impact of the USAA roll-off.","Total U.S. GDV had less than 1 PPT headwind from lower gas prices. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis. This is down 1 PPT versus last quarter due to slightly lower growth in each region. Cross-border volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, about 2 PPT higher than the 10% we saw in the second quarter, and driven primarily by commercial travel programs in Europe.","Let me turn you to Page 5, and here you see process transactions grew 18% globally to $14.5 billion, which is 4 PPT increase from last quarter, driven primarily by increased PIN routing in the U.S. Globally, the number of cards grew 6% with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued. Let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out, both here and on the next slide, are on a currency-neutral basis. The net revenue growth was 14%. We saw a strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentives grew 21% due to higher volume and new and renewed deals.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on a currency neutral basis, domestic assessments grew 10%, essentially in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 15%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 3 PPT gap is due to some pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 19%, in line with process transaction growth. And finally, other revenue grew 23%, predominantly driven by advisors, safety and security, and loyalty.","Moving to Page 7, you can see that excluding last year's special items, total operating expenses increased 12% in the quarter, of which more than 2 PPT is due to the impact of foreign exchange activity and balance sheet re-measurement. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we continue to invest in digital services and geographic expansion, as well as higher data processing costs, in line with our transaction growth, and Russian domestic processing cost to NSP card.","Turning to Slide 8, let's discuss what we've seen in October through the 21st. Most of our drivers are similar to Q3, except for the U.S. The numbers through October 21st are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 10%, and that's equivalent to what we saw in the third quarter with double-digit growth in each region outside of the U.S. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 3%, down more than 3 PPT from the third quarter with the same growth in credit programs and lower growth in debit programs, primarily due to the de-conversions I mentioned earlier. Excluding that, our October growth was similar to the third quarter. Gas did not have an impact on our October growth rate.","Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, and that\u2019s actually up 1 PPT from the third quarter with higher growth in each region. Globally, process transaction growth was 17%, down 1 PPT from what we saw in the third quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was similar to Q3, while the U.S. growth was down 3 PPT. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 13% globally, up almost 1 PPT from the third quarter with faster growth in Europe, driven by a combination of consumer and commercial usage.","Now looking at the full-year 2016, there is really no change in our business outlook from what I have discussed at Investor Day back in September. We continue to expect revenue growth in the low double-digits on a currency neutral basis. When you model on an as reported basis, adjusting for the impact of all currencies, we now estimate that there would be about 1 PPT headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom-line. This is less of a headwind than what we had said in September, given the continued moderation of exchange rates.","Let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modelling 2016. On expenses, we now expect total operating expense growth in the low double-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. As discussed at Investor Day, we expect to see positive operating leverage for the year. And you should now feel the 2016 tax rate towards the lower end of the 28% to 29% range that I talked about in September. As is our normal practice, we will defer any comments about our 2017 outlook until our year-end call in January.","Now, let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?","Barbara Gasper","Thanks Martina. We\u2019re now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. And in order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Jack?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operation Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jim Schneider","I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update on the B2B payment space, and the opportunity you see there. And specifically can you talk about how Zell [ph] and MasterCard Send fit into the strategy for you?","Ajay Banga","Sure. I think this whole commercial business continues to be an area of pretty good growth, and you just heard me talk a little bit about Fleet Card and WEX and virtual cards. And I gave you the examples of UBS and Credit Suisse. But what we\u2019re basically seeing in addition to the transaction side of this is we\u2019re seeing an adoption of some of our products, smart data, which is our reporting and reconciliation tool, as well as In-control, which is a virtual card system for commercial payments is getting kind of getting well embedded.","I\u2019m also starting to see some increasing interest beyond the typical bank card users. Technology providers will embed commercial payment solutions into their software and their platforms and payment aggregators and verticals, such as construction, insurance. You see these guys coming into play as well. So there is series of things we\u2019re doing in the B2B space, in the D&E space, in the SME space, that are all connected to this effort to drive our commercial efforts.","The MasterCard Send product that you just heard us talk about again, what this is, is a payment service that facilitates the delivery of funds very quickly and very securely to consumers, both domestically and internationally. If we take a single connection into this platform, you could be a business, you could be a merchant, you could be a government, and non-profit, an issuer, some other sender, and you can send money to consumers, whether they\u2019re banked or un-banked, most importantly, whether there are domestic or overseas as well.","And that\u2019s kind of what we are trying to do here. Because in the overseas markets, we combined with a JV that we had launched some time ago, called HomeSend, sent, not to be confused MasterCard Send. That\u2019s just internal MasterCard confusion. I don\u2019t want you to get confused. And HomeSend is a unique asset for cross-border payments. It kind of expands our reach to billions of bank accounts across more than 70 markets, through their phone numbers and systems. And so the combination of this ability to move money to any bank account in the U.S. through MasterCard Send, whether it\u2019s got a Visa debit or a MasterCard debit card at the front end of the account, combined with HomeSend. which can connect to these billions of bank accounts across 70 markets using phone systems. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up to.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","I was just wondering if you can maybe give us your perspective on why your growth rate reported on constant currency basis has been growing at such a big premium to Visa. Any color there, because actually you\u2019ve been boarding a lot of new clients. So I've been surprised by the magnitude of the premium?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Tien-tsin, you know that we are extremely disciplined when we go the market and when we actually work with clients and the kind of agreements that we are striking. And as we have discussed on Investor Day, we are not just doing a core product deal where we look at the credit product, or debit product, or prepaid product or commercial product, but we are also adding quite a lot of our services on to that agreement. And when you look at the growth rate in the other revenue line item where most of these services are actually residing, that\u2019s where you are seeing the extra juice coming out from these kinds of agreements. So I would say between the discipline that we have, and the services, the differentiated services that we can deliver to our clients, you can actually see that coming though.","Ajay Banga","Maybe you should Tien-tsin, take another side step. Both our companies are winning clients around the world from each other, but also the growth of geographic expansion, new issuers, new types of issuers coming into the system. It's not my impression that a great deal of growth comes for either of us from just winning a client from each other. I would rather focus on the opportunity that exists in this industry to grow versus so much more there is. Do you remember, 85% of the world\u2019s retail transactions are still in cash and check. And that\u2019s -- I think our focus is giving us the benefit of thinking that through, in a way that's allowing us to build assets and capabilities to aim for the bigger buys, and keep at it over a period of quarters. There will be quarters when we do better. I'm sure there will be quarters when somebody else does better. And I'm fine with that. I'm more focused on where we\u2019re executing for the next few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg","Just wanted to build on Tien-tsin\u2019s question. Obviously, you\u2019ve got 14% constant currency growth year-to-date, if I am not mistaken, but still guiding to low double-digit. So assuming the math on Q4 would imply a lot of detail, is there some rebate timing to consider? Or what other factors should we be building into the Q4 model? And does this put you kind of at high-end of low double-digits at the risk of putting too fine a point on it?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Jason, nice try. No, it's still at the low double-digits. But what you have to consider for the fourth quarter, and you're absolutely right. Year-to-date it's 14%. So actually this is the third quarter this year that we are producing a 14% net revenue growth rate. And we are obviously extremely pleased with that. But yes, you will see a slowdown in the fourth quarter. And you have to consider two factors. One, we have the USAA roll-off, and that will be pretty much complete by the end of the year from what we understand.","So of course, that\u2019s a bit more of an acceleration than what we have talked before earlier this year. And secondly, on the rebates in incentive side, it is normal for us in the fourth quarter just before year end to sign a whole bunch of new agreements and renewing agreements. It's actually nothing different than what we\u2019ve seen in prior years. But you should expect that there will be more rebates and incentives coming in, in the fourth quarter. Both of these factors will weigh down on net revenues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Don Fandetti","Ajay, it looks like cross-border is continuing to tick-up here. Could you talk a little bit about the comment on the commercial improvement in Europe? Is that organic or are you seeing marketshare gains? And then also, what are you seeing in terms of outbound China. I know that some of your competitors have talked about some stabilization or improvement.","Ajay Banga","So the first part, the second part, which is actually a transactional piece of information on outbound China. I think you'll find growth to certain parts of the world, but not to others. It's not coming in through the U.S. and Europe as it used to. It's actually going much more through the Asian markets. So Australia to Japan, to those parts of the world. That's actually similar to what I may have said at Investor Day, but I don't fully recall if that question came up. But that's kind of what we are seeing on the China part of it.","The cross-border growth in Europe, remember when we pointed out commercial in Europe because that's the one thing that's different from prior quarters. It's not as though that's the largest reason for our growth. So we're going to take it in context. It's the one thing that's different. And in that, yes, we are seeing the activation of a bunch of programs in commercial in Europe, that we have sanctioned these earlier, they've come on board, there's a series of activation going on.","But our cross-border growth is built of really blocking and tackling on a series of portfolios around the world where our account teams engage with the issuers and the merchant community to look at how to work on cross-border opportunity. And this is not a new thing. I think I can recall this for years now. It probably was being done before I even showed-up seven years ago. And I think it's just a series of focus items in MasterCard around cross-border.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","I just wanted a question on the thought process around incentive growth. We've had now I think two years of around 20% incentives of rebates growth, and obviously outpacing gross revenues. Obviously, there's been a lot of deals and now I think Martina you just mentioned Q4 probably has a step-up also. Just can you give us a little thought, a process around what's happening in the industry around, is it competitive dynamics, or -- and then really with SunTrust and others, should we expect another type of year like that going forward? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So Darrin I don't think \u2013 for the last couple of years we are really seeing nothing. We have not seen anything different than what we've seen in the last couple of years. Just to remind everybody, in 2015, we had a step-up in rebates and incentives given that we signed some fairly mega agreements; like one agreement with one customer for 10 years, another agreement with another customer for 20 years. And so we did talk in 2015 that we had to step up the incentives. The accounting was a little bit different. So in the early part of the years, we are actually amortizing more of those incentives. You see that second year, so the 2016 number is going to be with us in 2017, et cetera, if you see the same kind of step up.","In addition to that when you look at our results this year, you do see some better revenue rate coming in on the growth side. You will see some more contra being dragged with that. What's happening in the fourth quarter from a renewal and plus from new agreements in terms of what I'm seeing from our business people, we're seeing nothing different in terms of how we're actually signing the agreements. It's just the normal activity and the normal terms and conditions by the way that we're seeing in the fourth quarter.","Ajay Banga","We actually incent issuers to give us a share of their wallet, and that's built into this thinking. So if grow well in numbers, in absolute numbers, and they also grow well in giving us some share, they actually get a higher percentage discount. And so this is actually good for us. And it's good in many ways to help with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Martina, when I look at the revenue yields for domestic assessments and cross-borders, those accelerated some and then transaction processing fees decelerated some. I know you mentioned last call that there was some anniversarying of fee increases. But how should we think about the trajectory of those yields going forward?","Martina Hund-Mejean","On the domestic assessment yields, we typically say that they will be trending down over time, simply because of what we have been saying that when you sign larger agreements and you are assessing customers, to be actually given more volumes to you, that should be happening. So you would have to factor the contrary [ph] and take count. If you just look at the domestic assessments for this quarter and for the prior quarters, you have a little bit of a change in mix coming in. Remember we\u2019ve been talking a number of times that when you go and do work in a number of Asian countries, African countries, Russia, Venezuela, et cetera, that those come typically with lower yields. And it depends which quarter, which part of the GDV is growing in which country in terms of how the mix coming in. And in this quarter we have a little bit better mix coming in. So that's all on domestic yield. What was your second question?","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess even the cross-border number on an adjusted basis was up little bit. Does that just continue? And then the USAA impact, the numbers you quoted, does that include all of it rolling-off, or is there an additional drag that we should expect?","Martina Hund-Mejean","On the cross-border side, we did have a little bit of pricing action in that. And that we\u2019ll be anniversarying very soon. And on the USAA side, we believe that our comments are comprehensively assuming that USAA is rolling-off by the end of the year. Now just you're going to have to take into account that because this happened all this year, that you're going to have a knock on impact to the growth rates in 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Chris Brendler with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Chris Brendler","I have question about Europe. Thanks for the disclosure on the co-batch transaction, but does that mean we exclude this transactions that had very well revenue yield set. Your prior commentary on European revenue yield being in the high teens would actually be in the 20s if you exclude these transactions. And then if you can just summarize, for PSD2, and all the changes that are taking place in Europe, you summarized that fundamental impact on your business, it seems to be positive at this point, and if it is, just give us a little color on why? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So, on the European revenue yield, first of all, just to make sure that everybody understands our European revenue yields -- Chris, can you please put us on mute, please?","Chris Brendler","Yes...","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thank you. ","Ajay Banga","Well, that sounds pretty exciting, wherever you are.","Martina Hund-Mejean","What we have said in the past, our global yield is around 21 basis-points. And we talked about our competitors\u2019 yields because the information was out there, kind of in the 10-9 basis-points, and we are somewhere in between. That [ph] revenue yields will not change, whatsoever, by this particular change in terms of not charging de minimis fees on these co-batched transaction. There will be absolutely no impact to that. So you should not be assuming that our yields on GDV in Europe is changing. It is not.","Ajay Banga","So PSD2, the first thing we did was to -- for the most part we did was to enable access to the consumer bank accounts through a series of what they call PSPs. Payment System Providers. As we have got at least [ph] to a series of some more competition, more innovation, and that's something we should expect to happen over the next few years. One thing is for sure. ACS will become even more relevant in the PSD2 environment. And you know that we have talked about that when we spoke to you about the reason that we were keen on getting into the ACS phase. We are literally into the fast ACS space.","There are other elements of PSD2. There is elements to do with strong customer authentication for the 24 online transactions. But depending on how it actually gets rolled-out, its could actually create either a hindrance to the simplicity of an ecommerce checkout or if it's done very smartly, it could actually make it smooth and safer. And obviously, we'd want the latter. But there's many conversations to be have between here and the actual implementation of the stronger consumer authentication philosophy that PSD2 raises.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","I think its notable Ajay that you are calling out services -- not the first time obviously -- as a differentiating point when you bid for business and win business. Given the success you\u2019ve had over an increasing standard period of time now, do you see competition, whether from traditional competitors or perhaps new entrants. I don\u2019t know off the top of my head, who those might be, but do you see folks trying to replicate the services success we had. And if you could comment a little bit on the competitive barriers you think you\u2019ve erection that can continue to share gains?","Ajay Banga","Actually I do see people coming into the system. But our services are not services generically. They are services that are very tightly connect back to the idea of an authentication clearing and settlement system that gives us the insight into a payment transaction. So on our services, be it loyalty and rewards, be it safety and security, be it the data analytics business or our managed services that we do with advisors, all of these connect back from that idea of being connected to the payment transaction, and the moment of truth when that happens. So I think we do a relatively good job of tying the two things together when we speak in terms of the logic of why a service we provide would be incremental value-add to the carrying authorization and settlement stream.","In a number of ways, competitive barriers are only as good as the investment you keep putting into them, they keep staying ahead in terms of both, technology and innovation. I mean, take safety and security. Anybody who will tell you that they figured it out of safety and security is probably somebody you should run a mile from, because there is no such right answer. There is a continuous effort of people trying break in to everyone systems. You read that all the time. So you're only as good in safety and security as the efforts you keep putting into it to keep your clients having products and capabilities that keep them -- keeping their promise to their consumers. So we recently launched a series of products that use our official intelligence and machine learning in the safety and security space. We're going to keep doing that. We\u2019ve been -- I would tell you that we're in the first innings of a baseball game on that kind of space. We\u2019re a little better when it comes to tokenization. We\u2019re well into the middle of a game. We are better when it comes to EMVs, where we're well into the latter part of the game.","So different aspects of safety and security have got different levels of maturity, in terms of what they're solving for, and therefore require different levels of investments to keep them growing and competitive. And I think our competitive edge is that we have been allocating capital to these areas, and expenses for the last seven years. And it's one of the reasons why I keep telling you I'd like to make sure that you take the expansion of margin off the table as a permanent effort of this Company, and instead give you a really healthy margin, but use the revenue growth of the Company to invest back in creating competitive and frankly great differentiators for future revenue from where they\u2019re going.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman","Martina, at the Investor Community Day in September, you had discussed the same topic of services. And you had said that the services division did a 40% combined margin, if I'm remembering right. But the thing I want to get as you said that it would scale -- the services margins would scale over-time, I was wondering if you could help dimensionalize that. Like what's going on with service margins? Did they just scale because this was a really good quarter? Or how should we be thinking about services margins over time.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So here we are, just a few weeks after ICM, and you think there will be something different than what you\u2019re paying on services. First of all, there is no such thing as a services division. There're many different services that we are actually providing and here I called out three, but they a ton of other ones, right. So I don't want you to just bundle this together. We bundle it together, because it's an easier way of contrasting it to our core business. So in terms of what I said on the margin is that when you add all the services with their many different margin profiles right back to what Ajay has been actually explaining on this, on the safety and security side, together, if you were to add that together, the margin as a whole at this point in time is 40%. And what I also said is that -- and by the way this is not on a fully loaded basis. So things like corporate costs, et cetera, are not in there. But I also said that over-time as we are scaling these services, that we would believe that the margin would increase. And just to remind you, there was this one charge in ICM where it actually showed which services are at a higher margin level versus which services are lower margin level.","And the safety and security side was actually really at the higher level. And then we kind of worked our way down, advisors was the next one down, below 80 [ph] was the next one down, and processing was actually on the lowest side. So all of those services, we are working to scale and re-scale, you will be getting some better margin on these businesses.","Ajay Banga","Interestingly, I don't look at these as one unit. That's a really important issue. I don't look at the P&L that way. I don't look at the business that way. It is broken up among a bunch of different people. They come in and they talk to me on our monthly and quarterly business reviews. Each of them has a different conversation about what they are doing with their independent units and their businesses and that's how it is constructed all the way. What the real implication actually, is that our sales force on the front-end is learning how to sell something that\u2019s way beyond our traditional credit-debit, prepaid, and frankly even commercial is not as traditional. But these are completely non-traditional in a selling process. And some things they can do themselves, some of them they need experts to come help them. So we have that kind of sales structure built, and it's constantly changing as well to keep pace with where this space is going. So it's a mix of many things that are going into services. I just feel that so long as we can keep it tightly connected to our off siding [ph], clearing and settlement business, we\u2019re actually building yet another leg of a stool for our Company for the next couple of decades to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of David Koning with Baird. Your line is open.","David Koning","And I guess mainly my question is just around the PIN share gains that you mentioned. That\u2019s how the process transaction growth accelerate. I guess, first of all, is that share gain sustaining into Q3? And isn\u2019t that lower yielding, because your transaction yield was actually up 1% sequentially, but I would have thought this was lower yielding?","Martina Hund-Mejean","So you are absolutely right. In the United States, PIN debit is lower yielding, absolutely. There is no question about it. How did they take him in, and we already talked about this at the last earnings call is that we did win a couple of PIN agreements. So we\u2019ve showed up at the back of the card. And then you have to remember in the PIN debit market as the merchants are actually then aligning the routing, they\u2019re choosing the routing over which network to route. So there is a second thing that you have to think about in terms of yes you can buckle in the back of the card but then, do you actually get to see the transaction and we have a very analytical methodology in terms of trying to see how many transactions we want to see and that actually influences the pricing that we put out in the market every day. And so you will see our picture going up and down. So you saw it in the third quarter going up. There is this new agreements coming in. You saw in our three weeks in October, it\u2019s coming a little bit down. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a little bit less process transactions. So you should expect it goes up and down.","Ajay Banga","By the way on the previous earnings call or somewhere, I once explained that we go to some of the larger merchants. The level of sophistication that goes into the decision making of routing of a PIN debit transaction is way beyond the price. The price is interesting and it kind of stable-states but they do an enormously sophisticated thinking on the time taken for approval, on the number of turndowns on all kinds of aspect s. And you can move up and down the routing table, five times a day in some of these merchants, depending on what\u2019s going on. And so it's a little difficult to predict where that goes, but it\u2019s lower yield business. So the overall impact on the revenue stream of the Company tends to be buffered or let\u2019s say shock absorbed. But it\u2019s an interesting learning for all of us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Tim Willi","Just wanted to touch on the comments around loyalty, and just in general, when you sort of talk with merchants, with banks about that topic, is there any sort of new dynamic or way that they are thinking about approaching it particularly with the continued evolution of mobile payments, shopping, in store? Just anything you might be able to add there and sort of how you think about the momentum around that business line?","Ajay Banga","There's actually a series of things going on in loyalty and rewards. One of those you've actually picked the correct topic, which was e-commerce, digital mobility, the whole space. If you think about this, it is almost like simple things like cash back become even more attractive. But even voucher management and the management of keeping track of your loyalty rewards card number and how it all accumulates into that, all those become very important, even more so than in the physical world.","The loyalty business has got many elements to it. It's got the accumulation of rewards. It\u2019s got the offers every day that go into the system. It's got the aspect of what\u2019s funded by banks and what\u2019s funded by merchants. It's got the aspect of are you a complete program manager in some markets or are you only providing a portion of the service, and only a portion of the value chain. As you know, we bought Pinpoint in Asia and Australia. Pinpoint is a complete program manager. Truaxis on the other end is a merchant reward generating engine, which is not a complete program manager. And it's something we bought a couple of years before Pinpoint.","So we\u2019ve got to see the different capabilities now in the Company. And in some ways, we are probably one of the more interesting global players on loyalty and rewards. But you've got to package it very tightly with as I said the clearing, authorizing and settlement business, whether in digital or in the physical space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan with CLSA. Your line is open.","Tom McCrohan","Just trying to get a sense of trajectory of operating expense growth going forward, and just looking at history as averaging high single digits or higher than at this year, and I know you don\u2019t want to give forward guidance at all. But maybe you can just maybe speak to maybe the intensity of investment spending? Has it gotten more intense recently, given all geographic expansion, all the digital changes, everything that\u2019s going on in the space? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Clearly, Tom over the last couple of years, I would say, over the last three years, the authenticity of the investments has really taken-off. Just imagine what have all happened in the digital space, a significant amount of spend into the digital space. But then in addition for us to do be developing all of the services, so what we did from an advisor point of view, from a data analytics point of view, from a loyalty and from a safety and security investment point of view, some of the investments that Ajay was talking earlier about, was very important for us to do.","Some of the numbers are masked in terms of when you look at the foreign exchange hedging activity that came in, in 2016, which actually was a benefit there for us. And in 2016, it was a drag. So when you actually take that out, our operating expense growth is relatively similar. We would continue to expect that we will have to invest. And again, I am not going to go into 2017, but as you can see for 2016, we really have not changed our forecast at all in terms of how we think we are rounding out this year, which is the low double-digit growth number that we gave on a currency neutral basis.","Ajay Banga","I'll add one element to that conversation. This discipline that Martina has in our Company around acquisition is that at the end of two years, the acquisition becomes part of our base. When we talk to you, we\u2019re talking about our base expenses as well. The acquisitions we are doing, because it\u2019s the kind of industry we are in, don\u2019t exactly come fully loaded with revenue and unloaded in expense. They tend to come with capabilities that bring expenses and revenue that we need to build over a period of years by putting them together with what we sell.","Typically the lag in that, the driving [ph] lag of that creates a higher growth rate in expenses than on revenues for the first few years of owning that property. That\u2019s part of what we are talking about when we talk about putting investment, capital and expense dollars to work. The acquisitions are all in areas of strategic growth opportunity for us, and a number of them are in the services space that Martina was loosely talking about a little while ago. And that's what we're putting our capital to work at. But a lot of our expenses, aside from the acquisitions tend to go into the digital space, because that\u2019s where a lot of opportunity will get laid out over the next decade. Revenue is not as much as stating our capabilities right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Chris Donat","Ajay, I wanted to go back to something you said in your prepared remarks about inbound cross-border volume into the UK being strong. I'm just trying to understand how sustainable this might be. And I'm wondering if you can comment on anything from historical examples of devaluations or sort of the opposite case where the Swiss franc appreciated in January 2015, and how that affected outbound volumes with Switzerland. Just trying to understand if UK is going to see a lot of inbound volumes for months or years here?","Ajay Banga","So first of all, I'm glad you called them prepared remarks. Barbara's always when I'm speaking because she's tracking all that I've said. I don't always follow the script. But I will use your comment as proof of my being relatively helpful. The second part is the UK. I was thinking of the other question, I'm just cracking up a little. I'm taking it out on Barbara for 10 years of this. So the UK, be careful about assuming that a lower currency will necessarily lead to inbound travel, either tourist related or business related. It works in a place like the UK because it is one of the world's most attractive tourism destinations.","If you drop the currency value in Venezuela, it doesn't lead to anything. But it does in the UK because of the nature of the UK being what it is as an attractive location. And in addition, and what we're seeing really in the third quarter, I don't know whether I can tell you right now off the top of my head - I actually don't know whether the break-up is commercial traffic or tourist traffic. So I guess Martina knows that. I don't know it today. But I do know that you can't assume that tourist traffic or even business traffic will necessarily follow the pattern of a currency moving around.","Right now, there's no doubt that in the UK tourism is up one. Two, there is a great deal of re-interest in acquiring assets in the United Kingdom. Because if you were sitting outside of the UK, the values of assets in the UK has not only gone down by the change in the currency, they've also gone down by the extreme reaction that the market had to the fears around Brexit. That has also created a lot of interest in people travelling in to look at assets in the UK.","Again, I don't know if that will persist because the latest UK GDP report actually shows the Brexit response to be kind of enhancing, which will take time to come. It won't happen this quarter in terms of real GDP change. And so this may change the valuation of market assets in the UK. I haven\u2019t drawn too many conclusions either from the past or even the UK specifically about where this is going.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So just one thing to add, for the main travel destinations, we are seeing some of this over the last 10 years. So when you look for instance where the dollar is trading versus where the pound is trading, versus where the euro is trading, tourists are actually relatively sophisticated, who go to these kind of locations and we have seen that the tourism travel is getting adjusted. If people are coming to the New York or people coming to London or people going to Paris, the people are adjusting their travel plans because of some of the factors of the currency. We\u2019ve seen that over the last 10 years. But as Ajay said, that does not expand to many other countries. It\u2019s really for the top tourist destinations.","Ajay Banga","Kind of shopping destinations. The U.S. right now inward tourist traffic is down with the dollar being strong whereas outdoor travel by Americans is quite strong. And so those are all just natural things that we ought to do as well.","Barbara Gasper","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis","One quick, Martina question, it did look like underneath the covers, Asia volumes were a little bit unusually low this quarter. I was curious what was driving that? And then for Ajay, it looks with this flurry of announcements around wallet interoperability and convergence that kind of gets little bit complicated in terms of what\u2019s going to be accepted where. How do you just envision how MasterPass will play into the overall wallet landscape and how you see it evolving? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Lisa, first on the volumes you are absolutely right. On the Asia Pacific the volumes year-over-year are little bit lower. China plays into that. We are now at low single digits from China growth point of view that was higher last year. Australia, India and Indonesia, also had a little bit of lower growth.","Ajay Banga","MasterPass, my view is that on a small mobile screen, it's unlikely that merchants on their checkout page for browsers, I am talking browser right now, which is still the largest portion of digital commerce. That probably will be a very large portion for the next four-five years. It's very unlikely that you are going to find them putting many different wallets up in the checkout page, because the total space available on a mobile phone is relatively restricted. And therefore there is going to be some kind of trend towards creating the right infrastructure wallet acceptance overtime.","And I think you will find the kind of things we are trying to do, we are trying to ensure that one of the brands in the checkout page is MasterPass, because if you could put your user digital wallets, as well as user wallets to all using MasterPass as an acceptance brand then that's a good thing. In our view and I've said this many times, MasterPass is not a B2C effort. It is a B2B effort. What I am doing is not just building wallets, because a bank could have their own wallet, a merchant could have their own wallet, or they could take a wallet from us private-label to open APIs, that doesn't matter. It all can come through in a safe secure way using token come through a MasterPass acceptance path.","And the idea is to build all our services capabilities onto open APIs, and we have already done that in a substantial way. If you go to mastercard.developer.com, or developer.mastercard.com, I think I'm mixing up what came first and what came later. But I think developer.mastercard.com, you'll find that it's relatively easy if you do strike a deal with us to get the cryptogram to unlock the API to then connect it up to your capabilities, either as a merchant or an issuer.","So, I would see MasterPass not as a wallet, that\u2019s just for the long time, I see MasterPass as a digital strategy and as a future brand for our Company. I see the MasterPass system as an acceptance system that enables safe secure payments, that enables open APIs to be connected to that for services. And that\u2019s the offering which is very partner centric and enables issuers to own their consumer experience by making it digital-by-default and connecting it to their online banking applications. It enables digital giants to create a seamless acceptance system, and it enables merchants to not have to repeat their acceptance capability time-after-time, because once they\u2019re on MasterPass, they can accept the others. That is what we are trying to do.","Barbara Gasper","Ajay, some closing comments...","Ajay Banga","Yes, sure. So, couple of closing thoughts. And just to sum up, I think our business continues to perform well. I think you see that reflected in our strong revenue and earnings growth, and that\u2019s despite the usual uneven global economy that everyone talks about. I think we are executing well against our strategy. We have our ups and downs, but we are executing consistently, growing our share, continuing to leverage services as a strategic differentiator to further drive our core business around the world.","We\u2019re in a very dynamic industry and I was just talking to Lisa, we are working very hard to deliver secure digital payment experience for our consumer using MasterPass across all devices all channels. And of course I continued to believe in the long runway driven by strong secular growth opportunities that we have and we continue to hopefully position ourselves well for that future. So, thank you for your continued support of the Company. Thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. All participants may now disconnect."],"13819":["Mastercard, Inc.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter 2018 Mastercard earnings call.","Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website mastercard.com. Additionally the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.","Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a currency neutral basis and exclude special items unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. Please note that due to our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan entity starting this year we're providing additional information regarding our switched transaction and card growth rates. The adjusted growth rates eliminate Venezuelan switched transactions and card counts from prior periods so that you can better understand the underlying growth rates of our business. Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted growth rates. These are the only supplemental operational metrics which are significantly impacted by the deconsolidation.","Finally, as set forth in more detail on our earnings release I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everybody. We're off to a very strong start this year. Our first quarter net revenue growth of 27% and EPS growth of 43% versus a year ago on a currency neutral basis and excluding those special items. But even if you exclude the impact of the accounting changes, the acquisitions, and a couple of other items that affect year over year growth comparisons, all of which Martina will explain to you in some more detail later, our underlying net revenue growth was up 20% and operating income was up 27%. All these results are driven by the focus of our folks, of our employees, on execution and solid business fundamentals as we continue to invest for the long term future of our company.","Now the macroeconomic front. We are continuing to see overall growth. We are, however, keeping a very close watch as central banks around the globe evaluate normalizing their monetary policies by reducing fiscal stimulus. The U. S. continues to perform well, low employment, healthy consumer confidence. Retail spending remains strong and our SpendingPulse estimates are increasing to 5.3% for the quarter versus a year ago. Now remember that estimate is ex-auto, ex-gas and we believe that's the best way to look at the underlying trends in retail spending.","Now when looking at the rest of the world, we see generally favorable conditions. Europe remains positive overall with retail sales growth in the UK has picked up in the first quarter although showed some deceleration in March, again according to SpendingPulse in the U.K. We do remain concerned about the potential impacts of Brexit. Latin America continues its recovery, lower unemployment, improved consumer confidence. And there we will continue to monitor for potential impacts from the elections particularly in Brazil and in Mexico and of course the whole NAFTA renegotiation.","Most of the economies in Asia continue trending positively and more stable oil prices and I think a number of government initiatives have been driven some improvement in the Middle East and Africa region. If you put that together, we expect the global economy to remain positive absent any significant impact from geopolitics or trade risks.","Meanwhile we are driving healthy double digit volume and transaction growth for Mastercard across most of our markets. We're growing share and we're executing on our strategy as we move into 2018. And let me give you a few examples. In the U.S., we continue to see good progress in consumer credit. The Barclays Arrival Premier World Elite Mastercard, that's a mouthful, was just launched and includes premium benefits designed to attract and retain the traveling consumer, such as an annual loyalty bonus and airport lounge access. This builds on the momentum from other recent U.S. affluent product wins like the Capital One Saver Card, the Bank of America Cash Rewards Card for which by the way Mastercard issuance has now begun and Bass Pro and Cabela's which we announced last quarter.","Now turning to co-brands. We're making real progress this quarter again including with Playground Battle which is launching a new Mastercard consumer credit product and will be migrating some of their existing private label cards over time. We've also renewed a number of co-brand relationships including with Shell. And now Kroger has begun converting cards to Mastercard following the win that we announced last year. In addition we're really pleased to be the exclusive network for PayPal's first consumer debit card in the U.S. which lets consumers and customers of theirs access funds in their PayPal accounts to shop online or in stores and to make withdrawals from ATMs worldwide. And that's consistent with our broader PayPal partnership which currently includes all PayPal credit and debit co-brands around the world.","In Europe we continue to gain share in key markets and I'm very pleased to say we're expanding our relationship with the Santander Group. In the U.K., Santander will issue Mastercard debit cards for its more than nine million consumer and commercial bank accounts, making this our largest debit slip in the U.K. to date. And this extends Mastercard's existing relationship with Santander U.K. on consumer and commercial credit and leverages our capabilities in digital fraud solutions and some of our exclusive sponsorship assets. Now that's in addition to a credit and debit renewal. Again, both consumer and commercial that we just signed with Banco Santander in Spain.","We're also pleased to announce a new deal for the U. K. Post Office Travel Money program one of the largest consumer prepaid programs in the U.K., to be exclusively Mastercard branded. In Latin America, building on our strong underlying momentum we've added the American Airlines co-brand in Brazil this quarter. We launched a new cashback consumer credit card with HSBC in Mexico. And we're driving innovative consumer and commercial solutions with the largest digital bank in Brazil, Banco Inter, and providing differentiated loyalty services for a number of customers in the region, including Banco Santander in Brazil.","And we are strengthening our position in other markets as well. This quarter we extended our Commonwealth Bank of Australia credit and debit deal which includes a portfolio flip. In India, we signed a comprehensive debit agreement with Bank of Baroda that includes advisers, consulting, data analytics, and managed services. As you know, our focus on India is on growing both the issuing side and merchant acceptance in a number of different ways, including with digital technology such as QR codes, and we have talked about this in the past.","Shifting to account paid (08:36) faster payments, we are making progress with Vocalink and we're in the RFP response phase for a number of potential opportunities around the world. But the PromptPay mobile payment system in Thailand is a good example of an international payment system powered by Vocalink gaining scale quickly. What PromptPay does is it enables bank transfers using a mobile number or a citizen ID. And as of April, 14 million users in Thailand have signed up, generating more than 170 million transactions since its launch in January 2017 and the equivalent of about $16 billion in consumer, business, and government payments in the last six months alone.","On digital, you heard us recently announce our support of the EMVCo standards for simple and unified payments. When people shop online and in-app, they expect the same convenience and security that they have in store. And just like the single acceptance terminal in a physical store, we believe there should be one common checkout button in the digital world. That will deliver tremendous benefits for consumers, for merchants, and for issuers. A common checkout button would give consumers a consistent, secure, low-friction checkout flow, making it far easier for merchants to implement secure digital payments and provide issuers with improved fraud detection and prevention capability. And that should result in lower abandonment rates and more sales, good for everybody in the ecosystem.","Since these standards also build on our tokenization services and authentication services, I think that brings us closer to a secure token-based world. 75% of all our cards are already enabled to be tokenized, and we see demand from merchants like Netflix and now Flipkart in India as well. And when you tokenize payment details at a merchant site, they essentially become useless if a fraudster steals them and tries to use them somewhere else. More importantly, it eliminates the need to manually update account numbers when cards are replaced. That happens automatically. It helps merchants and consumers by reducing declined transactions; again, good for everybody in the ecosystem.","What's the bottom line? The bottom line is the EMV framework will bring the benefits of standardization, openness, and interoperability to consumers, to merchants, to acquirers, to issuers in the digital space. Now of course, we at Mastercard will continue to innovate and offer differentiated services for consumers and merchants in a whole range of ways, from loyalty and user experience to analytics with new kinds of security and authentication tools that we can provide, including with our recent acquisitions of NuData and Brighterion.","Staying on our digital strategy, we are developing new ways for consumers to pay and for merchants to get paid through QR codes and particularly in emerging markets. A recent example is the partnership we announced with M-KOPA in East Africa to make it easier for people to access reliable energy sources to power their homes and businesses. And the idea is to boost productivity and prosperity. Masterpass QR enables people to finance solar power through small daily payments by scanning a QR code with their smartphones or entering the merchant ID into their older feature phones. Distribution partnerships on social platforms like Facebook and mobile financial services platforms like Tigo Pesa in Tanzania further extend the availability of QR codes to millions of users at a time.","And finally, we continue to expand our suite of differentiated services. As many of you know, the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe, known as GDPR, establishes new rules for the use of personal data, and it puts consumers in greater control over how their data is used. Now we've always been committed to strong protection for consumer privacy. And you know, for example, that we only work with data in our analytics business on a fully anonymized and aggregated basis. We are very well positioned, therefore, for compliance with GDPR by the late May deadline across the full scope of the new requirements of this regulation.","Having said that, one part of GDPR is related to how data must be anonymized for later use. And in this area, we've taken what I think is a particularly innovative approach. We have designed a compliant solution for this, founded an independent trust called Truata to offer this service commercially. Essentially, customers of Truata will remove personal identifiers from their data before sending that information to Truata, which further anonymizes it to protect an individual's identity. Customers will then receive analytics and aggregated insights back to use in their products and solutions. That way you ensure that the data and the resulting analytical capability and output can never be linked back to an individual. So that's a service that Truata's customers, including Mastercard, will use to further scale data and analytics services in a secure and compliant way.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.","We are very pleased to deliver a strong start to the year, even when you exclude the 4 ppt tailwind from foreign exchange to net revenue and the 6 ppt to net income, which was primarily driven by the appreciation of the euro since last year.","Here on page 3, I will now highlight the numbers on a currency neutral basis. And also I will exclude special items related to litigation commissions. Net revenue grew 27%, driven by strong underlying performance and it includes a 4 ppt benefit from the new revenue recognition rules and a 2.5 ppt benefit from acquisitions. Excluding these items, underlying revenue growth was 20%.","Operating expenses increased by 32% which includes 20 ppt of growth due to acquisitions our charitable contribution to the Center for Inclusive Growth and the impact of the new revenue recognition rules. Underlying expense growth was 12%.","Operating income grew by 23% or 27% on an underlying basis based on the adjustments to revenue and operating expense I just noted. Net income was up 39% reflecting strong operating results and the impact of the U.S. tax reform, which contributed approximately 8 ppt to this net income growth.","EPS was $1.50 per share, up by 43% year-over-year with share repurchases contributing $0.03 per share. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $608 million through April 27, 2018.","So let me turn to page 4, and here you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 14% on a local currency basis and that's up 1 ppt from last quarter. We saw solid double-digit growth across most regions.","U.S. GDV grew 10%, up 1 ppt from last quarter and was made up of credit and debit growth of 9% and 12% respectively. And outside of the U.S. volume growth was 16%, up 2 ppt from last quarter primarily due to Europe and Asia-Pacific. Cross-border volume grew at a healthy 21% on a local currency basis, driven by growth in all regions, with the strongest growth contribution coming from Europe.","Turning to page 5, switched transactions continued to show strong growth at 17% globally, normalized to exclude Venezuelan transactions as we no longer consolidate that entity. We saw healthy double-digit growth in switched transactions across all regions. And transaction growth was also up sequentially, led by Europe and the U.S.","In addition, global card growth was 6%, again normalized for Venezuela. Globally, there are 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued.","Now let me turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The 27% net revenue increase was primarily driven by strong volume and transaction growth as well as by growth in services. The new revenue recognition rules contributed 4 ppt to the growth rate, higher than what we anticipate for the total year.","Excluding this impact and acquisitions, underlying net revenue growth was 20%. This growth was stronger than expected due to the delay of new deals resulting in lower rebates and incentives for the quarter and higher growth in services and cross-border.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 20%, while worldwide GDV grew 14%. And the difference is primarily due to the impact of the new revenue recognition rules. Cross-border volume fees grew 19%, while cross-border volume was up 21%. The 2 ppt gap is mostly due to the higher intra Europe growth.","Transaction processing fees grew 22%, primarily driven by the 17% normalized growth in switched transactions as well as revenues from our various service offerings and from Vocalink. Finally, other revenues grew 33% driven by increases in our advisers and safety and security services. As a reminder, most of the Vocalink revenues show up in this line which accounts for 10 ppt of this growth.","Moving on to page 7, you can see that total operating expenses increased 32% excluding special items on a currency neutral basis. As I referenced earlier, this includes an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions, an 8 ppt impact from our charitable contribution of $100 million and a 3 ppt impact related to the new revenue recognition rules. Excluding these items, underlying expense growth was 12%. This reflects our investment in strategic initiatives such as digital infrastructure, safety and security platforms, data analytics and geographic expansion as well as higher costs related to our increased revenues in certain areas such as loyalty.","Turning to slide 8, let's discuss what we have seen in April through the 28th where all of our drivers are similar or a bit slower than our first quarter drivers but in line with our expectations and comprehended in the outlook that I will talk about in a moment. The numbers through April 28 are as follows. Starting with switched volume, we saw global growth of 14%. That's down 2 ppt from what we saw in the first quarter with solid growth in all regions. In the U.S. our switched volume grew 8%, down three ppt from the first quarter with lower growth in both credit and debit programs. Switched volume outside of the U.S. grew 18%, down 2 ppt from the first quarter. And globally switched transaction growth was 17%, the same as what we saw in the first quarter with healthy growth in each region. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 19% globally down 2 ppt sequentially in part due to the drop of crypto wallet funding.","Turning to slide 9 and our thoughts for the full year 2018, which I will describe on a currency neutral basis and excluding special items, our business fundamentals remain strong as we continue to grow share across our core products and expand our service offerings. We continue to forecast a healthy economic environment. And with a solid first quarter we now expect year over year revenue growth to be in the high teens percentage-wise, up from our previous expectations of mid-teens. As a reminder, this growth includes the impact of the new revenue recognition rules in 2018 and the full year effect of acquisitions which we continue to estimate will contribute about 3 points to growth on a combined basis.","As you can see on the orange bar at the bottom of the chart our organic growth excluding these items would be in the mid-teens range, up from our prior expectations of the high end of low double digits.","I would like to call out a few items related to the revenue profile for the year. First, we do expect deal closings and implementations to pick up from Q1 levels which will increase rebates and incentives in the following quarters. Second, we expect cross border growth to moderate somewhat. This is due to the recent drop-off in crypto wallet funding. And in addition, cross-border will also face tougher comps for the balance of the year given the strengthening of the euro during 2017. You can see this a bit already in our April metrics.","Thirdly, we do not expect to see as much revenue uplift in the next three quarters from the new revenue recognition rules as we saw in Q1. And finally, just a reminder that we have lapped the Vocalink acquisition at the end of April.","On expenses, we're accelerating our investments in strategic areas such as safety and security, digital and our B2B products. We're also seeing some increased operating costs related to our higher revenues, in particular related to some of our services such as loyalty. As a result of these factors, we now expect year-over-year expense growth to be in the mid-teens, up from our previous expectations of low double digits. This growth includes the impact of the new revenue recognition rules, the full year effect of acquisitions and impact of the contribution to our Center for Inclusive Growth.","When combined, we continue to estimate that these three items will contribute about 8 points to growth. Again as you can see on the orange bar at the bottom of the chart, expense growth on an organic basis excluding these items would be in the range of high single digits, up from our prior expectations of mid-single digits. With respect to our quarterly expense profile, as usual Q2 and Q3 will grow significantly more versus year ago than the fourth quarter.","A few other items of note. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a 2 ppt benefit to the top line and a 3 ppt benefit to net income for the year with the biggest uplift having already occurred in the first quarter given the profile of the year ago exchange rates. And the estimated tax rate of approximately 19% to 20% for the year, based on our current expectations of regional mix of earnings. Of note, the Q1 effective tax rate of 17.7% is lower than the expected full-year tax rate, as Q1 included discrete benefits of 2.3 percentage points.","With that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session. Warren?","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Martina. Operator, we're now ready for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Congrats on the solid results. I want to ask about the strength you're seeing in Europe and Asia in particular. Are those share gains versus the competitors, or is that just the overall growth in the markets? It's probably a little bit of both I'm guessing.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Yes, we're seeing both, Bryan. Actually in Europe, we're seeing domestic growth really showing up very nicely. Cross-border growth has actually improved from what the statistics that we have seen before, including what we're seeing, by the way, in the UK. So we are seeing very solid spend in the UK domestically. We see solid double-digit cross-border growth outbound of the UK as well as inbound into the UK. So we're seeing at the moment no clouds on the horizon, even though we are obviously worried about Brexit. We see very solid growth in Eastern Europe showing up.","In Asia-Pacific, what we're really seeing is that Australia is coming back a little bit. And we're also seeing some healthy growth, it's like in the high single digit rate, from a cross-border perspective in China.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, on the rebates and incentives side, the pickup you expect, is there any way to think about the cadence throughout the rest of the year? Will it pick up each quarter going through, or is it just a little bit of a pickup here in the second quarter as some of the deal closes? Thanks so much.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","You're asking me the $100 question here because that is always what I'm asking our people in the business. It really depends in terms of when we are signing agreements and when we're implementing the agreement. The best outlook that I have at this point in time is that probably Q3 is the high-water mark in terms of rebates and incentives. But again, once we close out Q2, we will let you know.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you, good morning. Could you comment on the pace of RFPs you're seeing in Europe for ACH-related offerings? Specifically I'm asking about Vocalink's positioning on Continental Europe ahead of PSD2.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So there are a number of RFPs out there, not just in Europe but around the world. We're participating in all of them. I don't think there's any change in the pace of RFPs based on the implementation dates of PSD2. A lot of the RFPs have to do with countries and locations trying to upgrade their clearinghouse systems over the years from what was built many years ago to what's more state of the art in terms of Fast ACH with better messaging and better data transmission capabilities connecting to directories and the like. That's what we are participating in.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. And then as a follow-up, could you comment on any update with respect to your B2B hub?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Yes, so that work progresses, and we are in the process of rolling out with the first client early in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, we already had a number of our clients who had relationships with AvidXchange. This is the partner we have used to build the B2B hub with. And those volumes are doing really well. In fact, one of those, for example, is KeyBank. And we have seen not just great volumes coming through, we've seen an increased share shift from check to card. So we've got good momentum on that commercial business beyond the B2B hub, as well with growth across Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Capital One, Citibank, and a bunch of other partners in commercial.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood, congrats on the strong results.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, it's Jamie at Susquehanna. Martina, I wanted a clarification, if I could. You were going quick there. But when you were talking about other revenue growth and then you had called out advisers and safety and security. I think, and I apologize if I wrote this down wrong, but you said there was 10 ppt of growth contribution from Vocalink. Is that \u2013 what's the antecedent? Are you referring to other revenue or services revenue or total revenue?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So the other revenues, as you know, has most of our services business included, and it grew for the quarter by 33%. And 10 percentage points of that was related to the acquisition that we did of Vocalink, so the underlying growth actually was 23%. And of the 23%, the line items that drove it most was advisers as well as safety and security.","The Vocalink acquisition, I just called it out because we still have not lapped the acquisition. Remember, we made the acquisition only on April 28, 2017, so it wasn't in there for the fourth quarter, so that's why we're calling it out for you. Of course, the impact in the second quarter will be much lower because you only have one month's worth of the Vocalink revenues coming in year over year.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it, thank you for the clarification. And then I guess like a moth to the flame, I've got to ask about the crypto. Let's see how to ask this one. That's a bigger callout than we had anticipated on the crypto. I guess what corridors are you seeing that come through and where is it deteriorating from? And do you think it will ever come back?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So the issue in this, first of all, in terms of the stacks, on the cross-border volume growth, the cryptocurrency funding or the crypto wallet funding really was 1 ppt. It was 1 ppt that we saw in the fourth quarter and it was 1 ppt that we saw in the first quarter.","What the issue is that a number of the banks have decided, in particular in the United States, that they would not allow the usage of cards for this particular funding vehicle. And that's why we have already seen a relatively significant decrease of the volume related to that event.","In terms of where the funding is coming from by country, we're seeing quite a bit coming out of the United States. We saw quite a bit coming out of Australia and some other select countries in Asia, and then a number of countries in Europe.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","The governments around the world \u2013 I was out in Asia recently. And Korea, for example, has pulled back on allowing some of these exchanges as well to operate. There's a lot of concerns even in Japan because one of their biggest exchanges got hacked into and has now been bought out by another company in an effort to bring that back to an even keel.","In general, the in and out of buying currency \u2013 a normal fair currency to put into a crypto wallet, which is what we were involved using our cards with, it depends a little bit on the interest in cryptocurrency. And as you can see, right now there's a little less interest than there was in the latter part of the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So when we did our earnings call last time, we actually said that this is not something we count on because we just don't know how to predict it or we don't even want to count it.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good morning. I had a question on the commentary around organic operating expense growth. So in the quarter it was 12%. I think you're guiding to kind of high single digits for the remainder of the year. So that to me would imply a step-down. But then there's the commentary about the significant ramp in investments or just continued advancement in investments. So I'm just trying to reconcile that statement a bit.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","It's really year-over-year comps, so you're going to have to look at where the operating expense numbers were in the second and the third and the fourth quarter of 2017. So it's just a reality of that. There's nothing really more to it, Dan.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","I can maybe add one more thing. So in the fourth quarter, often enough we go for lower A&M expenses. And you might see some of that too because we are trying to move some of that into the earlier quarters. But that's really \u2013 it's not going to be very different than what you saw last year.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then can you just provide some commentary around the step-down in these April statistics? You've already mentioned obviously cross-border but switching in global U.S., outside the U.S., they all kind of stepped down so. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Okay. So, first of all, I just want to remind you that this is completely in line with our expectations. And I comprehended it totally in the stats for 2018 from a net revenue point of view. But when you look at the U.S. where the switched volume is down, really predominantly it's because of the debit programs. And there it's a seasonality adjustment. You might remember that we are powering the Social Security benefits with Comerica for the United States.","And depending when they get paid, you have a little bit of an uptick in the first quarter. Secondly, we are also the provider for H&R Block in terms of tax reimbursements. And of course, in the first quarter, especially at the end of the quarter, there's actually quite a bit of an uptick which you don't expect to continue into the second quarter. So that's for the United States.","In terms of the volume outside of the U. S., 18% down 2 ppt. Look, I mean this is like \u2013 if it's 1 or 2 ppt or even 3 ppt here or there, it's little upticks and downticks country by country. I'm not going to go through all of this. But it's just what we see from time to time quarter-over-quarter.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Donald J. Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Ajay, on the common checkout button, can you talk a little bit about sort of a realistic timeline when you think this could be up and running? And I guess my question is, do you think that this approach will be a little more successful in terms of merchant penetration? I think my sense is over the years that it's been a little bit of a struggle for the networks under digital wallets.","And then, secondly, how important strategically is success here? Clearly if you look at where volumes are going, ecommerce is the future. And can you talk a little bit about that?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Sure, Don. I mean, look, ecommerce is definitely growing. And but remember we participate in ecommerce as well through the funding of lots of different wallets and methods of paying over the Internet, whether you pay from a phone or you pay from your computer. So ecommerce is growing which typically takes out cash as well and also does take out retail brick-and-mortar in some ways.","It's a good thing as far as we're concerned. It's all about digital payments. So I'm not fussed about that. And remember this that ecommerce at the end of the day is if that's what the consumer wants to do and that's how they want to interact, our job is to make sure the consumer can do that in a safe way, in a simple way, in a convenient way, in a way that meets their needs and gives them rewards and incentives and the like to do it.","So I'm actually quite inclined to think that that's where a lot of effort will go and think about the Internet of Things and digital physical commerce coming together, so all that's important. Therefore, finding a way to also grow in the digital space, not only by relying on other wallet providers but also giving our issuers a chance to be able to be present on merchants' checkout locations in an appropriate way, in a brand friendly way, in a simple way for consumers is also important.","And for merchants which is to me where it all started from as well, if you go to them with each network or each wallet attempting to create its own way to connect with a merchant, think through what that means. Forget big merchants. It's a nuisance for them. Think of the medium and smaller sized ones. It's a nightmare for them.","So the right way to this is the way we did the physical card business, take away the issues of multiple terminals in merchants' locations. It becomes impossible, difficult, expensive and inconvenient and make it simple for them with one terminal. That's what this is about. It's one checkout button.","And then after that, it flows the way you would normally flow with all the offers that we can provide from rewards and incentives and loyalty and security and all those things. So do I believe this is important? I absolutely do. Not just for the networks or the banks, I actually think it's really important for merchants and consumers. That's what I'm really focused on and why I'm a big supporter of the single checkout button. I think it's transformative for the industry as a whole, for the ecosystem. I think our job is to execute it well.","Now your first question is about timing. My belief is it that we better do this well. Somewhere over the course of the latter part of this year, you'll begin to see the first aspects of this coming out into the marketplace. You'll probably see a real push in the early part of next year.","Remember merchants have got to gear up for getting into this. Banks have got to gear up for getting into this. Normally the banks have already signed up to network digital wallets but also how they then offer it seamlessly to their customers for online enrollment.","There's a whole set of things to be done here if we're going to do it well for the merchant, the consumer and the issuer. That's what we're focused on.","Donald J. Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","And I just want to add one step to what Ajay has been saying on how important the ecommerce business is to us. In this quarter, the ecommerce business grew 25% okay?","So that's a very, very large growth. And by the way, these kind of stats we have been seeing quarter after quarter. It's either in the lower 20s, mid 20s or high 20s depends on which quarter you're looking at. So it's obviously a huge focus for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for the time and congrats on a nice quarter. Can I dig in a little bit more on the B2B strategy that you have? It sounds like the investments are going to be accelerated there.","Can you just be a little more specific on what specific strands of investment that you're going to accelerate there? Is it more partnerships? Is it more organic building of technology? Could you just be a little more detailed for us?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Sure, sure. So that's part of Martina's expense commentary that she was talking about, right? I mean look, we are taking advantage of two things. Let me put them in context.","One is better revenue growth and two is the tax reforms that have allowed us to think in terms of accelerating some of our investments in strategic areas. Commercial B2B is one of them but there's safety and security. There's everything we're doing at digital and contactless. There's all the work we're doing on expanding acceptance with QR codes and the like. There's the matter of loyalty and rewards. And so there's a bunch of places the money is going into.","Commercial and B2B is a very important part of that. That's why we called it out in a prior Investor Day. What are we doing? It's not just what we've done already which is commercial cards which, by the way, are growing well.","And that's \u2013 somebody asked me a question a little while back and I talked about good commercial growth in the U. S. with Bank of America and Capital One and Citi and elsewhere as well. That's typically inside the traditional card based business, whether physical cards or virtual cards. And that basically aims at corporate T&E, at fleet cards, at purchasing cards, at B2B payments through Amadeus and the like. That's one part of it.","That uses things like Smart Data. It uses In Control. Those are all, I would say, assets of ours that we are continually investing in to keep them state of the art but they're there. We own them, we have them.","What's interesting is we're all seeing interest beyond the typical bankcard issuers. The technology providers who embed commercial payment solutions into their software, into their platforms are getting interested in our ability to provide them with a full service suite when they go and sell to small and medium merchants. As well as payment aggregators in verticals like construction and insurance where we haven't had great penetration over the years.","Then there's the third aspect, which again somebody asked me about it, the B2B Hub and all the work in the accounts payable place. The idea there is to streamline accounts payable which otherwise has over the years become more and more of a nightmare to most people.","There's lots of people you're buying from, lots of people you're paying to. Trying to reconcile those two together and find a way to ensure that complicated payments are reconciled appropriately and don't leave you with enormous issues at the end of the cycle as well as providing access to easy credit. That kind of stuff is what the Mastercard B2B Hub can help with.","We don't provide the credit but we can help enable the efficiency of the accounts payable space. And then the last one which we're actually quite focused on and which shouldn't be the last but it's just that way I'm talking about it is actually capturing cross-border B2B payments. That's where Mastercard Send and HomeSend on the one hand combined with Vocalink on the other is to me the killer app.","So today I can go to the bank and go there and say I can meet your B2B needs. You want them through ACH and direct debit, talk to me. You want them through virtual cards, talk to me. You want them through commercial cards, talk to me. You want them through any aspect, I can help you. And I can help you Mr. Bank, and Mr. Medium and Small Merchant by making life easier for you, quicker for you, more efficient, easier to reconcile and streamline. That is our B2B strategy.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then just any update on the economics of how you see the Vocalink business kind of being deployed, be it more network effects or network economics versus kind of being an arms dealer or a mix. I know that was something you talked about at your last Analyst Day. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Arms dealer? I don't know if I used that. That's an interesting topic. So here's the deal. I'll start off and I'll give it to Martina. My view is that Vocalink will go in the marketplace, as I said, one, through RFPs where they are actually creating or participating in the infrastructure of fast payments in a country.","The UK is where we not only participate in helping the infrastructure, we run it. In other countries like in the United States, it's our software that's powering the clearinghouse which is in the process of rolling out this instant ACH systems.","Like that we are the participants as I said in Thailand, that's the example I gave you about that. One where we are more than just software and also helping them actually manage their capabilities. We do that in Sweden. We do that in Singapore. We do that in a number of countries. We're participating in RFPs for that kind of work in a number of markets around the world from Latin America to Asia.","There is a second aspect, which is to be able to bring our knowledge and capabilities of this to banks as they attempt to make ACH become a bigger part of their payments but do it in a way that takes it from being a relatively blunt instrument where reconciliation and settlement is happening, sometimes one day later, sometimes two days later, to on-time, real-time instant. And what that changes in terms of the value added services they can provide and therefore find a way to build loyalty with their customer base. That work is another space. We call that fondly the scheme kind of thinking.","Then there's a third which is more application built, which you read about us launching in the UK, the Pay by Bank app which is an ability for banks to pay at a merchant space and offer their consumer the choice of paying by card or by direct debit or with some kind of economics and value-added services that make sense for the consumer, the merchant, and the bank. All that is part of what Vocalink's up to. It's a different set of strategies for different markets. It's is not going to be one sort of fit of the code for every country.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","From an economic point of view, typically when we go to the infrastructure layer, it's either a license fee. That is not a lot of money we always tell to our investors, or there is a basic fee for people who are using the infrastructure. Where the money is really going to be made is what Ajay referenced, when you run the scheme or when you have an app. And typically transaction-based pricing, very similar to our core model, comes in at that point in time. And that's what we're already proving out in the UK with the Pay by Bank app.","And then lastly, on top of that with the services that we're building, and we showed a number of those services in our last Investor Day in September, that is a normal pricing if it's a data analytics service or if it's a loyalty service or if it's a fraud service. That's k the normal pricing that we have established already from a core perspective. So those are the three layers in terms of what you should be watching out for us to develop.","Having said all of this, this will take some time. This is not like we're turning the key and suddenly you're going to see this all coming in next year. It's going to take us a number of years to really prove the case.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","And the reason for that is we're dealing with clearinghouses in different countries. These are not individual one-on-one bank to us deals. These are deals where you're going to get either the government or a set of banks that own the clearinghouse together to be able to migrate to Fast ACH. There are lots of implications of this. But it makes us the player that can offer choice to a country, to an issuer, to a merchant, and to a consumer. And choice is what we are focused on.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question, good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe address two items on debit. One is do you think that the \u2013 it seems like the trends are pretty strong globally. Anything to call out in terms of your debit share from an issuance perspective beyond the things that you noted in terms of Kroger and your confidence that can improve from here?","And then the second one relates to the transactions processed on network or switched transactions. That seemed to step down a little bit. Was that purely an effect due to European mix, or was there something else going on there?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So first of all, our debit performance is very strong in the United States and in Europe, really in the rest of the world too, but that's the two questions that you asked. In the U.S., as you can see, we're winning some share. When you look at transactions in the U.S., it really depends which quarter you're looking at because the routing of the PIN transactions by the merchants can make a difference. And you might remember that we won quite a few of those routing RFPs quite some quarters ago, and some of those are lapping. But also merchants make dynamic decisions from time to time. So I don't think you should be reading into that anything from a U.S. point of view other than that we continue to make good progress. From a European...","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","We also have the PayPal debit deal in the U.S., which will help us.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Which will help us. It hasn't rolled in, of course at this point in time. And then in Europe, in Europe I think we're very strong in debit in most countries in Europe. There's only one country where we had a little bit more of an issue, which is the UK And as you can see from a number of these announcements that we have been making over the last few quarters as well as what Ajay talked about this morning with Santander, we are really going back into that space and being able to compete effectively. You are not seeing some of those stats yet coming into our actual numbers. It will typically take a 6 to 12-month period for the implementations to happen and for those portfolios to flip over.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Last time we talked about Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel in France. We got a debit flip there. We've got ING Bank in Italy. I just talked about Bank of Baroda in India. You'll find that our growth rate on debit in India is strong. And over the next couple of quarters, you'll see us talking about the India debit share there.","The debit, you're aiming at millennials. You're aiming at everyday spend. You're aiming at contactless, which really attacks cash. So you're also obviously aiming at ATM withdrawals and getting cash out of ATMs. Debit meets all those needs. And so debit is important to us, and that's where we're focused on. We're also doing a lot of work on converting some Maestro cards to Mastercard debit because that gives banks and consumers a better capability of using those cards. So there's a lot of building blocks to our strategy on debit.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","The one thing, Jim, I just want to point out because I'm not sure if you're getting confused because of that is, remember we are excluding the results of Venezuela starting the first quarter of 2018, which in particular impacts transactions. It doesn't really impact volume. And so you're not seeing \u2013 you're seeing the same 17% growth or so that we had in transactions. But in fact, if you strip that out, then the transaction growth in the fourth quarter was 15% ex-Venezuela, and in the first quarter is 17%. So you actually saw an acceleration from a transaction point of view.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Thanks, guys. I was just wondering if you could give us some rough sizing on your China outbound business as a percent of total cross-border. We just continue to get some questions around the expanded acceptance of Alipay and WeChat Pay. I know we've talked about this a little bit in the past. But as the acceptance footprint in the U.S. and other Western countries expands and more Chinese citizens traveling in the West potentially use some of those services, is this something that's significant enough to ultimately move the needle on those outbound China cross-border volumes? Is it too small to really matter? Just any context there would be helpful.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","I'm going to start and then probably Ajay is going to add some comments on it. First of all, we're seeing from a cross-border volume growth point of view, outbound in China high single digits, okay? That's what we saw in the last quarter and then it went around that for the last few quarters.","The Alipay, the Tenpay, that's not a big impact at this point in time. What is much more of an impact, what happened in China last year in terms of the dual-branded cards were actually not allowed to be issued or banks took the PBOC guidance not to issue dual-branded cards. And that got changed some quarters ago where the banks were willing to again go into the dual-brand card business. And dual-branded cards as you know both have a cup logo which is the card is being used domestically as well as Mastercard logo on it where the card is being used cross-border. And that actually did impact our growth when they were cut off and it does impact our growth positively as they're starting to come back into the market.","In the meantime, we have issued quite a few what's called single-branded cards. So these are just Mastercards. There's no domestic logo on it. And those single-branded cards are used by customers only in the cross-border context. As you can appreciate, those cards have to work their way up to top of wallet, right, because a Chinese consumer is not going to be able to use it daily in China. But we're going to have to make sure that they put out that card overseas and there are lots of loyalty programs and other things that we're doing actually with our issuers. But those cards also carry less spend than the dual-branded cards because they're less top of wallet. That was much more of an impact than what you saw from the pays.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","The only think I'd add to that is that you've got to realize that I think China is an interesting market going forward. But today, total numbers, it's a relatively small part of what Mastercard is. So yes, some of the cross border from China goes one way or the other, one quarter it's up, one quarter it's down. It's interesting, but it doesn't transform our life. Yes, out some period of time, some years depending on how the strategy in China plays out, I believe there is a very interesting opportunity for our company there. And we are deeply thinking our way through that. And that's where our focus is.","That, by the way, includes our ability to operate for domestic processing in China which, as you know, we've got our own effort to apply to get the ability to get a domestic processing license. We went in there with a joint venture structure, constructed in a way that brings lot of local expertise with us into the system but enables us to offer value added services from our technology overseas as well. So it's a very nice balance of allowing local business people to be helpful to our company while also helping us add value from our global constructed services.","We're obviously waiting for clarity from the Chinese government and talking to them regularly. Clearly, the U.S. China trade circumstances will help or impede some of that movement, but I don't measure this in three months and six months. I measure this over a few years. I've been here nine years and I've been working on this topic for nine years. So it's not going to change in a day. Meanwhile, Alipay and Tenpay are actually partners of ours in a number of ways. So I have a lot of respect for them. I admire their capability. I think we can do a lot together with them as well.","There is a change on the ground in China as well with the regulator and the government beginning to put a more constructive playing field around what banks are doing and what digital players are doing. And I think you should kind of go and study that a little bit to get a sense of this isn't going forward, what it was looking back. It's just there's a whole new landscape working out in China and we believe that there's opportunity for us as well as others in what's a very large marketplace.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Hey, Tien-Tsin.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, thank you. Good morning. Hi. Good morning. Good stuff. I don't have a lot of stuff. Just wanted to ask on the regulations side, because we've been getting this question. Just on the euro cross-border and dynamic currency conversion proposals. Any implications for Mastercard?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Not really. I mean, I think implications always in a sense is going to help get it implemented, but I actually think it's consumer-friendly. And so if you do it the right way it actually helps consumers understand what they're paying, when they're paying and how much they're paying. So I don't think it's \u2013 implications is there to get it done, but it's probably the right thing to do.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. And then just one quick one. Just on the services side. It sounds like very strong growth there. I'm curious, given all the focus and sensitivity on data sharing, does this change in any way your thinking on monetizing analytics and info services and things of that nature?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","No. In fact, Tien-Tsin, I believe that we can set a bar on how GDPR kind of rules get implemented in different parts of the world. We are ready with the GDPR work in Europe. We're are not really ready with our work. We're creating a commercial opportunity out of what most people think is a cost.","And we believe if you do it the right way you can still protect consumer privacy. You could still protect their interests, as you and I want our interest provided, but still provide you with good value added services that include your ability to choose how your data is shared. I don't see that as conflicting.","Remember that the majority of what we see as data today is essentially not consumer specific. The overwhelming majority is only of card number, the dollar value, or the euro value, the time of the transaction and the merchant code. So I don't think that's changing.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Ajay, any final questions or any comments.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you all for your question. We'll wrap up with some closing thoughts. We are off to a very good start of the year with record revenue and earnings growth this quarter. Martina actually has willingly raised our expectations for the year as well, which is a first. We're pleased with our deal momentum with wins like Santander in Europe. And that leverages our differentiated service offerings. That's what Tien-Tsin is also getting at just now.","And to advance our digital strategy, we are executing on delivering the best digital experience across all channels, all devices, in both developed and emerging markets.

We believe that although the recent hurricanes and weather impacts have had significant localized impacts, I think they're demonstrating a limited effect on the U.S. economy overall.","According SpendingPulse estimates, U.S. retail sales increased during this last quarter by 4.2%, ex auto, ex gas, a little bit better than the quarter prior to that. Economic growth in Europe is steady, driven by Germany and France, with an upward trend in consumer confidence and lower overall unemployment. In the UK, the outlook is a little more mixed with unemployment rates the lowest in years, but with concerns over the potential impacts of Brexit dampening consumer and business confidence. Latin America, meanwhile, continues to show signs of improvement, with better economic activity in Brazil, stability in Mexico, and that is despite the short-term disruptions from the earthquakes in Mexico. In Asia, consumer confidence was broadly positive. Most ASEAN economies remain steady.","And with that backdrop, we're continuing to focus and execute on our strategy. We're seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. So I'm going to keep our business highlights brief today \u2013 we just spent time updating you at Investor Day \u2013 but we've got a couple of things to talk about. So firstly, we continue to be pleased with the progress on our acquisitions, including our most recent ones, NuData Security and Brighterion, which enhance our capabilities in behavioral biometrics and artificial intelligence. Integration activities are well underway.","We're also off to a good start at Vocalink. Our fast ACH technology will be launched in the U.S. soon with The Clearing House, and we've just gone live yesterday, in fact, in the UK with a new image-based clearing system for the check and credit clearing company, which basically helps to speed up the traditional approach by digitizing that process. And of course, as we've said in the prior earnings call and at Investor Day, we are active with Faster Payments business development efforts now in each of our regions.","Turning to partnerships. We have established a truly global partnership with PayPal, having expanded our U.S. and Asia Pacific strategic partnership to Europe, Canada, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. What this means is that we now have similar commitments across every region to enhance customer choice, including making Mastercard a clear and equal payment option within the PayPal wallet.","It includes implementing Masterpass through Braintree to expand our digital acceptance footprint and enabling consumers to cash out PayPal balances through Mastercard Send. And this global partnership is above and beyond the extensive programs that we have developed with PayPal over the last several years. We are their partner for all of their credit and debit co-brands globally and have additional commercial and prepaid solutions in markets with them like the UK and Italy.","In the U.S., we continue to see some good momentum. In addition to the Bank of America consumer credit deal that Craig announced at Investor Day, we have locked in some additional business in the consumer credit, debit, and prepaid side. And one example is a new prepaid program with ADP, which is the largest payroll provider in the U.S. In commercial, building on our previous discussions of the Mastercard B2B hub, we're just actually very pleased to announce our first customer, Fifth Third Bank, who will offer this platform to small and medium-sized businesses that want to simplify their accounts payable processes.","Beyond the U.S., we continue to extend relationships and win new business around the world, starting with Europe. We're continuing to make progress on deal flips and new business wins, such as with Santander in Poland and Banque Travelex in France, just to give you a couple of examples. In Asia, we're very pleased to announce that Mastercard will be Costco's exclusive co-brand partner in Japan starting early next year. And while in Asia, we've also entered into a comprehensive agreement with Uber that goes beyond acceptance to include activation and usage campaigns, as well as Masterpass integration in selected markets with them.","And in the Middle East, one of the largest banks in Saudi Arabia, National Commercial Bank, has signed a long-term exclusive consumer debit and prepaid deal for new and renewed issuance that's committed to enhance those portfolios with Mastercard Advisors and loyalty services. And further, this is the customer to be the first issuer of Masterpass for its cardholders in Saudi Arabia.","Now shifting to some work we're doing on the product side. It's no secret right now that protection of consumer data is a hot topic. Safety and security is a key priority. We have a multilayered strategy that helps our customers better manage their own security while also protecting the overall ecosystem. In the past, we've talked about and shown you Safety Net, which identifies large-scale fraud attacks and blocks transactions in real time, trying therefore to save our customers from significant losses. And this quarter, we added to our tool set with what we call the Early Detection System, which alerts issuers to accounts that are at risk of future fraudulent activities, even before they have been used in an unauthorized transaction.","Like Safety Net and all our fraud products and services, this predictive tool leverages the power of the Mastercard network to supplement issuers' own fraud defenses. Early Detection System also combines external data and insights to generate confidence levels to help our customers determine the appropriate action to take \u2013 could it be monitoring transactions more closely or shutting down a particularly affected card immediately based on how likely it is that an account will be used for fraud in the future and how quickly that may happen.","We've also been working to enhance the security of digital transactions through the tokenization of cards stored on a merchant's website or in their app. When consumers keep their cards on file, as some of you probably do, checkout is faster, more convenient. Merchants can easily process recurring payments. Now, when you tokenize the credentials that are kept on file, it becomes useless if a fraudster steals them and attempts to use them somewhere else.","And Netflix is our first customer going live with this capability. It's also our first customer using our APIs to connect directly to what we call our Automatic Billing Updater to be able to keep payment credentials up to date in real time when an expired, lost, or stolen card is replaced. These types of account continuity tools bring significant value to merchant businesses and have helped our customers reduce declined transactions in some cases by more than 25%.","Now moving on to Mastercard Send. As you know, we've got some unique capabilities in this push payment solution. It reaches pretty much all debit cards in the U.S., reaches many other endpoints, cash-out locations, mobile wallets, bank accounts in over 100 markets worldwide. This quarter, we're continuing to help our partners deliver money faster to their consumers.","And let me give you a couple of examples. American Red Cross, where we've enabled real-time disbursements to consumers' personal debit cards for emergency response relief like in Texas and in Florida. But another example is Western Union, whose U.S. customers will now have the option to receive funds from other family members and relatives in the U.S. directly to the debit cards that they use every day.","We're continuing to invest in Masterpass, both in terms of expanded acceptance and promoting consumer awareness. We've signed a number of new merchants, including Verizon Wireless, Home Shopping Network in the U.S., TGI Friday's, Avon, and Carrefour, which is enabling in-app purchases in Europe. And we're now live as the exclusive digital wallet with Pizza Hut in four markets in Asia. We also launched Masterpass in Mexico this past quarter.","And while on the innovation front, Garry Lyons spent some time at Investor Day talking about some of the exciting things we're doing as we expand our acceptance reach through the Internet of Things. We're partnering with companies like Fitbit and Garmin and leveraging our tokenization MDES platform to enable consumers to pay by simply tapping their smartwatches in approximately now 7 million contactless merchant locations globally.","From wearables to connected spaces, we're actually piloting a fully digital experience at WeWork. And WeWork, as you know, is the shared workspace community. You can use metered payments there for members to pay for the amount of time they're sitting at their desk and to purchase food with Masterpass, all without taking out a card or even a digital wallet. Masterpass is also powering payments through virtual reality with a shopping app recently launched with Swarovski, as well as an augmented reality shopping experience with Saks Fifth Avenue that uses Identity Check Mobile with iris authentication to make purchases. So all in all, fun and games on the innovation front.","With that, let me turn it over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone. So while Ajay is always covering the cool things, I'm going to review with you the numbers now. So as you can see, the highlights on page 3, we have delivered another record quarter. Foreign exchange had a benefit to as-reported results, primarily due to the strength of the euro. For the remainder of my remarks, I will call out the growth numbers on a currency-neutral basis.","Net revenue grew 17% driven by strong underlying performance, and includes approximately a 2.5 ppt benefit from acquisitions. This was in line with our previous expectations. Operating expenses increased by 19%, and that includes an 8 ppt impact due to acquisitions, and that's primarily Vocalink. Operating income was up 14%, while net income was up by a healthy 19%, benefiting from a lower tax rate. EPS was $1.34 per share, up 23% year over year, driven primarily by our strong operating performance, with share repurchases contributing $0.04 per share. And during the quarter, we repurchased $838 million worth of stock and an additional $286 million through October 26.","Now let me turn to page 4, where you can see the operating metrics for the third quarter. The worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 10% on a local currency basis, and that's up 1 ppt from last quarter. The U.S. GDV grew 6%, up 3 ppt from last quarter, and was made up of credit and debit growth of 9% and 4%, respectively. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 12%, up 1 ppt from last quarter.","We continue to see strength in the Europe and LAC regions. First (sic) [Third] quarter volume grew at a healthy 15% on a local currency basis, with solid double-digit growth across all regions. Europe continued its strong performance, particularly from the UK and Germany. And in LAC, we saw a steady growth in Brazil, while Asia Pacific was led by South Korea and China. And finally, we saw the U.S. return to double-digit growth.","Turning to page 5. Here you can see switched transactions continued to show strong growth at 17% globally. And similar to last quarter, we saw double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S., led by Brazil, Russia, and India. And globally there are 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.","So now let's turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. As I already mentioned, net revenue grew 17%, which includes approximately a 2.5 ppt benefit from acquisitions, and was driven by robust transaction and volume growth, as well as strength in services. Rebates and incentives grew 19%, reflecting higher volumes and incentives for new and renewed deals.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. As we have commented during the first half of the year, the difference between fees charged and volumes in the domestic assessment and cross-border categories were mainly due to pricing, which was essentially offset in rebates and incentives, as well as some mix. This continues to be the case. However, the effect is less pronounced in the cross-border line this quarter.","So domestic assessments grew 14%, while worldwide GDV grew 10%. Cross-border volume fees grew 15%, the same as cross-border volume growth. And transaction processing fees grew 21%, primarily driven by the 17% growth in switched transactions, as well as revenues from our various service offerings. Finally, other revenues grew 19%. As a reminder, most of the Vocalink revenue shows up in this line. Advisors and Safety & Security revenues were also up. These items more than offset the 4 ppt impact from the changes we made to our loyalty business in Asia that I've called out previously.","Moving to page 7. You can see that total operating expenses increased 19% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes an 8 ppt impact from acquisitions, primarily from Vocalink and including of course the related impact of purchase accounting and integration-related costs. The remainder was due to our continued investments in digital, geographic expansion, and Advisors capabilities as well as increased A&M spend related to the Masterpass awareness campaign that we've been discussing since the beginning of the year.","I'm going to turn now to slide 8. And let's first discuss what we have seen in October through the 28th of October, where all of our drivers are similar or better, with the exception of cross-border, which was slightly down. Each of these drivers was generally in line with our expectations. So the numbers through October 28 are as follows: Starting with switched volume, we saw global growth of 13%, up 2 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter, with healthy double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S. In the U.S., our switched volume grew 9%, up 4 ppt from the third quarter, with higher growth in both credit and debit programs. Switched volume outside the U.S. grew 17%, the same as the third quarter. And globally switched transaction growth was 19%, up 2 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter, with similar or higher growth in every region, including the U.S. And finally, with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 14% globally, down 1 ppt sequentially, with slower growth in Europe.","Now looking to the full year of 2017. Our underlying business fundamentals remain strong as we grow our business through a combination of new and renewed agreements, as well as our expanded set of service offerings. We continue to expect year-over-year revenue growth to be at the high end of the low double-digits range on a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, as we commented on at the recent Investor Day. As a reminder, the fourth quarter tends to be a period of increased deal activity, and we expect higher rebates and incentives sequentially. Foreign exchange is expected to be a slight benefit to the top and bottom lines for the full year.","A few other items of note. On expenses, primarily as a result of increased Masterpass spend, we now expect operating expense growth to be at the top of the high single-digit range for the year on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. We continue to forecast recent acquisitions, notably Vocalink, will be about $0.05 to $0.06 dilutive in 2017, driven primarily by purchase accounting and integration-related costs. You should now assume a tax rate closer to 27% for the year, based on our current expectations of regional mix and discrete tax benefits realized year to date, with a tax rate of approximately 28% in Q4. As is our normal practice, we will defer any comments about our 2018 outlook until our year-end call in the New Year.","With that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session. Warren?","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer session. In order to get to as many people as possible on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back for additional questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Cantwell from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just had a high-level question. There was a lot of talk about blockchain at Money 2020. And of course you guys just had an announcement about opening up your blockchain API for banks and merchants. I was just hoping \u2013 can you talk to us at a very high level about how Mastercard's blockchain is going to be combined with banks and businesses? Just want to understand the use cases, the value your blockchain brings to the table. I guess, most importantly, just want to understand how you're thinking about blockchain right now, why it's important to Mastercard? Thanks very much.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So I think blockchain has a whole ton of potential use cases, and I think the real question that you're asking is how will that connect to our traditional customers. So what I'm trying to give you a sense of is we've been investing in our own platform in blockchain, not just to create our own blockchain, but to really learn how blockchains work. So whether we, in the future, operate only off our own platform or we operate as a facilitator for other people's blockchains, the objective is to be confident and knowledgeable on how they operate.","So we've filed a number of patents in the space in our own blockchain and our own platform. We have developed APIs, and we've also done things like making investments in organizations like the Digital Currency Group, which enable us to look at the way other people are innovating using their blockchains.","So what you saw at Money 2020 was that blockchain platform and APIs, and there was a hackathon there, and 60 teams of developers tested on them successfully. But the idea is that we will open this up to financial institutional merchants so they can connect into our settlement network. But remember, this is early days. Don't expect this to be a switch that gets turned on tomorrow. It has to be built country by country, connecting into settlement networks and the like.","The initial focus is on the B2B space, because we continue to believe that the challenges of speed, of transparency and costs, both in domestic and cross-border payments in B2B, are more interesting than trying to find technology looking for a problem to solve in consumer payments that consumers do not perceive. So to us there's a bigger opportunity in B2B. We're working on three or four ways of making the blockchain solution that we are trying to put out there different from others, and the first one is on privacy. So that we're trying to make sure that transaction details are shared only among the participants of a transaction, while you've got your (24:37) or you've got a permissioned blockchain.","The second one is flexibility. So you can use these APIs, combine them with other APIs on Mastercard, and maybe create a range of new apps. Third is scalability. Obviously, if we can connect it into our whole system and to use our leg network rules, then scalability becomes possible, and therefore reach. Because through our system, over time, you could reach into everywhere we operate with our settlement network.","That's what we're up to. Now, it's not currently by itself. We've got a bunch of things going on here: virtual cards, Mastercard Send, Vocalink, all of which are aimed at supporting cross-border and domestic B2B payment flows. And so that's what we're up to with the blockchain.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I appreciate that. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller. Please state your company. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks, guys. You know, purchase volume, I mean, even adjusted for Article 8, accelerated a couple of hundred basis points versus last quarter and came in pretty well versus our numbers. Can you just talk about really more what's driving, in your view, the outperformance in these trends, maybe compare underlying macro to secular shifts around digital, some comment on what e-comm growth was, and then maybe what was market share? Just break it down a little more for us; that'd be great.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Yeah, So, Darrin, it's Martina. Let me take that first. In terms of some of the drivers, when you look at the U.S. drivers, while obviously can see them as behaving a little bit better, they are spending a little bit more, most of the quarter-over-quarter performance is really due to the lapping of USAA. When you look at the rest of the world, the rest of the world is actually really doing well.","In Asia Pacific, if I just go around the world, in Asia Pacific, China, at this point in time, is not a drag. In fact, when you look at our cross-border volume, China is actually a really nice additive growth component. In Russia, we actually had the expansion of a number of agreements, and therefore we've been doing very well on Russia. In Sweden, so also in Europe, we have had a flip, so that is also very nice additive to the numbers. And then the Latin America is continuing to perform as well as it did actually in the prior quarter \u2013 it's right in the mid-teens \u2013 but that is mostly led by Brazil, as Ajay has already said. Mexico kind of stabilized with the kind of numbers that we are seeing.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Can you give any more sense in terms of is this market share versus underlying trends in spend in macro or digital or anything else?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","That's what I just called out. In the United States, it's between what the economy's doing and the lap of USAA. Outside of the United States, I just called out for you a number of areas where we are actually gaining market share. When you just look at our European region, for instance, they're in the high teens, growing in the high teens, at this point in time.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. So, Ajay, clearly fundamentals are good here in the quarter. So I just wanted to check in on the regulatory environment, in particular in the U.S. It seems like it's pretty quiet and manageable right now. Would you agree with that? And are there any emerging hotspots globally that we should be paying attention to?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","On the regulatory environment, honestly, I \u2013 whenever he talks to me about what I think about, I think about cybersecurity and regulatory. That's the two things that anybody in this industry \u2013 and I mean not just payments, but broader industries \u2013 we should be careful about. Because there's an environment where, with more and more connected devices, cybersecurity becomes important, and there's an environment in politics around the world where regulatory becomes really important.","I would tell you that, yes, in the U.S. right now, if anything, including in today's newspaper you can see about the administration working really hard to roll back some of the regulatory changes in many industries that were put in place over the previous eight to 10 years. That is correct. But on the other hand, in every other region around the world, we keep a very close eye on this.","As I said on one of my previous calls, our country managers are now \u2013 in their goals is a very clear objective to remain very close to anything that could impact the franchise locally, whether it be policymakers, opinion leaders, regulatory changes, or litigation, not just clients, but all those things. And so we're on them at all points of time. What's going on is there are a number regions in the world where earlier domestic payment schemes were very active. Some of those regions, those domestic payment schemes for reasons of being unable to keep pace with technological developments, mostly \u2013 that is the reason \u2013 they end up tending to open up compared to where they used to be.","So Europe is an example of that, and there are other examples in Brazil and Colombia and markets in Latin America where that's happening. On the other hand, in markets and parts of Asia and Southeast Asia, you find a renewed surge of thinking around domestic payment schemes. And so whether it be in Indonesia or in China or in India, we're constantly working with those countries, trying to figure out how our technology and our services and our artificial intelligence capabilities can help them deliver value-added services over and beyond what they could try and do if they were trying to do this themselves. And that's how we partner with them. That's the story in Russia as well. So it's a big story.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning. Martina, just thinking about pricing, I know you talked a little bit about it, how it's changed slightly. Just want make sure I understand what the impact was there. And secondly, just on FX, as we do our models, just an update on impacts, movement in the euro and the real and any other major currencies. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","On the pricing side, really no change, as I called it out in my prepared remarks. As you know, for pretty much the beginning of the year, we have been reshuffling pricing, where you see some of it coming up in domestic assessment as well as in cross-border, which you continue to see for this quarter. But it was essentially offset in the rebates and incentives line. So really no change in that. And we're going to have one more quarter, the fourth quarter, of this.","From a foreign exchange point of view, really what you're going to have to look at for the total year, full year, I think there's continue to be just a slight benefit to the top line as well as to the bottom line. So when you extrapolate rates of today, of course you're going to see a little bit more of a benefit for the Q4 numbers if those rates continue to persist.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Happy Halloween.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Happy Halloween to you, too.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Yeah, exactly.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","And to your kids especially.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, exactly. It's a big day today in the Keane household.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","We know.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Schneider. Caller, please state your company. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Goldman Sachs. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you'd maybe kind of step back a little bit and talk about now that you have had Vocalink for a little while, and there's been a lot of discussion you provided and detail at your Investor Day, when do you think the B2B payments opportunity specifically will begin to be notable in the results? Is this something we can expect in terms of noticeable impact in the next two to three years, or this is more of a kind of a five-year time horizon? Maybe just kind of give us a sense about how that's different between the consumer-facing parts of the ACH business versus B2B.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So B2B as a whole, you're seeing results already because we're approaching that channel, not just through Vocalink, but through all the other things we're doing, from the B2B hub we talked about or virtual cards. Now, back to our Investor Day, virtual cards address only the cardable portion of that spend. It's a smaller portion, but it's a pretty large portion from where we started. So you're seeing results in commercial based on that. You're seeing results from our corporate T&E business, our fleet business. Those are all already in the system, and there's continuing momentum on those.","But what you're asking is with ACH specifically, are we going to make new inroads in that space in the other non-cardable portion within the next two to three years or five years. I actually don't know how to answer that. Because, as I said, the Vocalink strategy depends a great deal on what way we enter different marketplaces. ACH tends to be, over the years, a very country-by-country business. It has only in a few cases, like Vocalink itself, which has demonstrated the ability to install its capability in more than one country, in fact, in five or six countries. That's a rare exception. Most ACHs are very domestic.","And therefore, to really get an inroad into the B2B business, you'd first get into the domestic ACH switching opportunity in that country. And that could either happen as an infrastructure play, all of which are in the various stages of RFPs. And if you know how to guess a government-owned RFP process in terms of timing, you can do it better than me because I don't. And we'll see when it comes out.","But the other options, which are more to do with apps and scheme rules and the like, those tend to be on a shorter timeframe than the infrastructure. So we're kind of working our way through all of this. It's very early days. I would hate to give you an estimate. I just know that in the next two or three years, you will see enough proof points to know that Vocalink is a really good asset for our company. That you will see. Whether that transforms our B2B revenue or not, I'm just not willing to make that commitment yet.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani. Caller, please take your company. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. KBW. Maybe on a related note, Ajay, you mentioned The Clearing House will be going live or has gone live with the real-time ACH. Could you just talk about your understanding of the use cases for that network? And then, when we think about the actual revenue benefit to you, is that already in the run rate because it's a software fee, or are there volume-based revenues as well? Thanks.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Sanjay, The Clearing House hasn't gone live yet. What's gone live is the check imaging and clearing system in the UK. That went live yesterday. The Clearing House is in the process of testing the software that's been put into their system with a couple of the banks. And then they'll roll out as the banks become technically enabled to connect to the fast ACH platform that The Clearing House has built with us.","Your second part of your question about the revenue stream, it's actually a software license. And therefore, it's not as though off the current use of that software as it increases for The Clearing House, that we will make any new revenue each time that that software is clicked upon. That's not what you should factor in. But what could happen is use cases being built on it, which enable us to play more actively in that space. It could be use cases for P2P. It could be use cases for B2B. And eventually, it could be use cases, if it makes economic and business sense, for B2B across border, if it can be connected to other clearinghouses or other ACH switches in other parts of the world. That's kind of what we're doing with them.","The different use cases are all of those, and I think you're going to have to wait and watch how American banks look at the capability of the fast ACH to figure out which one of those satisfies a business case where they're either meeting a need that somebody else is filling right now or they believe that there is a priceable opportunity or a value extension opportunity in that system. And I don't think that those answers are clear yet.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Togut. Please state your company. Your line is open.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Evercore ISI. Could you comment on the pipeline for new pan-European deals, especially as recent payment routing regulations in Europe open up the playing field versus some of the national payment schemes?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Well, the opening up of the playing field versus the national payment scheme has been happening for a while, not just because of PSD2. Actually, PSD2, the new regulations, are more about how other players outside of the domestic payment schemes, could also enter into the value chain and become players in between the banks and the merchant or in between the banks and the consumer. So it's two quite different things that are going on.","The aspect of tackling the domestic payment scheme, that work is ongoing. And every quarter, actually, we see more and more transactions in most countries. Now, it's not a \u2013 as Javier, our European President, is fond of saying that it's an evolution not a revolution, because everything in Europe moves at that pace. And we're seeing improved number of transaction share in every country as far as domestic payment schemes are concerned.","As far as PSD2 is concerned, there's a lot of work doing on \u2013 we talked about it at Investor Day a little bit \u2013 both in terms of enabling banks and acquirers to be able to meet the challenges that will come about through the new regulations, where essentially they will be responsible to provide both a transparency of the data to other players, but also a safety and security layer that they are going to be beholden to. And we can help them with both of those things.","We can also help them with \u2013 and help the merchants \u2013 with their transaction thinking over the course of the next couple of years. So we've got a team of people in Europe who we're working with, merchants and banks, ready to roll out ideas how we could be helpful with them and fin-tech players over the next couple of years.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So, David, Europe's GDV grew 16%. That just doesn't happen by itself all because of the economic environment in Europe. Of course, secular trend drives some of it, but the other one is what Ajay has been talking about: Every quarter we're actually winning deals that's helping this number to continue to grow. And with the second portion on PSD2, as Ajay said, we have a really big team there. There's a lot of opportunity, but it's very early stages yet in terms of going after what kind of help the banks are needing.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Just need to remember that the fact that it's a low-interchange environment will introduce its own element of how quickly PSD2 will enable different forms of acquiring and payments to take strength in Europe. Because if you have a low-interchange environment, the other side of this is there's less money available in the pot for people to build out acceptance and build out alternative payment methodologies in Europe. There's just less.","And so I would treat PSD2 as something that's going to take a few years to really start showing changes. You'll see changes at a high level, rather than real numbers changing, and reform is going to take some years to come. Meanwhile, we're going to keep trying to win as much as we can from domestic businesses and from some of our other more famous global competitors during this period.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang. Please state your company. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. I'm with JPMorgan. Just want to \u2013 I guess a lot of talk about security. So was curious, on the Equifax breach, any fallout from that breach? Could you see a change in deal or maybe reissue activity or more demand for security projects? Any color would be great. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Tien-Tsin, not yet, not yet. Remember, first of all, the number of cards that got leaked in that time were very few. It's like \u2013 I'm trying to remember. I think it's less than 300,000 cards. And you know that compared to the breaches of card information that happened in the past, we're missing many zeros at the end of that in relative terms. So typically, that's where the first level of the activity tends to be.","The issue, as you know, with the Equifax data being out there is really identity fraud over a period of time. And you see some elements of that, but it's difficult to figure out whether that's because of Equifax or that's just part of the way that cyber theft is beginning to become a more noticeable item in our connected Internet of Things world. So I wouldn't jump to any conclusion right now that Equifax breach is leading to new or higher attacks in any way. That's probably not a true statement.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Makes sense. Thanks. Congrats on the revenue growth.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you. Just keep using your card, man.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Will do, will do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg. Please state your company. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thanks for taking the question. So just to start, was curious if we can get a general update on the global e-comm and online business in terms of size and growth. And then, Ajay, any latest thoughts on India? I know they're been moving forward with QR code standards there. Is this going to move the needle for Mastercard, in your opinion, in the next two to three years?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","I'm going to let Martina have the pleasure of answering the e-comm line. I'll tell you about India. I was there actually a few weeks ago co-chairing the World Economic Forum. It's pretty interesting. Trying to think where I should start from. I continue to see spend on digital forms of payment, card and wallet, increasing. There's no doubt. Although cash withdrawals are right back where they used to be pre-demonetization. So it's kind of a strange place to be in, considering how much effort has gone into this.","Now, what has happened as the GSTs begun to roll out, and I think that will have a different form of impetus over a period of the next few months on the incentive to use traceable forms of payment rather than non-traceable cash, just because merchants will no longer have the incentive to help a consumer pay less by not paying taxes, because they, in turn, will pay taxes anyway earlier in the chain. So they need to recover the taxes or absorb a hit in their margin, and it's a reasonable quantum of tax to try and absorb that.","So next you see high purchase volume growth. In fact, this quarter, as in other quarters, the number is astronomical. I mean, it's in excess of 70%. It was 100% a few quarters ago. It's in excess of 70%. But there's negative cash volume growth because of withdrawals from ATMs being down, but less so than they used to be. As I said, cash usage is back. So there's an interesting mix of business changing over there.","I'm generally optimistic about the fact that over the next two, three years, we will continue to see good, strong spend n digital, cards and wallets, in the country because as I said, of the GST. Along with that, there's very high acceptance growth happening. And acceptance terminals are now up to 2.9 million compared to 1.5 million just in September last year. Now, remember, there's 60 million merchants in India if you take the informal sector as well. So 2.9 million is interesting, but there's heck a lot of merchants to go yet.","That's where QR comes, to your first part of your question. The QR code-based acceptance, now that it's been standardized through EMVCo, as you've got what's called Bharat QR, which is rolling out \u2013 that, to me, has a real opportunity to change the number of merchants accepting electronic payments because of the cost of the terminal and the cost of maintaining the terminal and the software is gone and been replaced by this relatively cheaper form of starting of accepting.","What's missing right now is the clarity for the acquiring banks and acquiring players on what the merchant discount rate would be for transactions in the country. As of January 1 in 2017, there's actually, if you remember three months last year, 0 MDR as a promotion. That kind of came back to be reinstated, but at a lower rate. And those lower rates are still in effect because the regulator had proposed higher rates, and those are going through various stakeholders. And I think sometime next year in the first quarter or second quarter, you're going to get a policy statement. Once that becomes a policy, acquiring banks are going to know what their revenue model is, and therefore what their risk-reward equation should be in building out acquiring using QR.","Long answer, but generally, what I'm trying to tell you is I think it's headed in the right direction. I think GST will provide an impetus. I think you will continue to see growth in all kinds of business and digital payments in India. And I think QR, you should begin to see more impetus in it next year. Now, having said that, 15 issuers and 22 acquirers are already are on with QR payments. But I just think there's a significant growth opportunity that is yet to come.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","From an e-commerce perspective, your other part of the question, worldwide, as you know, e-commerce is about 10% of retail payments. And by the way, that was around 8% just three years ago or so. So clearly, what is happening in the gig economy with Uber and et cetera, there's a lot of Airbnb. There's a lot of growth in terms of e-commerce side. In terms of our switched volumes, we have about a quarter of those on the e-commerce side.","And then that growth at a very healthy 20%-plus pace. So it's good. It's additive, and we're focusing on it. As you can see, with some of the remarks that Ajay has been doing, what we're doing with Uber in Asia Pacific as well as what we're doing with Netflix in terms of making sure that people can use their cards easier going forward as they're \u2013 get upgraded on their cards or they get replacement cards. All of that will continue to benefit the e-commerce growth.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for all the commentary.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. Follow-up question on Europe. I guess, part one, just looking at Europe, where the purchase volumes are up a couple of points over the last couple of quarters and transaction volumes also up 4, 5 points over the last couple of quarters. First part of the question: Martina, can you just dimensionalize for us how much of that is due to the shift or swap from Maestro cards into Mastercard cards? Because it looks like Maestro cards are down about 5%, so just trying to clarify how much of that is just a reporting thing versus underlying acceleration.","And then, I guess, second question, how is debit \u2013 it looks like debit is very strong in the region. So how is \u2013 can you just \u2013 maybe this is an Ajay question \u2013 articulate the how you're competing debit in these regions where you're competing aggressively against a pretty well-established bank transfer bank transfer network, what the value proposition of debit is there? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So, Lisa, on your first part of the question, first of all, the economic environment, secular trends as well as some of the wins that I have called out in a number of countries like Russia and Sweden. Actually, we had some better performance in Turkey and Italy. That wasn't necessarily related to wins, but that was better performance. That all drives Europe.","From a Maestro to a Mastercard slip, those are actually very important. Maestro cards, as you know, are mostly used in the cross-border context and not as much used in the domestic context, because obviously, they are co-batched with a domestic scheme on it. When those cards get flipped to a Mastercard, those cards make actually a lot more money for us from a revenue point of view. So it's not just a technical, you have Maestro cards going away and Mastercards showing up. These are real revenue-generating activities, because a person now can use the card not only out over the cross-border side, but also domestically, and they earn the points or the rewards and get on anything that might be with a card.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","And, Lisa, back to the other question about debit growth in a region like that. So there are two or three things. First of all, there is our debit growth within the volume that's already in debit. And I've been saying this stuff for five, six years. They're growing share in Europe. And the facts are the facts of the numbers. If you look at Nielsen reports, they'll show that to you as well. That's the first one.","The second part is a really interesting question, which is how do you compete with these bank-connected networks which exist. Germany, a number of consumers, even like Martina, who are confused Germans, they go around actually -","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Converted Mastercard user.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Yeah. Converted Mastercard user. They actually do give their bank account data to merchants to be able to do a direct transfer, which I find fascinating. Having lived in Brussels for years, I know that I used to even make payments to my gardener and my vendors with some direct bank transfers.","But there are three or four things that allow you to grow versus that as well. The first one is technology in itself. Just bank-to-bank transfer system is clunky and old, and it's run by typically associations of banks with limited ability to invest, just as the domestic payment schemes have limited ability to invest with new technology. What do I mean by that? Technology on safety and security. Technology on loyalty, technology on things that enable them to be competitive to what we could do with card and other forms of digital payments. So I think that's the first thing that enables us to fight in a number of these markets. And including in places like the Nordics, which are actually relatively high accepters of new technology.","The second part is acceptance. I mean, debit enablement through bank clearing systems, as I said, has tended to be a localized business. The moment you want to go cross-border or even expand within the local domestic acceptance, a network tends to be a more interesting differentiator. So it's really a question about the network rather than it is a question about debit cards versus domestic payment systems. You know what I mean?","Lisa Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, terrific. Thank you. Thanks, Martina, to you too. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Perlin. Please state your company. Your line is open.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, RBC. So you talked about the global expansion partnership with PayPal. And I'm just curious, at this point in the stage \u2013 and you talked about a bunch of different areas of integration \u2013 have you seen a discernible difference in terms of volumes that are actually being driven by PayPal onto your network? And if so, are you at a point now where there's threshold payments or incentive fees that would actually get paid back to them? Thanks.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So remember there are two key elements of our partnership with them. The elements of the co-brands and so on, yes, absolutely, we see volume from the co-brands, but we've had that relationship with them, in some cases, for quite a while. They've been renewed and they're growing. PayPal is doing well in the co-brand space. So those we see, and that's great. We've got some commercial and prepaid deals with them in Europe. Those we see. That's great.","There's two new things which you're referring to. One is Masterpass acceptance as Braintree goes out and signs up merchants. We had to first integrate our Masterpass capability into Braintree. In the U.S., that has happened. And as of the last few months, they've begun to go out and sign up merchants, whom they're signing up for Braintree. They're also putting Masterpass into it. We're beginning to see the first few of those merchants come online. Obviously, that work has to be done in a number of the regions. So you should see that over the next six to nine months, maybe sometime during 2018 is when that Braintree-Masterpass integration across the world will happen in a form that will give us some scale on growing acceptance.","The part about being an equal player, again, it rolled out in the U.S. about a couple of \u2013 two, three months ago. And if you try and enroll on a PayPal in the U.S. today, you will see that there's a very different offering methodology compared to what used to be there a year ago, when PayPal used to prompt and push you towards giving your bank account details. That's no longer happening. We're seeing the natural benefit of some of that in our numbers. None of it is setting the house on fire yet, but it's good.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions, actually, the first on cross-border. You had discussed China being strong. Is this because you're taking share in the single network reissuance from your competitors? And secondly, regarding Brazil, where are you on regulatory approval of the Ita\u00fa processing deal? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Hey, Craig. On China, I think it's a mix of things. First of all, the single issuance is going well, and they're really expanding the number of cards that they're having out there in the market, and that obviously adds something. But also relatively recently, a number of banks went back to dual grant issuing and continued with that. You might remember that late last year, earlier this year, there was a bit of a hiatus on that, given that there was rough clarity from a regulatory point of view, and that opened up again, but only for a number of issuers. And that certainly is a benefit, given that many of these dual-branded cards are top of wallet.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","And our share in the dual-branded card issuance over the last three or four years was much larger. Every time a new dual brand got approved, we were a much larger of share within that. That's kind of baked in that number.","Your question on Brazil, that deal is still in regulatory limbo. It hasn't yet \u2013 remember, when we did the Ita\u00fa flip and win, one, we won most of their new card issuance as well as flipping the past book. But we also agreed to do with them this domestic payment network to compete with other domestic payment networks. What's happened is the regulator there, (58:08), about a couple of months back, has begun to change the rules for the other networks in such a way that the competitive advantage of launching our own domestic payment network with Ita\u00fa is no longer as strong as it would've been if it kept the debenture rules in place. That's why it's in regulatory limbo. Nothing new is happening on that as of now.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay, thank you so much.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Okay. Ajay, do you have any final comments?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","That's Warren reminding me that I've got to read our cards. Okay. Got it. Thanks for all your question, and I'm going to wrap up with a couple of closing thoughts. We continue to deliver strong financial performance while investing in our business for the long term. That investment in our business is a core part of the way Martina and I run our budget cycle and our strategic planning, and that is something we're not willing to sacrifice while continuing to grow revenue the right way. We're off a good start in each of our acquisitions. Integration efforts are well underway.","We're very focused on safety and security. You heard me talk a little bit about the early detection system and adding products like that to our expanding set of customer tools to enhance our ability and those of our customers to make sure that this ecosystem is safe, and safe and simple ways to pay exist. Most of this is done through incorporating technology and artificial intelligence into our systems and our data.","We're executing well on our strategy, which is continuing to drive sustained levels of strong revenue growth.

[Operator instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Kneeshaw, you may begin.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you, Brandy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions.","You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.","Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis otherwise noted. As a reminder, starting this quarter, we have updated our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains or losses on our equity investments. We are excluding these items as we believe this will facilitate a better understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.","For the three and six months just ended, net gains of 143 million and 148 million have been excluded. Prior year periods were not restated as the impact of the change was de minimis. Our non-GAAP measures also exclude the impact of special items, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items.","In addition, we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.","Ajay Banga","Thanks, Warren and good morning, everybody. So, a strong performance continued this quarter. Revenues up 15%, EPS is up 17% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency neutral basis as Warren just said. These results reflect the continued execution of our strategy as we invest for long term growth.","On the macroeconomic environment, consumer sentiment and spending remains relatively strong, with some moderation versus 2018 as expected. We are continuing to monitor ongoing trade negotiations and other economic and geopolitical factors, which are showing signs of weighing on business sentiment in particular. In the US, we are seeing continued growth, low unemployment, healthy consumer confidence, retail sales grew 3.2% versus a year ago ex-auto, ex-gas according to our SpendingPulse estimates and that reflects some moderation from Q1 and from last year.","In Europe, the outlook is mostly unchanged, as we continue to see modest growth. UK retail spending remains healthy, although it has slowed somewhat from Q1, according to our SpendingPulse estimates, and of course, the uncertainty around Brexit remains. In Asia Pacific, trade tensions continue to weigh on business sentiment, particularly in China. We are however seeing improved consumer confidence and more accommodative monetary policies in several markets there. And the outlook in Latin America continues to be mixed, as growth in markets like Brazil, Colombia and Chile are partially offset by weakness in Argentina and Mexico.","Meanwhile, we continue to drive healthy double digit volume and transaction growth for Mastercard across most of our markets by successfully executing against our strategy and I'm going to give you a few examples of how we are growing our core business, diversifying our customer base and building new areas for our business.","So starting with growing our core, we continue to make good progress driving growth across our credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and we\u2019re expanding acceptance across both physical and digital channels. We expanded a number of important issuer relationships in the credit space, including National Commercial Bank, the largest bank in Saudi Arabia, and we secured full exclusivity across their credit, debit, prepaid and commercial business along with flipping their credit portfolio.","We also signed a new consumer and small business co-brand partnership in the US with House, a rapidly growing online home remodeling marketplace. And we won a 10-year exclusive co-brand credit deal with Despegar, a leading online travel agency in Latin America in five new markets across the region. As with many of our other co-brands, Despegar will integrate our loyalty program into their offering to deepen their customer engagement.","In Germany, we have renewed our credit relationship with DZ Bank, the second largest retail banking group in the country and they represent hundreds of cooperative banks across the country and they will continue to issue Mastercard cards to their customers.","Turning to debit. We signed an agreement in the UK with Nationwide who selected us as their business debit card provider, due to our experience in the small business space and our demonstrated expertise of working with FinTech. So Nationwide plans to launch a new business banking proposition to over 5 million small businesses in the UK early next year.","In Colombia, we won an exclusive debit partnership with Scotiabank, and secured long term debit agreements with Bancolombia and Davivienda, the two largest debit issuers in the country. And in Germany, we extended our long standing partnership with the German savings bank group, Sparkassen. Collectively, these debit renewals will leverage a series of Mastercard services to help drive contactless adoption, advanced digital security and accelerate the migration of Maestro debit MasterCard.","In terms of the secure remote commerce initiative, we are making good progress in June. EMVCo launched a new SRC payment icon, and technical specs. We are currently testing SRC in market with issuers and merchants. We're actively working on Mastercard\u2019s upgrades to SRC with partners like tickets.com, Expedia Group, Saks Fifth Avenue and Norwegian Cruise Line and we expect to launch in the United States in the next few months.","And then, we have developed a Mastercard digital wellness program, which will provide merchants with access to a host of technologies and resources, including a standard compliant click to pay checkout. But most importantly, added security through tokenization and AI technology, along with cyber security resources to combat online attacks. We're working with payment processors and platforms, such as worth Worldpay, Square, Adyen, Stripe and of course, our own Mastercard payment gateway services to make these unique features through the Mastercard digital wellness program available to merchants.","So let me turn now to the second pillar of our strategy, where we are continuing to diversify our business by expanding across new geographies and customers. An example in India, where as you know, we're building partnerships with local retailers and issuers to help drive growth and further develop the payment ecosystem. We\u2019re pleased to have launched an exclusive credit cobrand program with Flipkart, the largest online retailer in India.","In addition, Paytm payments bank has signed a new issuance agreement with Mastercard, we\u2019ve also established a new acquiring relationship with them to drive open loop acceptance with them in that market in India. Paytm will also be using our send capability to enable credit card bill payments. We\u2019re leveraging assets to design unique solutions for specific verticals, such as the growing gig economy.","We were selected as the network for the Lyft Direct Mastercard debit card, which provides Lyft drivers with instant access to their earnings. Collaborating with evolved bank and trust and branch who will issue Mastercard prepaid cards and will utilize Mastercard send to help their corporate customers provide interest fee pay advances to their hourly workers. And in Mexico, we partnered with Uber and DVVA to provide a new Mastercard debit card for Uber drivers.","Working in the fintech space, I believe we just continue to lead there. We\u2019ve established a series of successful partnerships with fintechs around the world who value the services we provide as well as our solution selling approach. This quarter, we signed a deal with Railsbank to bring new consumer and commercial debit card programs to market in the UK and in Brazil, we\u2019re working with digital bank, BanQi and Via Varejo to offer a new digital prepaid card targeting their approximately 60 million customers.","So now on to the third pillar of our strategy focused on building new areas for our business. We have developed and acquired, as you know, a broad set of capabilities, which together with our existing card rails allow us to differentiate our offerings, address new payment flows, and most importantly, operate as a one stop shop for our customers and let me give you a few examples.","First, we recently announced a partnership with P27 Nordic Payments Platform, owned by six of the largest banks in the Nordics to provide a leading edge real time and batch multi-currency payment platform across the region. This new platform leverages our VocaLink assets, will replace the existing payments infrastructure, and provides instant and secure payments across the region. And I believe this partnership represents another milestone in our strategy to offer customer choice in the form of real time, account to account payments infrastructure, applications and services and builds on a series of wins across Latin America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East that I've highlighted to you over the last few quarters.","Second, we continue to build additional depth and scale in our cross border capabilities, which already allow us to disperse payments across bank accounts, mobile wallets and cards, all through a single API. For example, we just completed the acquisition of Transfast, which will not only enable us to service a greater number of markets and endpoints for our customers, Transfast, by the way, allows us to reach over 90% of the world population, but also provides a suite of leading compliance, assets, messaging and licensing capabilities to address many of the cross border pain points that exists today.","We\u2019re executing on our cross border strategy through a new partnership agreement with Interac in Canada, which leverages our Mastercard Send push payment capabilities to allow Canadians to send money internationally across Interac\u2019s e-transfer platform. The National Bank of Canada will be the first issuer to launch this new international remittance solution.","We\u2019re developing new capabilities to penetrate the bill payment space, and completed the acquisition of Transactis to accelerate our go to market strategy for the Mastercard bill pay exchange. Transactis offers a unique combination of technical assets, distribution partnerships and customer relationships, which when combined with our current bill pay exchange capabilities, will allow consumers to view, manage and pay bills across multiple payment methods and channels, whether we are real time account to account payments or cardrails on your mobile banking app or through a business website.","And finally, in B2B, we announced a partnership to integrate our Mastercard Track with the OpenText Supplier Portal that has buyers and suppliers in the automotive industry, streamline and digitize financial supply chain processes to increase the speed, compliance and security associated with business information, payments and financing. ","So with that, let me turn the call over to Sachin for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Sachin?","Sachin Mehra","Thanks, Ajay and good morning, everyone. So turning to page 3, you will see we continue to perform well. Here are a few highlights on a currency neutral basis and excluding both special items related to certain legal matters as well as the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments. Net revenue grew 15%, driven by solid momentum in our core and was slightly ahead of our expectations due to stronger services growth. Acquisitions contributed a minimal amount to net revenue in the quarter. ","Total operating expenses increased 17%, which includes a 2 ppt increase related to acquisitions and a 5 ppt increase related to the differential in hedging gains and losses versus a year ago. The remaining 10% relates to our ongoing investment in strategic initiatives. Operating income and net income, each grew by 15%, reflecting our strong operating performance and each includes a 1 ppt reduction due to acquisitions.","EPS was $1.89, including a $0.02 drag related to our recent acquisitions. EPS growth was 17% year-over-year, with share repurchases contributing $0.04 per share. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1.9 billion worth of stock and an additional $493 million through July 25, 2019.","So let's turn to page four where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 13% on a local currency basis, up 1 ppt from last quarter, in part due to the ramping of co-brand wins in the US, as well as fewer processing days in Q1. US GDV grew 10%, up approximately 2 ppt from last quarter with credit and debit growth of 12% and 8% respectively.","Outside of the US, volume growth was 14%, up 1 ppt from last quarter. Cross border volume grew at 16% on a local currency basis, in line with expectations and driven by double digit growth in all regions. ","Turning to page 5, switch transactions continue to show strong growth at 18% globally, reflecting in part the continued adoption of contactless. We saw a healthy double digit growth in switch transactions across all regions. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued.","Now, let's turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The 15% net revenue increase was primarily driven by strong transaction and volume growth as well as growth in our services offerings, partially offset by rebates and incentives.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, you'll see that domestic assessments grew 13%, in line with worldwide GDV growth of 13%. Cross border volume fees grew 19% while cross border volume grew 16%. The 3 ppt difference is mainly driven by pricing, partially offset by mix. Transaction processing fees grew 15%, while switch transactions grew 18%. The difference is primarily due to mix.","Finally, other revenues were particularly strong this quarter, up 24%, driven by growth in our cyber and intelligence and data and services solutions. Acquisitions contributed 2 ppt to this growth.","Moving to page 7, you can see that on a currency neutral basis, excluding special items, total operating expenses increased 17%. As I just said, this includes 7 ppt related to acquisitions and the differential and hedging gains and losses versus a year ago. The remaining 10 ppt of growth relates to our continued investment in the strategic initiatives, such as digital enablement, safety and security and geographic expansion.","Turning to slide 8, let's discuss what we've seen through the first three weeks of July where each of our drivers are at or slightly ahead of what we saw in Q2. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. Starting with switch volume, we saw global growth of 16%. In the US, our switch volume grew 13%, up 1 ppt from the second quarter, due to the timing of certain social security payments this quarter. ","Switch volume outside the US grew 19%, also up 1 ppt, primarily driven by Europe. Globally, switch transaction growth was 19%, a sequential increase of 1 ppt, primarily driven by the US and Europe. With respect to cross border, our volumes grew 16% globally, similar to the second quarter. ","Looking ahead, our expectations for 2019 are consistent with our prior estimates. We had a solid first half and we continue to grow our business, both in terms of new and renewed deals as well as with our service offerings. We continue to see healthy consumer spending, with some moderation versus year ago as expected. ","In terms of net revenue, on a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, we continue to expect to grow at a low-teens rate for the year. On this same basis, for the third quarter, we also expect to grow at a low-teens rate because of a sequential increase in deal activity, as well as some moderation of services growth versus a very strong Q2. We expect FX to be a 2 ppt headwind to revenue for the year and about a 1 to 2 ppt headwind for the quarter.","In addition, acquisitions will add about 1 PPT to third quarter revenue growth. For operating expenses on a currency neutral basis, excluding both special items and acquisitions, we continue to expect growth at the high end of high single digits for the year. On the same basis, for the third quarter, we expect growth in the mid-teens versus a year ago due to the timing of marketing spend, which is more heavily weighted to Q3 this year, as we promote contactless usage and invest in sponsorships.","Year-over-year, FX will be the tailwind to OpEx of about 1 ppt for both the year and Q3. In addition, acquisitions will add about 5 ppt to third quarter OpEx growth. As a reminder, we issued 2 billion in debt at the end of May and this will impact our interest expense run rate going forward. In terms of the tax rate, we now expect it to be approximately 19% for the year.","With that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thanks, Sachin. Brandy, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen.","George Mihalos","Congrats on another strong quarter. Ajay, wanted to ask a question, you brought up contactless, obviously that's been a good driver. How long does it take when you introduce contactless or how long do you think it'll take as you introduce it in sort of a new geography to really peak up and meaningfully drive, I guess, accelerated growth.","Ajay Banga","So, contactless basically targets low value cash transactions as the first place that it kind of changes the paradigm and the speed of adoption. We've got now 10, 12 markets around the world where contactless has grown very strongly. Australia, Canada, Turkey, Poland, Hungary and the likes, UK. It depends a great deal on how many cards are in the market that are contactless enabled, combined with contactless terminals, combined with the use case for everyday payments. ","So if the transport system gets contactless enabled, it tends to ramp faster. If it doesn't, it tends to ramp slower. So if you take Australia as an example, where the banks, the acquirers, and the merchant community worked really hard together on promoting contactless, it went from non-existent to being like close to 80% of all transactions, under AUD100 were contactless in four to five years after launch. It was not that case in other markets, but I'd say four, or five years to get to a really large percentage of small dollar transactions with all the effort in the market is a pretty good number.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Good growth here again. Just -- if you don't mind, a couple of quick ones, just on the stronger services growth. Maybe, can you be more specific, you mentioned cyber and data. I'm curious if these are project related or more recurring type work. Maybe just a little bit more there and then just on the payback on your M&A, I know you gave that third quarter, look, which is helpful. Is the payback on those types of deals outside of the traditional retail card space and bill pay and et cetera? Is it different than what we've seen in the past?","Ajay Banga","Let me take a first crack and then Sachin being far more comprehensive on numbers, can probably correct me. But here we go. The first part is the services revenue, a lot of the cyber revenue has recurring competence built into it, because it involves the selling of AI and other products that are sold into banks and merchants and governments in a way that they tend to have re-utilization quarter-after-quarter. What would change is that the volumes going through then change and our revenue profile from them will obviously change, because it's not dissimilar to our current business in that as the volume goes through our cards, we earn more. That's kind of the first part. ","What is improving our capability in cyber and intelligence, aside from our own efforts of developing new tools and the acquisitions of Brighterion and NuData and all the work we're doing was improving it is, we now see a much larger percentage of our transactions than we used to 10 years ago. We're now seeing 55%, 56% of our transactions, it used to be 40 something percent, every time you see more transactions, the predictive power of your AI tools improves. That's kind of the \u2013 that second part, by the way, impacts some of our data business as well. But on the C&I space, it tends to be more recurring. ","The data and services space, some of them are recurring, some of them are one-off projects. Sachin referred to the fact that you should expect that the third quarter in services maybe a little slower in growth than the second quarter, primarily caused by the fact that the 2Q had enormous growth rates. But part of that is lapping of our comparison to prior, where part of that is some projects in part of our business, like in D&I. So that\u2019s kind of the \u2013 D&S sorry, these acronyms confuse me, the data business. And so you've got a mix inside our business where the cyber business is more recurring, the data businesses are fairly high proportional recurring, but it does have some project related work.","Sachin Mehra","Yeah. And Tien-tsin, I'll just add to that. So like Ajay said, right, so in the second quarter, this number moves around quarter-to-quarter. As you've seen, even last year, in the first quarter of last year, we had very strong services growth take place. And that's a little bit of function of what are the projects, which are being delivered in a particular quarter, which caused for things to move between quarter and quarter. And that's particularly on the advisor side. So I would tell you in the second quarter, our advisors growth came in slightly stronger, which could be what -- in line with what Ajay said on the consulting side of our business.","On the second part of your question on M&A, look, I mean, we've shared with you what we think the dilutive impact will be for the acquisitions, which have been completed -- the couple of things which I\u2019ll remind you is the acquisitions have closed during the course of the second quarter. There's one acquisition, which is Transfast, which closed early in the third quarter. So all of that has been taken into consideration, as we think about forward outlook for acquisitions. ","We continue to expect that our acquisitions will be dilutive between $0.07 and $0.08 in 2019, and as it relates to the revenue profile, these acquisitions are across different lines of what we do. So for example, the acquisition of Ethoca, which is in the safety and security space, will follow a little bit more, from a revenue model standpoint, along the lines of what Ajay just described. ","Then there are other businesses such as Transactis, which is in the bill payment space, where it's a function of what kind of engagement volume we get of, those resentments coming into the business and how we charge on the basis of that. So that'll be more in the nature of per bill presented, what kind of transaction fees we charge on those bills.","Ajay Banga","Nothing has changed in our basic M&A philosophy, which is two philosophies remain. One being, we try and make sure the dilution stops by year two, and therefore becomes accretive in the third year. Secondly, remember that by the second year, the businesses embedded in the core of whatever business they are running, and therefore we don't do a next acquisition after the second year, which means that discipline on buying something and making it work for you by the end of the second year is now fairly strongly embedded in every business line in the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I have a question on Europe. The growth in the region continues to remain robust and has been for some time. Could you talk about how long you expect that to persist, because I know you've had some fintech wins and Maestro conversions that have helped. And then maybe you could also speak to any visible impacts from Brexit.","Ajay Banga","Sanjay, I've been saying this since the day I became CEO that Europe is a growth market for our company, it's now almost 10 years, I see no reason to change that prediction. Europe is a cash dominant market in large parts of the continent even now and therefore the opportunity to convert cash in personal payments remains strong and healthy.","To give you an example, just in quarter one of 2019, that's the first quarter this year, we grew merchant acceptance locations in Europe by 10% over the prior year first quarter. And so this is not a developed payments market in the sense -- having said that, the Nordics are, so don\u2019t get me wrong, I'm talking about most of Continental Europe has got enormous opportunity for growth, as yet. There is market share growth as well, which is share growth, not just against our large global competitors, but also against local national schemes, all of whom are finding it hard to keep pace with technology, innovation, and regulation trends. ","And therefore, they tend to come to us for help and assistance that allows us to get a stronger foothold even in their businesses. And so, and this is all about commercial and B2B. And there's yet another space in the SME and B2B space in Europe that we are growing. So, fintechs, yes, of course, regular banks, yes of course. That's the share growth angle. But just think in terms of cash and acceptance and B2B payments, there's an enormous opportunity, even now in Europe, and I remain very bullish on what Europe is capable of doing.","I forgot to answer the Brexit impact for Sanjay. And not sing directly yet, I mean, it's interesting, the UK still remains a market where people seem to be spending and growth in spending remains healthy. So I can't tell you that I'm seeing direct impact there. But guess what, the currency is volatile. Obviously, you expect that as we get closer to October 31. If there isn't clarity, you're going to get more volatility in the market. But consumer spending is still healthy, inbound and outbound cross border flows, pretty interesting yet still, I think in fact, inbound is stronger than outbound. But, the UK still remains an attractive market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider","I was wondering if you could maybe just comment on the -- what you did before relative to transactional process growth. It seems like the big drivers there have been, first of all, the move to contactless, but also the reduction in Maestro cards. Can you maybe just kind of give us a sense about whether there's any reason to believe that level of growth in the high teens is not sustainable from here, since it's pretty much at the highest level it's been in, I think, the last five or six years.","Ajay Banga","Yeah, so Jim, I'll take that one. I think you should think about our switch transaction growth across the vectors, which you just spoke about, which is, as we continue to drive contactless adoption, that's going to be a helpful fact in terms of driving growth on switch transactions. The other piece is obviously the migration, which we're doing from Maestro to debit MasterCard, which should be helpful. What we should also remain focused on is, you'll see, over the years, the percentage of switch transactions for MasterCard, as a company, has increased. And that continues to remain a focus area for us, which is how do we continue to engage to drive more switching over our network, vis-\u00e0-vis that of local schemes. So all of these factors are helpful facts in terms of driving the switch transaction growth. Those are things, which I would keep a close eye on as it relates to what the trajectory of growth would look like on a going forward basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.","Lisa Ellis","Ajay, I wanted to follow up on your call out to that Mastercard signed an issuing agreement with Paytm in India. It seems like we're seeing an increasing number of examples of this, where these digital wallets are issuing debit cards against the balances, which seems like a pretty significant competitive shift in the environment relative to a couple of years ago, where many of these players would have been at least aspiring to compete with MasterCard. So can you talk about this competitive dynamic? Has it in fact shifted like this? Are you seeing this more broadly across the developing markets and how is working with these players little bit different than your traditional banking customers?","Ajay Banga","So Lisa, a lot of these guys, at the end of the day, some of them start out by trying to find a way to use bank account to account rails as a way of generating payments. The factors are in so many markets around the world, debit interchange or the MDRs are regulated. And therefore, the economic benefit of going account to account versus going on a debit card has changed quite dramatically over the last decade. And it used to be a one or two market incident of regulation that\u2019s spread quite far on debit, a lot of the Asian markets, India, as an example, has regulated debit card MDRs. And therefore, the benefits, the economic benefits have moved around, as they have in the US where debit interchange is regulated. And so -- and that economic benefit has changed. The tonality of the conversation has changed vis-\u00e0-vis, card rails versus account to account rails. ","Meanwhile, we, ourselves as a company, have adopted the view that offering choice to consumers and merchants and customers about both account to account and card is a good idea. And that's why the investments is VocaLink, that\u2019s why the investments in building out infrastructure with real time payments in the Nordics or in parts of Asia and parts of Latin America or in the Middle East Africa region and that's why all our efforts to build applications and services on top of real time payment rails as well.","I believe out over the next decade, you will see more and more of us being sort of rail agnostic, if that's what our customers and consumers and merchants prefer. Because I believe that's the best way to cater to the changing payments landscape.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","You'd kind of talked a little bit about the acquisitions and there are a number of them. What might be different about this round of acquisitions that there are more platform, I guess, than perhaps just getting a specific amount of revenues and maybe could you just talk a little bit about how you think they factor in kind of over the course of the next several years.","Ajay Banga","First of all, I would say, most of our acquisitions, even over the past few years, have been platform oriented or in a couple of cases oriented towards skill sets we didn't have. So years ago, we bought a company called C-SAM, which gave us access to 450 mobile technology engineers, which would have been quite a challenge to hire organically. But the majority of our deals, be it merchant loyalty programs or Pinpoint from Australia or these last ones have all been platform or some service oriented of that time. So take Applied Predictive Technologies of the data and services space, that gave us a testing and learning platform or take NuData that gave us AI platforms for cyber security. ","So I'd say most of our acquisitions tend to connect back to wanting to be the owner of a platform, so we can add into what we have, and then sell as a bundled service in our system. That's kind of what we're trying to do. So, I don't see these as being dramatically different on that logic. I think what's getting interesting is that we're seeing more deal flow than we ever did, you've always seen a lot of deals and picked one or two or three out of 20, 30. We see many more deals in the last two years than we saw in the first five years. I think part of that is they're seen as a credible acquirer, who tries to develop the company we acquire and stitch it into the kind of businesses we have and then give people opportunities to grow in a career growth. ","So we\u2019re not seen as an acquirer who comes in to plant the Mastercard way of doing things. I would tell you the things like APT and NuData and Brighterion have taught us a great deal that we didn't even know before we bought them. So I think that benefiting enormously from our acquisitions, both culturally for our mother company, but also in the cross flow successes between the two of them. I don't see that as very different for an Ethoca or a Transactis or a Transfast or a Wise. I can see all of these having similar patterns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Bob Napoli","A question on B2B payments. Ajay, you'd mentioned that you haven't even scratched the surface internationally. I was wondering if you could maybe, Sachin, give an update on trends in that business in the US, growth rates, any signs of acceleration, the AP automation piece, and is there -- is the international market far behind the US in the growth of B2B payments.","Sachin Mehra","Yeah. So our B2B business, Bob, as you know, you should think about as things we've been doing for many, many years on the commercial side, catering to the small business universe, the T&E side of the business, our fleet card management side of the business, that business continues to grow well. There still remains a lot of opportunity from a secular shift standpoint, I would tell you, in that part of the business. We continue to grow that nicely. We've got some very solid platforms, which you're familiar with, which support the growth of that commercial business.","The more recent stuff, which we've done as it relates to the B2B hub, again, we're seeing good interest from our customers in that. So like we said previously, those things take time, the adoption curve on those things is something which is a multi-year adoption curve process, but still shows a lot of promise because it's solving pain points in the business.","Then I think about the new and different stuff. For example, we announced just in Ajay\u2019s comments earlier today, we talked about the partnership we've established for our Mastercard track capabilities with OpenText, again, early days, but shows a lot of promise because it's solving the real pain points on the B2B side as it relates to compliance and onboarding of customers, in this instance, in the automotive segment.","So, I think you should think about our B2B business across multiple spectrums, this business we've been in, which continues to grow healthily, which delivers revenue right now. There's other businesses we've invested in over the last few years, which are starting to show good trajectory and traction. And then there are other new things which we're doing such as Mastercard track, which are just getting going, which will pay off over the longer term, and not much has changed in terms of our views on the opportunity there, both in the US as well as from a global market standpoint.","Bob Napoli","Is the international market further behind the US market? I would imagine the opportunities are \u2013","Sachin Mehra","Yeah. Bob, the answer to that question is yes. The answer to that question is clearly yes. We announced last quarter, our partnership with [indiscernible] for example, in Australia, that would be an example of again, taking the lead from what we did in to the B2B hub in the US and taking it overseas for an opportunity, which exists there as well. This quarter, we talk about our agreement with Nationwide, which is primarily taping towards the small business space in in Europe. Again, a big opportunity there. So I think the answer really is yes, things typically start up in the US and there's opportunity globally on this as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Kupferberg","Just one for Sachin and one for Ajay. I'm just starting on the domestic assessment, it looked like the revenue growth there decelerated about 300 points in constant currency. So just wanted to get some color on the drivers there and maybe what moving parts we should be considering for the second half in that revenue line.","And then maybe Ajay, if you can just go a little further on SRC now that we're getting closer to actually live implementations. What's the plan in terms of educating consumers there? Will we see actual targeted advertising kind of like what we had seen historically with Masterpass?","Sachin Mehra","So Jason, I'll take the first one, domestic assessments, you\u2019re right, they grew at 13% this quarter, in line with our GDP growth rate of 13%. That's down sequentially from a 16% domestic assessments growth rate in Q1. That is primarily due to the lapping of certain pricing that was put in place last year. And from a trajectory standpoint, you would continue to see the pricing effect of that marginally come down as the year progresses.","Ajay Banga","And the part of SRC, yeah, once we get the testing completed and we get the current Masterpass merchant uploaded into SRC and we start rolling SRC out for the broader marketplace, you will probably see the whole industry making substantial effort, banks, networks, acquirers making substantial efforts on marketing and promotion to get consumers used to the idea of the fact that this one button has the simplicity of checkout that you would expect in today's digital world, you would see that coming, but I'm talking it\u2019s still a few months away before that kind of stuff starts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Ajay, on cross border, can you parse out a little bit the different trends in e-commerce versus T&E in terms of growth? And then just a follow up on the commercial? I know there's been some talk in the industry that maybe it's been a little bit or some concerns around growth in commercial, can you just clarify how you're feeling on commercial spend overall?","Ajay Banga","I\u2019m getting good on commercial spend overall. So that part is exactly where Sachin just answered. The part about cross border, e-commerce, cross border growth is in the high double digits, high teens kind of thing. And that's a good number for us. If you remember, it\u2019s stronger, because you remember the whole crypto currency purchases, stuff that we talked about, well, that\u2019s lapped. So, some part of the cross border growth improvement quarter-over-quarter is the lapping of the cryptocurrency effect that you saw back in 2018. And that's the real benefit we're getting out of that.","The travel kind of expense, cross border tourism, by and large, cross border tourism is still alive and well. You would find changes in where people are going, so take China. In China, cross border growth from Chinese card holders is actually up this quarter over the prior quarter. But it's primarily due to increased travel, not just to where it began to happen, which is Japan and Australia. But this quarter, you\u2019re seeing some travel to Europe, to Germany, to Canada, to the United States as well. And that goes in and out, depending on which quarter and what's going on. But by and large, travel, tourism is still intact, doing okay.","Sachin Mehra","And I'll just add right here, which is we continue to see double digit growth in cross border volumes across all regions and for full year 2019, we continue to expect cross border growth rates to be in the mid-teens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Hi guys, just want to ask about Ajay your comment about now seeing 55 or so percent of transactions that you guys are switching, can you just talk a little bit about where that percentage can go over time. Obviously, there's an economic lift there for you as well. Maybe you can talk about that throughout the model, maybe higher yields and then it sounds like it pushes services revenues higher. So just thinking about the different implications there.","Ajay Banga","What I can tell you is I expect 55% to keep growing, but I'm not going to be able to tell you what number I expect this year, next year, the year after. The reason for its continuing growth, there are multiple reasons. One reason is that local payment schemes that I was mentioning struggling to keep pace with innovation technology with cyber security, with regulations, and that gives opportunities for companies like ours to come in part or happened to show that our transactions are protected or better service to have more analytics behind them and that allows us to grow. ","That's happening all across Europe as an example. It also happens when regulatory environments change, like some years ago, they changed in Brazil, and they're beginning to change in Colombia, they're changing in Argentina. And as they change there, you tend to begin to see more of your transactions, because the locally formulated scheme, either no longer has control, ubiquitous control on where the transaction is routed. And the control choice now goes to merchant on issuer, so it kind of changes the dynamic in the marketplace.","That's behind some of this growth in what you're seeing. And then obviously, certain kinds of technologies allow you to see more transactions, contactless in many markets allows you to see more transactions than the old Mac stripe or chip cards could do. And so there's a number of things behind the 45 becoming 55 or 40 something, I forgot the exact number 10 years ago. I think they were 42%, 43% coming up to 55 odd percent now. I expect to see that continuing to grow. And yes, the implication of that is that it does help us with the predictive power of our data, both in cyber and in our data and services businesses, and that does allow us to bundle our solutions better for merchants and banks. That is correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore.","David Togut","Good to see your P27 partnership in the Nordics leveraging VocaLink. Can you talk more broadly about VocaLink\u2019s positioning on the European continent ahead of the launch of SCA on September 14, and, when we go live on September 14 with secure customer authentication, what do you expect to happen in terms of transaction authorization and approvals in Continental Europe?","Ajay Banga","I expect a lot of fun. So let me walk you, first of all, September 14 is an important date. But there's also been some announcements that there will be some flexibility in the enforcement of SCA at a national level from the European banking authority. I think a month or two back, they gave out some clarification on that. That will be interesting, because you'll get some degree of friction caused by the fact that there will be different enforcement's in different countries. And I think that could lead to some consumer confusion, some merchant confusion, some issuer confusion. So we're going to have to work our way through this over the next few months, as this happens.","What we\u2019re trying to do is focus on our customers, help them better understand their requirements, provide them with solutions to help assist with their compliance on SCA. I continue to believe that we\u2019ll be very individually advantaged during this process, if you stand by them, as they try and meet the needs for what the regulation of PSD2 requires. Remember, there is connected stuff around open banking there, which is everything from connecting to protecting to resolving for disputes by working that through with a number of countries, we've launched in the UK, launched in Poland, we're in the process of doing that kind of work in different parts of Europe.","VocaLink is not the only entity that is helping us do that. It\u2019s cardrails, a counter count rails, it's actually more to do with the cyber intelligence and data services businesses, that there's a lot of opportunity in PSD2 in Europe. VocaLink, as a whole in Europe, and in Continental Europe, the Nordics would give us first physical presence once it's fully implemented across Continental Europe, because otherwise we were in the UK, in the case of Europe, and no one knows where the UK will be on November 1. So this gives us a foothold on Continental Europe as well by the time we get this implemented over the next few years.","In the UK, all our contracts have been extended out by a substantial number of years on what VocaLink provides both the bank contract, the link contract and the faster payment contract. Of course, some years later, there will be RFPs and all of those, we\u2019re busy making sure we are well positioned for those.","David Togut","Understood. And then as my follow up, what is your expectation for the adoption of pay by bank in Continental Europe or consumer ACH payments, once we go live September 14?","Ajay Banga","Yeah, I don't know yet. Like I said, September 14 isn't a real switch on it. It's got some switch on angles, and it's got a bunch of demos attached to it. So the like may or may not come on fully on September 14. Do I think of pay by bank as a great opportunity? Yeah, just remember this. That comment I was making to Lisa earlier, the incentive to switch to paying by a bank account direct debit, the economic incentive for a merchant to help advance that or for a merchant to therefore give better benefits to their consumers to choose that as the way to pay as compared to paying by some other method has reduced as the economic difference between the MDR and debit cards and the cost of a fully loaded account or account payment are taken into account. ","And so this is less of an economic argument as compared to a preference argument. I consider lots of Europeans who think of paying with debit as a natural way of paying as compared to paying with credit. They think of debit as safer. I suspect a number of them will adopt pay by a bank or pay by a bank account as something they understand and appeals to their way of planning for their financials. I think that's the way this will grow as compared to some very strong economic or pecuniary opportunity benefit to consumers and merchants, which means it'll be a slower bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Ajay, more broadly, I mean, your volume trends continue to remain really strong, even in to the July period, and you still maintain a pretty good spread to most of the competition across a lot of volume growth metrics. Can you just comment, I mean, is this just solid macro trends, or how much of this is actually market share in your mind or other technology innovation driving growth, just maybe you could try to parse out and if you think there's anything of this kind that you're seeing that would change that current volume anytime in the next half?","And then just quickly Sachin also, cross border revenue, it was up a little more, the underlying cross border volume growth rate, is there anything on pricing there, should we expect that [indiscernible]?","Sachin Mehra","Sure. So you\u2019re right. Cross border assessments were up 19% in the second quarter, which is about 3 ppt more than what you saw on the driver at 16% growth and that was due to pricing, which is partially offset by mix. And you would -- pricing continue for a few quarters going forward. So nothing more early on that, Darrin.","Ajay Banga","So on transaction growth and GDP growth for like, the two broad pictures. One of course, macro spending environment by consumers and in the B2B business, it\u2019s still good. Has it moderated towards -- compared to the prior year, yes, but it's still relatively healthy. There are pockets of concern on macro spending. I think China is something that everybody has now begun to talk about, which is a challenge and it\u2019s stressed. Mexico is slower, but there are other markets are doing better. So, Brazil is doing better. The US is holding strong. The UK is holding up, parts of Northern Europe are doing fine. India is doing okay and Japan and Australia are doing okay. So there are markets doing okay, that's the macro trends.","Are we growing share? Absolutely. And we've been growing share consistently for a while across product categories. But growing share, this business doesn't change share growth from, you don't grow share by 300 basis points in a quarter. You grow share by incrementalism mostly, even if you win big deals in one country, the combination of that country contributing to the total world spend is still a smaller number. And so share grows and share gives you a consistent tailwind, but its first a macro and secular and second share growth.","And third remember, we\u2019re smaller than some of the other competitors in some of these overall numbers, because of our position in different markets that tends to make the percentage number look better. It's a combination of all three. I believe it's a little bit of all three going on. So you should take that into account.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Craig Moore with Autonomous Research.","Craig Moore","Considering my peers have circled the wagons on all the enormous positives, I thought I\u2019d ask on some of the few controversial items. First, can you discuss the Australian proposal to completely eliminate interchange by year end? And if you can comment on the fact that the UK Supreme Court has agreed to hear the class action case against Mastercard.","Ajay Banga","First of all, Craig, Tim Murphy is delighted to get a chance to speak on the UK. So let me go ahead with that.","Tim Murphy","Sure. Great, thank you. So, we feel very good about the decision of the Supreme Court to look at -- to approve our appeal, we\u2019ll take that forward in the next couple of months. Just to context on that issue, this is one of the first major cases in the UK, looking at their new collective action or class action law. We think the appellate court said too low a standard and that would produce an outcome in the UK that was not intended under the law. So we think this is great opportunity for the Supreme Court to come to a more balanced decision and then we'll proceed on that basis. But we\u2019re very pleased with that approval.","Ajay Banga","And then the Australian proposal, it\u2019s not just Australia, wherever you come to zero interchange or MDR in a country, I continue to believe that no economic incentive for increasing either acceptance or digitization of payments, doesn't make sense to me. At the end of the day, if there is a value being derived by an entity, be the consumer, be the merchant, be the bank from doing something, and somebody else is providing the capability for the value to be derived, in this case, particularly, if merchants are deriving some value from digitized payments, be it ticket sizes, be it lower test, be it better cash management, be it lower expenses and collecting, there's a series of studies around the world that demonstrate what digitization does for the merchant community in terms of benefits for them. ","And I believe that in some way, incenting the providers who enable that digitization acquirers, processors, issuers who take on risk expense, and the capital allocation that is required to enable this is a sensible business model. So going to 0 just says, I'm not going to do it, and you need to find a way to do it anyway. And I suspect that\u2019s not the smartest way to go about it. But you know what, at the end of the day, countries will make decisions. Our job is to help illustrate to them through research, through logic and through experiences in other markets, what we believe to be conducive regulatory systems. And then when they make that decision, our job is to work with it the best we can. ","That's been our approach for years, that\u2019s the approach we\u2019ve taken in Australia as well. I consider Australia to be a very important market for our company. We are market leaders there in a number of categories with the Westpac recently, we are definitely market leaders in more categories. And I consider our presence in Australia to be that of a responsible payments partner for the Australian Government and the ecosystem, and I will keep trying my best to work with them.","Ajay Banga","So few closing thoughts. We continue to execute well against our strategy. We just had another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth. We are really pleased to further extend the reach of our real time payments capabilities with the P27 win in the Nordics. We look forward to working with all our new colleagues from our recent acquisitions. And with that, thank you for your continued support of the company. Thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Cesenia, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the conference over to Barbara Gasper. Please proceed.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Cesenia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today, either by phone or webcast, for our discussion about our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. We also appreciate your patience with the technical difficulties this morning, and I'd like to say that we are going to extend the call beyond our normal length just to accommodate everybody for your patience. ","With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, we will open up the call for your questions. ","This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. The earnings release and the slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier today. A dial-in replay of this call will be available for one week, through February 9.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Ajay Banga. Ajay?","Ajay Banga","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. Before Martina gets into the details of our results, let me start, as usual, with some high-level comments. In the fourth quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 20% as reported or 21% on a constant-currency basis. And that helped to fuel operating income growth of 34%, excluding the special item for the litigation charge. ","And as you see on Slide 2, this quarter's performance capped off a very strong 2011 for us, with net revenue and EPS growth ahead of our 3-year objectives. We had a strong operational performance with annual gross dollar volume, cross-border volume and processed-transaction growth rate in the mid- to high teens, all driven by very solid local execution. And we delivered an operating margin a bit ahead of our 50% minimum target, while actually finding a way to continue to invest in strategic initiatives for the long-term growth of our business. ","We have some decent economic news in the United States lately with the unemployment rate dropping to 8.5%, consumer confidence increasing over the past few months to an 8-month high. This comes as consumer balance sheets have improved, following a period of deleveraging. And all of this has had a positive impact on consumer spending, as is reflected in our SpendingPulse data, which showed growth in December for all the 11 retail sectors that we track. Now we saw continued strength in our own U.S. volumes, which were up about 12% for the fourth quarter. But this positive news remains tempered by the uncertainty that persists in the picture of the unemployment rate and housing prices. And you should also remember that U.S. retail sales, as well as our own U.S. volumes, begin to hit tougher year-over-year comparisons -- actually, that started late in 2011, and it'll persist through the year 2012. ","In Europe, our business remains strong in spite of another quarter of negative headlines regarding the macro situation there. Fourth quarter volumes grew almost 17%, in line with the growth we saw with the prior 2 quarters, driven by double-digit cross-border volume growth. The addition of domestic processing in The Netherlands continues to drive significant processed-transaction growth in the region. ","You should remember that our European region is comprised of nearly 60 markets, extending far beyond Western Europe and the Eurozone. In fact, the majority of our revenue comes from the relatively stronger economies of Northern and Eastern Europe, where we continue to see strong growth in both processed volume as well as revenue, with particular strength in France and Germany and The Netherlands. ","The countries most often talked about as troubled, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain account for less than 5% of our 2011 global net revenue. In January, processed volume growth in these countries, these so-called troubled countries has decelerated only slightly from the mid-teens level that we saw over the previous several months. That said, in the Eurozone, we have seen a decline in consumer sentiment in the third and fourth quarters of 2011. ","In the past, it has taken a few quarters before changing consumer sentiment impacts the growth of PCE in this region. And as such, we've continued to watch our European business closely. And of course, there is the potential that Europe's impact could spread to the U.S. and other regions. That's what we read about in the papers every day, but the facts are that as it relates to Latin America and the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa we finished 2011 with GDV growth greater than 20% in the fourth quarter in those 2 regions as well, with strength in both domestic and cross-border volumes. ","With all of that as a backdrop, the facts are the lingering uncertainty in Europe and the lukewarm recovery in the U.S. is what makes us continue to have a cautious outlook for overall consumption growth of PCE. We remain focused in what we can influence: the steady displacement of cash and our ability to gain share in the electronic payment space, both of which, we've continued to make progress on. ","So before I get to some business highlights, I thought I'd give you a quick update on the litigation front. And as you see in this morning's earnings release, we took a $495 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter. This charge is an estimate of our financial liability that could result from a settlement of U.S. merchant litigations and is basically based on the progress in the mediation process. We know there's been a good deal of speculation in the marketplace about the terms of this settlement -- of this potential settlement. The mediation discussions remain confidential, so I can't really say much beyond what's in our release. But being that much of the speculation is about credit interchange, I want to make clear that we would not agree to any significant or long-term reductions in MasterCard's credit interchange rates as part of any settlement. ","In the meanwhile, we continue to execute our strategy displacing cash, winning deals to get more than our fare share of payments growth. And let me share a few business highlights. During this quarter, we signed a number of really interesting partnerships connected to our strategic priorities: First, our global agreement with Western Union to help us grow and diversify while displacing cash and serving some of the world's 2.5 billion financially underserved people. In addition to becoming Western Union's preferred prepaid brand globally, we are working to enable all 485,000 agent locations of Western Union to serve as reload locations for any MasterCard Prepaid Card. Western Union and MasterCard are also working together using our MoneySend platform and issuer relationships to help remove cash from either side of the remittance transaction. ","Last year, we entered into a JV with Telef\u00f3nica, covering the 12 Spanish-speaking markets in Latin America where Telef\u00f3nica operates the Mobistar brand, with 87 million customers. In November, we signed an additional JV agreement with Telef\u00f3nica, this one in Brazil. The Telef\u00f3nica's brand is called is called Vivo, and it reaches an additional 65 million customers. With that, we now have completed our relationship across the breadth of Telefonica's geographic footprint in Latin America. Both these JVs are focused on providing consumers with mobile payment services, to drive financial inclusion, increase acceptance of the users of payments over the next few years. ","We also entered into a strategic relationship with Intel to leverage Intel's ultra-book chip, what some of you may have seen at this year's Consumer Electronics Show. When a consumer reaches checkout on an e-commerce site, all they will need to do is tap their PayPass-enabled device from their computer, which will do a few things. For consumers, it'll speed up and simplify the checkout process while making the transaction more secure, because it leverages dynamic authentication, something most PayPass transactions do. And for merchants, while this security will help to reduce fraud, we believe this will also help to reduce shopping cart abandonment, making it much more productive for them. ","We've also signed a commercial agreement with mFoundry, as well as having taken a small equity stake in that company. mFoundry develops mobile banking apps for nearly 600 banks and credit unions in the U.S. This should give us a chance to give the U.S. consumers of these institutions -- of these 600 institutions, mobile PayPass capabilities integrated with their online banking apps. ","On to the U.S. in specific, the team continues with solid execution across the lines of business in debit. Banks are continuing to work through their decisions to comply with debit non-exclusivity. At this point I can tell you, we have won PIN deal with a couple of major U.S. banks and have already begun to see some of those transactions. ","We've signed an agreement with KeyBanc as well to add PIN debit and to move on to our IPS platform. We've also renewed our signature debit and ATM relationships with them. During the quarter, we converted the conversion of Huntington to MasterCard debit card and onto our IPS platform. And interestingly, while the top 25 banks in the U.S. do get spoken of most often, we all know that independent banks and credit unions are important players. Credit unions alone serve over 90 million U.S. consumers.  In 2011, we made substantial in-roads here. We've signed debit and credit deals with almost 150 of these issuers. And importantly, a good proportion of these deals were conversions from competition. ","We've also won some new U.S. public sector prepaid programs, which should be launching shortly. The State of California will issue prepaid MasterCard for child support payments. New York State, Oklahoma will leverage prepaid MasterCards as an option to distribute income tax refunds. Dollar General now accepts MasterCard credit cards and will distribute MasterCard Prepaid Cards in its 10,000 stores, all of which will also become prepaid reload locations like those Western Union agents I was telling you about.  And just this week, we contracted with Toys\"R\"Us to be the exclusive network partner for their co-brand program. ","So on the topic of merchants, we're bringing all of our assets to bear to drive value for merchants in a variety of ways. Let me give you some flavor. Two major automotive brands will begin accepting MasterCard debit cards in the U.S. for monthly lease payments. In France, Casino, a top 5 mass retailer will convert its private label store card to a co-branded MasterCard PayPass card. PayPass acceptance new across geographies, some examples: taxis in Hong Kong; pharmacies and gas stations in Russia; discount grocers in Austria; Canada's largest pharmacy; in the U.S., RadioShack, Gap stores in San Francisco, Pinkberry and so on. ","With our Priceless Cities program now in New York, in London and Toronto, we partnered with restaurants, retailers, theaters and other merchants to drive traffic and offer cardholders priceless experiences they would otherwise not be able to get. In Europe, we are partnering with affluent merchants to bring global travel benefit, VIP guest passes, accelerated bonus points to MasterCard World Elite and Black cardholders. The luxury brands we are working with include, for example, Mandarin Oriental, Fairmont hotels, Oxford Jet and more are getting signed up. ","In the other regions, we are continuing to work on paving the way for the growth of electronic payments. In Africa, a growth region that MasterCard has traditionally been relatively underrepresented in, we have signed a bunch of things. During the quarter, we signed an MOU with Ecobank Group to drive the issuance and acceptance of prepaid and debit accounts across 31 African markets, where Ecobank has more than 750 branches and offices. ","In Nigeria, we signed an agreement with Zenith Bank, one of the largest banks in Western Africa, as well as a debit deal with Skye Bank. We've continued to launch debit cards with other customers as well, programs with GTB Bank in Ghana, NBC in Tanzania, as well as a major global bank with a presence in Kenya to issue world debit cards. Also in Kenya, we've launched prepaid MasterCards aimed at young travelers with Equatorial Commercial Bank. ","In South Africa, we've launched PayPass cards in virtual card numbers, as well as prepaid cards for insurance, and interestingly, micro-finance distribution. Now we've even got an office in Nairobi to serve as a hub for our East African business.  In Russia, we're working with MTS, the largest mobile network operator in that market, and we're developing mobile PayPass products for their consumers. They're pushing ahead of mobile payments in China. We just signed an MOU with Unicom for e-pay to explore collaboration. And while on China, China Industrial Bank launched a Geneo [ph] airlines co-brand MasterCard, which adds the co-brand relationships we already have with the top 4 airlines in China. ","In the commercial space, we've launched numerous programs in China, including 5 new co-branded commercial card products with China Construction Bank, which by the way is also launching a frequent business airline travel card. And talking of airline cards, Air New Zealand Airpoints customers will now get a card that comprises a monthly currency PayPass-enabled MasterCard Prepaid Card on one side, with their Airpoints membership card on the other side. And you can actually tap the card to check into your flight. So that's just the flavor. Tons of these going on. ","Now let me turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck, where we'll focus on the 2011 non-GAAP column, which excludes the special item related to litigation. And I'll compare those numbers to the 2010 actuals. ","This quarter's EPS growth of 27.5% was driven by a combination of strong revenue growth and solid expense management. Net revenue grew 20.2%, while operating expenses grew 11.5%, resulting in an operating margin of 44%, a 4.4 percentage point increase year-over-year. Foreign exchange had minimal impact on these numbers. ","Overall, acquisitions added 2 percentage points of growth to net revenue and 3 percentage points to operating expense growth. This is a lesser impact than we have seen in recent quarters, as we anniversary-ed the acquisition of DataCash in late October. The effective tax rate was 32.3%, versus 28.7% in the fourth quarter of 2010, mainly driven by benefits we recorded last year in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings. ","Let's turn to Page 4. And here you can see the regional breakdown of our gross dollar volume for the fourth quarter. Worldwide GDV was $863 billion, up 16.3% on a local-currency basis or 14.9% on a U.S. dollar converted basis. U.S. GDV increased 12.1%. And rest-of-the-world GDV increased 18.4%. ","On a local-currency basis, worldwide credit GDV was 13.6%, driven mainly by APMEA and Latin America. Worldwide debit GDV grew 21.2%. In the U.S., local GDV grew 18.4% aided by the Sovereign and Huntington wins. Debit growth for the rest of the world was 23.4%, driven by APMEA and Europe. ","Fourth quarter volumes grew 17.5% on a local-currency basis. The slight deceleration versus the 19% cross-border growth that we saw in the third quarter was the result of lower cross-border growth for U.S.-issued cards and in Europe, while the growth in both regions remained in the double digits in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., there's not a fundamental change in the usage of U.S. cards overseas, but rather, this was largely the result of a stronger U.S. dollar on purchases. In Europe, the decrease was very modest. ","Turning now to Slide 5. We proposed 7.7 billion -- I'm sorry, we processed 7.7 billion transactions in the fourth quarter, up 23.2% over last year's fourth quarter. Double-digit increases in all regions were aided by domestic processing opportunities in The Netherlands and Brazil; new deals such as Huntington and Sovereign; as well as from U.S. debit routing  changes. Globally, the number of MasterCard and Maestro cards grew 11.3% to over 1.8 billion. ","So now let's turn to Page 6 to discuss net revenue in a bit more detail. Domestic assessments grew 18.7%, and cross-border volume fees grew 14.5%. Both of these line items were driven mainly by higher volume. The 12.6% increase in transaction processing fees was driven by a greater number of processed transactions, including PIN debit transactions, which drive incremental revenue albeit at a lower year. ","Other revenue grew 27.5%, mainly driven by our Access Prepaid acquisition, which closed at April 2011, and growth in consulting services. Rebates and incentives grew just under 9% for the quarter, driven by both new and renewed deals and healthy volume growth.  U.S. [ph] revenue grew 15% in 2011 and represents now 39.6% of our total net revenue. ","Let's move to Page 7 for some detail on expenses. Total operating expenses increased 11.5%, excluding the special item. Acquisitions, largely Access Prepaid, added about 3 percentage points to operating expense growth. G&A increased 14.3%, primarily driven by higher personnel expenses related to strategic growth initiatives within core products, emerging payments, information services. And Access Prepaid contributed about 4 percentage point to this growth rate. ","The 4.8% increase in A&M was mainly driven by investments in Priceless Cities, customer-specific activities and sponsorships. Depreciation and amortization increased 24.3% primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from our acquisition. ","The cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights are summarized on Page 8. We generated $784 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of $4.9 billion. The slide also summarizes our progress on our share repurchase program to both year-end 2011 and through last Friday. ","Now let's turn to Slide 9. And let's discuss 2012, starting with an update of what we have seen for MasterCard processed volumes for the first quarter through January 28. Our first quarter volume grew about 17% globally, in line with the fourth quarter. This was driven by continued double-digit growth in all regions. ","In Europe, cross-border growth remains in the mid-teens, with intra-regional growth continuing to outpace interregional growth as the European stay closer to home. In the U.S., cross-border growth remains about 11%, in line with the fourth quarter. Although not a perfect proxy for GDV, total U.S. processed volume grew about 13%, the same level that we saw in the fourth quarter, driven by continued strength in debit and commercial credit volume. ","In January, total processed volume growth for the rest of the world was about 17%, in line with what we saw in the fourth quarter. European processed volume growth was in the mid-teens, consistent with the growth rates in the fourth quarter and only a bit below the third quarter. And globally, processed transaction growth was about 25%. This is higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter and was driven by higher growth in Europe due to the continued roll-on of domestic transactions in The Netherlands; and higher growth in the U.S. due to new debit wins such as Sovereign and Huntington; as well as an increase in PIN debit processing resulting from routing decisions.","Just a reminder, insomuch that we continue to get additional PIN debit transactions, processed transaction growth will continue to outpace related revenue growth due to the lower yields that we're getting on PIN transactions. ","Looking forward, let's start with our long-term financial objectives. We saw exceptional performance in the first year against our 3-year objectives for the 2011 to 2013 period. We remain confident that our business is capable of a 12% to 14% net revenue compounded annual growth rate and a 20%-plus EPS compounded annual growth rate for the next 2 years as well. These are, of course, on a constant-currency basis and based on the current economic conditions that we see in the world. We also remain committed to our annual margin target of at least 50%. ","So based on what I've just told you, let me give you a few other thoughts, specifically about 2012. First, assuming the euro continues to trade at the 1.30 level and the Brazilian real at the 1.75 level for the rest of the year, we would expect about a 2 to 3 percentage point headwind to as-reported net revenue, net income and EPS growth for full year 2012. ","Based on our current plan for 2012 strategic investments, we might have an opportunity to deliver some operating margin expansion this year. However, the amount of any improvement will depend on several factors, including global economic conditions and investment opportunities that may surface during the year.  ","Our plans currently call for G&A growing at a higher rate than A&M. We also expect our depreciation and amortization to grow by roughly another $30 million this year as a result of our strategic investment activity. And for modeling purposes, you should now assume a full-year tax rate slightly below 32%, as a result of our ongoing tax-planning initiatives. ","Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the Q&A answer period. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Ajay, I appreciate the color on the merchant litigation. Just a follow-up on your comments there on interchange rates. Do you mean that you guys would consider some kind of short-term implications to the actual rate? And then just perhaps you could just follow up on the timeline going forward.","Ajay Banga","First of all, the details of this mediation are confidential, so I wouldn't assume that the opposite of what I said may come true. I just don't jump to any of these conclusions. I was just trying to take one topic of speculation off the table, which is what I was reading about in the speculation that is out there. That's all I was trying to provide some sort of insight to. So I'm afraid I can't give you any more than that. I also don't know anything about the timing, because these things are always -- they move around on you. And speculating on timing is not going to get me very far in this topic, so I'm away from that one either.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just thinking about the incentive trajectory into fiscal '12, is there any noise you might want to call out relating to Key or any of these other debit wins that you alluded to? And secondly, there's been talk by your competitor about incentives increasing due to  signing more global deals to longer multiyear agreements. Is that a trend that you're seeing? And if so, what's the long-term impact on your business?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Glenn, first of all, as you know, we are not really giving any guidance on the incentives and the rebates line alone. Our guidance includes that line item. So if you're coming down to net revenue -- and as I just said, we feel that this company is really capable of producing, for the remaining 2 years of our 3-year guidance, to 12% to 14% incentive. Anything that might have to move in the market, be it from what U.S. trends on the U.S. debit side or other deals, we have that obviously baked into our thoughts, but I'm not really prepared to break that apart.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan with Janney Capital Markets.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So just a question on the merchant -- outstanding merchant liquidation. Is there any outcome from that, that will put at risk the 12% to 14% guidance for revenue -- net revenues for the next 2 years?","Ajay Banga","Well, the way we've tried to give you that guidance includes our thinking of the merchant litigation as we put out into our earnings today. So that's kind of where we are. We've kind of factored our thinking in there. Obviously, if some unforeseen thing emerges from it, I can't speculate on that one. But the way it is built today, clearly, we factored that into our 12% to 14%.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And given the 12% cap that you guys disclosed before as far as your obligation of  any monetary settlement, should that -- I want to make sure that the math's right. So based on that pretax special item this quarter, that assumes a monetary settlement about $6.5 billion?","Martina Hund-Mejean","So Tom, what we have to do, of course, we have to estimate the amount that we would be taking for a charge. And based on the facts of the table, based on the progress of the mediation, we had to develop a view on what kind of number we had to charge. And this is our best estimate in terms of the charge. And we have to see in terms of the development of the future of the mediation, in terms of where that might be going. But this is our best estimate as of today, and it does reflect the 12% share that MasterCard would have to carry in a potential settlement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the KeyBanc relationship, I just want to make sure I understand that this is a PIN debit only. And can you give us any other thoughts or updates on your progress in securing PIN debit business? I guess my key question there is have you seen a lot of these banks that you're talking to make the decision on how they're going to address exclusivity? Or are they still wrestling with that decision at this point?","Ajay Banga","All right, Chris. First of all, KeyBanc. This incremental agreement with KeyBanc is to add PIN debit and is to move onto our IPS platform, where we also have an ATM relationship with them and a signature debit relationship with them, both of which have got renewed, along with this incremental move that I just talked about. So it's a much wider relationship with KeyBanc. As far as the other aspect  is concerned, somewhere in my earlier comments, I talked about the fact that we've actually won these PIN deals with a couple of the very major U.S. banks, and we've actually begun to see some of those transactions. So while the banks are working their way through, let's say, complying with the non-exclusivity criterion, a number of them have began to make their decisions, and those are the ones that we have been able to talk about. So it's WIP, but progress is being made.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","If you exclude portfolio conversions and de-conversions from the fourth quarter of 2011, can you quantify underlying processed transaction growth year-over-year?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes. So mostly what we do, of course, on the de-conversions is from a debit perspective, right? And so when we -- there's very, very little movement in there from a de-conversion anymore, because we've pretty much concluded all of those. So it's really the roll-on for the new wins. And when you strip that out, you're coming kind of down to a number of the mid-teens versus the 23% growth that is the top line number.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Quick question for you on Europe. I was just hoping to get your initial thoughts on the Green Paper that was published in Europe and is now out for comment.","Ajay Banga","Craig, this is Ajay. Let me put it for you this way, right? The Green Paper which came out recently, they've got a 3-month consulting period. It ends in April 11. Basically, they're looking at all aspects of European card, Internet and mobile payments. They're saying -- they're coming from the viewpoint that there's not enough innovation, competition or integration in Europe, which is fascinating, given all the other things they're dealing with. But what this does is it identifies potential obstacles or barriers to further expansion of card, mobile and Internet payments and kind of says we got to do stuff with this. And it may actually lead to a legislative proposal later. But in contrast to what the EC seems to think, we see e-commerce and mobile payments are growing dramatically in Europe. Consumers are adapting new technologies. New players are coming in with different ways to pay. I don't see Europe lagging behind other regions in innovation, when you look at the complete picture. So that's where they're coming from. We share their goal to see commerce grow through more electronic payments on cards and mobile phones and over the Internet. And I think we have the ultimate open platform. We allow new entrants to compete. We result in more choice for consumers, more choice for merchants. We actually see ourselves as a part of the solution, and that's how we're approaching the working with them. We're kind of working with retailers, we're working with telcos, we're working with governments, we're working with software companies and a whole lot of other methodologies to make European payments simpler and easier. I don't think regulation is going to meet that need. It's just going to lead to more fragmentation, less innovation and probably will increase cost at the end of the day. So I'm not big on this stuff. I think we can work with them in a way to enable them to meet their needs of allowing more innovation, allowing an open system, allowing more people to play rather than trying to put up walls to close the system in some way. And that's our attitude towards the Green Paper: positive in terms of participation but not completely agreeing with the basic premises on which the paper was put out.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Martina, I know you mentioned this in your prepared comments, but there's clearly -- with the disconnect between the transaction processing fee growth and the transaction processing fee is almost a 10-point delta. And I know you have the PIN transactions sort of driving that, but it seems like an inordinate disconnect, where it implies you had very healthy sort of PIN or Maestro transaction growth. And I'm actually surprised that it's sort of happening so quickly. Maybe a little bit of the color there.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, first of all, we are very happy that, that is happening quickly. So obviously people are making their decisions to get the benefit of these kind of decisions. But let me give you a little bit more detail on the difference between the 23 -- roughly 23% transaction growth and the roughly 12% transaction fee growth. So there's about a 9  percentage point difference, right, between the 2 numbers. And really 1\/3 of that, so roughly 3 percentage points are due to the business that we are getting in the United States on the PIN side. And the remaining 6 percentage points are mostly due to what's still happening in The Netherlands, where we're still getting incremental transactions. There's a tiny little bit on Ita\u00fa in there, but that's more natural growth. But those are the 3 areas: the United States, The Netherlands and a little bit Ita\u00fa in Brazil that are really driving this differential. And as I've just told you about the January numbers, where we're seeing transaction growth of 25%, you should be starting to see an even bigger gap, just because what I told you, PIN transactions are coming in at a lower revenue yield. That is incremental revenue that we are making in our P&L.","Ajay Banga","Glenn, it's Ajay. Let me just add one aspect of that for you. As I said we've managed to get a couple of those major U.S. banks to use us for these PIN debit transactions. And clearly, you're seeing the beginning of the results of that, which is both the fact that we've got the deal with them but also the fact that we've been able to make the operational side of this come together relatively quickly. And that's the point I've been making for a couple of earnings calls, that if we do this well, there is some opportunity here for our company. The second thing is -- to add a little color to what Martina said about Europe, while The Netherlands has a very large impact on what we're doing, finally the SEPA conversions are beginning to show results over the last few quarters. In the fourth quarter of 2011, processing for domestic transactions in SEPA grew 256% over the same quarter last year. For the year 2011, we're up 155%. These are still all small numbers, but the fact is that all that SEPA regulation change is finally beginning to give us some opportunity.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just real quickly on the merchant side. Haven't really heard you guys talk too much about your efforts in -- on the merchant margin side. So any color there in terms of routing exclusivity, as we think about the merchants and their ability to influence, post Durbin here?","Ajay Banga","Well, the fact is we have -- as I told you earlier, we're looking at all this strategically. We're not trying to put out some master policy statement on how we're going, either at the big banks, or the smaller banks, or the merchants. We're actually talking to all of them. And clearly, from the answer to the previous question, you can see some benefit in our processed transaction growth from what's going on at PIN transaction in the United States, that 3% incremental that Martina referred too. So this is kind of what we're doing. I'm just not going to be out publicly talking much more about it. I'm just going to keep looking at it strategically.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Two things. Can you just clarify what you were saying before about signing PIN business with top 25 banks? So in addition to Key in the fourth quarter, did you sign some others as a second PIN network?","Ajay Banga","Yes. So what I said was that there's a couple of major U.S. banks. We have signed with them to become the alternative PIN brand at the back of their card. And the result of that is showing up in the 3% incremental process transactions that Martina referred to in the total increase. So that's kind of the basic idea that I was trying to say. What I was talking about in the 25 banks  was a different context. I was saying that as most people talk about the 25 large banks. But I was also trying to talk about the independent banks and credit unions and the business we are building with them, not just in PIN debit but also in credit and signature debit.","David S. Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then can you just give us any color that you -- changes in the spending behavior in credit in the U.S. and in Europe maybe that occurred in the fourth quarter? And did gasoline have much of an effect in changing spending?","Ajay Banga","Not very on spending. Gasoline, actually, Martina would tell you a little bit about, but not really any change in behavior either on credit in the U.S. or Europe. Or for that matter -- because I'm assuming somebody will ask that, or for that matter between signature and PIN behavior in the United States. So it's early days, so I don't know where that could go. But right now, I'm not seeing anything.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, gas, we really haven't seen any changed behavior. The numbers, in terms of total volume in the U.S. that is spent on gas purchases is still 8%.  From a transaction point of view, it's still around about 15%. So that -- sometimes it bounces a little up and down in the quarter, but we really haven't seen anything much different. I just want to add one more thing on the PIN business side, David, because there are also some things that we're seeing as the exclusivity on the back of the card went away. For instance, on the regional networks, we're obviously seeing some of that business too, because people are deciding to move to us rather than through the networks enrolled in [ph] the card originally. So that's a little bit of a benefit for us.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Ajay, first of all, thanks for the comments and the color on the U.S. interchange. I think that goes a long way for a lot of investors. But maybe just talk a little more about the regulatory environment in Europe for a minute, especially on a related-to-it topic. In regard to the cross-border interchange lawsuit. I know we're coming kind of close to a conclusion there. We're expecting a ruling from the EU at some point, maybe in the next 6 months. Any concerns over that? Or maybe even -- any expectations of further intervention by country-specific regulators around this topic, in the topic of interchange in Europe?","Ajay Banga","Look, right now, this matter is sitting in the court, so it's kind of difficult for me to tell you what's new between the time we finished the court hearings and now. So nothing new [ph] has come to us. We're not a party to any discussion of the court since then. We're all sitting there and waiting for them to come to a conclusion based on all the arguments that were presented. We continue to believe we had a good argument, and we presented it with clarity. But we're going to wait and see what happens. There has been very little change at a country-by-country level, to answer the second part of your question. It's really more focused on the commission's ruling, the court's ruling but also the Green Paper, which by the way, came out around the same time and is actually not quite connected. That's a separate conversation, but both things are going on in Europe right now.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Hypothetically speaking, what kind of impact do you think that the elimination of a no-surcharging rule could have? And if, hypothetically, something like that were on the table, would there be any reason for concern over an unlevel playing field with Amex?","Ajay Banga","So hypothetically speaking, I have no clue, because I genuinely believe -- I'll tell you my personal belief in this. My personal belief is payment systems work less but best with least friction. Whenever you introduce friction, you always create the opportunity for consumers and merchants to feel less than perfect about their transaction. That's kind of an obvious statement. Having said that, in different countries, where surcharging was allowed, it's not as though every merchant has jumped onto the bandwagon to actually introduce a surcharge. That's partly because of the fact that they do see the value of electronic payment system from their perspective. And it's partly because at the end of the day, I believe that there is a good competitive situation out there for merchants, and they have to watch their own competitive circumstances versus other merchants. And I think that rule will come to play in some stable way, once the clarity around hypothetical surcharging becomes clearer. That's kind of how I think about this. I don't like friction, but it is what it is. And as far as the Amex angle is concerned, again, your question assumes that the surcharging applies to some and not the others. And I don't know if that's a hypothetical move too far. So I don't know yet where that will go, right, so we'll see. But that's kind of where I'm coming out on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Martina, you've mentioned -- and I appreciate the difference in revenue yield on PIN debit versus other forms of payment. Yet in the fourth quarter, your net revenue yield was up nicely. Is there something else kind of going on there that we should be thinking about, whether it's mix or pricing or some other dynamic that might be overall offsetting what would be an otherwise lower revenue yield?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Look, first of all, just to take the pricing comment out of the room here. There was only very little pricing in our numbers. It was about 1.5% on total revenues, okay? So that -- yes, it does impact a little bit, but it's not a big deal. The -- what's really also happening is that we obviously earn money both from a transaction point of view, as well as from other businesses that are driving our revenues. And they're not related to GDV. So for instance, what you see -- what our DataCash revenues are adding, what our Access Prepaid revenues are adding, what our consulting business is actually adding, that's not related to the volume driver. So you will see -- as we are growing those kind of businesses, you would see some of these yields increasing. And that would be then when you just look at our main processing business. We said over time, you should be seeing a slight decline in the yield, as we're getting more and more transactions and volume growth, and as we are incenting customers to run more volume over our network. We have to look at those 2 sides. And when you put them together, you really have to pull them apart.","Ajay Banga","That's why I say once in awhile revenue yield is not the single metric you should use. Because in addition to what Martina just described, you've got the mix of cross-border volume, you've got geographic mix, you've got product mix. Yield is a composite of many things. And only one element of it is the PIN debit contribution to our total revenue, which clearly has a lower yield as we've said -- but not a lower profitability, just a lower revenue yield.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Nice to see what I think most people would consider to be effectively a guidance raise here, as you're taking the top and bottom line CAGRs out for the next 2 years. Can you just talk about the general factors that gave you guys the confidence to do that at this point in time? You obviously had an extraordinary 2011, which does create a tough comparison. And as you guys discussed, there's still some macro uncertainty to cope with, so I think it's all the more encouraging to see what you guys had to say for the 2012, 2013 period. Maybe if you can just give us some of the underlying factors that are driving the outlook, that would be great.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So look, Jason, we are always going back to what we call the 3 concentric circles that we showed you at the Investor Day, right? First of all, PCE. And where PCE in the world is a really important driver for all our baseline growth. And there we made the comment that the United States is feeling a little bit better. We're not really seeing much pain coming through at the moment in Europe, but we're going to have to watch very closely, because of the consumer confidence falling. Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, Africa is still behaving very nicely. So we're feeling relatively comfortable in terms of where we put our mark from a PCE point of view for those 2 years, as well as from a longer-term point of view. Number two, as you know, we are really going after converting cash to electronic forms of payment. 85% of the world's transactions are still done in cash. There is a lot of room to be working. I mean, you look at what our products people do and our services people, how they help, we are all focused on making sure that, that 85% goes down to 80% to 75%. Last but not least, we obviously want more than our fair share of that, right? So our last focus is how do we behave in the marketplace, how do we get profitable market share and how do we put products out there, so that we are actually successful doing that. So don't forget about those 3 things. And even if one of those things -- so the PCE number goes up and down depending on where the world is going, we still have the 2 other things to drive. That's what you see us do in 2011, and we feel, based on where we are today -- I always have to reiterate, this is a \"today\" comment, okay? We feel that the next 2 years are looking good from that range point of view.","Ajay Banga","Let me add a little bit to that, Jason. I think of those 3 circles just like I was talking about the revenue yield earlier. I think of these as composites that come together. They are almost like multiple legs of our stool that we control as we play our game of management. And so yes, I don't control PCE growth. But given where we are today, in Martina's comments, the U.S., Latin America and Asia and Middle East look okay. Europe looks okay today. But history of them, that when consumer sentiment begins to go down, 3 or 4 quarters down the road, it begins to show up. So I'm a little less -- more cautious about that than I am about the other regions. But then I'm very focused on all the things I've been telling you for the 1 or 2 years on changing the cash versus e-commerce ratio. What's the electronic commerce ratio? Hence the things with the Social Security in the U.S., or with the Punjab government in India, or within Russia, or things they're doing in Italy with the post office. All those add up to trying to take away the traditional sanctuaries of cash and look at getting them to come to us. Now in any one transaction, they don't change the needle. But when you do it consistently over a period of 2 or 3 years, it does change what numbers we operate off. And then, of course, there's the market share gain, which -- we are competitive guys. We like to win some good market share. And that's the third angle. So all 3 give us a balance in the different legs to our stool.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Facebook released their S-1 yesterday. I'm sure you knew that. But in their S-1, they showed $500 million of payment revenue. And I wondered if -- most of that tied to virtual games. And I just wondered if that surprised you and just kind of what -- how you work with Facebook and how the economics are. And if -- their focus on the payments market is -- and do you view that more as an opportunity for MasterCard or a concern?","Ajay Banga","Well, they've got their revenue actually -- I've read the S-1 in great detail and was interested in the Facebook IPO from a personal perspective as well. I think it's an interesting development. The -- I'm not surprised at all by their payments revenue, because how do you load the Facebook credit right now? You do it through various ways, which includes our card. So I cannot see that data, and I understand it. I actually think that for us, working with them is a huge opportunity, just as it is for other people as well. We're not the only -- we're not the only girls at the dance, there's others too. And so we're all chatting with them, and we're all trying to do business with them. And we do some things with them already. And we're going to be doing more with them I'm sure as the years go by. So it's the same approach I have with a lot of other opportunities. I think new technology is an absolute opportunity for MasterCard if we engage with it and we work with it well. We share the same questions on telecom companies 2 years ago, and we've shown you over 2 years. We engaged with them. We worked with them. And in fact, they realize our value, we realize their value, and there's a business to be made in working the 85% of transactions that still are out there that's coming to electronic commerce. And so there's a much bigger space out there than getting worried by the risks. I think it's an opportunity every day of the week.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just wanted to talk about the long-term plan on the operating margin front. It seems like you're saying today that there's possible room for some margin expansion in 2012. But I also wanted -- after 2012, I mean, are you saying that we shouldn't be expecting margin expansion after 2012? So if you could just clarify, what's the swing factor that matters the most for margins in 2012? And then what's your current plan for post 2012 on the margin front?","Ajay Banga","Rod, I'll try explaining this again. My approach to operating margin came out of the context when we were originally saying we would expand our margin by 800 basis points every year. All I was trying to do was to say, given this 85% of cash out there, given the unbelievable opportunity in this industry, I would rather keep the margin at a very healthy minimum of 50% and take the money that generates for the company with our revenue growth and with that leverage in our P&L and put it towards making tomorrow even better for our company, as compared to merely taking the 50% to 52% to 54% to 56% to 58%. That's the context in which I gave it. I've also said that if revenues are doing better, I'll let that flow straight through to margin, which I've done over the course of 2011. And that's kind of how I think about it. So in 2012, right now, we feel pretty good about the fact that we can get deliver more than the 50%. We're even telling you we may actually be able to deliver more than what we ended 2011 with as a year. But if investment opportunities come up that today we have not foreseen, and if the economy looks to be in decent shape, and I feel that's a good risk-to-reward tradeoff, I'm going to use some of that money to still meet my commitment to you, while putting it into the long term. That's the angle with which I look at operating margin. I look at revenue growth and net income and EPS growth as the 2 things that are the gating factors. I look at the operating margin as if I can keep at least 50, which I think is an extremely healthy place to be, then put whatever I can get back into growth. If I can't think of good ideas, it goes right back to you as the shareholder. That's the perspective on operating margin.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So Rod, for each one of the years that we have in the 3-year guidance, we said a 50%-plus operating margin. And look, in 2011, yes, we had a little bit of a margin improvement, but we did precisely what Ajay said. We didn't run after that particular margin improvement. We had a certain set of facts on the top line. We made the investments that we believe we need to make in order to actually make a better future for the company in the -- for the company to come. And that's the investments that we did. So the operating margin is really a result of those kind of managerial decisions. And every year will be a little different on that, but we are focused on making sure that we at least keep this very healthy 50%.","Ajay Banga","Plus.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Plus.","Ajay Banga","Correct.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one final question. And this is probably a quick one. Visa has a common switch strategy and a network participation fee. We know that there's not much detail on how those things will be implemented. But can you assert today a plan on what MasterCard will do on the common switch front or on the network participation fee front or is it premature for you to assert [ph] ?","Ajay Banga","I told you when you were here. Yes, yes, look, I told you when you were here, we actually can -- thanks to what we do with Maestro, by the way. That's exactly how it works. So it's not that we can't do that. I'll say that to you again and again, we can do it. It's not a revelation to us. So just so you get that context, we have the ability, the capability and the operational competence in our technology. And we've been doing it for years in Europe and elsewhere, where Maestro is used. As far as the network participation fee, or a merchant strategy or a detailed strategy around Durbin is concerned, I don't feel that I need to go out with a blanket statement of a strategy, because I'm not the one protecting the incumbency. Somebody else is. And so in their shoes, I may well have done what they're doing. But I'm not in their shoes, fortunately, this time. And so I'm doing it my way. And my way is showing up in the processed transaction growth that you're seeing. And so that's what I'm going to say. I'm not going to be able to give you much more, unfortunately.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just looking at the First Data spin track, PIN debit has been taking some share for signature. But I think you said, Ajay, that you hadn't really seen that. I guess maybe do you expect PIN to be taking some share versus signature? And I saw the EMV  announcement you guys made this week. It sounds like you guys are open to chip and PINs. So I would assume that PIN would be -- could be increasing in the future.","Ajay Banga","So you're actually onto a very interesting topic, which I -- which is fascinating. Truly, I haven't seen that change. Part of that is because, remember, we were starting from a smaller place, so for me I'm getting some incremental volume in the door. And I haven't really seen a big move today between PIN and signature. Now let's step back from today, because today is still only a few months after the Durbin and non-exclusivity rules went into play. There's so many things going on right now in that space. Think about -- there's no real incentive for a merchant to move from one to the other, because the merchant discount rate has just got equalized. I mean, interchange for the issuer got equalized. So nobody's got an incentive to push one way or the other, given the way it is today. But if you look out further, if you think about creating a payment ecosystem for mobile payments, for electronic payments, out a few years, we really believe that EMV is the right way to go. Now what we're trying to do is rather than mandate it is to consult with merchants, issuers and other partners, which we have done systematically over the last few months, and then finally said let's create the right incentives for people to go to the best way in the long-term, which would be the most secure way, which would be that way of going to EMV and PIN. And that's the chip and PIN angle that we're trying to put out there. I see this as a journey. I don't see it as a -- as it'll happen tomorrow or day after. I think it's a journey. And what we're trying to lay out in that EMV announcement is where we think the journey would lead to. I can't tell you today how long it will take to get there, because I suspect some issuers and some merchants will roll on quicker, others will roll on slower. They all have their own compunctions, and I kind of understand that. So that's where I'm coming from.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.","Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Martina, I'm still confused about the transaction processing fees, the fact that they declined sequentially in the fourth quarter. I understand the pricing impact and everything, but was there -- or the PIN debit impact. Was there any sort of issuers hitting new pricing tiers or anything else going on that could have impacted that revenue line item?","Martina Hund-Mejean","No. We have seasonality, that's typical. You have to really -- you shouldn't look at this sequentially. You really have to look at that versus the year-ago quarter, and that's where I made my remarks that you really have to compare the 23% transaction processing growth versus the 12% transaction fee growth.","Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And let me just sneak in one last one.  Just as we think about moving to chip cards in the U.S. and mobile, globally, how should we think about that impacting MasterCard's economics broadly over the next few years?","Ajay Banga","Favorably, I'm hoping. That's where I'm coming from. So I hope to participate in it. I hope to get more volume out of the conversion of cash. I hope to get most secure transactions for my partners in the merchant world and the issuer world. That's kind of where I'm going with it, yes.","Martina Hund-Mejean","It's all part of driving our top line the way that we talked about it.","Operator","I'd now like to hand the call back over to our CEO, Ajay, for closing remarks.","Ajay Banga","Thank you. So let me leave you with just a few quick closing thoughts. And thank you all for those questions, folks. ","We had a terrific 2011. Our financial performance was driven by strength, not just in our base business, as well as tremendous execution by our employees across our regions, which led to some significant business wins. And that's the 3 concentric circle discussion that Martina got into. At the same time, we have made targeted investments and partnerships in our strategic focus areas. And I hope by doing that, what we're doing is to lay the foundation for longer-term growth. ","For the year ahead, we're very mindful of concerns around how the European economy will fare and  any knock-on effects around the world. The main effect on this -- the main impact of this would obviously be on that global consumer spending growth. But PCE is only one of our growth drivers, the other 2 being the proportion of electronic-to-cash payments and our share of that electronic portion. Those 2 areas are where we are focused. ","We will continue to execute at a local level to displace cash by driving issuance, acceptance in new categories and by delivering the benefits of electronic payments to more people, more institutions and more merchants. We're trying to ensure that we capture more than our fair share of payments growth. ","So once again, thank you for your participation.

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then the queue will open for questions.","You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted.","As a reminder, in Q2 we updated our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains or losses on our equity investments. We are excluding these items as we believe this will facilitate a better understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.","Our non-GAAP measures also exclude the impact of special items, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items. In addition, we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency with the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Please note that the growth rates we provide for switched volume, switched transactions and cross-border volume have been adjusted to normalize for the effects of differing switching days between periods.","Starting this quarter, we are further adjusting these growth rates to normalize for the effects of differing number of carryover days between periods. Carryover days are those where transactions and volumes from days where we do not clear and settle are processed. Generally, we do not clear and settle dual message transactions on Sundays. These adjustments have been made to current and prior quarters. This information is being provided so that you can better understand the underlying growth rates of our operating metrics.","Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted growth rates. We do not normalize GDV growth rates. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance.","Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga.","Ajay Banga","Thank you, Warren, and good morning everybody.","So we closed our 2019 on a strong note. And for the year, revenue was up 16% and EPS was up 23%, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. I think these results reflect broad based growth across each of our regions and the ongoing execution of our strategy as we continue to invest for the longer term.","On the macroeconomic environment, consumer spending remains relatively healthy, and we expect this to continue in 2020. We are, however, monitoring a number of economic and geopolitical factors as well as the potential effects of coronavirus that could impact this outlook.","In the U.S., we are seeing stable growth with low unemployment and healthy consumer confidence. Our SpendingPulse estimates for Q4 show retail sales remained solid, up 3.1% versus the year ago ex auto, ex gas.","In Europe, we see continued modest growth. UK spending actually held up reasonably well again, according to our SpendingPulse estimates with year-over-year retail sales up [technical difficulty] in Q4 ex auto, gas and restaurants despite uncertainty around the potential impact of Brexit.","In Asia Pacific, we are seeing modest GDP growth in the region overall, in part due to the support of favorable monetary policies in several markets. We are pleased with the recent trade deal with China and obviously, we'll continue our efforts to pursue a license to participate in that market domestically.","The outlook in Latin America is mixed as growth in Brazil and Colombia was partially offset by weakness in Argentina and Mexico. Meanwhile, we are driving healthy double-digit volume and transaction growth for Mastercard across most of our markets and these results are a function of us growing our core products of differentiating with our unique services, of expanding our digital solutions and footprint, and are leveraging our multi-rail capabilities to capture new payment flows.","So let me start by talking about driving growth in the core. We've done that through new wins as well as key renewals and expansions. Following on the heels of our recently announced extension with Citibank, we are excited to announce a renewal and extension of our relationship with Capital One.","We also signed an agreement with FasterPay to launch new debit, credit and payroll solutions for small and medium-sized businesses later this year. And we've renewed our deal with the Standard Bank Group of South Africa, the largest bank in Africa, which includes new issuance and will help us grow our share in that market and throughout the region.","On the co-brand front, the Amazon Rewards Mastercard has launched in Canada. MoneyLine, a U.S.-based mobile consumer finance platform has selected Mastercard as their exclusive partner for their new credit co-brand program, and will flip that existing consumer debit portfolio to us as well. In the travel space, we won a new co-brand deal with Vistara Airlines in India, and have also expanded a long running co-brand relationship, Norwegian Cruise Line in the United States.","Turning to prepaid, we have renewed our agreement with the network for Direct Express, which is the largest prepaid program in the world. This card issued by Comerica Bank is used by the U.S. government to make fast convenient and secure federal benefits disbursements.","And in debit we have expanded our presence in key emerging markets in China and India. In China we entered a new deal to be the preferred debit partner of China Construction Bank, the second-largest bank in China, and are also launching our first debit program with China CITIC Bank. In India, we have maintained our debit leadership through renewed debit deals with both HDFC Bank and State Bank of India, the largest public sector bank in the country.","So now to differentiated services and co-products wins such as these I've just talked about frequently included [technical difficulty] company. We continue to grow these services both organically and inorganically, and are making good progress in this regard.","And for example, Brighterion's artificial intelligence platform and NuData's behavioral biometric capabilities have been broadly integrated into our core security solutions to help customers minimize fraud and manage risk. And since joining Mastercard, Ethoca has signed over 350 new deals including a recent agreement with Microsoft to streamline their dispute process and improve the cardholder experience.","And while on the topic of acquisitions, I think we have bolstered our Cyber Intelligence Suite a step further with our recent acquisition of RiskRecon, a leading provider of AI and data analytics solutions. RiskRecon's best-in-class, Cyber Risk Assessment capabilities are designed to help financial institutions, merchants, corporations and governments secure their digital assets.","They will - we can build on their current customer base and develop new cyber security services. We are very pleased to have the RiskRecon team as part of the Mastercard family and we look forward to offering these solutions to our customers. ","So on to digital initiatives and our footprint there. We are expanding our digital solutions with the rollout of click to pay with new deals on our merchant tokenization solution and real progress on the contactless front. On click to pay we can announce that merchants such as [technical difficulty] and Saks Fifth Avenue are now live, enabling a faster and more secure guest check out experience for their customers.","Further beginning in mid-2020 this year, Citibank plans to streamline the checkout experience at participating merchants by leveraging push provisioning to make the click to pay enrollment process much easier for Citi branded credit card holders in North America.","We've also signed several deals with merchants for our tokenization capabilities, which as you know provide security and they sort of approve - the approval rates improve and a better experience for merchant customers. Recent partners who signed on to use this tokenized card and file solution include Amazon, Stripe MercadoLibre, PayPal and several of the largest U.S. wireless and telecom providers.","And on to contactless, whereas, I said, we're making real progress. This quarter contactless made up over 30% of global card present purchased [technical difficulty]. Contactless provides a frictionless and fast payment experience, which is opening new categories of spend including displacing cash on small ticket purchases.","The U.S. is poised for growth on this front and the New York City MTA is a good example of the potential for rapid adoption by consumers. In fact they've surpassed 5 million taps since the launch in May and MTA has plans to rollout contactless acceptance system-wide by the end of 2020.","And on to new payment flows and multi-rail capabilities, which we're using to penetrate new flows, including recent successes with Mastercard Send. Bank of America will now use Mastercard Send for their business-to-consumer card disbursements in the U.S. on an exclusive basis.","In the insurance space, Allstate will expand the use of Mastercard Send across their enterprise to power instant insurance claims payouts. PayPal will utilize Mastercard Send in 10 new markets across Asia Pacific [technical difficulty] to enable users to transfer funds from their PayPal wallets to their eligible cards.","We're also leveraging our capabilities to help facilitate more efficient cross-border payments. So here's an example. Swiss Bankers, a Swiss prepaid card issuer, launched a new money transfer service using Mastercard Send that enables consumers to make secure payments to recipients' bank accounts, digital wallets and eligible cards in 18 countries. We're also partnering with [technical difficulty] which is the switches in Russia and the Central Bank in Russia to bring cross-border functionality to the Russian domestic Faster Payments system.","Moving on to Bill Pay. We've gone live in the U.S. with our Bill Pay Exchange product. We're leveraging technology from our Transactis acquisition. Bill Pay Exchange provides an enhanced Bill Pay experience for banks, for consumers and for billers.","And our initial launch partners include U.S. Bank, Aliaswire and Avidia Bank, with Jack Henry & Associates agreeing to participate later this year. We plan to add additional functionality and new partners throughout 2020.","We've also entered into a partnership with Pine Labs. They provide a range of point-of-sale and prepaid solutions to merchants across India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. This partnership is focused on offering installment payment solutions to merchants and consumers across both card and real-time payment rails.","Beyond [technical difficulty], we also want to work with Pine Labs to offer a range of prepaid, loyalty and cybersecurity services to customers. And this partnership is consistent with our strategy to deliver greater choice to consumers and be the partner of choice for our customers.","Open Banking is another area where we've worked for some time to develop the right set of comprehensive solutions and services that work for all the players in the ecosystem, banks, fintechs, merchants and consumers.","Our solutions are live today in Europe, and we are focused on ensuring that the ecosystem can provide for the real-time exchange of information and transactions while, most importantly, protecting the interests and data of all participants, including our fintech and bank customers.","We see Open Banking as an important global trend and as a significant opportunity and believe that our leadership in data privacy as well as our scale in real-time and cross-border payments are very [technical difficulty] to optimizing Open Banking solutions for banks, for fintechs, for merchants and for consumers globally.","Now beyond payments, we made good progress on our digital identity solution. Here, digital identity is aiming to allow individuals to own, control and share their identity credentials their way on the devices they use every day. We believe that our commitment to the responsible handling of personal information, letting consumers have ownership of their own data and giving them control over which data is used and how it is used is critical to a consumer's increasingly digital life.","Mastercard's network is able to check a consumer's chosen credentials and confirm them for the intended recipient and purpose without ever taking possession of the underlying identity data. So Mastercard is uniquely positioned in this field given our experience in governance and operating [technical difficulty] our focus on financial inclusion, our announced and clear sensibility to data privacy and our commitment to investment in a global interoperable infrastructure.","We have recently launched pilots in public and private institutions in Australia, which actually is one of the countries at the forefront of digital identification. And this set of pilots enables participants to use their digital identities to access certain government and student services. We have also additional digital identity [technical difficulty] pilots that you will see us introducing in more markets throughout 2020, and we look forward to continuing to innovate and grow and embed ourselves on this front.","With that, let me turn the call over to Sachin for an update on our financial results and our operational metrics. Sachin?","Sachin Mehra","Thanks Ajay.","So turning to Page 3, you will see that we've delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter to end the year. Here are a few highlights on a currency-neutral basis, and excluding special items, as well as the impact of gains and losses on the company's equity investments.","Net revenue grew 17%, driven by solid, broad-based momentum in our core products and services. Acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to this growth. Total operating expenses increased 12%, which includes a 4 ppt increase related to acquisitions.","Operating income grew by 22% and net income was up 25%, reflecting our strong operating performance and which includes a 2 ppt and [technical difficulty] ppt reduction due to acquisitions, respectively.","EPS grew 28% year-over-year to $1.96, which includes a $0.05 contribution from share repurchases and $0.02 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions. During the quarter, we repurchased about $1 billion worth of stock and an additional $438 million through January 27, 2020.","So now let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 12% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from last quarter, primarily due to the impact of the differing number of processing days between periods, as well as some lapping of previous wins.","U.S. GDV grew 9%, down approximately 3 ppt from last quarter, with credit and debit growth of 12% and 7%, respectively. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 14%, down 2 ppt from last quarter. Cross-border volume grew at 16% on a local currency basis, driven by double-digit growth across most regions.","Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions showed strong growth at 19% globally, reflecting in part the ongoing adoption of contactless. We saw healthy double-digit growth in switched transactions across most regions. In addition, card growth was 5%. Globally, there are 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.","Now let's go to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. The 17% net revenue increase was primarily driven by strong transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in our services offerings, partially offset by rebates and incentives. As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 1 ppt to this growth.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 14%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily driven by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 16%, in line with cross-border volume growth of 16%. Transaction processing fees grew 18%, while switched transactions grew 19%. The 1 ppt difference is primarily driven by mix.","Finally, on other revenues, which were up 25%, including a 4 ppt contribution from acquisitions, the remaining growth was primarily driven by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions.","Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a currency-neutral non-GAAP basis, total operating expenses increased 12%. This includes 4 ppt related to acquisitions as well as 2 ppt related to the differential in hedging gains and losses versus the year-ago period. The remaining 6 ppt of growth related to our continued investment in strategic initiatives, such as digital enablement, safety and security, geographic expansion and new payment flows.","Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we've seen through the first 3 weeks of January, where each of our drivers are generally consistent with what we saw in Q4. The numbers through January 21 are as follows; starting with switched volume. We saw global growth of 15%, similar to the fourth quarter.","In the U.S., our switched volume grew 11%. Switched volume grew - switched volume outside the U.S. grew [technical difficulty]. Globally, switched transaction growth was 19%, similar to the fourth quarter.","With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 15% globally, down 1 ppt sequentially. For the year, we expect cross-border growth to be in the mid-teens range, and this is contemplated in our thoughts for revenue growth for the year.","Turning now to Slide 9 and our thoughts for 2020. We expect the economic outlook to be similar to what we saw in 2019. Our business fundamentals remain strong, with growth driven by a mix of new deals, new agreements and the expansion of our differentiated service offerings.","We expect net revenue to grow at a low-teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Rebates and incentives growth is expected to be higher year-over-year, driven by renewed and expanded deals that Ajay just commented on.","In the first quarter, net revenue growth is expected to be about 2 ppt lower than this annual estimate, primarily due to higher growth in rebates and incentives. We expect that net revenue growth will increase throughout the balance of the year as we implement new wins and season-related volume. Foreign exchange is expected to have a minimal impact to annual growth but is expected to be about a 1 ppt headwind in the first quarter.","In terms of operating expenses, we expect growth for both the year and the first quarter at the high end of the high single-digit range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This is driven by our continued investments in digital, analytics and security products and platforms to address new payment flows. Foreign exchange is expected to have a minimal impact to OpEx growth for both the year and the first quarter.","Turning to M&A. As you know, over the years, we have used acquisitions to supplement our organic efforts and diversify our revenues. You have seen this in areas such as data analytics, cyber and intelligence, loyalty and costs in developing multi-rail solutions for our customers. This has helped expand our addressable markets, drive new revenue streams and strengthen our core product solutions. As a reminder, we are disciplined in our approach as we work with our acquisitions to break even within 24 months of close.","With that context, let me outline the expected 2020 impacts of our recent acquisitions, which are progressing well. In terms of net revenues, we expect acquisitions to add about 2 ppt [technical difficulty] for the year and about 1 ppt for Q1, assuming that the transaction with Nets closes in the second quarter, which is our current estimate.","For OpEx, acquisitions are expected to add an additional 7 to 9 ppt to growth for both the year and the quarter. For the year, this estimate includes the full year effect of the acquisitions made in 2019, including purchase accounting and integration-related costs. This also assumes the anticipated closing of the transaction with Nets.","A couple of other items of note beyond acquisitions. In other income and expense line, we are at a quarterly expense run rate of approximately $50 million based on our current debt levels. This excludes gains and losses from our equity investments. With respect to tax, you should assume a tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% for the year.","So just to sum all of this up, 2019 was an excellent year, both in terms of financial performance and in setting us up for the future. We have signed a number of important deals, developed a strong pipeline of products to address growth in the short, medium and long term and made several acquisitions to broaden our capabilities. We are pleased with the progress we are making, and our outlook for 2020 is for continued strong growth.","With that, let me turn the call back to Warren to begin the Q&A session.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thanks, Sachin. Marcella, we are now ready for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom from UBS. Your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much and good morning. Ajay, I just wanted to see if we could get an update on the progress on Mastercard Track. And in terms of the U.S. experience and maybe Australia, which I think was also recently initiated in the past year.","Ajay Banga","Yes. So Track actually you've got different elements, Australia was part of the whole B2B Hub you are referring to U.S. also had a B2B Hub but Track is an overall approach to the B2B payment space that starts with having the right merchant directories and then connects - and sort of small business and business directories that are all compliance run through in the fully informed directory attached to an invoice presentment engine that also enables our payment optimization engine and the reconciliation system.","That's all built inside. Then it uses the distribution channels, one of which is something like the B2B hubs that we have talked about in the past, but it can also go to what our issuers agents and buyers\u2019 agents and as the whole ecosystem there that we are getting into and putting our footprint into.","So that's kind of where we are. We piloted during 2019 big customers the full business payment service kind of solution, which we've been developing in the U.S. and in fact also in Latin America. We are rolling it out globally starting in the U.S. in the first quarter [technical difficulty]. We will get to more geographies and more payments over time. That's what we are at, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going.","Eric Wasserstrom","And if I can just have one follow-up on that. To the extent that - to what extent is the - are the volumes and revenue benefits from the Mastercard Track hub and the SME B2B space contemplated in the 2020 outlook?","Ajay Banga","As we've told you when we were discussing this at Investor Day as well, this is more developed. For example our corporate purchasing cards, our fleet cards, our SME cards, our virtual account numbers, our cross-border travel payment systems, those are all relatively well developed and are well factored into the way we think about 2020.","The B2B Hub to an extent because it\u2019s got Bank of America, First Hawaiian and Fifth Third in the U.S. and MYOB in Australia, but that's like four customers across the world. And for a company of our size, well, that's important for B2B, it is a bigger picture.","What we're really talking about is adding those on over the course of the next 2 to 3 years. So we don't have that built in any great way in 2020, and if we knock the lights out from that, that will be great, but I have a view that this kind of thing takes a little time.","Remember as I explained the ecosystem, not only do you build the technology across all of those phases, you also have to sign up all the distribution that enables you to connect with this relatively new ecosystem that Track is specifically aimed at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","I was encouraged to hear the mid-teens outlook for cross-border. I have been getting a lot of questions on the Coronavirus and how to kind of maybe frame this. I'll ask you guys if you don\u2019t mind. How much of your cross border book is tied to the China region, and is there a way to maybe look back or reference SARS or swine flu or something else to maybe get a clue on what this one might do. Thanks.","Sachin Mehra","Let me give you a little bit of color on cross border, right? So as I mentioned, we do see double-digit growth across most of our regions as it relates to cross border. And, as I kind of sit back and I think about it, we had good solid steady performance coming out of the U.S. As it relates to EMEA, and that's, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific as well, we continue to see solid growth. We saw some softness [technical difficulty] Mexico, a function of the local environment out there but by and large the business is running in a very healthy pace.","To your specific question around the impact of the Coronavirus, here is what I tell you, it's early days, fortunately, a decent portion of our inbound and outbound cross border from China is e-com related. So it provides some level of a hedge. And we will continue to monitor the environment. It's too early to tell at this point in time, how this thing plays out.","Ajay Banga","If you remember Tien-Tsin, people have brought their tickets and they are still travelling out for the Lunar New Year. At this stage, if this is much bigger and it becomes a much more sort of urgent and immediate crisis across many parts of the world, then we'll take a look at those numbers once again, but we're going to take this as it comes, one step at a time, and that's the only way to look at this carefully.","You got to remember when SARS was on and that was way back in the early part of the last decade in 2003 and 2004, the total business in China was also smaller. The total size of our Company was also smaller, and our ability to be a real player in cross-border across many corridors 18 years ago was very different.","So I kind of wouldn't go too much on that. I would rather, think about the natural hedge that e-commerce provides the fact that there's still a lot of travel there, but that could change over the next few weeks, and we\u2019ll keep an eye on it very carefully.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Just real quick follow-up, if you don't mind just on the, I think I heard you say, Bank of America Mastercard Send that was an exclusive arrangement is that the case. And I'm curious if that's maybe a new model that we can expect with that product?","Ajay Banga","It's actually correct you did hear correctly. Your ears are in good shape Tien-Tsin, even if you had an AirPod shoved inside. But I'm not going to I can't tell you if that's a new model going forward. It's the way that, in this particular case, Bank of America finds value from what we are doing. I don't know yet [technical difficulty] two of these don't make a trend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is open.","Craig Maurer","I had a question about recent acquisition activity in the space. Your largest competitor seems to have gone in a somewhat different direction from what we've seen from your acquisitions. And I wanted to get your updated thoughts on acquisitions that moved Mastercard closer to the consumer or closer directly to the merchant?","Ajay Banga","Hi Craig, we've done it - well closer to the consumer. You can remember, we are a B2B2C company. And so what we're not trying to do is get in between our customers and their consumers that's really not. What we are trying to do is to provide services or capabilities or product sets or [technical difficulty] structure that enables that customer to be a merchant. It could be a government the [transit] authority, a bank, a fintech reach their consumer better.","That yes, a 100% that's we're into. So for example, in your specific question or around how you reach fintechs and the like. I'm assuming that's where the reference to our competitor comes from. We've built a series of capabilities in Europe, where as you know, PSD2 has changed the layout between fintechs and banks very substantively.","And there, we were actually live with the whole idea of connect, protect and resolve and consult capabilities across a number of fintechs and banks and AISPs and PISPs and all the terminology that has now become part of the day-to-day conversation in Europe. That's a fairly strong position for us. What I do want to make sure in all of this, with merchants, for example, your question around merchants, you don't series of transactions that provide data, analytical and cybersecurity [technical difficulty] services to merchants.","Ethoca is a most recent example. RiskRecon is even more recent than that. Loyalty reward schemes that we bought some years ago are connected to that. Brighterion does a series of things with merchants and banks and fintechs so most of our acquisitions cut across this ecosystem. What I am permitted to, is to doing it in a way that respects the rights and the privileges of all the different players in the ecosystem and doing it in a way that [technical difficulty] protects data and privacy all through the system.","So we will keep looking for acquisitions that enhance those few words I just mentioned: security and privacy of data, the responsibilities and rights and the priorities of different players in the ecosystem. You'll see us doing that very carefully, very sensibly and keeping at it.","Craig Maurer","If I could ask one follow-up just on the guidance. What's the thought process for rebates and incentives for the full year as a percentage of gross revenue?","Sachin Mehra","Sorry could you say that again, you broke out there, [Craig though].","Ajay Banga","The percentage, I think.","Sachin Mehra","Yes.","Craig Maurer","Yes, sorry.","Sachin Mehra","Yes, I think I got it on rebates and incentives. Your question was what's the guidance on rebate and incentives I'm not going to give you specific guidance. But what I will tell you is we do expect the level of growth in rebates and incentives to pick up in 2020. That's on the back of the deals which we've signed.","That's what the news as far as I'm concerned because the way it kind of plays out is these are new and expanded [technical difficulty] deals that come with incremental volume. All of that kind of plays into the thoughts I've shared for 2020.","Craig Maurer","Okay, thank you.","Ajay Banga","Craig, one last point on acquisitions. You should expect us to remain relatively committed to the idea of buying something that can break even at the end of year two. And then it becomes part of our base. We no longer pull it out, and you should expect that discipline from us.","I believe there is adequate target in the ecosystem [technical difficulty] in our priority areas that can help us grow while doing that in a way that transforms our company as it has done for the last 10 years in a sensible way. That is the right way to approach the value of an acquisition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis","So, looking for a few comments on China, not on the coronavirus, just more broadly it feels like with the recent trade agreement and then some of these announcements with Alipay and WeChat Pay, opening up their wallets to cards, PayPal's, I guess, recent acquisition of GoPay there. It feels like the market might actually finally be loosening up. But on the other hand, we felt this way before.","Ajay, I was just kind of curious, what's your current sort of optimism level around Mastercard gaining access to the domestic China market, sense of timing, likelihood? And then an updated view maybe on how you're thinking about approaching this market given it's so different from others around the world?","Ajay Banga","Yes so Lisa, I'm going to have to take away anything to do with the coronavirus obviously in the answer because that's got an impact that I don't yet know how to predict, specifically for China. I mean we as a company have, on that particular topic we've actually given our employees two extra weeks to work from home using that ability so that we try and help them manage their own families and their own situation [technical difficulty] in a way that's responsible for them.","So we're clearly worried and nervous, like everybody else is, about what's going on there. So just move on from that. And I'd say the trade deal itself, it is the first time that I've seen a trade deal where companies are mentioned by name in terms of what should be agreed upon between two different governments in a bilateral trade deal. I hope that means that all of us will get a better chance to play in the domestic ecosystem in China and that we will bring them [technical difficulty] our ability to party. And then we'll find and win what we can win.","We are late to the party because the digital players there have already built substantially good businesses and, frankly, with very good offerings. So they deserve to have won what they've won. The question will be how do, we then break in and how well do we do in that, and that's going to be our task in China. My general attempt about that part of the businesses, I've seen this movie earlier. I'm going to only say anything about [technical difficulty] what we actually see something in writing that changes what our position on the ground is.","Meanwhile, we're doing things. We - publicly there's been speculation that we are looking at partners to be able to go into the domestic processing business with. That's kind of one angle which everybody is looking at so are we. There's clearly an effort to build out the acquiring footprint so that our acceptance expansion can begin to happen. There's an effort to build out the issuing relationships so that, that [technical difficulty] hit the ground running.","Meanwhile, you referred to Alibaba and WeChat accepting our cards into their domestic wallet. That's also been part of some effort. There's conversations going on with them on all kinds of partnership opportunities where we may compete or may not compete. So it's kind of - there's a lot going on in China. We are hiring people. We've been doing that for the last two or three years. We're building talent and skills on the ground.","So kind of that's where we are. And I think my approach to the market there is [technical difficulty] there will infrastructure capability, build acceptance, build the right partnerships, build people and skills on the ground and learn how to do that in a market that is as you said, dramatically different from the others. So, I think local presence, local knowledge and local capability is going to be really important in China.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. And then maybe as my follow-up, just a quick update on the contactless deployment in the U.S. Do you have any updated stats on sort of where we are in terms of card issuance, merchant acceptance and are you expecting in the 2020 outlook an uptick in U.S. volumes as a result of that or is it more of a 2021 dynamic? Thank you.","Ajay Banga","I'm pretty certain that U.S. contactless will keep growing throughout 2020 quite attractively. Because if you look at the numbers of the number of bank partners that have committed to issue contactless cards - for a minute let's even forget Apple Pay and Samsung Pay that enable every card through their RFID [technical difficulty] devices to be used. If you just look at the number of cards, we're talking about 70% of our total cards in the U.S. market will be reissued over this 12-month to 14-month period.","My own personal cards are already contactless from Citi. And so, I think you'll see that happening. Cabela's is doing that. There's a bunch of others that are actually deeply embedded into the idea of contactless cards. On the acceptance side, as you know, the kind of all new terminals going out are embedded with contactless. So [technical difficulty] the large retailers like Target and 7-Eleven and CVS have announced that they will accept contactless payments.","And in fact, over half of U.S. card-present transactions are now happening at contactless-enabled merchant locations. And when the MTA rolls it out system-wide in New York City, and there are other transit systems beginning to do the same in their cities, I think you will get the impetus. Some of it will come in 2020 to your earlier question. More of it will come in 2021. But outside the U.S., that kind of growth pattern is pretty strongly embedded. You know that in Australia, over 80% of transactions under AUD 100 are contactless. So there's a lot going on in that space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.","Christopher Donat","Thanks for work on contactless as an MTA rider, I deeply appreciate not having to swipe anymore. The question I wanted to ask, Ajay, was about the other revenue and the percentage - or the portion of that that's organic. Just how sustainable is this roughly 20% level of growth in organic other revenue and - or is it even possible to accelerate with some of your work on the data and other offerings?","Ajay Banga","[Technical difficulty] Sachin, go ahead.","Sachin Mehra","Sure. Hey Chris, so very quickly, some color around the other revenues line item, right. I mean you've seen that in Q4, we talked about a 25% growth rate in other revenues. That had about 4 PPT coming from acquisitions. So that's where you come up with your number of about 20% for Q4. Let me give you some context. There are three main components, which are there in other revenues.","Some of our services lines roll up here, things like cyber and intelligence products, data analytics, consulting and managed services as well as loyalty, right, a significant portion of [technical difficulty] recurring in nature, although there are some such as consulting and loyalty engagements that are project-based and can have some timing between quarters.","The second item, which is there in other revenues is our Vocalink-related revenues. And again, this is recurring in nature. And finally, we put a number of our recent acquisitions, and I know you said net of acquisitions. But remember, the acquisitions which we have done will at some point in time become the equivalent of organic growth to your sense. And we put those into the other revenue because of the [technical difficulty] model. So net-net-net, I would tell you, a decent portion of other revenues is recurring in nature, although we're not providing specific estimates for this line item. I will say other revenues, excluding acquisitions, we expect that to grow faster than the overall company growth rate.","Ajay Banga","Remember that the - a lot of the acquisitions are basically either meant to enhance what Sachin started with, which is our data analytics capability or our cyber and security capability or our managed loyalty capability. A number of - not all of them, but a number of them. When you do that, and two years into acquiring them to become part of the base, they then become part of organic revenue and expenses. So we have to manage the business in a way that at the end of the second year, breaks even, each of them individually and then starts becoming margin-accretive in the third year.","That's the discipline that's embedded inside the company's P&L line-by-line with each business that acquired [technical difficulty] a single entity during the year. So absolutely, I expect that organic growth will continue to be good in that line item and as Sachin said, probably higher than that of the whole company.","Christopher Donat","And just as a follow-up, Sachin, on the project-based component of that, is that - that's relatively small though, right the recurring component of the other revenue is much more significant, right?","Sachin Mehra","[Technical difficulty] component is more significant than the project-based component. And as I mentioned, it's the project-based stuff is typically our consulting and managed services and loyalty pieces. But then again, you go back into cyber and intelligence recurring nature of Vocalink, recurring in nature, a lot of these things are things where you sign agreements and then they kind of stay in play for some time. So yes.","Ajay Banga","There's been a lot of effort that's gone in to convert some of the nonrecurring into recurring and the manner in which we sign deals and have to work with partners. Part of the idea of what we like is recurring revenue, but that's non-recurring because it opens it all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","I just want to hone in a little more on cross-border for a minute just given that it did show a little bit of a deceleration into January. I think you said 15%, and comps do get easier. So just - I know you talked about mid-teens for the year, but can you give us more color on what type of activity you're seeing in terms of specifically e-comm versus travel. And then I don't think I've ever heard you update what the e-comm percentage of cross-border actually is. If you can help us with that?","Sachin Mehra","Yes. So on cross-border, first, I would just kind of caution and say we're three weeks into the month of January, and the one PPT decline, which you're seeing between 16% in Q4 and 15% in the first three weeks of January, I wouldn't make too much of that, right. Hence the comment which I made about you still expect mid-teens from a cross-border standpoint.","Just - but more specifically around some color around what we're seeing in a cross-border standpoint, steady growth in the U.S. right. As it relates to our card-not-present cross-border, we see that at approximately 20%, and that's fairly consistent as we've seen over the past few quarters.","As it relates to region by region, in Q4, our APMEA region, which is the combination of Asia Pacific and Middle East and Africa, saw some accelerated pace, as I mentioned earlier. And on the flip side, in LAC, we saw some level of weakness in Mexico, in particular. But there are puts and takes every quarter on this. That's really the color, which I've got. It's steady as it goes as far as cross-border growth right now, and then we'll pick it up from there.","Darrin Peller","All right. Just a quick kind of housekeeping. I mean you still expect Nets to close, I think you said, first half. I just want to verify that. And if you could remind us of any potential financial impact that we should expect on the year with that on the top and bottom line. And then also, when you think of, Ajay, just make sure that deal doesn't preclude you from doing other meaningful deals this year, are you really on the active hunt right now for something in the first half?","Ajay Banga","So on the deal front, I - as I said earlier, we look at 40, 50, 60 deals in a year. And in some years, we closed none or 1 or 2, and last year provided more than that number. And honestly, there's a group of people who are like moms in a Santa shop that are working very hard on this. I don't like that reference. And they're working away really hard on this thing, right? And they produce stuff. And then we kind of look at it and say, that one doesn't make sense either because it doesn't fit our strategic profile or the M&A numbers don't make sense or that somehow it doesn't respect those principles I was thinking about when I was asking Craig - answering his question.","Or some of them [technical difficulty] too. And then yet others get lost along the way because the negotiation doesn't work out or the due diligence scares the heck out of us. And so it just carries on like that. I don't know how to give you an answer. I would tell you, nothing has changed. I've been on the hunt from the day I joined and still in the hunt.","Sachin Mehra","Yes. I'll just add to Ajay's comment. You asked specifically about Nets. Obviously, we're going through the regulatory approval process as we speak right now. It's our estimate to close Nets in the second quarter of this year. That's the basis of what I've given and the nature of thoughts for 2020, where I kind of mentioned to you that on a full year basis, we expect about a two PPT contribution from acquisitions on revenues and somewhere in that 7% to 9% growth in OpEx relate to acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Trevor Williams","Sorry to pile on the China theme, but I'm just curious on the outbound cross-border volume from China. So is China UnionPay and WeChat and Alipay have been partnering more with acquirers globally to expand their acceptance footprint outside of China. I guess I'm just wondering longer term, how much of a risk you think there could be to your outbound cross-border volume just if acceptance of those three big Chinese players reaches critical mass, just at least in the major tourist hubs. And I'm not sure if I caught this in response to the question from Tien-Tsin, but I was just wondering what percentage of cross-border is Chinese outbound?","Ajay Banga","We don't. The first part, I can tell you what's going on. I mean, look, first of all, this is not a new issue of these bilateral agreements between what cut and the Chinese digital wallets with players outside. You should know that the top specifically is concerned because of the way the Chinese rules change over time. What used to be a dual-branded card which are still large numbers there, all the new issuance is single-branded.","So banks that are issuing our cards in China, and we are issuing both protocols there every year, those are all now single-branded. And therefore, when they go overseas, those cards can only be running on Mastercard rails, and their transactions cannot be taken on to somebody else's rails. That's just factual.","And so just as there's a put and a take on both sides of that, similarly, in the case of the digital wallets, outbound - while - both inbound and outbound used to be not as plain in Alipay and WeChat. You now have known and seen that they've announced for inbound, and there's always ways for them to work with them like we're already doing on different aspects of their outbound work.","Will that lead to a completely open system or not? I don't know. Will that change? Will we also operating domestically because the total scale and size of our operation with them will change? I don't know. We'll see.","Meanwhile, there's a lot of volume that comes out of China, which has been enabled by the new digital players that I don't believe is going away from us. This is - it's the bigger size of the pie game that we're also talking about. And so our growth on cross-border out of China has been relatively healthy. It goes through its quarterly ups and downs. It goes through stuff, but it's relatively healthy.","And I presume that will stay that way over the next few years. Obviously, coronavirus and stuff, as we discussed, already could change a quarter here or a quarter there. I don't know that yet. And we're very carefully keeping an eye on it. But in the big picture, I still see lots of opportunity on our bond cross-border from China.","Trevor Williams","And just one quick follow-up. I was hoping to just get a little bit more color around some of the mix dynamics. So I know last quarter was a bit unique. You had negative mix across domestic assessments, cross-border and transaction processing. In the domestic assessments, there was a couple hundred basis point benefit this quarter just with pricing, but it looked like transaction processing was lower again due to mix just relative to process transaction growth. Just curious, anything there that you can provide just color-wise to help explain the delta?","Sachin Mehra","Yes. So our transaction processing growth rate. And as you know, switched transactions are growing at a nice clip at 19%. And we're pretty much in line from a transaction processing fee standpoint. What I would tell you is as the business grows and as we do more and the nature of contactless payments, so on and so forth, and you start to proliferate down into smaller-ticket payments, it does have an impact from a mix standpoint. You will expect to see that take \u2013 just depending on market and [technical difficulty] in question. I wouldn't make too much of the disparity between the two.","The other thing I would tell you is in transaction processing fees, there are line items which are beyond just the high correlation to switched transactions. In other words, some portion of our services are related revenues also are comprising the transaction processing fees.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from BoA. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg","I wanted to start with a question just on U.S. credit volume growth still remains quite robust here. I'm wondering how many more quarters of tailwind do we have from Cabela's before that laps. Are you seeing any noticeable uptick from the Apple Card, Venmo card? Or any commentary on kind of the consumer versus the commercial pieces of U.S. credit? And just at a high level, trying to get a sense of the sustainability of these double-digit levels as you do get to some tougher comps, I think, in the next few quarters.","Sachin Mehra","Jason, it's Sachin. So very quickly, I want to give you a little bit of color on - I mentioned earlier about - in my prepared remarks, something about lapping of wins. The Cabela's portfolio has begun to lap, right, as part of our Q4 metrics, as I mentioned earlier, so also Kroger's. But then overall, the market share wins which we've had over the course of the last 12 months, that's starting to roll on. So you're starting to see some of that come on in the nature of Apple Card, so on and so forth.","Also, I will mention that we talked about the deals we signed with Citi and Capital One. We would expect for that to also start to roll in. So there's going to be puts and takes. There will be previously won portfolios which will lap, and then there'll be new portfolios and new market share wins which will come in. so all in all, good performance from a credit standpoint in the U.S., as you mentioned.","Jason Kupferberg","And just one for Ajay. I'm curious to get your thoughts on synergies potentially between Nets and Vocalink. I know there's some differences there in geographic exposure. But are there some broader enhancements to your alternative network capabilities from the Nets deal? Or are these just kind of separate offerings for different segments of the real-time payments market?","Ajay Banga","Yes and yes, actually. It's a really good question. What we're buying - it's a really good question. What we're buying with Nets Corporate Services in the Nordics is not just the similar thing to what Vocalink does. So Vocalink both operates the infrastructure, provides for the software real-time payments as well as batch processing and ATM [technical difficulty] but also provides applications and services on top of that infrastructure in the United Kingdom.","That is more similar to the P27 deal we signed in the Nordics, where with the banks in the Nordics, we're going to implement fast and real-time payment capabilities using Vocalink's sort of structure and then operate it for them in the Nordics. We're doing that in a number of other countries around the world. We're doing it in different flavors. Some of them are software deals. Some of them we'll operate everything. So Saudi, Peru, the Philippines and so on, right? So there's that element.","The Nets Corporate Services piece that we've bought in - that we're trying to close on in the second quarter in the Nordics actually provides for using all those underlying services for payments and builds, and they connect all the B2B payment systems. They connect all kinds of players in the Nordics and outside of the Nordics with Nordics there.","So that's a whole different capability. I'm quite hopeful that we can apply both these solutions to different segments, as well as enhance each other's capabilities in different markets around the world.","So Paul Stoddart, who runs all this for us and came out of Vocalink, he used to be the Chief Operating Officer of Vocalink when we first bought them. Paul's kind of the guy who's running all this for us and stitching it together over the next period of time. It's a great question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi","I was wondering if you could talk about the margin profile of the business short and long term. I know you've given comments on the back past that you don't run the business to the margin. But given the differences between you and your competitor, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on your - on the progression or cadence there.","AjayBanga","So my view has been that we will - it's a mathematical calculation of business in some ways. As long as you keep revenue on the margin appropriately and you manage your expenses right, this business has a higher fixed cost and a lower variable cost per transaction. If you add more capacity and you pump more volume through it, you will find yourself growing as the margin - even on your operating margin. That's just math.","What's changing along the way is that we're trying to take that math and apply that surplus we get to building and diversifying the revenues of this company. And those, when you acquire those businesses, they may not follow that. But over time, they get there as a number of our services businesses used to be less recurring, back to an earlier question. Now they have got a much higher profile of recurring revenue.","A number of our services businesses, their margins have grown over time as the volume being put through them, thanks to their access to our network of distribution and partners, increases. So our attitude towards our margin is healthy growth, not kind of pushing that as what we managed to. We manage gross and net revenue and we manage through expenses, and we manage that kind of space for our future. We don't actually manage through margin.","That's why, as said, we'll keep a healthy margin of 50-plus because I want you to know I'm not going to throw money away, kind of my reference to even the acquisitions and the discipline around the acquisitions. But the idea is that we will eventually, always through math, be growing sensibly. You could see it over the last few years.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. And then just as a follow-up - I'm sorry. Just there is no...","Warren Kneeshaw","[indiscernible].","Joseph Foresi","Okay, great. I appreciate it. Well, this will - I'll make it a softball then so we can end on a good note. Yes. Well, I'll do my best now. Focus is on it, right? So - but you've done a great job of expanding your addressable market into new areas. We talked about B2B and contactless. And I know China is on the horizon maybe over the long term. Which of these areas are you most excited about in the short term over the next year? Where should we be spending our time because there just seems to be an expanding amount of areas in your expanding addressable market?","Ajay Banga","I think over the short term, you should continue to remain very focused on our Cyber & Intelligence services business, and you should look forward to more growth in contactless. Everything else, just by the nature of the ecosystem that we work in, has a longer time to resolve than these. These ones, we're able to put [technical difficulty] solution system in a form that enables us to have a little more control over the outcome than we would in the others. We've got to work everybody towards it.","Warren Kneeshaw","All right. Thanks. Any final comments, Ajay?","Ajay Banga","Yes, sir. First, I'm going to wrap up very quickly. Thank you for all your questions. We've had another strong year. We've had broad-based growth across each of our regions. We're driving solid deal momentum. We're trying to capture new flows through the conversation we were just having with our multi-rail capabilities. Our recent acquisitions are performing well within the businesses that we've talked about again today. We look forward to working with our new colleagues from RiskRecon. We've got another one, the Nets Corporate Services, on the horizon. When that comes in, we're going to work hard with them. And we're progressing well against the three-year performance objectives that we laid out for you for 2019, 2020 and 2021.","With that, thank you all for being a part of this journey, and thanks again for joining us.","Warren Kneeshaw","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Sean I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the MasterCard Fourth Quarter Full-Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Barbara Gasper, you may begin your conference.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for a discussion about our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the QA makes session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question. Even if you think you have already dialed into the queue, you will need to register again for the QA following our prepared comments.","This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found on the investor relations section of our website, www.mastercard.com. These documents include some reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents so I would like to call your attention to the several appendix slides at the end of the slide deck. The documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one month.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earning release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Ajay","Ajay Banga","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased to be able to deliver strong results for both our fourth quarter and the full year performance, even with the mixed global economy. For the fourth quarter, after we adjust for the euro and the Brazilian real translations, we report net revenue growth of 9% and EPS growth of 22% driven by solid underlying metrics. And for the full year, we saw net revenue growth of 8% and EPS growth of 18%, excluding special items.","And most importantly, when you remove the impact of the functional currency translation, as I just said, for the euro and the Brazilian real, but also for what we call local FX which is the impact from other transactional currency pairs. Our fourth quarter net revenue growth was 12%. And on that basis, for the full year net revenue growth was almost 11%.","Moving onto the global economy, we continue to see challenges in many parts of the world. The U.S. economy seems the most resilient and had good growth in both consumer spending and jobs. In Europe, growth is expected to increase at the fastest pace since 2011, although this is at a lower-level, driven by stronger domestic demand and exports. However, several big emerging market economies, China and Brazil being examples, are experiencing either week or slowing growth.","And of course oil prices and their impact on oil-sensitive markets around the world, political instability, security concerns in some tourist destinations, these are all concerns that bare careful watching. We're globally connected as a Company and so what you've got to do is to work to successfully navigate through these challenges exactly as we have in the past.","So with that backdrop, let's get into our business. Our business continues to grow and our fundamentals remain strong. We saw double-digit volume and transaction growth across all regions except for the U.S. We saw growth in the mid to high single digits. In additionally, our services businesses provide a nice complement to our volume-based core business and continue to show good growth.","So moving onto a few highlights of the year and some of our recent business activity. Overall, I'd say 2015 was a year that had its economic challenges and maybe also had a deal of foreign exchange volatility. And as I said earlier, not just in the euro or Brazilian real which are functional currencies, but in the other local transaction currency pairs as well. But despite all that, I think we have navigated these circumstances well and we but significant points on the board as a result of our investments in digital payments in safety and security as well as in a financial inclusion. And this year we've talked about winning some significant customer deals and called on many of those in previous calls, but to cap off the year, let me mention a few that we had in the fourth quarter.","So this past quarter we renewed and we expanded our relationships with a number of our larger customers including, in this case, Citigroup's commercial card portfolios in Asia-Pacific, in Europe and the United States. The HSBC premier consumer credit business covering 28 markets around the world. In Italy we signed the long term debit agreement with both Italian to migrate their Maestro cards to debit MasterCard. But we also expanded advisor services to help them drive financial inclusion and digital products for their customers. In Russia, VTB24 which is the second largest bank and the card issuer in that country, is converting their debit card portfolio to MasterCard. And another example, we signed the long term renewal with Qatar National Bank, one of the largest banks in the Arab world, for their debit card portfolio.","Turning to China, I don't have anything new to report to you about the opening of the domestic market. That's still a work in process. But we're executing on certain elements that have already been in the draft regulations, such as building out our technology underground. Meanwhile, we're continuing to work with our Chinese customers as they, themselves, prepare for the next wave of payments growth as well as to expand into the digital space. So let me give you two or three examples to give you some color on what are doing.","We were closing with Bank of China and ICBC, these are two of China's top five state hold commercial banks, to launch their mobile payment products in China. They're utilizing our organization and cloud-based technologies for that. And while waiting for the new regulations, some banks are beginning to issue single-branded cards with international networks. In 2015 we have launched 32 single-branded programs in China, including one this past quarter with the Bank of Communications for their first single-branded EMV credit card. They also utilize our fraud management products. Now what I mean by single-branded is that we're the only network brand on that card. There is no China union pay on that card. That is what single-branded mean.","Finally, we're also seeing more issuance of commercial card products. In the fourth quarter, we won new business to the Bank of Beijing and with the Agriculture Bank of China for their commercial card portfolios.","And 2015 was a big year for us in the digital space. We're actually pleased with our progress in our MasterPass. We've launched in 13 new markets this year in the fourth quarter. Japan, Sweden, Ireland, Slovakia were the latest markets to go live and that brings the total number of MasterPass markets to 29. In 2015 we launched the total of 64 new MasterPass enabled wallets with some of the more recent additions being Axis Bank in India, Nedbank in South Africa and the first wallet in Japan with UC Card. We're busy expanding acceptance with premier merchants representing the largest volume opportunities in the marketplace. And you've read about Walmart and Sam's Club, Staples, Sears, JetBlue, Barnes & Noble, College, Crate and Barrel, et cetera, et cetera -- all of whom are launching MasterPass in this coming year of 2016.","And in our third quarter earnings call I talked about the launch of the MasterCard Compass for every device program to enable any consumer gadget, any accessory available, whatever, to become a payment device. We also mentioned we were working with fashion designers, with auto makers, with smart band developers. And last quarter we announced our partnership with General Motors to integrate our digital enablement system into their own OnStar platform. And we're actually continuing to build on that momentum because this month, earlier at the consumer electronic, show along with Samsung, we announced Groceries by MasterCard. That's basically a new app that allows consumers to order groceries directly from their new Family Hub refrigerator. ","We've also announced the partnership with Coin, that's the consumer electronics and financial software company. They will help us to bring MasterCard payments to a wide array of fitness bands like those from Atlas Wearables or Moov or smart watches from Omate and other available devices. While none of these is expected to be big on their own, it kind of demonstrates the breadth of the opportunity in digital payments and our engagement to that opportunity as every device over the next two years begins to enable commerce.","Another area of focus for us in 2015 was safety and security. And there have been some big moves in this space, including significant progress in the U.S. EMV migration -- even though the industry was slightly short of its forecast of 50% of issued credit and debit cards being chip-enabled by the end of the year, they're pretty close. As volume from chip-enabled cards continues to grow, we still expect almost all U.S. cards to be upgraded before the end of 2017. And merchants are continuing to enable new terminals and ATMs are being upgraded as well. So this is kind of a work in progress but in the right direction. Looking beyond the U.S., we deployed a number of security solutions from tokenization to Selfie Pay to something called Safety Net.","And Safety Net is our real-time fraud solution. What it does is it detects attacks upon threats globally across all products, all channels -- that's point-of-sale and ATM. And it's a great example of how we're leveraging the unique capability of our global network and analytical capability. It can identify, isolate and stop cyber-attacks often before the bank is even aware of them. And as a result, now more than 80% of our issuers around the world and are using Safety Net as a service from us. That's an example of the kinds of products we're building in our services business which is, as you know, advisors consulting information services with all these safety and security products. And loyalty and rewards are all apart of this services effort that we're putting into place.","So last year as part of our financial inclusion efforts we signed about 600 new government programs, including, I think, some very innovative ones. The example of the Egyptian government comes to mind. We were going to extend financial services to more than 54 million Egyptians by linking their national digital ID, something the government is issuing, to a mobile wallet to receive government benefits, employer payroll as well as a P2P capability across all banks and all telcos, by the way. It's a countrywide effort. And finally we've worked through various regulatory challenges, including being the first network to migrate domestic card transactions to the new Russian NSP card switch [ph] as well as implementing the new European payment regulations.","So that's 2015. Some business wins, something about what we're doing and digital and MasterPass, what we're up to in services and safety and security and the work in financial inclusion and as a backdrop behind the revenue numbers I gave you. But looking forward 2016, we expect this year to similar to what we saw in 2015. It's a complex environment. I consider that currency will remain a challenge over the course of the year. The dollar is going to keep strengthening. But our plan is to stay focused on executing our strategy to displace cash, to play a defining role in digital and innovate for the future. And that means expanding our services businesses as well.","We've got to grow our processing capabilities so we can see more transactions that then enable us to provide greater insights through analytics as well as providing robust safety and security solutions so we can offer better protection for our cardholder, for merchants and for our issuing bank partners. We're going to continue to pursue profitable market share while diversifying our revenues. And at the same time, I think you'll find us continue to work hard to manage our expenses so we can allocate more resources to these growth areas","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks, Ajay and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, despite strong FX headwinds, we closed out the quarter well. Let me give you some highlights on the fourth quarter starting with page 3 where you can see the difference between asset reported and FX adjusted gross rates.","So EPS growth was 14% or 22% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control, executing on our tax strategies and purchasing shares all contributed to that performance. Acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of EPS dilution in the quarter. Included in our other income and expense line was $83 million of impairment charges, predominantly related to some of our very early investments in mobile. A number of these investments have performed well, while others have not met our expectations.","Next, our tax rate of 13.1% in the quarter was more favorable than we expected due to the benefits that resulted from the impact of settlements with tax authorities related to the tax audits that I have mentioned as a possibility at our investor day last September. Share repurchase contributed $0.02 per share to our fourth quarter results. As of January 22, we have $4.2 billion remaining under our current authorization. Lastly, cash from operations was $1 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.7 billion.","So let me turn to page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV, was up 12% on a local currency basis, down 1 PPT from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 9% and 8% respectively. Total U.S. GDV had a continued almost 2 PPT headwind from lower gas prices. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis, down to PPT versus last quarter with mid-teens growth in each region. And on cross-border volume, we grew 12% on a local currency basis, lower than the 16% we saw in the third quarter, primarily driven by the political instability and economic conditions around the world as well as the lapping of some recent wins in Europe and Canada.","Turning to page 5 you can see global process transaction growth was 12%, the same as what we saw in the third quarter. We continued to see double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S. And globally, the number of cards grew 7% with $2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued.","Now let's turn to page 6 for some highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 4% as reported or 9% FX adjusted, given currency headwinds. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was higher than we expected, more than 3 PPT, driven by currency such as the Venezuelan bolivar and the Canadian dollar. After eliminating both currency impacts, our underlying net revenue growth was about 12%. Rebates and incentives were slightly higher than we expected due to the timing of some deal in the works and acquisitions contributed about 2 PTT to net revenue growth, up slightly from the 1 PPT we saw last quarter.","Looking quickly at the individual line items -- revenue line items on an FX adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 10% while worldwide GDV grew 12%. This 2 PPT gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency, somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 13% while cross-border volume grew 12%. Of the 1 PPT gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of intra-Europe activity, some local currency impact and lower inbound U.S. cross-border volume -- essentially offset by pricing. Transaction processing fees grew 13%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in process transaction. Finally, other revenue grew 26%, driven primarily by advisors as well as our an APT and TNS acquisition.","Moving on to page 7 you can see that total operating expenses increased 1% in the quarter or 4% on an FX adjusted basis. This growth was essentially all driven by M&A activities as we focused on integrating the acquisitions we made in 2014 and 2015. So you can see the underlying expense growth was essentially flat from last year. The non-recurrence of a significant severance charge in the last -- in last year's fourth quarter was offset by several factors including additional personnel expense as a result of our investment and strategic growth areas, higher processing costs due to both more transactions across our network as well as the fees paid to NSP card for processing [indiscernible] Russian transactions and lower foreign currency related gains versus the prior year.","Let me turn to slide 8. And here we can discuss what we have seen in January through the 21. Most of our business drivers are a bit higher or similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. But here are the numbers through January 21.","Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 14%, up 2 PPT from the fourth quarter. In the U.S. our processed volume grew 13%, up almost 4 PPT from the fourth quarter, with higher growth in both credit and debit. Gas had a 1 PPT negative impact on our January growth compared to the almost 2 PPT drag in the fourth quarter. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, the same as the fourth quarter with doubled digit growth in each region. Globally processed transaction growth was 13%, up slightly from the 12% we saw in the fourth quarter.","And growth outside the U.S. slowed just a bit, primarily due to the lapping of some business wins as well as a slowdown in Brazil. U.S. growth was up 2 PPT, driven by improvements in both credit and debit. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 12% globally. That's the same that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Now let me start out talking about our long term performance objectives which as you know exclude the translation impact of our euro and Brazilian real functional currencies. On that basis, for the 2013 to 2015 period net revenue growth was 10.5%, close to the low end of the range. Beyond the euro and Brazilian real, we experienced extremely strong foreign exchange headwinds from the other local currency pairs that Ajay has just referenced which resulted in about 2 PPT impact to our compound annual growth rate.","Therefore, the underlying net revenue growth for this period was over 12%. We achieved our margin commitments and delivered a 19.2% compound annual growth for EPS over the period excluding the tax benefits we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015. Again, when I exclude the impact from those local currency pairs, the EPS CAGR was over 20%.","Now let's move on to our 2016 to 2018 objectives which are net revenue CAGR of low double digits, operating margin of at least 50% and an EPS CAGR in the mid-teens. Remember, these objectives are on the constant currency basis and exclude any new M&A activities. Going forward, you should be using a pro forma 2015 EPS figure of $3.12 as the starting point for the three-year EPS CAGR calculation.","The pro forma number is calculated based on a normalized 2015 tax rate of 30.4% which adjusts for several one-time tax benefits. The largest of these is from the significantly favorable outcome of some tax audits that concluded late in 2015. And consistent with the methodology we have used in the past, it also excludes the impact of special items.","As you heard from Ajay, we expect 2016 to be a continuation of 2015. For the U.S. and European economies are showing signs of strength but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, foreign exchange volatility will continue to be with us into 2016. We have navigated through periods like this before and we will continue to run the Company for growth, both on the top and bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. So as we look at full-year 2016, our underlying business fundamentals remain strong.","However, we expect to be at the low end of our were three-year performance objectives due to current FX levels relative to where they were back in September when we first developed these objectives. These objectives already included some level of local FX headwinds, though they are now expected to be higher than what we assumed in September. And I know as you model all your numbers on an as-reported basis, you need to adjust for the impact of our euro and Brazilian real functional translation. And at current rates, that results in a 2 PPT headwind on net revenue growth and a 3 PPT headwind to bottom line growth.","For 2016 let me call out a few additional items that you should also consider. For rebates and incentives we expect to see slightly lower growth this year than the 20% as-reported growth rate that we saw in 2015 which is much different than what we see in some of your current models. On expenses, just a couple of comments you just heard Ajay talk about putting money into our growth areas.","Well for 2015 that was focused on a number of acquisitions. With that integration process well underway, this year we will accelerate our investments in digital, certain geographies such as China as well as in safety and security. Also, in last year's first quarter we had $40 million of FX gains in the G&A line associated with the events in Venezuela that are not expected to recur this year. As a result, you should expect our total operating expense growth to increase in the high single-digit range.","Now having said, that as you all know, we always plan our investments with a certain degree of flexibility depending on the market or macroeconomic environment. We're already prepared with contingency plans to adjust expenses, should the need to course correct the necessary. In the other expense line, interest expense associated with the euro denominated debt that we issued last November at roughly $10 million to our normal underlying run rate of roughly $15 million per quarter. So this is $15 million per quarter. You should assume a roughly similar tax rate for 2016 as the 30% normalized rate I just spoke about four 2015. And finally we realize that it's becoming more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. We're thinking how to make this entire topic more transparent so stay tuned on this.","Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?","Barbara Gasper","Thanks, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question and answer period. And in order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional question. Sean?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache","Martina, I had a question on the 2015 base. There is some confusion since the three-year guidance that you guys gave at the investor day was on a constant-currency basis. But it looks like the 312 that you guys are pointing to an appendix D strips out some significant items but doesn't add back FX headwinds yet. In appendix C you guys include the FX adjustment for the 2012 to 2015 period. Can you just walk us through the thought process behind that please?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes. So first of all when you look at the objective from 2013 to 2015, you have to start with the base of 2012. Right? And the base in 2012 are basically actual numbers adjusted for only one line item, which was the tax line item -- basically our special tax benefits that are not expected to be repeated. So that's the $2.14. When you walk to 2015, what we did there is you have to adjust for foreign exchange for the euro and the BRL because that is -- when we do our performance objective on an FX adjusted basis -- so you put basically back in $0.21 on top of the EPS that we print. Right? So you start with an EPS of $3.35.","You add in the special items of $0.08, which is $3.43. You add back the foreign exchange, which is $0.21. You are adding back the acquisitions and you are adding back these one-time tax items, all of which we called out, which gets you to the $3.62. And when you do the differential between the $2.14 to the $3.62 you are getting actually that 19.2% compounded annual growth rate. So that is the history.","Now let me focus on 2015 and going forward. So for the 2016 to 2018 financial objectives -- 2015 you are not starting with the $3.62 because that is an FX adjusted number. Of course we're going to have to start with the real number -- with an actual number, right? So you start again with a $3.35. That's exactly our as-reported number in the financials. You adjust for that for the special items, which is the $0.08. So you are going to $3.43. And then you are putting in -- and then you are taking out the tax items $0.31 of that.","And that's how you get to $3.12. So you are on actual FX rates for the starting point, you adjusted for the special item and you self-adjusted for the special tax items. That's how you get to the $3.12, which is the basis upon which we calculate our future EPS performance.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Martina, following along your thought process line -- so when we look ahead 2016, what we would do is take that $3.12, grow it by the mid-teens and then account for the 3 percentage point headwind of the local currencies? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, that is what you're going to have to do--","Sanjay Sakhrani","15 at the high end -- it will be 12% growth off the $3.12.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So first of all, Sanjay, you start with the $3.12. You grow it for whatever number you want to grow it at for the next three years. My statement for foreign exchange was only an outlook for 2016. Right? I have not given you an outlook for 2016 to 2018. So when you look at your 2016 numbers, whatever numbers you are going to come up on topline to net revenue, to get to the as-reported you are going to have to take 2 PPT out. When you look at the bottom line, both for net income and EPS, you are going to have to take 3 PPT out in order to get to your as-reported. But that's a 2016 statement, not a three-year statement.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I'm sorry to follow up on that. On the low end of the targeted range of -- for low -- or for mid-teens is?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Look, we have low double-digit growth. That is our three-year guidance. And we are at the low end of the low double-digit.","Ajay Banga","So just to be clear, all we are saying -- bake through all this stuff -- all we are seeing is 2016 is turning out to be a crazier year than we thought in September only because between September and December lots of local currencies moved around. And those normally are inside our revenue number. We're just trying to make you understand that. That's all we are doing. Beyond that, the euro and the real are the euro and real.","They are functional currency's. You guys are more used to that one. In that there's a 2 PPT headwind on revenue and a 3 PPT on net income and EPS. I'll she's trying to do is clarify that for you for 2016. We'll be at the lower end of our numbers. And when you do actual as-reported as compared to FX, just make sure your account for the euro and the real. That is all we're trying to provide you with guidance on. Other than that, we are conducting our business the way we normally conduct it. We're going after business, volume, revenue, diversification, services and the rest of it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matthew Howlett from UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew Howlett","Can you just clarify the trends you said? In January you said everything was trending up over 4Q?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes. So in January 21, just to repeat that, processed volume we actually saw growth of 14%. So that's up 2 PPT from the fourth quarter. In the US actually we grew 13%, up almost 4 PPT from the fourth quarter. And then outside of the US it was pretty much the same as the fourth quarter at 16%. Our processed transaction growth also up slightly at 13%. We saw 12% in the fourth quarter. And then cross-border was pretty much the same. The cross-border growth was right at that 12% that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Matthew Howlett","And then just on the China region, with the wins you are having over there, is that going to take all the offset? We just noticed a weakness in that region. Can you just maybe just go a little bit more in detail in terms of what you're seeing overall versus the wins you are gaining?","Ajay Banga","Yes. So look, I don't think it that China's wins per say on these single-banded cards and the like. They all take time to build as numbers. I do think that China spending is what you are concerned about. And what you will find interestingly is not that Chinese tourists are not traveling. They're traveling to different places. Earlier, instead of going to greater China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, a lot of that, today they're going more Japan, as an example. Japan has actually seen a surge of 115% in tourist arrivals from China compared to the prior year.","So, current direction and location is changing. Domestic spending is certainly impacted in China. I was in China last week and you could see it there. So I don't know that merely winning a few more deals will change the nature of revenue growth trajectory in China over the course of one year. Over the course of a couple years, absolutely. It can help. But I wouldn't assume that China's revenue growth will be exactly as it used to be just given the amount of economic change that is going on in that country.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","It's nice to see the solid expense management when you need to. And I guess we looked at how this quarter -- your expenses did grow by call it mid-single digit on a constant-currency basis, including acquisitions. But excluding deals, you guys had roughly flat expenses in the quarter. I know you mentioned investments in China and digital and security but I also thought you guys were doing that throughout this year. So I guess just some clarity on why that couldn't be roughly low-single digits again or flattish even with the same reinvestments in China and digital. Especially if your acquisitions are coming down, I think, now, right?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Well our acquisitions are actually starting to be really part of our base business and doing very well, I have to say. But what really we have to dial up, and we talked about that quite a bit in September with you, is two areas. One is China. Ajay was already mentioning that we have started to put our investments on the ground. 2016 will be a fairly heavy-duty year for that. And that will require some investment. And the second area is still digital.","As you heard, we already rolled out MasterPass in 29 countries. There's a heck of a lot more that we have to do and we have to gather a lot more banks issuers as well as merchants onto that platform. So those are the very -- the two big areas where we will now focus on.","Ajay Banga","You'll see us honestly investing in that and you'll see us investing in all the services businesses, information services, of consulting, of processing, of safety and security because without processing more transactions -- and I've said this a few times. Look at Europe. We only process 40% of our transactions. Now that is from where we used to be but it's still only 40% because of all the local schemes that exist in every country. And clearly the opportunity for us is to process more transactions so we see more data and we use that data for our services. Our services business depends on that data. It's all about the analytics that get created and the transactions we see.","So that's the kind of investments that we think we should be making in 2016. But, Martina, if you talk to our business people in the Company, you will hear from them that Martina is a relatively painful person because she tracks it by quarter. And then she alluded to her astute expense management that's otherwise called a gatekeeper. She gives it to you every quarter based on what she thinks the trends are for how the Company is going. And so she is able to manage her expense management, both for strategic investment and the underlying core, built to suite the cloth that we are dealing with. That's the idea that we're trying to communicate to you.","Darrin Peller","But there should be a step down in the incremental integration expense related to acquisitions this year--","Ajay Banga","Absolutely. From the current acquisitions -- absolutely correct, now look, we do some others, which is a different thing. But all that we've -- and now in our basin, basically as you said, by the second year they go into our basin. We deal with them as part of our core expenses.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open.","David Togut","With domestic credit and debit interchange caps going into effect in Europe in December 9, can you comment on any impact you have seen on your card issuing banks or any thoughts going forward on whether payment acceptance in Europe could increase as a result?","Ajay Banga","Nothing has changed in six weeks. Europe doesn't work in six weeks cycles. You know a different Europe from what I know. But frankly, I would tell you this. The conversation about the impact on banks, the impact on merchants, the likely on acceptance, that conversation has been going on from the day and the regulations have been complement. There's nothing new to tell you from what we've discussed earlier. Banks are clearly worried about the impact of their revenue stream. ","They are clearly looking at ways to make up that, either through fees or through other methods. Clearly merchants with a lower cost of acceptance should be willing more to accept electronic payments than they used to. As you know, Europe is a relatively underpenetrated market on electronic payments compared to its sophistication as a destination. And so there's a lot of opportunity there as well.","And then there are all these local schemes that are re-looking at their context, given the digital change and the investment that is required to upgrade themselves to digital. That is how we have been winning more domestic processing over the years. All of that is pretty much a trend, even now.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So in fact, David, as we were running up to the December 9 deadline, a lot of work was done by our people, especially by our advisor people in our consulting business, helping banks as well as merchants to be getting ready for that. And that's the opportunity that actually Ajay was referencing -- is that there are real life engagements that we could be doing -- we did do in order to get them ready and make sure that their portfolios are in a shape that they can take it profitably forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Chris Brendler","Just want to focus on your comments around cross-border in Europe. You mentioned a grow-over issue. Can you quantify that at all? Is it relatively small? And any more detail on what those wins were last year? And a separate question, you mentioned the processing share in Europe. It looks like process transactions are growing a little slower than your overall volumes at this point. Is that just a mixed issue? And if it is a mixed issue, what is causing the slower growth in transaction? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes. So first of all, in Europe we won actually some wins some time ago in the Nordics. And they are now lapping. And that's where you see some of the impact in our volume numbers, including the cross-border numbers, including the transaction numbers, by the way. They were terrific wins but they're lapping at some point in time so they are going to our baseline. Other than that, there is really nothing different going on than what we've seen in prior quarters.","Chris Brendler","And those wins, were they airline programs?","Ajay Banga","No. These are banks. Banks of the Nordics -- SEB Bank, Nordea, Danske, all of these in the Nordics.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Just a couple clarifying questions, if you don't mind. Just first on the fourth quarter operating expense, how did that come in versus plan? Did you pare back spending based on something you saw? Or was it more just FX? And then your high-single digit comment for 2016 in OpEx, is that a reported or local currency growth comment?","Martina Hund-Mejean","So, Tien-tsin, for the fourth quarter, fourth quarter was we managed through fourth quarter the way that we actually have expected to manage through fourth quarter. And as Ajay said, I'm a little bit of a stickler with the budget and what people can do. So of course we did everything that we could do in the operating--","Ajay Banga","I'm going to pay for that comment later, Tien-tsin. I'm getting looks from across the table.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, you're getting looks on that one. So on the operating expense line we made sure that we basically fund those investments that we need to do. Now, all of the numbers that I have called out, both for the fourth quarter as well as for the 2016 numbers, they are all on an FX adjusted basis. Right? Tien-tsin, we always call out the euro and the BRL.","And that's why we've been giving you the headwinds numbers in terms of what you should be assuming going forward. So coming back again, when you look at 2016, for the topline it's a 2 PPT headwind because of euro and BRL. For the bottom line it's a 3 PPT headwind for the euro and BRL. So we can basically think that operating expenses has a little bit of an issue from an FX headwind point of view too.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. And just on slide 12 the reconciliation for the three-year CAGR, looking back the 10.5% and the 19.2% revenue EPS -- is that comparable to the prior objectives?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes. So Tien-tsin, this is as I was trying to explain to Bill. This is completely done in the basis that we had put out. Right? So four -- when you look at the revenue line -- the net revenue line, we said it will be adjusted for any acquisitions that we had not announced at that point in time and it will be on an FX neutral basis for the euro and BRL. So when you look at page 12 and you see our net revenue growth of 9.5%, you see two adjustments which gets you to the 10.5%. And then for the bottom line, very similar to how we laid out the 2012 base number of a $2.14 EPS. We calculated the 2015 EPS in exactly the same way with exactly the same principles. That gets you to the $3.62 for a growth rate of 19.2%.","Tien-tsin Huang","So the difference between 19.2% then and the at least 20 that you are targeting can be explained by--","Martina Hund-Mejean","All by local effects. So that is actually a very important point. I am glad you are bringing it up. The 19.2% had more local effects in there than we would have ever thought about when we put the performance objectives together back in 2012. Remember, last year's foreign exchange volatility in the market and the way the dollar appreciated has not been seen in over 15 years. It was an extraordinary year. And by the way, I also sat in my prepared remarks, when you look at the revenue line that 10.5% would have been over 12% if we course-corrected for all of those local FX headwinds.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Don Fandetti","Ajay, your cross-border held up very well relative to Visa over the years. And I think more recently you have been feeling pretty good about it. Can you talk about what's changed and are we seeing trough levels here? I know it's one of your higher-margin products. I just want to get your sense on the outlook.","Ajay Banga","Yes, Don, we've navigated through this 12% kind of number on cross-border growth earlier. This is my sixth year into the place here. And I have seen 12%, I have seen 16% and up and down from that. I -- my view of what's going on in cross-border right now is that the fact is that tourism around the world did get impacted in the fourth quarter of last year. There is no doubt that when the Parisian terrorist attacks happened it impacted France for a while.","There's no doubt that when the Egyptian plane went down, it impacted tourism into that area. And so that's just reality. A lot of these tend to bounce back over time. Paris did come back. Not exactly to the level that it was growing at. Remember, Paris is the world's number one tourist destination, the world's number one.","And some portion of it comes from tourism, some portion of it comes from corporate travel, some portion of it comes from e-commerce. And these different elements have been impacted differently by the way the world is seeing its geopolitical circumstances over the last two or three or four months. That's why I think our numbers are still running even at 12 in the first 21 days of this year. And they are not going higher or lower. It's kind of where we are. We're sitting there. I'm going to watch that very carefully because it does impact my revenues. Sort of every transaction and sort of many other things but cross-border is a particularly interesting part of it. And so we watch it carefully. And that is part of the reason why we believe that in 2016 one of the reasons where we're saying take a look at us being at the lower end of our revenue guidance to you for the three-year period -- is all these factors are inside that thinking of our budget for the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Orenbuch","I was very impressed with the acceleration in January in the US. And it sounded like from the comments that one percentage point of it was in fact from less of a drag on gas prices but another 3 PPT seems to be coming. Is that partners that are doing better? Are there other things we should be aware of, either wins or losses in the US to affect the balance of 2016?","Martina Hund-Mejean","You have a number of factors going in there. Of course gas is -- because of the lapping effect has one impact. But we are also doing better on the pin side. Okay so we have more volume coming through there. Secondly, we have a number of clients who actually picked up their volume. And so we are seeing some of that. And lastly, we also are getting in the more fully lapping period from the loss of Chase.","Ajay Banga","Remember we had loss of Chase. We've had our wins. That complex intermix is coming into play. And then some of our -- it's our mix of clients as well. We have had a couple of years of some of the clients -- we've had the larger ones -- were struggling on their own growth. If you like the scores, you look at the numbers that are publicly released, those folks are doing better over the last few months. That helps us. So it's a mix of all of that. So that's a good thing.","Moshe Orenbuch","Correct. Absolutely. And how does USAA factor in?","Ajay Banga","Not yet because they are still on our books. But the migration will happen over time. Credit will migrate and then debit will migrate over the last 12 to 18 months at a certain pace and process. And that will certainly go away from some of our numbers. But you know what? You get wins and losses. I would not rotate on any one win or one loss otherwise you will drive yourself crazy.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Jeff Kay [ph] on for Eric. [Indiscernible] technology is increasingly on the reader in the payment space, particularly with cross-border. I think we are at the stage of the hype cycle where the reality no longer matches some of the more aggressive assumptions as far as what the technology is really capable of. So I was wondering if you could just help frame the public conversation, specifically with respect to what you're seeing in terms of internal opportunities and also if you could share your views on its perception as an external threat. Thanks very much.","Ajay Banga","I want to make sure I understood your question. You're trying to have a dialogue with us about how we think about digital as an opportunity as a disruptor, as a transformation in the commerce place of the plane. Is that what you are looking for -- broad conversation around that?","Unidentified Analyst","Correct. A, how you would potentially use the technology. And B, what your opinion is of it as an external threat.","Ajay Banga","You're talking about Blockchain specifically? Are you talking about digital transaction as a whole? Are you just talking about -- I just want to make sure I give you a substantive answer.","Unidentified Analyst","With respect to digital please. Thanks.","Ajay Banga","Digital over all. Okay. So first of all, my belief is that this thing is going through its cycle. Four or five years ago, the conversation was that the mobile payment operators would be able to create their own payment systems because they had both consumers and email, voicemail, phone connectivity with millions and billions of consumers. Why would they need anybody else to provide? As you saw over time, we have now got 50 of those [indiscernible] around the world signed up as our partners.","And some of them, in fact, we have entered the JVs with that have done well, others have not done so well. That is actually one of the write-downs that Martina was referring to. Over time, they're going to invest in different directions. Some of them will do well, some of them will not. And a couple of those haven't done as well as we would like to.","My general sense is the mobile network operated payment system for person to merchant has yet to prove itself in scale in any marketplace at all. From person to person payments there is a little more going on. Okay, so I just -- I think that's a bit of a challenge on where those are going. I think on non-mobile network operator, that is to say hardware-based Samsung and Apple, Google -- there's some interesting new developments we are seeing with contact-less payments and in-app payments.","I don't know yet that browser-based payments will go where with that bunch of digital giants. But remember, browser is the largest portion of digital payments today. And frankly, out three to four years it will still be overwhelmingly the large percentage of digital payments. So that's another one to be card through.","I do think that the biggest conversation that's going on in digital is the safety and security of those transactions. And a lot of our effort and energy has definitely gone into organization, not just for MasterPass for our banks and merchants but even for -- not just new transactions but even for cards on file. Because frankly, with EMV in the US, where do you think fraud will migrate to? It's going to migrate to online. And that's what happened to every country around the world.","So our focus here is not just in solving Band-Aids with EMV, it's on making the whole payment system more secure over time. That's why tokenization is key. And a large amount of our investment and those of our competitor is going into that space. That's why we agreed on industry standard for tokenization so we shouldn't create fiction between banks and merchants on which standard to work with.","So you're going to see a lot of energy and effort in that space. And I think the other piece that will come into play in digital will be the intelligence that will drive the capability of banks and merchants to drive better transaction, better relationships with their consumers. And that's why the effort on services and analytics. So you kind of -- that's why I think about digital. I think of it as a big opportunity. When 85% of the world's transactions are still in cash, there is a lot of space out here.","And it's the same view I have about existing competitors in the payment system. Rather than say domestic debit scheme in a country or it's the larger competitors or it's a China union or anybody else, my view is there is a lot of space here. You've got a get off the 85%. We can all growth in there and still have a pretty good run rate for this industry for some years to come.","Martina Hund-Mejean","And within that, what Ajay was saying, obviously, we are exploring any new technologies, be it the Blockchain, be it biometrics, be it what's happening in the mobile space. And we obviously work with many partners around the globe in order to make sure that we can deliver the products and services that consumers and merchants are demanding that the banks want to deliver and so new technology is nothing new to us. We're going to have to be on the forefront of that every day of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Jamie Friedman","I wanted to ask about the commercial corporate market. One of your competitors, one in New York not in California had called out weakness in the corporate market. I wasn't sure if their loss was your gain or something more structural.","Ajay Banga","You're trying to triangulate stuff. Okay. So I don't know what somebody else was saying. I'm not going to comment on that. That's their business and they're a very good competitor. So let them do what they are doing. My general opinion across the world on the commercial market for corporate clients is that it's still healthy and something that there is opportunity for us to grow on.","And remember that even through this last cycle of economic difficulties in 2007, 2008 and 2009, the commercial corporate market is in a growth market. That's because business people are still traveling. And there is a lot of space there in travel. There is space on B2B cards. There's space on purchasing cards. There's space on B2B flows and large cards. All of those are what's inside our commercial business","Martina Hund-Mejean","So just from a number point of view to give you some context. For all of 2015, the commercial market actually grew at low double digits -- actually not a bad growth of all. It did come down a little bit but still double digits in the fourth quarter. So it is growing very healthy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is open.","Bob Napoli","Just a quick on the rebates line and with a little clarification, if you could, Martina, on the percentage of revenue -- maybe you were talking about on confusion on some models. But my real question is on just the services business. The -- which I think you had said at your conference is 25% of revenue -- has much lower margin. I was just wondering what your outlook is for the growth of that services business over your three-year time horizon and any thoughts on the margins in that business as well.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Okay so first of all from a rebates and incentive point of view, I didn't give a percentage of growth. What I did is I gave you a view on what the growth would be 2016 over 2015. In 2015 we saw a growth rate in rebates and incentives around 20%. I said for 2016 it will be just a little lower than that 20%. Okay? So that's the growth rate and it's the 20% that you saw in 2015. By the way that's and actual reported number.","So for the services business, yes, I tried to give you a few points back in September at the investor day saying that our core business is substantially 75% of the Company and the services business is about 25% of the Company. All of those growth expirations that we have in services -- and you can actually see in the revenue line where we have most of the services in there -- it grows very, very fast. All of those expectations are actually embedded in our overall net revenue guidance.","So I am not splitting for you apart in terms of what our core business versus the service business does. The other thing that we said in September, and I have no different expectations at this point in time, is that the services business, while its lower in margin than what we have today than what we have in our core business, that we do believe that over time there will be some margin improvement in the services business.","Ajay Banga","It's all the question of scale. Right? That's one of the reason that it's a lower margin. Although that's not the only reason. It's also the nature of the business. In some parts of it is more people intensive. In some parts of it it's more technology. Where it's more tech intensive, it's more like our core business. Where it's more people intensive, it's a lower margin business. And therefore, as you build up a volume and scale on top of those businesses, you get better revenue and better margins out of them. That's what we are doing. In fact our advisor consulting business in the six years that I have been in the Company, I have seen Martina work it with the team there on improving the margin of that business through better utilization of people, lower downtime of consultants, creating centers of excellence, essentially the steps that have been taken to improve that business. So that is the kind of thing that is underlying our commentary on lower today on margin. But we have every expectation of continuing to improve that margin over time.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Chris Donat","I'm going to ask one that's a little bit off the beaten track here. But with the change in sanctions rules and laws for Iran and your experience you have had over the last few years in Burma or Myanmar, can you comment on how long you think it might take to get to a business in Iran and with Iranian banks and if there is any meaningful revenue opportunity in the next 5, 10 years?","Ajay Banga","Next 5, 10 years, Chris? Yes. Next one year? No. So let me give you an example from Myanmar. Myanmar was handled -- once the government of the United States opened up its relationship with Myanmar, the removal of sanctions in Myanmar happened pretty quickly after that. And companies like us and our competitors were able to go in and begin to first enable ATM networks and then enable acceptance and then enable issuance in the country. With all that, because Myanmar has a relatively underdeveloped payment system, that entire thing is relatively slow.","Now Iran, on the other hand, has the payment system domestically, merchants to accept electronic payments already. It's not Myanmar in the form of being a completely cash economy. So if you could plug and pay, you could probably get quicker results than in Myanmar but the United States government is still to lift its sanctions. You just saw that the Iranian president came out and signed a fairly large set deals on planes from AirBus -- hasn't even signed anything at Boeing. That is all part of what is going on.","There has to be a whole change in the sanctions regime that allows companies like us and our competitors and banks to operate freely in Iran. That has yet to be seen. So I would say Iran more interesting because of a literate population with a relatively functioning electronic payment system. But until the sanctions actually get lifted, this is all very nice but we can't do very much.","Ajay Banga","Okay. Questions done. Closing comments. So thank you all for those closing questions. Let me give you a couple of closing thoughts. You saw it come through in what Martina and I were saying. We think we've navigated a tough economic environment this year, particularly the foreign exchange. And honestly, the local currency tangent to your question -- that came at us even faster in the last two, three months of the year.","We met you in September, talked something about local currency. By the time December came around, it was a different picture. December is self was a different picture from November and October. That's how rapid the local currency movement, vis-a-vis the dollar has been. But you know what? We've navigated that and delivered strong results through a variety of prospective financially, volume, share growth, bill, innovation. 2016 look similar to 2015. So we're going to stay very focused on executing our strategy.","We're going to try and play a defining role in the digital opportunity. We're going to keep trying to innovate for the future, grow revenues from both our core and our services businesses and work really hard to manage our expenses so we create the space for us to invest in our future. The payment space I think remains a great place to be. Our business continues to have strong momentum. We're going to keep perusing profitable market share. We're going to keep trying to drive the conversion of cash to electronic payments around the world. I continue to believe that run rate is an enormous runway of growth.","We intend to maintain our leadership in the industry effort in digital payments, in safety and security, in financial inclusion. And I am quite confident we can run the Company for growth and will try to deliver on our three-year objectives. I just appreciate your ongoing support for the Company and for all of us. And thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14043":["Mastercard Inc.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Christine, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us for a discussion about our third quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer.","Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question. Even if you think you have already dialed into the queue, you will need to register again following our prepared comments.","This morning\u2019s earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. We\u2019ve added a new table in the slide appendix to the deck that breaks out the impact of acquisitions as an easy reference for those of you who track that detail. These documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week through November 6.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Ajay.","Ajay Banga","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning everybody. We had a good third quarter. We saw a net revenue growth of 13% along with net income and EPS growth rates of 15% and 19% respectively. So we delivered another quarter of strong results and we\u2019ve continued the momentum you\u2019ve seen from us over the course of this year, as we are navigating through I think what everybody would agree is a mixed global economic environment. ","So let\u2019s take a look at the underlying global economic trends for the quarter and let\u2019s start with the US and there the recovery continues. Our SpendingPulse data showed sustained growth over the course of 2014. US retail sales ex automobiles in the third quarter were up 4.2% and that was a higher number than the second quarter growth of 3.8%. ","However the monthly growth trend showed some deceleration with several sectors lodging, furniture furnishings, grocery experiencing some noticeable slowdowns in September. So these are mixed trends in the US but overall the underlying indications [have been] positive. In October, the consumer confidence index is up over September as well. Excluding the impact of the Chase de-conversion in both the second and third quarters, our core US GDP growth rate was roughly the same. ","Europe\u2019s recovery slowed in the third quarter. Annual PCE growth projections have been revised down from 3.5% to 3.1% and our SpendingPulse data for the UK also showed third quarter retail sales ex auto growth slowed to 2.9%, down from the 4.8% growth that we saw in the second quarter. ","Consumer confidence economic sentiment also down slightly but unemployment levels continued to show improvement across the region. MasterCard\u2019s total European volume growth for the third quarter was in the low teens and process transaction growth in the high-teens, about the same as the last quarter. And the region\u2019s growth was driven by a number of countries, including Russia, Turkey and Sweden. ","In Latin America, our third quarter SpendingPulse data for Brazil showed retail sales growth of 2.5%, down from 4.1% in the second quarter. Across the region, annual GDP growth expectations were also revised down from 2.3 to 1.3. The primary exception in this whole thing is Mexico where they continued to benefit from improving exports to the US and our business in the region remains solid. Third quarter GDP and process transaction growth is in the mid-teens, again about the same as last quarter. ","In Asia Pacific, there is a decline in business sentiment in the third quarter, mostly because of everybody\u2019s being concerned about the economic slowdown in China but consumer confidence held steady. And our business in the region continues to do well, GDP growth in the mid-teens, process transaction growth in the mid-20s in the third quarter, down slightly from last quarter. ","So in summary, the economic environment is mixed. The US is in relatively decent shape. We\u2019ve got some challenges in Europe and Brazil that we will keep our eye on but we are not seeing anything to cause us immediate concern and you will hear that from Martina when she updates you on our October trend volumes.","So before we go to our business highlights, a couple of legal and regulatory matters. First of all, nothing to report new on the European legislation. The council of ministers continues their discussions regarding the proposed legislation. We remain actively engaged with all parties. We still believe that the proposed legislation is most likely to be adopted sometime in the first half of 2015. ","Now Russia. As you know, there are some new amendments to their national payments law. These have just recently been signed into law. What those amendments do is principally two things. And the first is the deadline for compliance has now been extended further to March 31, 2015. And the second is related to local processing. As you know, the original law required us to find a local processing partner for domestic transactions. And we\u2019d begun to do that through an RFP process. ","The new amendments clarify that the local processing partner will now be the central bank\u2019s new domestic switch. So we clearly need to work out all the operational details to connect to this new switch but nothing else has really changed in terms of being able to issue MasterCard branded cards for use in the Russian market, or for that matter, the potential financial impact of this new law for us. If you recall in the last quarter earnings call, we had given some idea of the dimensions of that financial impact and our best estimate continues to be something less than $50 million on an annualized basis. ","You\u2019ve probably also seen some recent news stories about the Chinese government announcing that it will allow qualified domestic and foreign companies to apply for domestic bank card switching in China. This is the first of many steps, we will get to know what it will take to become a qualifying institution, nor do we know what the broader regulatory framework will look like. And of course, there is no -- right now, no indication of timing. So while we are awaiting all these details, the fact is we are pleased with the announcement. We see it as a good step in the right direction. ","So with that, we\u2019ll move on to some of our recent business activity. You\u2019ve kind of heard from us during the recent investor days in September and you\u2019ve had an opportunity to see first-hand a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling out. So rather than go back over the deals and the innovations, I am only going to pick a few items that we may not have talked about in those inventor days. ","A year ago on this call, we talked about tokenization, the development that everybody was focused on in the area of payment safety and security. We talked about how we were working with the broader group that included technology companies and merchants and trying to create better consumer and merchant experiences while ensuring safer and more secure transactions.","And for the recent launch of Apple Pay will only help with the convergence of the physical and digital worlds and we are actually pleased to be working in partnership with Apple, and they are using our digital technology and our security protocol to enable MasterCard credit and debit cardholders to use Apple Pay. It is the simplicity of Apple Pay that makes it attractive, the ability to make a payment with as little as your fingerprint. ","We\u2019ve worked closer with Apple over the last two years and helped them deliver a user-friendly safe payment experience. We\u2019ve provided the most secure combination of payment technology [indiscernible] more issuers continue to sign up. I think the most current number is something like 500 and is growing. ","Now of course, Apply Pay has gotten a lot of attention. However there are many other elements of mobile payments and we are working with all of them. And our strategy has been to work with all players to ensure that we have the capabilities to meet the needs of different market models and make choices available to consumers. So our most consumers have a phone, a number of them have PC, a tablet, a game system, a connected appliance and increasingly connected cars. So our innovations using MasterPass are all designed to work across all of those devices. ","As many of you saw last month at our investor days, you saw a number of those devices actually in operation. So remember that tokenization used by all of these digital payment options is based on an industry open standard that the networks have developed together. As a result, others will be able to leverage this technology to enable secure digital transactions across any device, think of it like EMV, an open industry standard that allowed all issuers to issue cards with chips that conform to that open industry standard. That\u2019s what this tokenization is all about.","Now all these new mobile payment options are putting more focus on contactless. And we continue to drive contactless technology which is a key component of our cash displacement efforts. Momentum is building globally. All terminals are being replaced with new ones that are contactless enabled while being installed. ","Australia is leading in the adoption of contactless payments. More than half of all face-to-face transactions under $107 are now contactless. We are also seeing progress in countries such as Canada, in Turkey, in Poland and just recently in the UK we worked with Transport for London to expand contactless payments to the underground, enabling commuters to use their credit, debit and prepaid cards across London\u2019s entire transit system. ","In the first two weeks alone, over 1 million contactless journeys were taken. And this adds to the list of transit agencies around the world whom we are collaborating with, we\u2019re trying [ph] to use our thought leadership in the transit space to migrate their riders from cash to electronic payments. ","So Apple Pay and Transport for London are just a couple of recent examples of how we are creating better shopping experiences for our cardholders using contactless technology. As you know, we just opened our new technology hub in New York City earlier this month. And we\u2019re just continuing to invest in innovation designed to make payments easier and safer. ","There are a couple of examples that demonstrate how we\u2019re creating a better cross-border shopping experience. In this quarter, we announced a partnership with Transforex. This is a company that is working with 7 leading tax groups in China to launch the largest tax refund platform in China. Chinese travelers leave as much as \u20ac3 billion worth of tax refunds unclaimed. The idea of this new platform will make the tax refund process much easier for the Chinese travelers by enabling them to receive their refund back to their MasterCard and do it all from the comfort of their own home when they return from that trip. ","In South Africa, our prepaid program manager, Access Prepaid Worldwide is working with the VAT Refund Administrator of the South African revenue service to migrate their single currency refund card to a four-currency MasterCard prepaid program allowing tourists to reclaim their VAT as they leave the country. So that\u2019s just two examples in that tax refund space.","Finally, our work with governments continues to grow. We\u2019ve talked about this a few times in the context of developing markets and financial inclusion. But we are actually doing a lot work with governments in the developed markets as well. So for example, the UK government has awarded the Royal Bank of Scotland the contract for their e-purchasing card. Over the next two years, all 17 central government departments, the Ministry of Defense and some regional governments will migrate their existing government purchasing cards to MasterCard\u2019s purchase and pay solution, it kind of combines our multi-card smart data and inControl technologies. ","And of course, we are continuing to add programs focused on financial inclusion in the developing markets, and I will give you a couple of examples. In Mexico, BANSEFI is converting their entire $6.5 million social benefits card portfolio to MasterCard debit and that\u2019s going to be enabled with the EMV chip technology. And in Africa, EcoCash which is a mobile money provider in Zimbabwe launched the MasterCard Companion debit card that\u2019s linked to their mobile money wallet, a first in Africa by the way. The card will be issued to more than 3 million EcoCash customers making it the largest rollout of EMV cards in Zimbabwe to date. ","So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks, Ajay and good morning everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck where you see the as-reported as well as the FX-adjusted growth rates. All of my comments pertain to the FX-adjusted figures, which are essentially the same as our as-reported numbers.","We\u2019re very pleased to deliver strong performance again this quarter. Net revenue growth was 13%. This combined with operating expense growth of 12% and a lower tax rate resulted in a 15% increase in net income. ","EPS growth was 19% and share repurchases contributed $0.04 per share. During the third quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $400 million, which reflects a slower pace of buybacks we expected. Through October 23 we purchased an additional 1.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $120 million and we now have $310 million remaining under the current authorization. We continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis. ","Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investment of about $6.3 billion. ","So let me turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 12% on a local currency basis, down slightly from last quarter. Overall our US GDV grew 7% which was down from last quarter. On the credit side, volume growth was 7%, down from last quarter, primarily due to the Chase de-conversion. Similar to last quarter, our US debit growth was 8%. ","Outside of the US, volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis and continues to be driven by APMEA. Cross-border volume grew 15% on a local currency basis and that\u2019s just slightly lower than the 16% we saw in the second quarter. ","Growth in Europe APMEA was in the mid to high teens. Key contributors to this growth included the UK, Germany, Italy and Sweden. The deceleration of cross-border volume growth in markets like Canada, China and Russia continued into the third quarter. ","Turning to Page 5, you would see, process transactions grew 10% globally to almost $11 billion. We continued to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth was down from the 12% we saw in the second quarter primarily due to the US and Latin America. Now globally the number of cards grew 8% with 2.1 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards. ","Let\u2019s turn to Page 6 for some highlights on a few of our revenue line items. Overall net revenue growth was 13%. In total acquisitions contributed 3 PPT to our net revenue growth. Domestic assessments grew 7% while worldwide GDV grew 12%. This 5 PPT gap is primarily due to the lower than average revenue yields in many markets outside of the US, due to market structure, domestic payment schemes or a higher proportion of cash volume. This is similar to what we've seen in prior quarters. ","Cross-border volume fees grew 13% while cross-border volume grew 15%. The gap between revenue and volume growth continues to be due for the most part to the higher mix of intra-European activity. But the gap is narrower this quarter versus what we saw in the recent quarters due to better mix with an increase in the proportion of Europeans traveling outside of Europe versus within Europe.","Transaction processing fees grew 13% primarily driven by the 10% growth in process transactions and other revenues grew 38% driven largely by contribution from our Pinpoint acquisition as well as our Advisors business. ","Moving onto page 7, you can see that total operating expenses was up12% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Of this growth, 9 PPT was due to expenses related to the acquisitions along with our majority-owned HomeSend investment and were primarily in the G&A line. ","Now when looking just at the 14% growth in G&A, our acquisitions contributed 11 PPT to the total growth, and the balance was driven mainly by the organic investments we're making in strategic initiatives. And finally, 19 million increase in D&A versus the same period last year continues to be the result of our growing level of capital expenditures, principally due to the additional investments in technology to support our strategic initiatives but also includes the impact of the amortization of intangible assets related to our recent acquisitions. ","Turning to Slide 8, let\u2019s discuss what we\u2019ve seen in October through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are up compared to the third quarter. All of these have been factored into our full-year outlook. The numbers through October 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw a global growth of 11%, up 1 percentage point from the third quarter. ","In the US, our processed volume grew 7%, that\u2019s very similar to what we saw last quarter. Processed volume outside the US grew 16%, about 2 PPT higher than the third quarter, primarily due to improvements that we see in Europe and in Latin America. Part of this is attributable to one of our deal wins in the Nordics as well as overall volume increases in both regions. ","Globally processed transaction growth was 11%, 1 PPT higher than what we saw in the third quarter, also driven by improvements in Europe and in Latin America. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 17% globally, about 2 PPT higher than the third quarter, driven by improvements in Europe. And we saw a strong growth across most major markets, including contributions from online travel programs. ","Looking forward, let's start with our long-term performance objectives for the 2013 through 2015 period which remain unchanged. We continue to believe that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR and at least 20% EPS CAGR. We are also committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude new M&A activities. ","Moving on, let me offer some commentary about full-year 2014 which is mostly unchanged from my comments last month at our investor day. Our expectation for full year net revenue growth before any contribution from acquisition is now slightly better than the low end of our three-year range we previously thought, due to our better-than-expected third-quarter revenue performance primarily due to higher underlying volume and transactions. ","Additionally, while the pace of the Chase card attrition year to date has been essentially in line with our internal projections, the volume shift has been a bit slower than we initially anticipated. Therefore we now estimate less than half of the volume to roll-out this year with the remainder in 2015. We continue to expect about 1 PPP contribution to our 2014 as reported net revenue growth from our M&A transactions. ","Overall we haven't changed our view about total operating expense growth for full year 2014 from what we said last month at investor day. We expect the as reported growth rate for full year 2014 to be in the low teens after considering the impact from M&A activities, and this does include high teens growth in G&A and D&A growth in the 25% range, again totally in keeping with what we discussed previously. ","Our view of potential EPS dilution from the 5 M&A deals that we also previously discussed continues to be about $0.05 annually for each of 2014 and 2015. ","You should now assume a full-year tax rate of slightly below 32%. The change in outlook is primarily due to our third quarter tax rate coming in lower than we expected due to some discrete benefits that only became known as we finalized the quarter. And as I have said before, although the exact timing is uncertain, there may be some potential to lower our tax rate further as we continue to work on several initiatives geared at better aligning our tax structure with our non-US business footprint. ","Finally with respect to FX in 2014, if the rates of our functional currencies remain similar to where they are today, so that\u2019s the Euro trading at the 1.27 level and the Brazilian real at the 2.44 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and the real would be a slight headwind for the full year. Further beyond the functional currency impact of the euro and the real we have already seen a 1 PPT headwind to net revenue growth year to date from other currencies depreciating against the US dollar and the euro. ","As I have said before, we carefully manage those exposures but we have also assumed some impact for the rest of this year which will likely continue into 2015. ","So now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. ","Barbara Gasper","Thank you Martina. We\u2019re now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. And in order to get to as many people as possible we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Christine?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. ","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","It looks like your revenues per dollar volume reached an all-time high this quarter. Can you remind us how you think about this metric and how sustainable it is at these levels? And then separately, I was hoping that there has been some evidence of competition becoming more intense in the co-brand spaces, some contracts have come up for renewal. I was hoping that you could just comment on what you're seeing there? Thank you.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So I am going to take the first question, Bill. Look, how we look at revenues is -- not every revenue is driven equally. We have domestic assessment fees which are predominantly driven by the volume and the volume growth that we have all around the world. And there you have to make some significant differentiation between how much is driven domestically versus how much is driven cross-border. So the mix is very important on that. ","Secondly, in a number of countries, we\u2019re actually processing most of the volume and that is when we get an additional transaction processing fee but there are a number of countries where we are not processing the volume, so that is also driving the mix in terms of how much we are processing in a country and where you see the growth on that versus where we are not processing and where you\u2019re using the growth in that, that is very much an impact. Further on this quarter's numbers, you did also see an impact on the \u2013 from the recent acquisitions that we did and you see that in the other revenue line item which increased by 38% and that is mostly driven by the terrific acquisition that we did down in Australia, the company is called Pinpoint and it\u2019s a play in the loyalty space. ","Ajay Banga","Bill, it\u2019s Ajay. About the co-brand space, actually the co-brand space has been pretty competitive for quite a while. I have talked about it a number of times in the earnings calls about how we\u2019re going about trying to be players wherein we [ph] win there regularly. And we have been winning a number of deals there. In fact, I didn\u2019t mention it this time because over the investor day period and then we\u2019ve talked about this a little while but for example, we won RAI [ph] over the course of this quarter \u2013 it\u2019s every quarter that deals would come and go in the US and overseas. And that\u2019s a competitive space, as I think new in that space. I think the one development that\u2019s interesting in that space has happened over time is that more and more the merchant driven co-brands tend to be driven with an issuer and the network is being separately approached during the course of the co-brand process. Years ago, it used to be that they were done together. That\u2019s kind of a trend that's pretty much changed \u2013 pretty clearly in the US, not so much overseas. So it\u2019s a competitive space and it\u2019s a space that you have to be very careful about both in terms of pricing but also in terms of the value-added features that you can bring to the party when you try and go win that co-brand. And you will kind of win some, you won\u2019t win all of them, so nothing new on that space.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Smitti [ph] of Morgan Stanley. ","Unidentified Analyst","Maybe just a follow up on the other revenue line items. Can you just help us maybe rank order the various pieces of the business that are in there, I mean loyalty advisors, data analytics, repaid and then from maybe largest to smallest and also just wanted to get some additional perspective on how meaningful data analytics is to the revenue contribution today and given the progress that you\u2019ve highlighted at the analyst day on this front?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Look, Smitti, the other revenue line item is driven by a lot of different things. Certainly some of the items that you have been calling out i.e. our loyalty business and it\u2019s not just the Pinpoint business, that have actually very thriving big loyalty business across-the-board in a number of our regions. It\u2019s one of the big drivers in there. Our advisors business which actually consists of three different pieces, quite a few of the revenues that are related to those pieces both in the consulting side as well as in the data side is actually related to that. And then we have a number of other businesses, little bit on the program management that we are doing out of Access Prepaid et cetera that are driving that line item and I'm very pleased to say actually that all of those businesses are growing very nicely. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair","Just on the Apple Pay, I was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of color on what you\u2019ve seen from your customers and uploading and then how do you balance working with Apple Pay and with your MasterPass product and with other wallets \u2013 are there conflicts in there that you have and -- so that would be helpful, a little more color on that. ","Ajay Banga","Bob, it\u2019s Ajay. The people signing up for Apple Pay is actually pretty good. I would say the first few weeks have been very encouraging. You see us in \u2013 if you\u2019d been to the Giants game and Kansas City Royals game in the San Francisco stadium, which unfortunately I didn't go to see even though I was hanging around in San Francisco, but I met a number of people who have been there. We were using and demonstrating the work of Apple Pay for purchasing in the stadium, we had advertising, we had activities and promotions going on in there. So there are a lot going on in the Apple Pay space right now. I don\u2019t know that I would sort of agree that it conflicts with the stuff that we're doing in anywhere else in mobile. I think you have to think of mobile and digital as a very wide space. One of those spaces \u2013 I have been looking at many different aspects to it. One aspect to it is are you going to put your credentials on the phone like in Apple, but are you going to do it through postcard emulation which is what many others will do, or are you going to do it through NFC like Apple, or is it in app like Apple or is it browser based like others. There are so many elements through mobile and digital commerce, I wouldn\u2019t call it conflicts, I\u2019d rather think that there is a lot of opportunity and lot of open space. ","The objective of MasterPass \u2013 MasterPass is not just a wallet by the way \u2013 please don\u2019t think of it like somebody else\u2019s wallet, it\u2019s not. MasterPass is a broad set of technologies, it\u2019s got wallet, yes, which is both wallet branded as MasterPass but also a wallet servers for our issuers and merchants. We do value-added services with MasterPass, loyalty programs will be in there. In the future there will be new additive ideas in that but I would label cost [ph] could be in there, in-store checkout is coming in there, online is already there with MasterPass. So it\u2019s got a bunch of things in it, and those full elements of the MasterPass strategy is what we are rolling out around the world. We are now in 11 countries, the US plus 10 others, Australia, Canada, China, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, UK, others. We are adding Taiwan soon. So we are in a number of countries with MasterPass, we are working with different banks of different sizes in these countries ranging from Commonwealth bank and WestBank [ph] in Australia and New Zealand to BMO in Canada, with Citibank and Credit Union in the US to Standard Bank in South Africa. So it\u2019s got all that going on, there is 40,000 plus merchant signed up, I got to see this as being a series of parallel activities which are all aimed at providing choices to consumers. And once you do that, then they are going to walk with their wallets on their feet on where they go and we want to be able to be the provider of that space. We are not in the consumer business directly. We are a B2B2C company and therefore we are trying to be that in every piece of what we do. ","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies ","Thanks guys. Just to start, can you just clarify what the cross-border volume growth ex Western Europe would have been and then can you separately clarify your stance on when you might implement tokenization pricing? We know that you\u2019ve got the rate card out there but your biggest competitor has obviously said they are waiving those fees through 2015, so just wondering if the same is true for MasterCard?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, on the latter question, it\u2019s exactly the same. And on the first question, from a cross-border ex Europe, typically we don\u2019t give these numbers but it's not too different, if you\u2019re actually excluding Europe for the MasterCard volume side. ","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies ","So you are waiving your pricing through 2015 as well?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes.","Ajay Banga","Yes, that\u2019s actually out in the market. We said we\u2019d only put it in there starting at the end of 2015. We put out our card and said, we will do it early 2016. So that\u2019s not new position [ph].","Operator","Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. ","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital","Just on the cross-border growth rate, I think you mentioned, Martina, earlier that the spread narrowed a bit more because of the mix, in terms of intra-Europe versus people traveling from Europe to elsewhere, so that\u2019s good to see. I guess just if you could touch on were there still any lingering additional pricing changes in that line and then maybe if you could just comment on the potential for merchant assessment change on the horizon as well?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yeah, so first of all, on the pricing side, there is no impact from pricing in that line item. And in fact when you look at our entire revenue growth there is really no material impact at all on pricing as most of you know our main pricing actions that we took some time ago have been pretty much all lapping with the second quarter of 2014. So you are just not seeing that in this quarter at this point in time. ","And in terms of future pricing actions, look, first of all, we are not going after pricing in order to make our top line, so when you actually look at the 2013 to 2015 long-term performance objectives we have relatively small aligned pricing embedded in that. And if there were to be any changes, we will be talking about it when they were to be evident in our financials but we don't really see anything at this point in time. ","Ajay Banga","You\u2019ve just got to remember we\u2019ve got thousands of lines of pricing in the system and there is some pricing we are going on in every country while we speak. So pricing is a part of the way we approach the entire marketplace. But I wouldn\u2019t tell you that there is some strategic plan to put in some new price starting on a particular date next year kind of stuff. That\u2019s not currently in our outlook.","Operator","Our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Hi, just want to ask on the Chase card transition. Are we a quarter of the way through that, or just trying to get a sense of that through the third quarter \u201914? And then secondly on FX, Martina, maybe you could just help us to make sure we\u2019ve got it right. Are we looking at 2 to 3 points or in the fourth quarter for FX headwind and then if rates held today, I just want to start to set our models for next year, is it about the similar 2 to 3 point FX headwind for next year as well?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Your first question was \u2013","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Just on Chase migration, just want to make sure where we are so far?","Martina Hund-Mejean","On the Chase migration, so what we said actually for when you look at all of 2014 we probably have less than half of the Chase volume rolling off. So you would still have some impact for 2015 and the way that it has been rolling off as we said before we didn\u2019t see much in the first and second quarter, we saw more in the third quarter. And I think you should see more in the fourth quarter. This is all subject to our own estimation. We don't really have a schedule from the customer but this is the best that we can at least get our hands around it based on what we see today.","From an FX point of view, for the fourth quarter, we are going to see a little bit of an impact on two things, one from a functional currency point of view. You're going to see about a 2 to 3 PPT impact on all line items and then from a local currency point to view, so those are the currency rates, other than the euro and the real. So those are all the foreign exchange payers that are excluded on that versus the US dollar and versus the euro, we think we\u2019re going to probably see another one PPT impact for the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s very similar to what we saw in the first, second and third quarter. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","And then into 2015 if rates stay the same?","Martina Hund-Mejean","You should expect some headwind of course given the strength of the US dollar versus many currencies in the world.","Operator","Our next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen & Co.","Moshe Katri \u2013 Cowen & Co","You said quite an impressive success in gaining share in Europe, was in Europe during the past year or two. Is there any way to kind of talk about this in the context of how MasterCard has been competing against Visa Europe and have they been losing market share to MasterCard? Any color on that will be helpful.","Ajay Banga","[We\u2019ve been going on] for a few years. I think if you look at the whatever public information that is available for Visa Europe you will find and there is some available, you will find that they themselves talk about losing share to us in the course of the last couple of years there. How we are competing is \u2013 it\u2019s not just the Visa Europe, we are competing around the world with a series of different things but obviously everybody starts with the conversation around what\u2019s the financial impact for anyone at the other end of the deal. But we\u2019ve tried to talk about all the things we do with advisors, all the things we do with data, all the things that we can do with loyalty, and rewards and that\u2019s \u2013 processing, if you look at our strategic plan, we used to add all those value-added services, so we can be a better service to the issuing community. And Europe is reflective of that very approach and if you look at the acquisitions we are doing, we\u2019ve had success in acquiring stuff in Europe as well both in the prepaid programs space as well as in the space of loyalty and rewards. That\u2019s what we are up to. So it\u2019s pretty much the same around the world.","Operator","Our next question is from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Understanding that it\u2019s very early days with respect to China and there are still a lot of details to understand. Can you maybe share with us your approach to the overall Chinese market and how that might differ from other geographies specifically the existence of UnionPay and new entrants likely Alipay in that market and how you might plan to attack the market generally speaking from a top level perspective?","Ajay Banga","So over the last couple of years, what we have done there three or four years is that before this whole announcement we were allowed to do \u2013 was to do no domestic processing but we were clearly the cobranded card is what you could be with China UnionPay so that when Chinese traveled overseas they could use their cards. Over the last few years all the new co-brand cards that were being announced, I think we were the winner and the overwhelming majority of them, I am talking 90 plus percent of those deals over the last two years. And that helped us a great deal in terms of changing our market share on the ground on cards issued in China, where the flow of new cards issued was all coming our way when they were co-brand.","In the meanwhile China UnionPay both operates in China and also have begun to strike over the last many years bilateral deals for acceptance outside of China. The impact of those depends on the marketplace, whether it\u2019s Hong Kong they\u2019re obviously stronger there, if it's the United States way weaker. And so in addition to the fact that we had to compete on the ground in China you have to be thoughtful about what is going on with these bilateral acceptance deals. And we went and stuck partnerships with China UnionPay to help them where they are expanding some acceptance in return for expanding our acceptance in China. So when someone like you went there, your MasterCard as I hope you carry issued here was being used in China in as many places as possible. That\u2019s kind of the way we were working, kind of like a partner but with a clear acknowledgment that they were in a position that gave them a monopoly benefit inside of China and yet were an interesting partner to play with. That\u2019s the way we were approaching China. ","Meanwhile we were also dealing with the Alibabas and Alipays and the TenCents of the world and in fact, we signed work with the Alibaba and Alipay where we were helping them think about cross border acceptance for their websites and helping them tackle fraud and counterfeit goods on their websites and so on. ","Now when that changes, with this announcement, it doesn\u2019t change yet. The announcement just indicates the direction is there but remember this announcement is innovated now for quite a few months ever since the WTO ruling had its deadline set up. So what\u2019s really going to matter is how they propose the regulations, what\u2019s called a qualifying company, would we need to be constructed differently in China to be eligible to be a qualifying company, or would we be allowed to participate there with the domestic processing capability? I don\u2019t know the answers to all that yet but in general we\u2019ve already made a number of steps that I will not competitively disclose that allow me to be relatively confident that when they make the right moves we will be able to respond. That\u2019s kind of where we are.","You had a question there about \u2013 how does that differ from other markets \u2013 well, there isn\u2019t a lot of other examples where a domestically mandated monopolistic switch exists, that\u2019s not been our experience. You could have banks coming together to create domestic debit schemes like Europe used to have in many countries which have been [ph] on the payment systems directive, have actually opened that up and that\u2019s one of the ways they are growing in Europe, we are seeing more and more domestic transactions in the developed European countries as well. But \u2013 and then there are similar domestically handled \u2013 domestic debit switches in Australia and Canada, so dealing with domestic debit switches and domestic debit systems is something we\u2019ve had experience on for 30 years. It\u2019s just that China was uniquely different because not only did you have a domestic switch for debit, it is for every card being processed there issued domestically was controlled in terms of who could handle that transaction on the ground.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel. ","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","I wanted to ask about the Asia-Pacific market for a second. Looks like the growth rate there has slowed down a little bit, now midteens on an FX adjusted basis, as well as it\u2019s been basically since the crisis. Is that mostly the Russian impact? I know there is also some macro weakness in that area. But fundamentally do you expect the Asia-Pacific market to return to just the historical stronger growth rates over the medium-term, or is it -- that markets are restructuring getting more further along on the secular shift to electronic payments, not much secular growth available, that will be helpful, thanks. ","Ajay Banga","I think secular growth in Asia is still very much available. The level of cash utilization in the Asian market is the highest probably around the world other than a few Latin American markets. I mean China and India are still in the 95 to 99 plus percentage of transactions being in cash, and that even Japan which is a developed country in that part of the world has a 75% to 80% cash percentage in its transaction in the country. So I'd be very careful to think that secular growth in Asia is beginning to slow. I think the real issue in Asia \u2013 by the way when you start \u2013 when you grow at 15%, 20%, you\u2019re not growing at 21 of 22%, big deal. And just you should take that in this context. ","And it\u2019s still growing very rapidly and ASEAN is probably growing faster than mainland China just because mainland China is genuinely facing a change not just in its GDP growth rate but in the manner of spending on the ground in China with all the different efforts of the leadership of the Chinese government is putting into place on what\u2019s going on in the ground. So that\u2019s kind of two or three things going on there in China. India itself had slowed down over the last few years. It\u2019s actually with the new government beginning to pick up again. So there is movement in economic growth indicators around there. There isn't much impact from Russia into Asia, that's not what I would lay as the main cause of what we are discussing, it\u2019s both the macro growth factors of China and then at the low level of India, ASEAN continuing to doing well, Australia slowed a little bit over time as the commodity boom has slowed. You know Japan is going through its own stresses and changes. But don\u2019t conclude \u2013 at least I wouldn\u2019t yet, that the secular growth rate of cash converting to electronic in Asia is yesterday story. I think that\u2019s the moral story yet to come.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Just on that topic, since you mentioned it. I mean India with its plans to leverage national payment scheme like RuPay and it\u2019s not clear at this point how big of a role you guys can play. How should we be thinking about the opportunity in India? I guess my question was more about -- markets like Hong Kong and Australia that are very highly card penetrated, you're not thinking about India as a huge opportunity for MasterCard but maybe that\u2019s not the right way of thinking about it, is India still a very much a greenfield for MasterCard?","Ajay Banga","Yes.","Martina Hund-Mejean","And we have some significant growth there and it\u2019s growing actually by quarter.","Ajay Banga","It is. Absolutely it is a significant opportunity. I mean RuPay is not a government mandated local monopoly unlike China UnionPay. RuPay is an effort by the government to create a national payment switch that operates in parallel and competitive about us and Visa and others. And clearly when you have a government switch they get certain benefit. Guess what I was saying, we've used to dealing with the domestic switches in a number of countries, that\u2019s kind of been true for Europe for the last so many years, it\u2019s true for Mexico, it\u2019s true for Canada, it used to be the case in a number of Latin countries, it\u2019s around the world. We do that -- we can compete on a level playing field because technology is superior, fraud capability, data analytics, the ability to do things with local banks, we can do that. So I still consider India to be an enormous growth opportunity. Just as by the way I consider China to be an enormous growth opportunity. And by the way I consider Australia to be an enormous growth opportunity given the relative the penetration of cards, because even now the percentage of retail transactions in Australia that are cash versus electronic are still in the majority. That\u2019s why contactless in Australia has been doing so well for the past two years. A large number of the retail transactions that were cash in Australia was small ticket and Australia contactless first started doing well in small tickets and now it\u2019s moved up. That\u2019s why understanding all the way up to Australian 100 dollars, more than half of those transactions in just two years have migrated to contactless, that\u2019s almost all of it is fighting what used to be cash. ","So it\u2019s pretty interesting what\u2019s going on in that part of the world. As it is the other parts of the world.","Chris Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","I\u2019ve risked of rules violation here but you mentioned it \u2013 one more question on that topic. Australia, is there still a surcharging headwind there or has that abated somewhat, so thinking about these small ticket transactions, I have seen that 30, potentially 40% of retailers potentially surcharge in Australia, is that \u2013 ","Ajay Banga","No, no, that\u2019s not true. You get surcharging in a great deal from online transactions where people don\u2019t have much choice. And that\u2019s always been an issue but in the real world out there, yes, surcharging is but it\u2019s a small number, it changes over the period of quarters and I don\u2019t consider that to be an issue. This is what I would like to see because I believe that consumers should be able to pay with whatever way they like to pay without having to face surcharges, and then by the way the Australian central bank has come back and put in restrictions on the level of surcharge for that very reason. So there is a lot of stuff going on in the marketplace down there, and guess what, that\u2019s our life, it happens in different countries, I still consider Australia to be a growth partner. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Maurer of Autonomous Research.","Craig Maurer - Autonomous Research","Two questions, considering the slower de-conversion at Chase, when you now expect co-brand winds could start to offset that de-converion and additionally we saw the growth in Maestro cards continue to fall and drop to flat, should we expect to see that turn negative in the coming quarters?","Martina Hund-Mejean","On the first one, Craig, we had always had our wins in the co-brand space, will be offsetting the Chase de-conversion over time. So that we are not talking quarters, we are talking over a couple of years. And you will see that coming in from a volume point of view, already seeing some of the co-brand wins actually coming in and you will see that more coming in next year. In terms of the growth of the Maestro cards, look, the Maestro business is very good and very live and what we are doing around the globe is that from time to time we are giving \u2013 we are working with our clients in terms of whether the Maestro product is appropriate or whether they would like to go with MasterCard debit card and you will see a number of switches in terms of where portfolios are going simply because of the kind of product construct and services that our customers are demanding. So that\u2019s really what you are seeing going on, it is more switching from a Maestro to a MasterCard debit card portfolio.","Ajay Banga","Craig, I would like to just make sure that the Chase de-conversion issue doesn\u2019t overtake what everybody is thinking. So just try to think through for a second. The co-brand cards have a certain vintage built-up, all cards have that behaviour. The Chase cards were already vintage. When they go up, they go up for the certain volume spend pattern. New cards take some time to build up to that pattern. You will see in the number of cards being issued that the US is continuing to do well and frankly despite losing the Chase de-conversion of the consumer business that you are seeing, you are seeing that our GDV is still doing okay, that\u2019s because we are growing with the other cards as well as in the commercial space. So our portfolio is a healthy mix of many clients across many types of cards and what we are trying to do as we win and lose clients is still stay focused on growing the overall business in a tangible way. That\u2019s what you are seeing. We\u2019ve got 13% revenue growth this quarter, we had good revenue growth for the past few quarters through this so called Chase de-conversion. In the meanwhile by the way Chase has been a really good partner on a number of other cards they are doing with us, co-brands as well as large corporate. So life goes on from there and there are other wins that keep coming and going and that\u2019s the context in which you should see our business portfolio.","As I know you understand because we\u2019ve travelled together a couple of times and we\u2019ve talked about this. But I just want to make sure everybody on the call gets that picture. ","Operator","Our next question is from Lisa Ellis of Sanford Bernstein.","Lisa Ellis - Sanford Bernstein","I had a question \u2013 one quick follow up question on China UnionPay, I am wondering if you are seeing them at all in issuer negotiations outside of China, they have been making some noise on directly verified by us, that they are starting to get some traction signing contracts outside of China, let\u2019s start with that.","Ajay Banga","So first of all, glad to hear a woman\u2019s voice on the phone asking me a question. Honestly I haven\u2019t seen what you are seeing. I have heard noise about it in Russia for sure when the whole situation with the sanctions happened. Clearly there was noise on the ground of issuers looking into possibility and I can understand that at that time although that didn\u2019t go very far, in the meanwhile the law changed and has amended and adapted. So I think it depends where that goes. So I don\u2019t know.","And in my general perspective, bigger perspective on this is that given that 85% of the world\u2019s retail transactions are still in cash, I am a little less fuss about every new effort being put into payments being a direct competitor as against being a part of the whole ecosystem that must fight cash have been talking about this for five years, cash is the real opportunity for a company like ours. And that\u2019s what we are focused on. It doesn\u2019t mean I am not competitive, trust me, I am very competitive on share and you would see that growing share quarter by quarter in markets around the world. But I don\u2019t really view each entry or exit as a direct competitive issue. I view that as something you\u2019re going to be careful of, but you\u2019ve got to also realize that few players that are aiming at cash is probably a good thing.","Lisa Ellis - Sanford Bernstein","And then just quick follow up, in the emerging market programs you are doing like I think the one you mentioned in Nigeria where you\u2019re partnering on sort of these mobile prepaid or other types of migrating on bank to bank via some sort of digital prepaid model. Can you give us some color on the economics to MasterCard of those types of programs? ","Martina Hund-Mejean","So Lisa, it\u2019s Martina, let me start with that. First of all, typically in all of these agreements our normal pricing applies. So if we do [inaudible] if you just do, and see the volume from an assessment fee point of view, the price gets \u2013 there are no really changes on that. But you\u2019re going to have -- when you think about it, when we start those kind of undertakings, so for instance in South Africa where we are much further along, we have 10 million cards out there for the social program, and people typically utilize those cards in such a way that they go to the ATM and pull out cash and then they pay at the merchant. That is typically a lower yielding transaction for us and then over time as we\u2019re actually establishing the acceptance base in those merchants where they could be using the card and we are having programs in place, so people rather going to the ATM go directly to the merchant and [save up for the band] \u2013 they are not carrying cash around, et cetera et cetera, then we are starting to go into the higher yielding transactions. ","So you have to look at this as an evolution, we first develop the infrastructure, it\u2019s first being used in a lower yielding way, you see that coming through our numbers and in a number of ways. And then as we are migrating people to be using the cards at POS, you\u2019re going to see higher yielding transactions coming through, and that is pretty much the experience that we have had so far on all of these programs. ","Ajay Banga","The only other thing I would add is beyond all digital, by the way, you\u2019re talking digital programs \u2013 South Africa and Nigeria are cards with a chip on them in both biometric enabled, and South Africa is even voice enabled to be recognized at the back-office. But in Nigeria it\u2019s the biometric card with a chip enabled card, and the other side is the payment card. It is mobile based in some markets but it\u2019s also card based so the world food program example in Syrian refugees, and Lebanon, Jordan is also a card. It just depends on what's going on in that marketplace and its ecosystem. Building a mobile ecosystem for delivery of product to people at the disadvantage level, when you start a remittance, which is what the [impasse] type of thing is, that\u2019s not easy because if that mobile system isn\u2019t accepted at a shop, it\u2019s not a lot of use to the consumer. ","So I\u2019d be careful to assume that it\u2019s all about mobile, I think it\u2019s about different ways of reaching these consumers and getting them into electronic payment system and then the revenue dynamics as Martina said low in the beginning because of higher cash use, you will see it in our numbers and in terms of the cash transactions and lower yield on those. And then hopefully over time the people will migrate towards being more in the system and using their cards at the point of sale, at which point of time you would see a bigger impact in our revenues. ","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse ","Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered. But I was hoping you could kind of give us a little more detail around the acquisition activity and how that shakes out. I mean Martina, you had said that at least one of them was already contributing to revenue and that there still would be this EPS dilution, can you talk about the revenue path and the earnings path as you go forward?","Martina Hund-Mejean","We are making acquisitions for a number of reasons. Some of the reasons like the Pinpoint acquisition as well as Provus, the processing entity that we bought in Turkey, it\u2019s really because the building and expanding our business and they will be contributing over time to our topline. What you should be expecting from them in terms of how the loyalty space is growing, that\u2019s how Pinpoint will be growling, what we are doing in the processing space in order to take Provus which are connecting to our processing in Turika [ph] and Poland together, you should be expecting them to grow based on how the processing space and the expansion grows. However we also made a couple of acquisitions which have basically built our skillset. Such as a company called [Sesame] where we acquired a terrific workforce, engineers, mostly based in India who really have a significant skillset in the digital and in the mobile space. That did not come with a lot of revenues but it came with a capability that we are now using for a number of engagements in the digital and in the mobile space. So clearly you will see more expenses coming through on that and that when you put everything together as we are in the early stages of integration you are seeing that $0.05 dilution in 2014 which we are expecting to be the same number in 2015.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse ","But some of that would have been money you would have spent anyway, wouldn\u2019t it?","Ajay Banga","Exactly.","Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse ","So you are kind of penalizing yourself a little bit?","Ajay Banga","That\u2019s a good way to penalize, Martina and I love doing that. And I will buy you a beer for that though.","So guys, thank you all for your questions and Lisa, thank you for yours. And I will leave you with a closing thoughts.","Yes, the global economic environment remains mixed but I think we are demonstrating that we can navigate through this pretty well and to this last question, you will see us continue to invest in our business, on products, on services, on technologies that are key to our strategy, not just organically but also through acquisitions. I really appreciate your continued support of the company. Thank you for being on the call today.","Operator","Thank you and thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is John, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Barbara Gasper, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Thank you, John. Good morning and thank you all for joining us for a discussion about our second quarter 2015 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question. Even if you think you have already dialed into the queue, you will need to register again following our prepared comments.","This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, MasterCard.com. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. These documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one month.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Ajay.","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. Our business continues to perform well with good volume and good transaction growth as well as the signing of a number of new deals. And as you all know, that's despite the mixed economic environment we're all navigating through. After we adjust for currency headwinds, our net revenue grew 7%, which is exactly in line with our expectations.","And, as you know, executing on our strategy over the last few years has included our acquiring a number of businesses, and in fact, that accelerated over the past year or so. And they are having a slight drag in our bottom line until we get them fully integrated. As we do this, we are very closely monitoring our organic expense growth to help fund these integrations, and that close care has delivered EPS growth of 15%. That of course excludes the impacts of currency translation and a special item related to litigation that we will touch on later during the call.","I'm going to just briefly touch on global economics this quarter. And overall, the environments in the U.S. and Europe have continued to improve, as key economic indicators remained healthy. But the U.S. consumer is still not spending all of their gas savings. Latin America and Asia-Pacific remain challenged, most notably in Brazil and in China, and our business continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar. But our fundamentals remain strong, with double-digit volume and transaction growth in spite of these economic situations.","So before we go to our business highlights, let me quickly update you in China. Two weeks ago, the Chinese regulator issued a draft version of the guidelines for review and for comment. They're going to need further clarity on some of the details there that are connected to domestic switching operations, and I'm assuming that will probably happen when the final regulations are issued likely later this year. In the meanwhile, what we are doing is working on all fronts, issuing, acquiring, and on-soil processing so we can try and take advantage of this opportunity as we get further clarity. Based on everything we know today, we continue to believe what we told you earlier; that we would be technically ready to process domestic Chinese transactions by the end of 2016.","So let's move on to some of our recent business activity. And during the quarter, we signed a number of new agreements and renewals around the world, and I'm going to pick three of four examples. So in the UK, we signed a new agreement with Virgin Money to convert their debit card portfolio to contactless-enabled debit MasterCards. And that deal now gives us 100% of Virgin Money's existing proprietary debit and credit book.","In the U.S., we continue to grow our debit businesses by signing now, for example, a new agreement with TD Bank to convert their PIN debit card portfolio to preferred MasterCard routing. In the U.S. as well, we have several co-brand credit renewals, Ann Taylor, Barnes & Noble, Brooks Brothers, [Fred] Meijer, and Spirit Airlines.","And so moving beyond all these specific customer agreements, I'm going to talk about a couple of topics. And the first one is we are significantly investing in cybersecurity-related technology to offer much greater protection to our cardholders, to merchants, to issuing banks. And there is no silver bullet to completely eliminate fraud. But if you apply a sensible multi-layered approach that has some coordination across the industry, we are all convinced we can help to significantly reduce that risk. And protecting card credentials through EMV, through SecureCode, and now through tokenization are only a few examples of our efforts in this area.","We've actually recently announced the expansion of our tokenization services to private label card issuers, and we're the first data network to do so for BJ's Wholesale Club. Kohl's and JCPenney will be among the first retailers use these services later this year. We also partnered with Synchrony Financial and Citi Retail Services, and these are two of the largest private label issuers in the U.S., to enable the use of their private label cards in participating mobile payment and digital wallet services.","Another area of focus in this space is safety as well as using biometrics to further protect the consumer's identity. And you've all seen news stories on pilots we are doing where consumers use an app on their smartphone to verify their identity for online transactions by taking a selfie. For those of you attending our Investor Day in September, you can take 100 selfies each and see this technology in person.","Another example is SafetyNet. As many of you saw demonstrated at last year's Investor Day, we are actually working closely with many providers, including people like CrowdStrike and FireEye to share broader cyber threat information. But the thing is with SafetyNet, it's not just about sharing the information. We don't just detect threats, but we act upon them in real time by providing an independent layer of security on behalf of our issuers globally. In 2014, for example, SafetyNet detected and stopped several confirmed fraud events, including two where forensics determined that the issuer exposure could have been roughly $80 million. So SafetyNet's unique solution is now being deployed globally across all products, all channels. And over the past two years since launch, more than 80% of our issuers are now using this service. Remember, not just to share the information, but to act upon that in real time.","Another topic of interest is how acquisitions fit into our overall strategy. So as a reminder, our M&A focus areas include loyalty, data analytics, processing, and safety and security. Now because these areas are all of strategic importance to us, our belief is that any transaction we do there has to stand on its own in terms of contribution, but it's also, most importantly, got to provide ways for us to cross-sell their capabilities in a bundled way with existing MasterCard products and services, what we talk about as the multiplier effect. So today I'm going to talk a little bit about what these acquisitions are doing, some of them at least, in combination with the rest of MasterCard.","First of all, anything we acquired before 2014 such as DataCash and Access Prepaid is now already embedded in our base numbers. These acquisitions have been extremely helpful in expanding our business and revenue growth, and as I mentioned, just how both on their own but also as combined with our existing products. And let me give you one example from each of DataCash and Access.","By combining our acquisition of DataCash with our previously existing gateway services in Asia-Pacific and then our recent acquisition of TNS [Transaction Network Services], we have built one of the few global e-commerce gateway solutions available. And that combined solution is enabling us to get closer to acquirers, closer to merchants, more recently deploy our innovations with them, and protect their digital transactions with what I think are extremely robust fraud and risk management solutions. So for example, we now have over 120 relationships with acquirers around the world, and we are providing integrated product offerings directed at merchants such as an omni-channel solution for H&M in the UK.","DataCash is also enabling us to more easily deploy innovations like MasterPass. We've added MasterPass to the Boots drug store chain website in the UK. We just quickly connected over 2,000 merchants in just a few days for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, all these enabled through DataCash. Another example H.I.S.; that's Japan's leading travel company, is using DataCash's fraud management solution to enable safe online sales in Malaysia and in Indonesia.","Access, in 2013 Access Prepaid helped Qantas upgrade its frequent flyer program to include the Qantas Cash multicurrency prepaid card. And just recently, that Qantas Cash surpassed A$1 billion in sales. It's added almost 10 million transactions processed by MasterCard since launch. And that, by the way, is just one of many currency prepaid cards in a number of verticals that have launched around the world using the program management capabilities of Access Prepaid combined with our prepaid product capacity and our selling skills in the regions.","So let's get to talk about acquisitions we've done over the past 18 months. And those, by the way, are the ones we include when we call out acquisitions in our numbers. Remember, we only exclude acquisitions from our base for up to two calendar years. And that means that by the end of this year, of the acquisitions made recently, only Applied Predictive Technologies, APT, will continue to be excluded in 2016.","So a few examples of how some of these newer acquisitions are supporting our strategy. In February 2014, we added substantial software engineering capacity and capabilities in the digital and mobile payments area with the acquisition of C-SAM. That's allowing us to accelerate the development and the expansion of MasterPass and other mobile payment solutions. And just this morning we've announced the launch of MasterPass in India, bringing the total number of live markets to 24. And on the merchant side, we've added Alitalia, South African Airways, Carnival Cruise Lines, WestJet in Canada, and a host of others.","In May 2014, the acquisition of ElectraCard Services, ECS, expanded our development capabilities and that enabled us to provide lower-cost authorization and clearing services as well as a suite of platforms that enable local issuer processing or local acquirer processing services. As one example, ECS's technology was what we used to open our processing center in Dubai last year. So C-SAM in combination with ECS now provides the backbone of our technology hub in India. With our large team of talented technologists, we have a wealth of creative ideas. That tech hub is playing a very important role in creating and supporting innovative digital payment technologies that we're now using around the world.","On the loyalty front, we acquired Pinpoint last year. That's the premier loyalty provider in Australia. We're now expanding that across Asia-Pacific. Pinpoint enables us to offer value-added solutions to issuers, to merchants and to consumers. And an example is the recent agreement with Cuscal in Australia, who will not only be converting their consumer credit business to MasterCard, but while doing so are adding Pinpoint's loyalty solutions.","Another example, this one in the merchant space, is that we recently won a deal with Dick Smith Electronics in Australia. And this deal combines the Pinpoint redemption network for their gift cards. We add MasterPass to their website, we provide Advisors analytics to support their business. And yet another example of using loyalty to address merchant needs and then including additional MasterCard services to help them in other ways.","And finally, our most recent acquisition is APT, Applied Predictive Technologies. That's the leading cloud-based analytics company in the information services area. Their Test & Learn platform combined with our anonymized transaction data and Advisors analytics capabilities is what enables us to advance our ability to deliver differentiated products to issuers as well as to merchants and to expand our reach beyond our traditional client base.","And in fact, just a few weeks after the acquisition, APT's access to our expanded client base has already resulted in a number of wins, and I'm going to call out two of them. The first is with BancoPosta in Italy, where APT's platform will be used to test the promotional effectiveness of their loyalty scheme. The second one is with a leading Canadian retailer to help them address some of their key business challenges.","So why am I saying all this to you about acquisitions? Because we recognize that for each acquisition, there's a certain amount of effort, a certain amount of investment. But we are clearly seeing the benefits that come from them in our engagements with clients, particularly when you look at adding their capacity to the services and capability that MasterCard already provides.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for going into our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin on page three of our slide deck, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. And these figures also exclude the impact of a special item taken this quarter related to a settlement we made with Tesco, the largest merchant involved in the UK merchant litigation case.","So you can see EPS growth was 6% or 15% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control and executing on our tax strategies and current share repurchase program all contributed to that performance.","I'd like to point out a few items here and then I'll talk about the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. First, as expected, acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of dilution. Second, the tax rate was favorable at 25.8% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on better aligning our tax structure with our business footprint. Third, share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our second quarter results. As of July 22, we have $2 billion remaining under our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $821 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $5.1 billion.","So let me turn to page four, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis, up from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 7%, made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was up 1 ppt versus last quarter, primarily due to our consumer credit programs and partially offset by the continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 16% on a local currency basis, up from last quarter and primarily driven by Europe.","Cross-border volume grew 17% on a local currency basis, lower than the 19% we saw in the first quarter, down slightly in all regions except the U.S. Of particular note, growth in Europe remained strong, in the low 20%s, with the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Sweden as key contributors.","Turning to page five, you can see here processed transactions grew 13% globally to 12 billion. We continued to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 12% we saw in the first quarter, primarily due to the U.S. and Europe. And globally the number of cards grew 8%, with 2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.","Now let's turn to page six for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 1% as reported or 7% FX-adjusted given currency headwinds and in line with our overall expectations. Looking at the components of net revenue, gross revenue increased 12% FX-adjusted, but we saw 28% growth in rebates and incentives, primarily due to the expected higher upfront incentive amortization from recently renewed contacts that we told you about. And additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was a 2 ppt headwind. Acquisitions contributed a little bit more than 2 ppts to net revenue growth.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. First of all, domestic assessments grew 9% while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 4 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 9% while cross-border volume grew 17%. Of the 8 ppt gap, the majority is due to higher mix of intra-Europe activity as well as some local currency impact. Transaction processing fees grew 12%, primarily driven by the 13% growth in processed transactions. Finally, other revenues grew 29%. While primarily driven this quarter by our PinPoint acquisition, our advisor business and our safety and security products and services continued to contribute to the growth of other revenue.","Moving on to page seven, here you can see total operating expenses after excluding the special item increased 9% in the quarter or 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. Of this, M&A activities contributed 10 ppts to total FX-adjusted expense growth, which is in line with what we have been expecting. The remaining 4 ppts was due to organic growth. We've modified the line at the bottom of our standard presentation chart to make it easier for you to compare the growth rates including and excluding M&A activities. As a reminder, the only acquisitions that we call out here are the ones that we did in 2014 and 2015.","Most of our expense growth is in G&A. while the savings from our restructuring efforts essentially offset much of our reinvestment activities, the remaining growth was primarily due to the continued increase in our transaction processing activities, driving higher data processing expenses. Data processing is also the line item in G&A where we are beginning to see the impact of paying the new local Russian processor, or NSPK, for processing domestic transactions. You can also see that most of our D&A expense growth is related to acquisitions, in particular the amortization of intangibles.","Turning to slide eight, let's discuss what we have seen in July through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are showing a higher growth rate compared to what we saw in the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, up from the 11% in the second quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 7%, up two PPT from what we saw last quarter, even after a continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. And we saw an increase in both our credit and debit programs.","Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 20%, also up about 2 ppts from the second quarter, with higher growth in every region. Globally, processed transaction growth was 14%, up 1 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S., which grew in the high single digits.","And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 19% globally, up 2 ppts from our second quarter growth. All regions were up in July except for the U.S., which was essentially flat. However, we did see a continued uptick in volume from the U.S. to Europe that began during the second quarter.","Looking ahead, here is some commentary about full-year 2015. Let me start by summarizing our thoughts about FX. And remember, the currency impacts us in two ways. So first of all, we have the impact of our functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, relative to the U.S. dollar, and this is what we refer to as FX-adjusted. While the real has continued to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar since our last earnings call commentary, the euro decline has somewhat stabilized. Second, we have the impact of local currency rates relative to their functional currencies, and the impact of this is already included in our FX-adjusted guidance. Our view for both of these factors hasn't changed since our last earnings call despite movements in several individual FX rates.","So let me summarize. For the functional currency translation impact, the first FX factor I just mentioned, we continue to expect the net impact of the euro and the real would be a 6 ppts to 8 ppts headwind to our as-reported results for the full year depending on what line item we are talking about, so revenue, net income, or EPS. And this assumes the euro continues trading at the $1.10 level and the Brazilian real at the BRL 3.35 level for the rest of the year. And for the local to functional currency impact, so this is the second FX factor that I mentioned, we continue to expect a net headwind in the 2 ppt range throughout the year both to revenue and the bottom line based on current rates.","Now let's move on to some of the individual P&L line items. And as you can see from our volume and transaction metrics, our underlying business remains strong, and little has changed in our 2015 outlook versus what we said back in April. On an FX-adjusted basis, we continue to expect high single-digit net revenue growth for 2015, including roughly two PPT from acquisitions. And on an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rate will still likely be in the low single-digit range as a result of roughly 6 ppt FX headwind, primarily from the euro functional translation, and that's based on current rates.","Moving to rebates and incentives, we continue to expect the full-year 2015 growth rate to be similar to the growth rate that we saw in Q1. The higher growth rate that we saw in Q2 will continue into Q3 before coming down in Q4, and that's due to the expected timing of some deals.","We're looking at total operating expense. We are now contemplating what investments we will need to make in China as the domestic market opens. While these will occur over the next couple of years, we will start investing in the next few months, and we have not previously factored that into our thinking around 2015 operating expense. So we are now projecting the growth rate for total operating expense for full year 2015 to be in the high-single digits on an FX-adjusted basis, up just slightly from our earlier view.","Our full year continues to include a roughly 7 ppt impact from acquisitions and as-reported growth will now likely to be mid-single digit range after continuing to expect a roughly 4 ppt tailwind from the euro and the real translation. We continue to project total EPS dilution will be about $0.11 to $0.13 for the full year 2015 from our recent acquisitions, including APT which closed back in May. And less than half of the expected dilution is due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. You should now assume a full-year 2015 tax rate of about 27% due to the continued benefits we have seen so far this year.","So to summarize, solid fundamentals continue to drive our underlying business in 2015 despite the mixed economic environment. Our expectations for headwinds from FX have not changed from what we said back in April, and we are still winning new business and managing our overall expenses prudently.","Finally, let me move on to our long-term performance objectives. First, I know many of you continue to ask when we will be rolling our performance objectives forward. We will provide you with our new long-term objectives at our Investor Day in September.","So for the 2013 to 2015 period, our performance objectives remain unchanged from what I have said on our last earnings call. Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we expect to deliver at the low end of our 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the three-year period due to the continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. And we remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude the M&A activity that we just talked about as well as any new ones that might occur this year.","Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. And in order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.","Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the revenue, I guess. So year-to-date running 7% to 8%. I think you said 7% was right in line with your forecast. So I know a lot of moving pieces, but just curious, maybe you can remind us what's weighing on the revenue growth year-to-date from your longer-term objectives in the double-digits. I'm just trying to parse out what the headwinds are that should ease longer term. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","So, Tien-Tsin, good morning. There really are a couple of factors in that when you look at the FX-adjusted revenue, which is the 7% for the second quarter, and by the way the factors were the same in the first quarter. Two I want to call out.","One is the incentives that we are now running through our P&L, which is really related to a couple of very large agreements that we had announced earlier. And the amortization that is running through our P&L is no different than we assumed. And, of course, this is the first year where you would be running that in, so you're not going to have a lapping effect in that respect for the next year.","The second factor that is still with us in some fashion is the deconversion from the Chase portfolio. So that is also going to end at the end of this year.","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Tien-Tsin, remember that inside that 7% is the other 2 ppts of local currency impact of the currencies that are not what we call functional, meaning everything outside the euro and the real. Now, who knows where that will go longer term, but that's also something that we hadn't seen in the year or two earlier.","So we've got these three things going on. We've got the front-ended loading of the incentives of some of these large deals. We've got the whole aspect of this 2 ppts of foreign exchange translation outside the euro and the real that are running through. The Chase portfolio is almost gone, but it runs through as a lapping effect to work until the end of this year. And that's three things we're dealing with. That's why you see the underlying gross volume is where you would think it would be, though the rebates and incentives combined with the 2 ppts in FX tend to pull things backwards. That's what's going on.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. I was wondering, Ajay, if you could comment on the Visa \u2013 potential acquisition of Visa Europe and what that would mean, what that could mean for your European business. The revenue yield at Visa Europe is very low-high single digits. I'm just wondering if you could maybe give some thoughts on how your revenue yields compare and what you think having Visa Europe as a for-profit company would mean.","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","There are a lot of implications of what happens if and when Visa actually completes that activity. And if they do, there are implications on pricing and yield. So the question you're getting at and there are implications of how long it will take for them to put the companies together. We've done the Europay acquisition quite some years ago and integrating that into MasterCard did pose some amount of challenges in terms of the cultures of the two companies.","You've also got the technology to be brought together. Remember that simple things like V.me and Visa Checkout are two different things and that goes into their credit and debit technologies and there's going to be a lot of stuff to be done.","But let's get past all that and assume all that gets done over a period of time. Back to your yield question, MasterCard Europe's yield is higher than the Visa Europe yield, but it is lower than our MasterCard Global yield. Now, there are two or three caveats I'd like to put into your mind around that before you conclude that means our yields will go up if Visa were to be in Europe a more rational pricing competitor.","The first caveat is yields in Europe generally tend to be lower. Why is that? That's because it's a heavier mix of debit, other than maybe in the UK and Spain, but most of continental Europe is heavier weighted to debit. We also process, both us and Visa, fewer transactions as a percentage because of all the competition from the old legacy domestic processors, particularly in debit, across the European countries. Now, you know there are breakthroughs happening in that space to increase the ratio of transactions we're processing. Today, we are processing just a little under 40%. Now, that's higher than we used to, but it's still only 40%. So when you process less and there's more debit, you get a naturally lower yield in the system.","The second little caveat, which is an important one as well, is that MasterCard Europe, when I said our yield is higher than Visa Europe but lower than MasterCard as a whole, MasterCard Europe includes Eastern Europe and Russia. Visa Europe does not do that. And so you've got to be a little careful about assuming the numbers across MasterCard Europe and Visa Europe. You may be comparing chalk and cheese a little bit there.","And the third part is you know all the regulatory change that's happening in Europe with what's going on with the interchange, and interchange doesn't directly impact network revenues. We've shown that time over time in every region around the world. But the fact is trying to go back to an issuer during a time that their own P&L is being compressed by lower interchange, dramatically lower interchange, I think that's going to be a little more challenging for pricing.","So even today our pricing is higher than Visa Europe's and that's why our yield is higher. They're gaining share even in that period of time. I'm not quite sure that if they do get in, they do buy it, what their pricing logic would be. If their pricing logic is to be more rational and raise it a little bit to come closer to us, that may give us a little more flexibility. But I'm going to wait and watch before I conclude anything.","Meanwhile, for us it's business as usual in Europe. They're pumping away growing share. You've heard Martina talk about our volume and our trends in Europe. We're actually trying our best to keep that business growing the way it should. We still think it's a very attractive growth business for our company in the years to come.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.","Moshe A. Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks. Ajay, you talked a little bit about some of the co-brand renewals that you secured. Can you talk a little bit about the outlook over the next several quarters, both from the standpoint of what you've got in terms of the size of what is out there to renew and then also maybe what you see at your competitors that might be a chance to get some new business?","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Look, the co-brand business is becoming where everybody suddenly got focused on. And it's always been a relatively competitive space. And some parts of it have gotten more competitive, others less so. My general opinion has been most co-brands are decided relatively rationally. There is a great discussion on pricing that's normally the starting point, as you would expect. But I do find that there is an intelligent conversation about the value you bring to the merchant and the issuer and the consumer of that co-brand in the process of being the network on that co-brand. So if the merchant issuer feels or the bank issuer feels that this is going to be an opportunity for them to build a stronger, closer relationship with some aspect of their consumer book, you tend to benefit from that, whether it be through analytics, through things like our Advisors book, or it be through safety and security or it be through loyalty and rewards. All those tend to patch together.","And in fact, just the pricing of clearing, authorizing and settlement is literally just an entry point. And a lot of what you're seeing us do in our acquisitions is to build out the capacity of the company's existing assets to connect into some of these edge of the network assets and become more than just what we used to be 10 years ago. That's what we're trying to do. And that impact will help us over time with co-brands, not just in the U.S., but also with proprietary books and also enable us to build more stable revenue streams, even as competition keeps coming into different parts of our existing revenue stream. That's a longer-term picture. It's not three, four quarters. I'm really talking out three, four, five, six years of how to think about the company for its future.","Specific deals in the U.S. and elsewhere, there are a ton of them that keep coming up. Every quarter there are co-brands up. There are some small ones, some big ones. We are playing for all of them. And some of them continue to make sense to us and some of them are at a point of time when they don't make sense. Then Martina and I go and hide in a room and run away from the numbers. That's what we do.","Moshe A. Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan from Sterne Agee (sic) [CLSA] (38:21).","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes, following up on the co-brand question \u2013 and I'm with CLSA, not Sterne Agee. When does a co-brand deal not make sense? If you can, give us some thoughts around how you think about that.","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","When it no longer makes sense? I don't how to give you a specific item or a number or thinking. But honestly, I look at it from many different ways. I look at the pricing and the yield for sure, but I look at it in every aspect of the ecosystem, issuer pricing, acquirer pricing, what you would get out of incremental volumes, what you'd get out of selling other value-added services, put the whole thing together. That, by the way, is true not just of co-brands. It's true of every deal we do. And we don't approach co-brands very differently from any other deal we do. We approach it with the same pricing discipline that we approach for any deal. And that's been our rules now at least since I've been here. I'm pretty certain that's how my predecessor used to look at them too.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Ajay, I wonder if you can comment strategically on MasterCard's acquisition approach. It sounds like you've gotten a lot more aggressive in areas that you called out in your comments in terms of trying to build out MasterCard's capabilities. Should we anticipate this as ongoing? I'm thinking from the perspective not only of competitive differentiation but also the impact on any given period's financials as you look out into the future. Is this from a capital allocation perspective a shift in MasterCard's overall strategy, or is what we're seeing more opportunistic in nature right now?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","So, Andrew, from a strategic point of view, I think what you're seeing us doing is that we got a lot more clarity over the last four or five years in terms of where we want to strategically play, and these are the areas that Ajay has actually called out. And then what we did is we went to work and actually looked at the areas. We looked at them organically and what can we actually build. We looked at whether we can partner with people, and then we also looked at what kind of companies and skill sets are out there that we could potentially purchase. And I think you see the culmination over the last 18 months of all of that work, putting it together.","We're looking at these acquisitions always first strategically. Do they fit with MasterCard? Will they expand our business? Will they be catering to the multiplier effect that Ajay was mentioning? That means not only putting their skill sets into our business but combining it with what we have and actually getting more out of it, so we looked at all of this. And then of course, we looked at does it culturally make sense? Can the companies work together, as well as does it make financially sense? All of those three criteria we really have not changed.","And when you look at our comments about capital deployment, again, we haven't changed those at all. We said first, we would be investing organically in the business. Second, we would be looking in these particular areas that are of strategic importance to us for acquisitions. And lastly, we are giving cash back to the shareholders. So you should not attribute any change in terms of what we're doing.","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","As far as the future is concerned, I hate to tell you that you should think about this dilution versus that dilution. At the end of the day, when I came here six years ago, we started this work around that time. And it happened that for the first three or four years, we only found a couple of deals that fitted into what we were trying to do. And at that time what we were trying to do was what led to DataCash and Access Prepaid.","Why was that? DataCash was like the e-commerce gateway. Remember, e-commerce six years ago was the thing that everybody was talking about growing into. We wanted to make sure we had the right connectivity with acquirers and merchants by building that in. We had our own gateway in Asia. We folded this with that, added the TNS gateway, and now we've got a pretty decent sized global gateway business. It has strengths and weaknesses. It's not strong enough in the U.S. It's stronger in Europe and Asia. We're trying to build it out. All that's going on.","Access Prepaid was because we were the minority players in prepaid, and we wanted to grow in prepaid. We saw it as a growth opportunity. One of the things we saw in there was if you owned a prepaid program manager, it connected valuable prepaid business and allowed you to grow your footprint. And lo and behold, five years later we have done very well in prepaid. We are one of the leading brands, if not the leading brand, by the end of this year in prepaid, and that's been helped partly by Access Prepaid.","As we moved along and we became clearer about where the future revenue streams would come from for continued growth, that's when we said let's focus on these bundled services, loyalty, safety, security, processing to see the data, connected to advisors and analytics. And as we built our confidence, we have kept looking at the deals. We looked at a ton of deals and chucked them out the door because they didn't fit one of those three criteria that Martina talked about, cultural fit, connectivity to our existing products and services, financial sense. But then along came timing-wise a bunch of deals that just enabled us to do this a lot last year.","Now it's been five months this year, we've done APT basically and one of the smaller ones, but it just depends on the year. So I'd be loath to give you a forward-looking idea about what this could look like. I just don't think I could predict that to you. But you should know that we will be acquisitive if it fits those three ideas and if we feel we can absorb it, and that's what we're trying to do.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Smitti from Morgan Stanley.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Yes, hi. Good morning, Ajay. Good morning, Martina. My question for you guys, I just was wondering if you guys could give us an update on your views on the legal and regulatory risks in Europe and in the U.S. Earlier this month there was some news out from the EU. And then over the past week there was some news out that the merchant litigation agreement in the U.S. could be facing some issues, too.","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","Look, the news item on the merchant litigation in the U.S., we've been aware of the article, we are aware of the underlying issues. If those allegations are true, clearly these lawyers have displayed conduct that's pretty disappointing. But to be clear, they were not the principals only involved in that whole settlement. There were lots of regulatory people involved. There was great close involvement by the judge at that time. I don't think that the behavior of two lawyers disrupts all that. But you know what, the court is going to decide that. We're pretty confident the settlement will stand. We'll see how it goes. But we've been aware of this for a little while now.","The European part of it, there are two or three things, too. One of is the actual announcement of the rules that are going into place, and you know that those are happening. The 20\/30 will happen. The functional versus legal separation of scheme and processing will happen. The co-badging will happen, and we're working with all that and we feel that we've got a good handle on all of those.","The statement of objections, this covers two issues, and we were aware of this for a while. We've been engaged in a dialogue with the commission, and we remain so in an effort to seek a constructive resolution. So the first issue they are tackling is the idea of interregional transactions and the interchange rates that are charged on inbound consumer cross-border transactions in an EEA from outside cards coming in.","Now, in our total numbers, that's less than 1% of our total volume. But it's an important issue, and Visa Inc. received a similar statement of objections from the EC, I don't know, three or four years ago, three years ago, and it's still sitting out there. So I don't even know how long this will take to come through to any sensible resolution, but it's a discussion that's happening; that should ECB be getting involved with the interchange rates that a Singaporean, Indian, Australian, American bank makes when a consumer from there transacts in the EU with very different ticket sizes and implications than an European consumer transacting in the EU. So we'll see where that goes. That is the work that's going on there.","There's a second aspect of the statement of objections from the EC, and that has to do with cross-border rather central acquiring rules for the European merchants. And that's what I'm going to be talking to them about because \u2013 how will that be constructive? For example, if you were to allow that to happen, would all acquirers move to one low-cost location and from there trend price down to a lower level, what would that mean for the banks and for the acquirers in other European countries? And so I don't know where it's going to go. In the actual putting out of the rules, a couple of these proposals got dropped because different European countries found them less than palatable. So we'll see. It's early days. We'll see. But we have in our disclosure, as Martina is about to tell you, because I can see she's dying to say something, so I'm going to point it to Martina.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","You've seen maybe numbers out there because in the SO you are seeing that the EC could be assessing fines associated with the SO, and it's far too early for us to be able to speculate on any numbers because there are many different ways that you can actually calculate them. And quite frankly, if we were to reach a settlement with the EC, we would not be expecting any fine to be imposed.","But there's really a third leg to the litigation in Europe, which I mentioned just in my prepared remarks, which is related to the UK merchant litigation. And as you can see, we have been settling with Tesco, which is the largest merchant claimant in this litigation. We have been settling with them. We are pleased that that is behind us and so I think we are on our way addressing those issues there, too.","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","Europe is an interesting marketplace for us, but it's got really interesting complications in the way it's constructed. You know that. That's how we've been navigating there for years. And as a company, we have a degree of experience and expertise on the ground in Europe.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Good morning. You spent a lot of time in your opening remarks talking about your Gateway globally. Visa made some very strong comments about the sustainability of PayPal's data disintermediation model and then backed it up with an investment in Stripe yesterday. So I was wondering if you could comment similarly on how you view the long-term longevity of data disintermediation.","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","Craig, there's a bunch of people that are playing in this space. Gateways are just one way to get some access to the transaction. PayPal is much more than a gateway. And Stripe is a different \u2013 they're different. People use gateway very loosely. So in that whole space of digital transactions, whether they be through m-commerce or e-commerce channel or in-app or browser-based or whether they be through physical contactless, there are going to be a lot of players playing in this space to connect to the merchant, to connect to the acquirer and to connect to the issuer and the digital vehicle that they use. We're just keen to be a regular player playing with all of them.","We've had a view through many earnings calls and investor meetings. But we're not going to pick winners and losers in this because this thing is evolving at a rate that's very fast and people who looked like winners three years, four years ago are no longer relevant players there. So rather than placing bets, we're being relatively agnostic in all these spaces, whether it be \u2013 you remember a little while back the conversation was secure element versus HCE. And we said we're not going to pick, we're going to do both, and that's what we're doing. It's the same with all of these things.","So my view generally is there's going to be a ton of players playing there. We are actively involved with Stripe with many different aspects of what they do. We will be doing other things with them. You don't have to invest with them to be able to do good commercial deals with them, although it may make strategic sense sometimes to invest. And so I don't rule out any of these. I just have a view: keep yourself open, play with all of them, find your company's best interests there and remain relevant in the value chain. That's what we're trying to do.","PayPal is a client of ours as well, not just \u2013 as you've heard from many others, more than half of their float comes from the use of traditional cards of all our networks. But in addition, their corporate cards, some of their small business cards is all with us as well. So I do see the fact that they do with ACH get around the networks and in a way around the issuer's compensation in that sense. That part I don't like. If you remember, that's why we put out the digital wallet operator rules which, by the way, the other networks have yet not clarified on. And so we put that out for a reason, because we wanted the rules to be clear. And the rules have got to be that the brand of the issuer, the brand of the network has to flow right through.","I believe they prefer a transaction that's not staged, but it's flowed through. That's what Apple has done; that's what a lot of the other digital giants are doing. PayPal does it differently. Yet PayPal is a client as well. And I think the digital world is a complicated one where you've got to find your way to thread your needle through it. That's what we're trying to do.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Is the two-stage wallet fee still in place?","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry, is the...","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","The two-stage wallet. Yes, it is.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Okay. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning. Ajay, could you update us on the SEPA debit processing pipeline?","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","It's the same as usual, meaning it moves at the glacial pace that I'm used to in Europe. We're growing our SEPA transactions in the mid-teens. It's been like that, I would say, for a few quarters now. We are seeing SEPA transactions \u2013 SEPA-based transactions, I don't want to call it SEPA transactions, we are seeing domestic transactions in a number of the European countries, actually in almost all of them. Growing in Germany, growing in Belgium. The ramp up in Netherlands was announced some time ago. We're seeing some more transactions in France and Spain and in Portugal and Italy. All that's going on. Nothing new on that phase.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","And in fact, David, when you really read the European legislation, that actually provides an opportunity for us to be expanding in SEPA processing more. Given what the merchants are looking at at this point in time, they will probably be accepting electronic payments more than they did. Remember in Europe, many, many merchants, especially the small merchants, are not accepting that.","They have a way of telling the industry in terms of where they want to route the transactions. And we believe that our processing business in Europe is very strong to be able to continue to take advantage of it. But as Ajay said, this is not a revolutionary change ever. It's an evolutionary change and will help us over a long term to be increasing our business in Europe.","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we've gone from what used to be high 20% of processed transactions several years ago to just under 40%. So that gives you a sense of how much time it took us to get from point A to point B.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","This was from the beginning of 2008 until now. So about a six-year period.","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay?","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Next question, please?","David Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler from Stifel.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks and good morning. Can we talk a little bit about pricing? I think you mentioned a benefit in the prepared remarks. I didn't know if you could quantify it. It sounds like it's less than 100 basis points since it wasn't quantified. And just going forward, we're seeing some degradation in the processed transactions, fees per transaction processed and domestic assessments. Is there a currency impact there, or do you continue to expect some degradation there? Any plans for any pricing would be helpful. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So first of all, Chris, on pricing, this quarter we had really a very, very small impact on pricing, similar to last quarter. Very, very small. And you should not expect for this year a lot of pricing to be coming through on a net basis.","In terms of what's going on transaction processing fee, there are two factors in there. One is mix in terms of where it comes from and in which region the fees are actually generated. And, yes, you're right, local currency is impacting that, too.","Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura.","William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Can you talk about whether you anticipate any kind of impact from the changes to AmEx's anti-steering provisions?","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","I haven't seen anything yet. It's very early days. And clearly there's got to be some impact in terms of how merchants perceive it, but very early. I don't know yet.","William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of comes from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Understanding it's still very early in the process with China, can you give us any sense at this point about the restrictions you might expect to be placed upon you in terms of limitations on regional operating or other market share restrictions that might prevent you from getting to full unencumbered market share potential in China over time? And if you don't have any sense on that, when do you think you might get more clarity?","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","So to tell you to expect that you will not have restrictions and encumbrances would be to expect the wrong thing out of the way China tends to open up its businesses. Based on many years of working with China, including my years in my previous job in Asia, they have always done this in a very measured, thoughtful way that allows local industry to both benefit from the influx of foreign money and technology, but also to actually protect itself in a way from that influx. And it's been done very carefully over the years. I see no reason why they wouldn't be as thoughtful in this, which is a very important industry to them.","So we will have restrictions. We will have encumbrances. Already in the preliminary guidelines they've issued, which I referred to when I was speaking in (56:45) more by the end of the year, they've got ideas around what qualifies for domestic processing and what kind of data can and cannot leave their shores and how you would operate for clearing, authorizing and settlement. And they've got ideas, but they're still at a stage where I don't know the detail of them. And finally in all of these, the devil is in the details.","We, because of our distributed operating structure a little different from other networks, may qualify for some aspects of our technology to be seen as more local than some of the others, but I don't know yet. It's all work in progress. But rest assured, there will be encumbrances and there will be some restrictions. But it's an interesting marketplace still. It will be a marketplace that will evolve over a few years. Not only is it a question of getting processing set up on the ground in China, which we hope to be able to do by the end of next year for sure, technically, but it's more than that. It's what kind of acceptance do you have outside of what used to be the high traffic tourist destinations in the big cities, which is where traditional foreign network acceptance was housed. How do you get more issuers to be issuing these cards over the next period of time? So there's going to be a lot of work on issuing, on acceptance in addition to the processing.","And part of what Martina talked about when she said we're going to start spending money this year is we see a two, three-year pattern of investing there. All we're trying to do is to start getting ahead of that curve and start putting ourselves in a better position. So over the course of three, four, five years, we feel good about where we are in China. We feel good today. Today, as I said last time in my call, about half of the cards issued, they are with us, but half are with our largest competitor. It wasn't that way five years ago. We've got a decent position. But you know what? Compared to China UnionPay's own branded card, we're all tiny and there's a huge opportunity in that system over a few years to come.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Martina, maybe you could just talk a little bit about expenses and operating margin. I think non-GAAP operating margin was 54.9%. I guess I'm curious to know if that was in line with your expectations. I know the Street was look for something higher, and I know before you've talked a little bit about some of the mis-modeling by the Street. So maybe can just address that. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Actually, operating margins were completely in line with expectations that we had internally, in fact, a little bit better because we were able to reap more savings from our restructuring that we had started earlier this year than anticipated. And also, the M&A activity that is on the OpEx line was actually right on with our expectations.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Okay, I think that's it for Q&A. Ajay, do you have some closing comments?","Ajay Banga - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So thank you all for those questions, and I'm going to leave you with a couple of quick closing thoughts. I guess the business continues to perform well in what we find to be a challenging global economy. The U.S. and Europe, as I said, seem to be improving. Asia and Latin America have a few market issues. We are going ahead and executing on strategy. We are investing in new technology. We're investing in other services both organically and through acquisitions, and we did have a couple of questions around that in the last half an hour. We are clearly seeing the benefits of these acquisitions in our business engagements. We continue to expect to have increasing opportunities to bundle that capability with our existing products and services. And as Martina mentioned, we're managing our organic expense growth to fund those integrations.","I hope many of you will come along to attend our Investor Day in September in New York, if nothing else, to get a selfie and check that your transaction goes through. But you will also have the chance to hear more about strategic focus areas and hopefully experience some of these innovative products and services, a couple of which got mentioned on today's call. Mostly, we appreciate your continued support of our company and all of us and thank you so much for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Good morning everybody. Our business continues to perform well. We are very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you could see from the release on a currency neutral basis, and excluding that special items related to litigation, we reported both net revenue and EPS growth of 14%. Martina is going to get into the financial details, so I'm going to talk a little bit about the global economy first, and frankly, other than the Brexit vote, very little has changed since the last quarter.","The United States economy is still holding steady. Consumer confidence up slightly, stable job growth, lower inflation, and frankly, prior to the Brexit vote, many parts of Europe were showing steady signs of improvement in both consumer confidence and unemployment. And you know, while it's still too early to predict the full impact of Brexit, we will obviously watch that situation very carefully.","The outlook for Asia remain cautious. We've got a prolonged slowdown in China, a weaker than expected recovery in Australia. India continues to be a bright spot. Both consumer and business sentiment there remains strong.","In Latin America, Brazil is still in a deep recession but interestingly, a modest increase in business confidence is beginning to show signs that the economy may be reaching a bottom. In Venezuela, economic conditions continue to deteriorate but Mexico is in a steady growth path. It's been driven by solid consumer spending and low unemployment.","And so as a result, it's likely we're going to remain in a period of economic and political uncertainly, at least for the near term. And having said all of this, our business continues to grow. Our fundamentals remain strong. We are seeing double digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets, and we continue to win deals by differentiating ourselves with services.","Now I wasn't on the call last week that Martina and team had on VocaLink, so let me just quickly share my views about the planned acquisition of VocaLink. The deal is an important component of our strategy to participate in all forms of electronic payments and to enhance our services for the benefit of our customers and our partners.","And VocaLink itself is very interesting to us for a couple of reasons. First, when you look at all payment flows in the world's top 50 countries, and this is not just retail payments, ACH represents about 50% of that total. And the potential of Fast ACH is growing, especially given that it is being promoted by a number of regulatory bodies in Europe, the United States and in other parts of the world.","Second, we believe that VocaLink is the best asset in this space, from both a technology standpoint as well as having a very talented group of people who are respected across the industry. Beyond the opportunities available in their primary UK market, they have been successful in operating and licensing their Fast ACH technology in other markets, in Sweden, in Singapore, in Thailand. They're also the primary supplier of Fast ACH technology to the Clearing House in the United States.","And finally, the ability to see both card and ACH transactions would enable us to offer an even broader range of data analytics and other services to our partners. Our card network is empowering our growth in both consumer and commercial payments for many years. And with this acquisition, we will now have a new set of capabilities to capture additional opportunities in B2B, in P2P and government payment flows, regardless of what payment rails are used. So that's VocaLink.","Let me move on to a brief update on China. In June, the People's Bank of China released the final regulation of foreign card networks to operate domestically in China. We are currently working through the requirements. We need a much better understanding around their national security and cyber security standards before we determine how best to proceed. We got to weigh whether we can apply for a license alone or with a business partner. It's all connected to this deeper understanding. Meanwhile, what we are doing is we're continuing to work on building out our technology on the ground as well as working with our Chinese customers on new issuance and broadening acceptance.","So moving on from there, a couple of recent developments on the legal front. In the United States, the Brooklyn District Court's 2013 approval of the US merchant class action settlement as you know was overturned by the Court of Appeals in late June. And obviously, we're disappointed by that decision. Charlie [Scharf] and Visa reviewed it in some detail on their earnings call last week, so I'm not going to rehash the same details. The case will be sent back to the District Court, where we expect the first order of business to be to appoint counsel for the injunctive relief class.","MasterCard will then work with all parties to see if we can find ways to reform the settlement in line with the Court of Appeals decision. And as you'd expect, our focus on that work will be on rule changes and the scope of the release, which were the issues in the Court of Appeals decision, not the money damages. On the money damages, note that our financial exposure remains capped at 12% of any settlement or judgment under the agreements we entered into with the bank defendants and with Visa in 2011.","Additionally in July, a UK court issued a decision in one of the UK merchant suits seeking interchange damages. That court awarded Sainsbury's a portion of the damages it had been seeking, and that amount, along with anticipated legal fees and costs, was taken as a charge in the second quarter. That's the special item you see in our results. Although we don't believe the retailer suffered any damages, they're gratified by several aspects of the court's decision. Just one example, the court recognized that an appropriate level of domestic interchange is substantially higher than the 20 and 30 basis points imposed by the European interchange fee regulation that went into effect last December.","So, now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. And during the quarter, as normal, we signed a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I'm going to run through a few examples. We continue to make progress in our US consumer business. Recent highlights include the renewal of our partnership with Huntington National Bank across their debit, credit, and commercial businesses, expanded acquisitions of new consumer credit accounts with several of the largest banks in the market.","In addition, we had important wins in the cobrand space, including American Airlines, where Citi and Barclaycard will both be the issuers, as well as InterContinental Hotels, Bed, Bath & Beyond and some others. We also renewed, just announced yesterday here actually, our consumer credit cobrand with PayPal, an important component of our overall relationship with them, which as you heard from Dan Schulman on his call, we're all actively seeking to expand.","We continue to drive our commercial business forward. One of the most important verticals for us is travel, and now in addition to our relationship with eNett and Travelport that we've talked of in previous calls, we just signed a new global deal with Amadeus, a leading travel technology company. Today, travel agencies make more than $300 billion in annual payments to airlines, hotels and other travel providers, largely via bank transfers and checks. What this agreement does is it combines Amadeus's new B2B Wallet and virtual payment technology with MasterCard's commercial card capabilities. We will provide travel agencies and travel providers with a fast, secure and automated way to pay and get paid.","We continue to perform well outside of the US. In Canada, we signed two new issuer deals, renewed four issuer and cobrand deals, including MBNA which is a division now of the Toronto Dominion Bank and President's Choice Financial which is part of Loblaws, which is one of the largest retailers in Canada, which by the way, included exclusive issuance. In Europe, we are pleased to sign an expanded agreement with Yapi Kredi, one of the market leaders in Turkey, for a larger portion of their credit portfolio. Prior to this deal, most of their credit business was with a competitor.","In addition to the deals I mentioned previously, we are continuing our momentum in the core brand space globally. We are very excited we renewed our partnership with Wal-Mart in Canada, and also signed a new agreement with them in China. We have partnered with Axis Bank in India, as well as Miles & More, one of the largest global frequent flyer rewards programs to launch India's first multi-currency cobranded prepaid card that supports up to 17 currencies to facilitate both domestic and international card usage.","Finally, you've heard us say many times how we've been successful with using services as a key strategic differentiator for winning deals. As one example of this, we're happy to have renewed a long-term debit agreement with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, one of Australia's largest retail banks, includes commercial cards and a flip of the majority of their consumer credit business. And that deal includes a full complement of our services, consisting of Advisors, Loyalty Solutions, and our suite of safety and security products.","We signed a deal with CartaSi, one of the largest card issuers in Italy, to begin issuing debit cards, as well as to use Advisors Consulting Services. You'll hear a lot more from us about how we're differentiating with services at our upcoming Investor Day in September.","So moving on to our digital strategy, you know we have long said this is a marathon not a sprint, but we've made some significant progress this past quarter, and there's more to come. So about two weeks ago, we announced an important industry milestone when we became the first network to deliver a digital payment service across all devices, all channels. With MasterPass, consumers can now decide how and where they prefer to shop whether that's in-app, online, or in-store, using a bank-branded offering from the issuer of their choice, knowing that their payment information is protected by our technology.","We've also previously talked about our digital-by-default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll card holders onto the MasterPass service through their online banking app without any additional effort by the consumer. We're very pleased that more than 80 million accounts will be automatically enabled by the end of this year, 80 million, as the service has begun to roll out globally, starting with Europe and Asia, and later this year in the United States with Bank of America, with Citibank, and Capital One.","Further, issuers can use MasterPass to differentiate their own wallet offering by using our open APIs to integrate other services from us such as purchase alerts or paying with points, or services that they have developed themselves. And lastly, in terms of geography, including the recent expansions to Greece, Switzerland, Colombia and Ukraine, we are now live in 33 markets.","From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass is currently available at hundreds of thousands of merchants, online and in-app. We are pleased to have recently added IKEA. We will soon be adding Saks, Lord & Taylor and the Cheesecake Factory as more examples. With the introduction of NFC capability, consumers will now be able to use MasterPass at the more than 5 million merchant locations in 77 countries that accept contactless payments today. Contactless will first be available to Android device owners in the United States later this month with a global expansion to follow shortly thereafter.","And that moves our last topic is tokenization technology. The MasterCard Digital Enablement Service, or MDES, we continue to make solid progress around making transactions more secure for MasterPass, which by the way is already enabled for contactless transactions with online and in-app to follow, but also for our digital partners. Most recently, we helped Android Pay expand to Singapore, as well as Apple Pay's move into Canada, Hong Kong, Switzerland and France. In addition, we're also pleased to be partnering with Microsoft on the launch of their cloud-based mobile wallet solution for Windows 10-compatible devices.","All these examples illustrate our continued commitment to deliver secure consumer payment experience to our cardholders using the mobile device of their choice.","So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with page three, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figures exclude the impact of the special items taken in both this quarter and the previous quarter related to the judgment issued on Sainsbury's and the settlement we made with Tesco, the two largest merchants involved in the UK merchant litigation.","I'd like to point out a few items using the currency-neutral growth rates. As Ajay said, net revenue growth was 14% for the quarter, coming in a bit higher than our expectations. Operating expenses grew 13%, primarily due to continued investments to support our strategic initiatives, as well as higher legal costs, of which the majority are not likely to recur. We saw a higher tax rate than in the year-ago quarter due to the non-recurrence of a discrete US foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the second quarter of 2015.","And with all of that, EPS was $0.96, up 14% year over year. Share repurchases contributed about $0.03 per share, and as of July 21, we have $2.7 billion remaining under our current authorization.","And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion.","So let's turn to page four, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. When comparing these numbers to the last quarter, just remember, the first quarter saw about a 1 PPT benefit from leap day, which explains most of the differences. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV growth, was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 PPT from last quarter. Overall, our US GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total US GDV had less than 1 PPT headwind from lower gas prices.","Now outside of the US, volume growth was 13% on a local currency basis, and that's about down 2 PPT versus last quarter, with low to mid teens growth in each region. And beginning on June 9, as a result of the new EU regulations, our volume numbers reflect the absence of domestic co-batched volume that we do not process, particularly in France. In the second quarter, we saw an impact of 1 PPT on worldwide volume growth, and a 3 PPT impact to European volume growth. The impact will become more pronounced over the next year, and this has been contemplated in all of our forward guidance. Cross-border volume grew 10% on a local currency basis, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the first quarter.","Let me turn to page five, and here you can see processed transactions grew 14% globally to $13.7 billion. And that's a very similar increase from what we saw in the first quarter. And globally, the number of cards grew 7% to 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued.","On page six, here you see some highlights on a few of the detailed revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out, both here and on the next slide, are all on a currency-neutral basis. So as I've said, net revenue growth was 14%, a bit stronger than we expected. We saw continued strong volume and transaction growth plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentives grew 23%, primarily due to higher volumes, as well as some deal renewals.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items, domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew by 11%, and the difference is primarily due to mix. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 10%. The 4 PPT gap is due to a number of pricing actions partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 21%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions, as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenue grew 25%, driven by primarily by services such as Advisors, APT and our safety and security product offerings.","Moving now to Page 7. Here you can see that total operating expenses after excluding special items increased 12% in the quarter or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Our APT acquisition contributed about 1 PPT to these growth rates. In addition, 5 PPT was due to higher legal costs. As I already said, the majority of these aren't likely to recur.","So the remaining 7 PPT was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to our continued investments in strategic areas such as digital, data analytics and geographic expansion. Also, our data processing expense growth is normally in line with transaction growth. However, this past quarter, the growth was higher due to the fee we now pay to NSPK for processing domestic Russian transactions.","Let me turn to slide eight, and here we can discuss what we have seen in July through the 21st, where most of our drivers are up from the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 11%, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the second quarter. In the US, our processed volume grew 8%, down 1 PPT from the second quarter, with slower growth in credit but higher growth in debit. Gas had less than a 1 PPT negative impact on our July growth, and that's very similar to the second quarter. And processed volume outside of the US grew 15%, up a bit from the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe and Latin America.","Globally, processed transaction growth was 17%, up 3 PPT from what we saw in the second quarter. Processed transaction growth outside the US was up 1 PPT, with increases in Europe and Latin America, and the US growth was up 6 PPT, driven by new opportunities of PIN routing. With respect to across border, our volumes actually grew 14% globally and that's up 4 PPT from last quarter, with faster growth in Europe. We also saw faster growth in Middle East\/Africa, which was likely related to the timing of Ramadan.","So now looking to the full year of 2016, there's really no change in our business outlook from what we discussed with you in our earnings back in April. Currently, we don't anticipate any significant impact from Brexit this year. However, foreign exchange headwinds will continue to be with us in 2016 although they continue to moderate from the recent past given current FX rates. Our underlying business fundamentals remain strong and we will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and bottom line, as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management.","As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our three year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies, and at current rates, we estimate that that would mean about a 2 PPT headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line, which is less of a headwind than what we said on our April earnings call.","Now let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. For rebates and incentives, we now expect to see growth of about the same as the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015 after factoring in the impact of the new American Airlines cobrand renewal. On expenses, we continue to expect total operating expense growth in the high single digit range for our as-reported results excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double digit growth. Be mindful that we're ramping up our efforts on MasterPass which impacts G&A and A&M, particularly in the third quarter. You should now assume a tax rate of slightly less than 29% for 2016.","And finally, on the subject of share repurchases, now while year to date we have bought back about $1.8 billion, most of that occurred early in the year, as we were out of the market for most of the second quarter given the pending VocaLink transaction. As I said last week, once our trading window opens in early August, we expect to continue our repurchasing activity.","So now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question and answer period. In order to get to as many people as possible, with ask you that limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Blair?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operation Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is open.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah, hi. Thanks. Two questions. One, if you could provide us your thoughts for the industry regarding the deal Visa signed with PayPal. And secondly, if you can comment if there was any disruption in volume in Europe related to any of the geopolitical problems there, terrorism, so on and so forth. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Hi, Craig. So a little bit about both. The second one is a more transactional question and I can tell you that places like Turkey and other such locations, there's no doubt that the impact of some of this activity in terrorism does impact what's going on there. Our cross-border growth to Turkey is down significantly compared to last year. Cardholders from Germany, Russia, Sweden and the US are not traveling there with the same level of frequency as they were clearly. We're also closely watching travel to other markets, France and so on.","Interestingly, in the UK, we're actually seeing an increase of inbound cross-border spend. So it's kind of bouncing around but specifically in a couple of countries that got impacted by terrorism, there's no doubt that it causes some angst in cross-border trends. Having said that, remember what Martina said, right now, our cross-border volumes for the first few weeks of this quarter, it's only a few weeks, are up compared to where we were last quarter. And in fact, Europe is one of the contributors to that being up.","So the part about Visa and PayPal. I've said this a few times to a number of you when I've met you. Back in June of 2013, we had implemented a new approach to digital wallet operators that applied to all staged wallets, and by the way not just PayPal, so I want you to understand that, with the intent of bringing consistency and transparency to the system. Transactions should flow through with clear data flowing through. The brand of the bank and the network should be visible to the consumer and the merchant.","There were many reasons for us to be thoughtful about that digital wallet operator principles. We're still exactly where we were with those principals, and I think what I'm really pleased to see through a constructive dialogue with Dan Schulman and his management team at PayPal, that PayPal is actually working to resolve some of those concerns we all had around the lack of transparency around these staged wallets as well as ACH clearing. And that's what you saw in the announcement that he and Charlie made a few days ago.","And if you heard Dan mention on his earnings call, they're in discussions other than the payment space to work with similar concepts or somewhat different but in the same space. We've worked with PayPal for many years. We have a good working relationship with them on a wide range of opportunities. I just told you we just renewed our credit cobrand portfolio with them, in fact yesterday. And so that gives you a sense of the manner in which PayPal is trying to work with the industry. I think this is actually a good thing for PayPal and for the industry, because at the end of the day, providing consumers the ability of having seamless, simple ways of paying is good for all of us. Everything's better than letting them use cash, and that's where we're all headed.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan from CLSA. Your line is open.","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Ajay, when you talk about China and some of the security standards, are you referring to the EMV standard that China adopted and it being different from what's been embraced around the rest of the world?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, actually that's a tactical problem that actually at the end of the day creates costs and implications for solving for the way chip cards work in China and Chinese chip cards work outside of China. It's solvable. It's not the best thing to do but it's solvable.","What I'm referring to is that they recently, in their policy regarding the opening up of the market for people like us to come in, they put in a couple of clauses around complying with their new national security and cyber security policy. The little challenges of the new national security and cyber security policy has not yet actually been passed into a form that is visible to us in a document that we can say, okay, got it, got it, got it, do this, do that, we're okay. It's not in that form.","So we're a little bit of in-between territory, between understanding that they want to have a thoughtful national security and cyber security policy, which they're entitled to, but we don't understand the implications for us in terms of operating a network on the ground. So whether we operate with our own license or we operate in a JV with somebody else or we do some other creative thinking around this will all depend on clarity of these kinds of elements that they've put into the policy they've recently announced. That's what we're trying to sort out.","Meanwhile, there's a lot of stuff to do for us in China. We are continuing work on issuance, continuing work on building out acceptance, where we've been continuing some work on basic technology development so that when we get clarity on this, and Martina and I are confident we understand what we're signing up for, then we can move forward relatively quickly from that space. So it's kind of one of those in-between spaces.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could kind of address the comments you made about US debit accelerating in July. I think Visa had made some comments about seeing the mirror image of that, some deceleration. Are there actions that you're taking that are causing that or is it decisions of individual acquirers or merchants? Anything you can kind of add to that discussion?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, if you heard us saying we're going up and the other ones are reducing, that's just the differential impact for both of us. So I don't know how to comment on that one. I'm not saying that you're getting a great change in underlying consumer secular spending towards debit. Don't conclude that. In fact, that's not at all what we are talking about. This is all to do with PIN routing and working on PIN transactions. And as I think I've told you a couple of calls ago, maybe a few before that, this stuff will move around a little bit and bounce around as merchants move the different routing in their routing tables depending on what's working for them. And it's not just about pricing. It's also about speed of approval. It's about many different things that they look at. Most of the bigger merchants have a very sophisticated and quite thoughtful way of deciding their routing tables, and we keep working with them. And so some quarters are better, some quarters are a little less good. What you're seeing currently is a better period.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah and having said that, when you look at our three weeks July numbers, where I said that the US transactions are actually up by 6 PPT, actually what is happening is that we have more of an opportunity to actually get routing for merchants because we happen to be now on more cards.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Back of the cards.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","On the back of the cards.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks guys. Nice job. Just want to touch on specifically the pricing changes that went into effect to allow the transaction fees to increase, or I think you said it was around 7 points faster than the actual transactions, similar with cross-border outpacing volume growth. Was it yield, all yield improvement on price, or was there also a mix element to it? And then just maybe on pricing trends going forward. Thanks guys.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah so, Darrin, I mean we said in the cross-border line as well as in the processed transaction line and those fee lines that we had some pricing actions. And it really was what I would call moving around the deck chairs in a number of countries, which allowed us net-net to take some price. In terms of actually anniversarying those kind of prices, about 50% of those actions have anniversaried now with the second quarter, and the other 50% of those actions will be anniversarying by next year. And by the way, this is nothing different than what we had called out in the last quarter. So this is just the normal run rate that happens from time to time.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Just as my follow-up, any early sense on impacts from Europe with regard to Visa Europe deal?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Look, it's very, very early, okay. They just about closed the transaction, and having said that, we obviously have prepared our group and our sales teams to make absolutely sure that we are with our clients and that we do all of the actions that we need necessary. But it's extremely early. You see that Europe is actually growing still very nicely in the mid teens from a volume point of view. So I don't think we have anything to add at this point.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just one extra comment on pricing, and I know your question was about two specific line items in the thing, but overall for us in the second quarter, pricing contributed a little less than 1 percentage point to our net revenue growth. And that's kind of just so you know the whole picture.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Makes sense. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler from Stifel. Your line is open.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Another question on Europe, if I could. I think, Martina, you just said that the volume growth in Europe, excluding the change in France, was mid-teens. Make sure that's right.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","It's including, Chris, including. When you look all of the volume, the GDV volume in Europe, it's still in the mid teens range.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. Okay. But you reported 8.8% because of the change to the co-batch transactions in countries like France?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Exactly.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. So that's more than double what Visa Europe has now disclosed, or Visa has now disclosed their European segment is growing. And the question I keep getting from investors that I'm hoping you could try to shed some light on is, there's been some discussions about yields and the difference in yields between MasterCard and Visa and that Visa will be potentially raising some of their yields.","And I just want to talk about, if you maybe could just refresh our memories, like how are you driving these market share gains, growing more than double the rate of Visa Europe at this point despite the higher perceived pricing levels? What I've been telling folks is it's actually not that different if you get down to the bank level. You're actually closer to apples-to-apples on a pricing basis. Maybe just give us some of your thoughts on that current dynamic and how it might change with Visa Europe now being part of Visa. And also, does VocaLink play into your strategy of competing against Visa Europe? Thank you.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","So first of all, when you look at our overall pricing in Europe versus Visa Europe, you are absolutely right that our pricing is higher when you look at it all accumulated together. It's not quite at the level where our global pricing is. It's lower because, as you know, in every geography and in the country, it depends in terms of whether we just were to be able to license our brand so that we get the volume assessment and whether or not we actually get to see the transaction from a processing point of view. All of you guys know in Europe we process about 40% of our transactions only.","And lastly, in terms of what kind of services we are actually delivering to the client, when you look at the largest client, I have to believe that we have very similar pricing to Visa. It might be different in terms of when you look at the medium and then the smaller clients. Now having said that, what Javier [Perez] and his team have done in a really great way is using the global capability of MasterCard with all the products and services that we have around the globe, to be bringing that in a seamless fashion to our European clients. And that's what they really like to see, right.","And this is what did not happen with our competitor, given that there were two different companies and given that we are generally the smaller company. I always have to say that we have to put more points on the board. That means we have to rise higher in order to make sure that the customer gets that differentiated product and service that they're seeking in order to basically address their pain points and have fantastic products for their consumers. That's how our team is winning every day in the market.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And your question on VocaLink, I think you should remember like I said, VocaLink is not about competing with Visa Europe, by the way. VocaLink is about us wanting to be real players in every aspect of electronic payments and the way they're developing. And the reality is that today, across the world, 50% of payments, not just retail, are ACH. But within that, what's really interesting is the opportunity to grow Fast ACH, and VocaLink is one of the few players that has not only an outstanding Fast ACH platform implemented in the UK, but also implemented in other countries and most of ACH tends to be local. VocaLink's demonstrated an ability to take that Fast ACH platform and make it globally adaptable.","And you can imagine the possibilities of that over the next decade. So I really want you to think about us doing the VocaLink transaction, if it all works out, once we're through all the regulatory steps, our strategic intent is to play across all aspects of these payment rails for individual consumer-to-merchant payments but also B2B, P2P and government payment flows. And that's how we see our footprint growing over the years.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you so much for the color.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Hey guys. Just a question about the full year 2016 top line outlook. I know you said that you're reiterating to be at the low end of the three year target, which is low double digit. So I'm going to call it 10% to 11% for argument's sake. You're running at 14% through that first half of the year. So can you just remind us what might lead to the decel? Or are you just being conservative on macro? I guess you've got USAA will be deconverting at a faster rate, and maybe some lapping of acquisitions. Just wanted to have the pieces there.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","So, Jason, excellent question.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Thank you, Martina.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Well listen, there are kind of three factors that are contributing to the deceleration on the growth rates for the second half, which would land us pretty much in the same place, as I've said at the beginning of the year, which is the low double digit number. The first one is we have anniversaried the acquisition of APT. Right, and we said all along that was about 1 percentage point. So that is going to come out. Secondly yes, we do have on the USAA credit portfolio, it's rolling off very fast, okay. So we will have a more significant impact in the third as well as in the fourth quarter. And then thirdly, you just heard us that we actually renewed American Airlines and starting with the third quarter, we will have more rebates and incentives coming into that line item.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That explains it.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Ajay, can you talk about where you are with the future pipeline of M&A? You guys have been decently acquisitive, and I guess going forward, should we expect you guys to digest some of these acquisitions?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I don't have any indigestion right now, just to be clear. We've been digesting the other ones in the past, and it's actually helped us build out a lot of capabilities. You know, it's not a coincidence that our other revenue line is growing at the rate it's been growing for quite a few quarters. It's not a coincidence. And remember, after a year when you anniversary an acquisition, it comes into the base. After two years, the entire P&L comes into our base. So we're quite disciplined about tracking ourselves against it.","Some of the acquisitions do better than what we thought we could do with them. Some of them don't do as well. That's just the reality of what we're trying to go through. But in the process, we've built out a decent capability in data analytics and information services. We've added to our capability in loyalty and rewards. We've added to our capability in technology and connectivity for e-commerce and gateways, as well as to connect to bank accounts around the world, even before the VocaLink acquisition. So that's kind of what we're trying to do.","I honestly, at any point of time in any quarter, I think Martina and her team are working on a number of possible acquisitions. What tends to happen is 2%, 5%, 6% of them show up at any level of second level analysis. By the time we are done, one out of many gets done. So it's tough for me to tell you that I have two next quarter or three in the fifth quarter, I'm not going to do all that. I am just focused on, first of all, getting the ones we're already doing to keep doing well. Second, we've got to work really hard between now and the next few months to get the VocaLink acquisition through all of the processes of regulatory approval and get our company to be an excellent player in the ACH and Fast ACH game, first with a responsibility to the UK, because we are going to be a large player there in terms of this, but also with the ability to see how we take it elsewhere.","You know, our priorities remain in the area of loyalty and rewards, in the area of data analytics and information services, in the area of safety and security. At some degree, all of this depends on us being able to see more transactions, to be able to see and handle and touch more transactions. Processing access are very helpful in that space, so we tend to play through these as we go along. And I, you know honestly, I think Martina has done great working with me because she's looking at a few deals all the time. This is probably not a great sartorial comment but that's true.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Next question, please.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of an update on the European acceptance landscape. I think you talked last quarter about how you've been given an update on what you've seen due to the European interchange cuts in terms of merchant acceptance. Obviously we're seeing some increased volume growth there. So any way you can parse out how much of that might be due to the interchange reg changes, and how much of that is just better economic activity or other factors?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","So, Jim, I do have to say, and I just came back from another trip in Europe, there have been quite a bit of changes on the merchant acceptance landscape because of the lower interchange fees. And as you might remember all during the last couple of years leading up to the changes that came in last December of 2015, we were hoping that that would actually change the view of some of the merchants to be able, or be wanting to accept card payments, because quite frankly, no card payments are a heck of a lot cheaper than what you have to do with cash, right.","And so we're seeing fairly large-scale changes coming through with some very large merchants, so that's what we're seeing first. So for instance, a grocery store like ALDI, which is a very a gruffy discount store \u2013 they don't even have shelves in their store \u2013 you grab actually goods out of the boxes that they just rip open. They finally are actually opening or have opened card payments. And there are a number of those large retailers who are now willing to do it. And we see it pretty much in every European country.","What we haven't seen yet as much as movement is on the smaller merchants, and that's obviously where there's a lot of work that we still have to do. And we're hoping that that will continue to allow us to change the secular trend in Europe which, outside of the UK, right, in the UK a lot is already electronic side, but in the rest of the Europe, in the Continent, I always call it that this is still an emerging country for us. That will help us on the secular trend from cash and check to electronic forms of payments and will help our numbers over time.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toget from Evercore. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Martina, you called out the impact of the separation of scheme from processing in Europe effective June 9. I'm wondering about another major provision that went into effect June 9, particularly the new merchant routing provisions. Could you comment on the opportunity to gain processing share, particularly in large markets like France and Germany as routing opens up outside of these local payment monopolies?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So I think that all of these changes in the regulation actually do help us over time to be doing more processing in Europe. As I just said to a prior question, is we do about 40% of MasterCard's transactions in Europe being processed by our own network. Now, with the separation of the scheme and the switching unit, our processing unit, that processing unit is actually free to go in a differentiated way to the market and to be hopefully getting even more switching opportunity from all of the local players, be it the banks or be it the merchants, and I think the merchant routing rules just play into that.","Just remember, when you go back to SEPA, that was implemented back in January 1, 2008. It opened the kimono a little bit, and we were able to move our processed transactions from I think, Barbara, it was in the mid teens or low, mid, no mid 20s, I think low 20s.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Low 20s.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Something like that, going up to the 40% range. I think this is just the next click from a regulatory point of view, which allows us to work with those kind of companies to move up more from a transaction basis.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just to add to what I said to Sanjay a little while ago on services, why does this all matter to us. Of course there's a revenue impact in the beginning of new process, more transactions, but the most important thing is all our services are built off our core payments capability. We're not building services that don't connect back to our core payments. Those core payments require us to be able to see transactions, whether it be debit, credit, prepaid or commercial transactions. That's why VocaLink is also important. The more we see transactions, the more we can do with them, and the more we can help build yet another strong revenue stream for this company for the next decade. That's kind of what we're trying to do.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. Ajay I wanted to follow up on your comments about the constructive dialogue taking place with PayPal. First, is it reasonable to expect you that guys will, you've mentioned the staged digital wallet fee and the rationale behind it previously, but is it reasonable to expect that you guys would eliminate that now?","And then secondly, does the tone of the discussions that are taking place around you lead you to think that it's not just you guys and Visa but perhaps your issuing bank partners that may get on board with promoting PayPal? And finally along those lines, can you help us think through what the exclusivity element of the Visa agreement with PayPal would mean for MasterCard's issuing banks?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the last one first. I can tell you that I'm not clear that I understand enough about what exclusivity Visa signed with PayPal, because we're not encountering any difficulty while talking to PayPal in that space. So I don't know exactly what the nature of that exclusivity is. You got to ask PayPal or Visa, because I'm pretty clear that we've got enough good conversations going on, not just now but for a little while. Obviously there's stress between these conversations, right. I mean, our digital wallet operator rules, when they went into place in 2013 were not replicated by others. Ours were.","We made our position clear at that time that we wanted to have a clear, transparent, fair methodology in this digital wallet development. It's been sometimes good, sometimes stressful, but constructive. And my view always has been that it if PayPal wants to, or anybody else like that, a digital wallet operator wants to use to our rails of credit and debit to be able to build their own model, then they can't just use our rails when it suits them, and use another rail to go around us and the banks when it suits them. There's got to be a more constructive partnership.","So yes, we have a constructive partnership on cobranded cards that, yes we do. We've had it earlier. We've renewed it again literally yesterday. So that tells you that that partnership has depth beyond one signature or one contract with somebody or the other. But also we've all been discussing the whole aspect of how does digital wallet operator systems work.","Now, if PayPal's methodology of operation from what I've learned from their announcements of Visa, if they reflect what our digital wallet operator policies put into place, oh yeah, then any fee they make from them will go away because the fee is not meant to be there if they're doing what's in the policy. But I can tell you that that fee is de minimis. We are not trying to use a fee to get them to change their policy. The fee was used to manage through all the difficulties that their policies were creating in terms of data and transaction management.","So let's just be clear about what this is all about. This is not about forcing them to do anything. This is about our perspective of how the marketplace should develop, transparently and openly to merchants, to consumers, to banks, to PayPal and to all of us. That's what we're trying to build. So I think it's a constructive dialogue. I think PayPal is very much a part of that dialogue.","And this could all end up in a good way for the industry as a whole, for banks, as well as for networks, as well as for PayPal. But will there be changes in the dynamics of the economics for a bank versus a network versus a PayPal? Everything to do with digital changes those economics. But that doesn't mean they're bad. It's just taking out other transactions and growing in volume as well. So I have a sort of generally positive view about where this is going.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not saying there aren't \u2013 and by the way, I'm not saying there aren't hurdles along the way, there aren't roadblocks along the way. Remember, we've been talking with them for two, three years. We don't yet have an announcement to tell you of the kind of transaction that Visa has. So everybody has their own ways of approaching transactions and has their own competitive dynamic and their own way of thinking about where the strategy is going. That's actually okay in an open, competitive market. It's a good thing.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","That's very helpful, Ajay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. I just wanted to ask a couple of quick follow-up relationship questions. And so I think you've made it pretty clear that you want to work more closely with PayPal, et cetera. But from just a process perspective and as it relates to the staged wallet fee, do you have to reach some sort of agreement with PayPal or others that would be subject to that or can they just start passing through the transaction data and hence avoid the staged wallet fee?","And then I guess more importantly, as we look at the case with the merchants and the like, your prepared comments seem to indicate that you wanted to pursue an adjusted settlement, et cetera. I'm just wondering if there would be perhaps any benefit to MasterCard to open up the discussions with those groups more widely so perhaps we could address some of the issues that may be evolving out of EMV, et cetera or if you would prefer to keep those two cases separate, if you will.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So yeah. Let me take the second question first, that way I remember it better. So the second question, honestly, litigation is complicated enough without trying to broaden things. When you already have an agreement between tens of banks, Visa, MasterCard, tons of people at the other end, it doesn't pay to start broadening things. Who knows how this will go? I can't predict because there's other players who all have to come to an agreement. But we'll see. I think we made real progress and we had actually a good deal on the ground, which a previous judge signed off on. But you know what, courts decide what they do. And while we could be disappointed, we've got to abide by it. So we're going to find our way through that working with other folks. I don't think I can tell you which way that'll get resolved. I wouldn't even like to speculate on that.","The part about PayPal, I want to make sure you guys don't get focused on some staged wallet fee because that's actually not what this is about. The fee is de minimis. This not a large fee, either for us or for PayPal, by the way. That's not what this is about. It's about a set of rules and policies around what the digital wallet operator rules are. That's what this is. And could PayPal comply with those rules without some master agreement with us? Yeah, they could. But we already have agreements with them on a number of things, and they're not the only digital wallet operator out there who wants to work closer with banks and networks and merchants. My view of this is, if we can collaborate together, if we can make this easier for a consumer in the process and for a merchant in the process, that's a good thing. We should be doing it.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","And that question comes from the line of Glenn Greene of from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for squeezing me in. Most of the questions have been asked. I'll just ask Martina an easy one. The other revenue growth, the 25% revenue growth, maybe a little bit of granularity. What's sort of driving that? And is there any acquisition benefit in there, or is that at this point, you would consider that all organic?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","What did you say, 25%?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other services.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Other revenue.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Other revenue.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So from an other revenue point of view, you do have the APT acquisition in there. Most of the revenues for the APT acquisition is actually in that particular line item. But I did call out actually not only APT, I called out Advisors. So we actually had a really nice increase in revenue from an Advisors, and this is in our consulting business. And then secondly, I also called out our safety and security products, which are our fraud products and also that had a really nice increase.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","But I guess the question is the expectations going forward. How should we think about this as we normalize and get past the APT?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","First of all, I'm not going to give you individual line items, but I have said over the last few quarters that these services businesses are starting to produce the kind of growth as our core business. And actually, when you look at these line items, they're producing a little bit higher than our core businesses. So you should be seeing that continuing in some fashion.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, guys. Thank you for all your questions and I'll leave with you just a couple of closing thoughts where I started. Our business continues to perform well. You see that reflected in our strong transaction and revenue growth. We're executing well against that digital strategy. Our services are continuing to help us differentiate and win new deals.","We hope that many of you can join us at our upcoming Investor Day in New York. I think we'll be able to show you the opportunity to hear about our strategic focus areas, but also most importantly, give you a chance to experience the various spheres we're working to create a better consumer experience and shift the future of payments, give you a chance to touch and feel what we are up to.","Thank you for your continued support of the company.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Barbara Gasper. Ms. Gasper, you may begin.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Adrianna [ph]. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for a discussion about our first quarter financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer as well as Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer.","Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered for the queue.","This morning\u2019s earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. These documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week through May 8.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard\u2019s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments here today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our most recent SEC filing.","With that, I will now turn the call over to our Ajay Banga. Ajay.","Ajay Banga","Thanks, Barbara and good morning everybody. For the first quarter, we are very pleased to deliver strong results with net revenue growth of 14%. That\u2019s driven by a healthy growth in gross dollar volume, by process transactions and cross-border volume. And this, combined with our operating expense growth of 12%, is what\u2019s helped us drive EPS growth of 18%.","So as usual, let\u2019s start by the global economic trend starting with the US. Our first quarter SpendingPulse data showed US retail sales ex auto growing at 2.8%, down from the 3.9% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. And I guess that reflects the harsh winter weather conditions that affected parts of the US as well as later Easter. But on a positive note, consumers continue to spend more. And so interesting sectors like airlines, lodging, restaurants, furniture and furnishings and that reflectively increased consumer confidence we saw in the quarter.","And we\u2019ve got to continue to watch these indicators in the coming months. The good news is that despite the headwinds on consumer spending, our US business in the first quarter saw process transactions and gross dollar volume growth higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. In Europe, the environment continues along a path of slow growth with positive PPE projection for the year, although those are slightly down from last quarter\u2019s forecast.","Across the region, consumer sentiment and business sentiment have continued to improve and our MasterCard\u2019s total Europe in volume growth for the first quarter was in the mid-teens and process transaction growth in the low 20s, a bit higher than the fourth quarter, driven by growth in a number of countries including Russia, Sweden and Turkey as well as continued healthy growth in the UK.","In Latin America, the overall consumer confidence is mixed across the region. Brazil\u2019s consumer confidence starting to stabilize in March. And our SpendingPulse showed a 5.9% growth in consumer spending there, up slightly from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","In Mexico, consumer confidence also showed some signs of stabilizing and I think is expected to improve. Our business in the region continues to do well with GDV and process transaction growth for the first quarter in the mid to high teens.","In Asia Pacific, consumer confidence like in Latin American remain mixed with some evidence of a slight slowdown in consumer spending during the first quarter. But in South Korea, China and Southeast Asia, they actually saw improvement in confidence levels. Interestingly, business sentiment was up across the region.","And our business in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa continues to do well with process transaction growth about 30% and GDV growth in the high teens for the first quarter.","So overall, the US and Western Europe seem to be continuing to move along a slope up through economic recovery. While there has been increasing optimism of our Europe, I think those recent geopolitical tensions could have an impact in consumer and business sentiment. And growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, as you know, is affected by among other things, the continued global economic uncertainty but also by domestic concerns like labor market conditions and consumer sentiment and spending and elections and all of which we\u2019ll continue to watch.","So before we move on to our recent business highlights, a couple of quick words about legal and regulatory matters. First, at the end of March, the US District Court of Appeals reversed Judge Leon\u2019s July decision on the Federal Reserve implementation of the Durbin Amendment. So absent further appeal, the regulation remains as it was originally implemented by the Fed.","The appeals court decision is good for the industry for a couple of reasons, including because it clears away one of the uncertainties in the market related to EMV adoption. Second, with regards to the proposed European interchange legislation, you\u2019ve heard us say before that this legislation offers us both opportunities and challenges.","A vote by the full parliament occurred in April which added among other things the merchant card interchange to the scope of the legislation. Separately, a battle review of the legislation will start in late Feb by the Council of Ministers and the European Commission will also need to weigh in. Will actively engages all these parties, there is still opportunity for the proposed language to undergo changes and we continue to expect that adoption is probably most likely in the first half of 2015.","So finally, something about Russia and the geopolitical events going on there. Over the past few years, we have made a lot of good progress in Russia, although it represents only a little over 2% of our total revenue. The sanctions have had a significant impact in that market, not as much from an immediate financial standpoint for MasterCard but rather on the ground where the Russian government is working to implement legislation to change their domestic payments market structure.","And we are still assessing all the elements of this new law. I mean there are provisions there that I believe would create serious complications for the way that we can operate in that market. One of those provisions, these are the requirements for on-soil switching capabilities. Now with our distributed network structure as a foundation, we\u2019ve actually moved further towards an environment that can be flexible in terms of on-soil requirements.","In fact, earlier this year, we launched a 24 by 7 operation center in Russia. What we have in place today does not, I believe, meet all of the new Russian requirements, although we\u2019re still studying those, but we believe may actually provide some of the ingredients that will be necessary. We\u2019re also very concerned about the new collateral requirements in the law which we continue to look at.","At the end of the day, we\u2019re going to need to conform to this new Russian law as well as international law when we operate our business in the Russian market just as it is in other markets.","So overall, we expect a small impact from this current Russian situation on our results for 2014. But the situation is fluid and it\u2019s difficult for us to be certain numerically about the impact for 2015 and beyond, at least until the law is clearer and we can work our way through those details which will take some months to happen.","So let\u2019s move on to some of our recent business activities. During the quarter, we signed a number of new agreements that let us support the expansion of our business around the world. And let me run through a few quick examples.","SEB Baltics [ph] which is a division of the SEB group. SEB group is a key MasterCard relationship in the Nordics. And SEB Baltics [ph] is in the process of converting their entire debit and credit card portfolio to MasterCard. So as a result, we expect to be the leading payments brand in the Baltics by the end of this year.","Additionally, Svenska Handelsbanken, the second largest retail bank in Sweden was big in converting all of their consumer credit, debit, co-brand and installment card across all their market including Nordic, Baltics, UK, Netherlands and Poland. This deal actually represents the largest conversion in Europe since we won the business with Swedbank and will make MasterCard both the exclusive partner of Handelsbanken but also the leading debit brand in Sweden which, as you know, is one of the countries with the lowest use of cash in the world.","Kenya Commercial Bank, East Africa\u2019s largest bank, announced that it\u2019ll issue 5 million debit, prepaid and credit MasterCard products over the next five years. That builds in the partnerships we\u2019ve announced over the last couple of years in Kenya in both Nakumatt Supermarket and equity banks and more than doubles the number of our cards in that market.","Now as we said before, over the last several years, we\u2019ve been focused on investing in deepening our merchant relationships as well. And you\u2019ve read that Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s Club announced recently that they will start converting their co-brand credit cards to MasterCard starting this summer. And starting in early 2015, Target will be converting their Target branded credit cards to MasterCard. Additionally, their entire REDcard portfolio which adds in their private label cards will be enabled with our ENB [ph] solution and will support chip and PIN transactions in their stores.","We are delighted to be chosen, obviously, as Target\u2019s ENB [ph] solution partner and for their faith in MasterCard as quoted from their press release that they will, quote, \"aggressively move forward to bring enhanced technology with the most secure payment product available\".","In addition, we\u2019re also expanding our relationship with Wal-Mart beyond the US to work with some of their Latin American affiliates. So in Mexico, their Sam\u2019s and Suburbia co-brand cards have been converted to MasterCard, one from a competitor, the other from a private label store card.","In Chile, they\u2019ve recently started to migrate their private label cards to co-branded MasterCard and that Wal-Mart local supermarket brand is called Lider is one of the largest in that country. That\u2019s the one we are migrating.","One additional example of the progress we\u2019ve made in expanding our merchant relationships is in Japan with Amazon.com. We just recently launched a MasterCard co-brand card. That card provides the card holder an opportunity to earn rewards when shopping on Amazon\u2019s website or at any MasterCard accepting merchant as well as free shipping through Amazon Prime.","So moving on to the mobile front, the convergence in the physical and digital world is reflected in the continuing shift in payments to digital form and more interestingly, new payment flows. It represents one of the most significant changes in our space since I think the introduction of plastic payment cards many years ago. And over the last several years, we\u2019ve been developing a foundation to support this shift by establishing products, services and standards to address the needs of this new ecosystem.","So you\u2019ve heard all of us talk about many of these in the past. MasterPass digital wallet is one example. Our efforts around organization, another example. But we\u2019re beginning to build on that, and for example, last quarter, we announced our acquisition of C-SAM, a leading provider of mobile wallet software. The idea is that this would help us increase the base of the deployment of our MasterPass wallet as well as the development of additional services. Customers first take [ph] offers, for example, loyalty and rewards, for example.","So when it comes to mobile, we are technology agnostic. We support implementations based on different market models around the world. One model puts payment credentials on the phone. So for example, we recently announced the collaboration between Trevica which is our European provider of processing services. It\u2019s a business we own. And three mobile operators will represent about 80% of the mobile subscribers in Germany \u2013 Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica Deutscheland and Vodafone. Any bank in Germany that connects to Trevica will be able to provision their card to the phones provided by any of these three mobile operators.","A different model is to put payment credentials in the cloud as compared to on the phone. And for that, we will soon publish technical specs supporting what we announced a little while ago which is postcard innovation which will make it easier to roll out contactless NFC based mobile payments in markets that want alternatives to storing payment data on the phone.","For a final note, MasterPass momentum continues. We\u2019re now in seven countries \u2013 the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Italy and China with more than 40,000 merchants accepting the wallet. In addition, which I think is really interesting, MasterPass will be available soon as an in app option so that it can be selected within a mobile shopping app, eliminating the need for the consumer to have to enter payment card information of any type to make a purchase.","So with that, I\u2019m going to run it over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and on our operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck where you see the as-reported as well as the FX-adjusted growth rates. All of my comments pertain to the FX-adjusted figures which are essentially the same as the as-reported numbers due to the strength of the euro offsetting the weakness of the Brazilian real.","As Ajay said, we are very pleased with our strong performance this quarter which we were able to deliver in spite of the mixed economic environment. Net revenue growth of 14% combined with operating expenses growth of 11% resulted in net income growth of 14%.","EPS growth was 18% and share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. During the first quarter, we repurchased just over 21.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $1.7 billion. Through April 24, we purchased a little more than 6.2 million shares at a cost of approximately $450 million and we now have $1.5 billion remaining under the current authorization. We will continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.","Now turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $568 million. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, we completed an inaugural debt offering of $1.5 billion and we ended up the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.6 billion.","So let me turn to Page 4. And here you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 14% on a local currency basis. And that\u2019s essentially the same as last quarter. US GDV grew 9% and our US debit growth was also 9%, again, same as last quarter.","On the private side, after some difficult quarters in consumer credit, we are turning the corner with growth of 6%, an increase from last quarter. Also commercial credit growth was in the mid-teens, up from the low-teens last quarter. And outside of the US, volume growth was 16% on a local currency basis. And this continues to be driven by APMEA and Latin America with more than 15% growth and solid mid-teens growth in Europe.","Cross-border volume grew 17% on a local currency basis, just slightly down from the 18% growth that we saw in the fourth quarter. APMEA grew more than 20% with Europe and Latin America in the high-teens. And countries contributing to good cross-border volume growth this quarter include Australia, China, Russia, Italy and Sweden. And we also saw some deceleration in Latin America and in Canada.","Turning to Page 5, here you see process transaction. They grew almost 14% globally to more than $9.8 billion. We saw double digit growth in most regions with particular strengths in APMEA and Europe. And globally, the number of cards grew 8% to just over 2 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards.","So let me turn to Page 6 for some insights on a few of our revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 8%, while worldwide GDV grew 14%. And then the gap between these two growth rates is 6 PPT [ph] which is driven primarily by the contribution of higher growth outside the US with lower than average revenue yield. Also many of these non-US markets fall into the category of emerging markets where the growth of the ATM transactions is often higher than POS transactions.","Cross-border volume fees grew 17% in line with cross-border volume growth. And when you drill down into the detail, 10 percentage points of pricing, the majority of which lays zapped in this quarter was essentially offset by a higher mix of intra-European activity. Transaction processing fee grew 14% in line with the 14% growth in process transactions I just spoke about.","And overall, as I said earlier, net revenue growth was 14% growth both on an as-reported and FX-adjusted basis as the impact of the euro and the real offset each other. Beyond those two currencies, we had a roughly 2 PPT headwind from the weakening of other local currencies such as the Russian ruble, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the Turkish lira, mostly in the domestic assessment in cross-border revenue categories.","And moving on to Page 7; here you can see that total operating expenses were up 11% in the quarter as it continued investing back into the business. In addition, I\u2019d like to point out two other items that contributed to this growth. First, there was a 2 PPT impact due to the rebalancing of our quarterly cadence of A&M away from Q4. And second, there was an almost 2 PPT impact due to acquisition.","Also, D&A increased 19% as we begin to see the impact of our growing levels of capital expenditures. This primarily reflects investments and technology, supporting initiatives like Priceless Cities and MasterCard.","Turning to Slide 8; let\u2019s discuss what we have seen in April through this past Monday. Each of our business drivers were flat or higher compared to the first quarter. The numbers through April 28 are as follows \u2013 globally, our cross-border volumes grew about 17%, the same as our first quarter growth rate. While US cross-border was down slightly, rest abroad was a bit better driven by Europe. In the US, our processed volume grew 11%, up about 2% from what we saw last quarter due to the continued improvement in both consumer and commercial credit.","Process volume growth outside the US grew 16%. That\u2019s essentially the same as the first quarter. Our European processed volume growth was in the mid-teens; again, the same as what we saw in the first quarter despite some deceleration in Russia. And globally, process transaction growth was 14%, the same as what we saw in the first quarter.","Looking forward, let me start with our long term performance objectives for the 2013 to 2015 periods. We continue to believe that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR and at least 20% EPS CAGR over this period. These rates are on a constant currency basis and exclude new M&A activities. We also remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%.","Since we first introduced these performance targets back in September of 2012, a number of things have happened in the payments space. Three interesting and relatively recent developments are \u2013 one, while we learned about the loss of the Chase portfolio in late 2012, we are only now in the process of working through that deconversion. However, you can already see our progress on winning new deals particularly in the US consumer credit space, which shows up very nicely in our US credit metrics. Two; the current geopolitical tensions around the Russia situation. And three, the continued evolution of the European payments industry regulation.","We expect minimal impact in 2014 from either the Russia situation or the European regulation. Looking ahead, Russia will be complicated to work through. While that market currently represents a little over 2% of our revenue, it\u2019s unclear today how developments there will impact us over the next two to three years.","With respect to the European regulation, like all other regulatory actions that we\u2019ve faced over time, it will create challenges for the payments space. But as in other cases, it will also open up new opportunities for those who are innovative and competitive. And we will look for ways to take advantage of that.","We are monitoring each of these situations closely but after weighing a number of factors, we are still confident about being able to deliver on our long term commitments. That said, remember these objectives exclude M&A activities and since we\u2019ve done a number of deals, our as-reported results will include the impact of those.","So let me now share with you some more specific thoughts about 2014. Over the past several months, we have announced four acquisitions spanning the processing, mobile and loyalty spaces. Therefore, I\u2019m updating the EPS dilution in our expected as-reported results for full year 2014 from the $0.01 to $0.02 that I mentioned on our last earnings call to $0.06 to $0.08. The quarterly impact will ramp up over the course of the year and the timing of the deal closings could affect the total dilution as well as the quarterly impact. We will continue to update you as we go forward about the potential impact of any additional M&A activity.","Turning specifically to net revenue, let me highlight three points. First, Q1 growth came in a bit higher than expected; however, we are still forecasting to come in at the low end of our three-year range for full year 2014 excluding M&A and at the constant currency. That includes some small impact from the Russian situation as well as the attrition that we expect from Chase.","Second, we still have no definitive schedule from Chase and why deconversions have started a bit slower than we originally expected. We continue to believe most of the attrition will occur in the latter half of this year with some continuation into 2015. And third, our new acquisitions are expected to contribute up to an additional 1 PPT to our as-reported net revenue growth.","On the operating expense front, similar to net revenue, we haven\u2019t changed our view at all about expense growth from what we\u2019ve said in January. However, when you now add in the impact of acquisitions, the as-reported growth rate will be in the low double digits.","Growth in D&A will continue to accelerate beyond what we have seen in the past, likely in the 25% range, due to our higher level of capital expenditures as well as the impact of amortizing intangible assets related to acquisitions. As a reminder, you will need add into your models roughly $30 million over the balance of the year to account for the interest expense associated with the inaugural debt offering that we did in late March. And again for modeling purposes, you should continue to assume a full year tax rate of about 32% which does not recognize the impact of the discrete items.","And finally, with respect to FX in 2014, you need to think about it in two pieces. First, remember that when we talk about constant currency, we\u2019re talking about the impact from our functional currencies besides the US dollar. If those rates remain similar to where they are today, so that\u2019s the euro trading at the 138 level and the Brazilian real at the 224 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and the real would be a slight tailwind for the full year. As I mentioned earlier, the FX impact of these two currencies was minimal in the first quarter due to the strength of the euro offset by the weakness of the real.","Further, beyond the functional currency impact of the euro and the real, they have already seen a 2 PPT headwinds-to-net revenue growth in the first quarter from other currencies depreciating against the US dollar and the euro primarily. While we are carefully managing those exposures, we have assumed some impact for the rest of the year.","Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Martina. We\u2019re now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. In order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Go right ahead.","Dave Koning \u2013 Baird","Yeah. Good morning. And great job. I guess my question is just cross-border you mentioned the price increase that lapsed. Should we expect now if we have high-teens cross-border growth to generate high single digit revenue growth, so about a 10% a disconnect between the two for the rest of the year?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yeah. I mean, I\u2019ve said that the pricing that we have put in last April in 2013 is pretty much lapping \u2013 almost all of it is lapping at this point in time. So you should expect that what\u2019s happening between the cross-border volume fees as well as the cross-border volume growth itself should be much closer in range. The impact \u2013 it has continued to be impacted, of course, by two things \u2013 one, the mix of the intra-European travel; and two, by local currency as we\u2019re still seeing and beaconing in foreign exchange rates versus the euro and the US dollar.","Dave Koning \u2013 Baird","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Go right ahead, sir.","Daniel Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Thanks. So the question I have I guess is, the success you guys are starting to have in the current pace of kind of the co-branded card portfolios in the United States for credit, I\u2019m just wondering, how is it that you\u2019re differentiating yourself here in that environment? I know that your competitor recently announced that they\u2019re going to drop I think 50% of their operating rules, and I\u2019m just wondering, are you guys like cumbersome in that respect, are you closer to these retailers? And just generally, what is \u2013 I guess what is allowing you to differentiate yourself right now? Thanks.","Ajay Banga","So I guess \u2013 I\u2019m not quite sure what the competitors are doing in that space. We have already worked our operating rules down actually quite some time ago \u2013 a couple of months back, three, four months back, towards the end of last year. I\u2019m actually not aware of exactly what the others are planning to do, so I\u2019m not going to comment on a comparison.","But I\u2019m pretty confident that we aren\u2019t winning our business based on operating rules only. We win our business based on analytics and capabilities around those. We\u2019ve built our \u2013 we build our business based on what we do in terms of acceptance. We build our business based on the kind of marketing and co-programs we do. We build it based on relationships. We \u2013 but of course, we build it based on pricing and that\u2019s always the thing that everybody looks at.","So it\u2019s a mix of all those things. And to me, the last few periods of months when this entre issue with Target happened actually has opened a whole new set of discussions around EMV and chips and signature and PIN and tokenization, and we think that we represent a good thought process in that space. And so all these things put together I think are helping us win business.","Now, we don\u2019t win every deal we bid for, don\u2019t get me wrong. We \u2013 and these are still going to be singles and doubles. But \u2013 and I said that a year or two ago but we\u2019re doing them consistently and steadily and we\u2019ll win some, we won\u2019t win the others, but that\u2019s one of the ways for us to rebuild our position in the consumer credit business in the US in addition to what we\u2019re doing with our bank partners where we are little by little winning deals in that growth area of that credit book too. So it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag of what we are doing. I wouldn\u2019t put it all down on any one silver bullet. I wish life were that simple but it isn\u2019t.","Daniel Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from J.P. Morgan. Go right ahead, sir.","Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 J.P. Morgan","Okay, great. Thanks. Just a follow up to that last question. On the Target front, I\u2019m curious, was \u2013 did your EMV solution cause you to win that or are there other factors behind it? And then, as a follow on or a bigger picture question, do you think this EMV push could actually drive some brand flips? Thanks.","Ajay Banga","Tien-tsin, I \u2013 you will have to ask Target why they gave us all the business. But at the end of the day, again, I believe it is a mix of things. And I wouldn\u2019t rely openly on any one thing because I don\u2019t think any merchant or any bank goes based on any one item. It\u2019s the mix of things we bring to the party that allows us to win and in other times, they will lose because you don\u2019t bring the right mix to that party. So I\u2019ve kind of got my feet firmly on the ground about this issue. I \u2013 we\u2019ve got two of the largest retailers in the US between Wal-Mart and Sam\u2019s on the one end and Target now, but it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s a win one by one at a time.","So I wouldn\u2019t conclude too much either one way or the other unless you ask Target and they give you a different answer. We\u2019re just very excited to be their partner because I see in them having gone through what they\u2019ve gone through, the desire to really make a big difference. And that\u2019s useful for somebody like us who also is trying to grow in that space. So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s going on in these wins.","Will you get a chance to get more flips? I don\u2019t know yet. I honestly don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still focused on the singles and doubles and just keeping my head down and trying to win deals.","Barbara Gasper","Next question please, operator.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Donat from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Go right ahead, sir.","Christopher Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask a follow up on the Target and the chip and PIN enablement. Is that something that \u2013 in the United States, chip and PIN isn\u2019t \u2013 entering PINs is not something I think US consumers are comfortable doing. So is this more giving Target the optionality that if consumers do want that level of security they have it or is it a blanket for everything? Can you just help us understand where that fits in?","Ajay Banga","Sure. Sure. Sure. The whole EMV migration is going to depend a little bit on the manner in which this rolls out. The chip cards will definitely be coming in. I mean, look, a number of issuers are already issuing chip cards for their overseas travel. And I have \u2013 my number may be wrong in the head. It\u2019s a month or two old, but I do recollect somewhere between 6 million and 8 million cards but I might be a little off the number \u2013 already issued that are chip enabled for banks \u2013 by banks to individuals who travel. I personally use those as well. Our entire corporate card portfolio in MasterCard for our employees is chip-enabled. In some cases, it\u2019s chip and PIN like our corporate card. And in others like my personal card, its chip and signature.","The \u2013 you will find that different models of this will emerge or appear over time, depending on the adoption of PIN terminals or the point of sale, depending on the banks\u2019 concerns about different kinds of losses in their loss book and the advantages and disadvantages of those.","And then finally and most importantly, it\u2019ll depend on consumer behavior. And so it\u2019s a mix of those three. And in all these cases, while we are going to enable chip and PIN, as you know, we\u2019ve even incented for people to have chip and PIN. But at the end of the day, we will work with what works in that environment. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.","Barbara Gasper","Next question, operator.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Go right ahead.","Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Thank you, guys. Ajay, just hoping you could just drill a little bit more into the Russia legislative process to the extent you guys have some insight into some of the milestones or next steps, I think you said it\u2019ll probably be a multi-month process until it fully plays out. So if you can help us understand that a little bit. And in conjunction with that, just how are you guys sort of probability weighting some of these I guess worst case scenarios if some of these more onerous provisions actually become law? I mean, does it feel more like that\u2019s just kind of some saber-rattling or is it felt to be a very serious threat of passage into law?","Ajay Banga","Jason, I think that the whole Russia situation is all very serious. I \u2013 both at a geopolitical level and in our own small way. I don\u2019t think this is a saber-rattling situation any longer. I just \u2013 I think this is going to be tough to work for almost everybody, governments and companies, over the next few months or periods of time. It might last longer than that in one way or the other. That\u2019s just me and my personal opinion.","As far as we\u2019re concerned as a company, what we\u2019ve seen in the recent legislation that got approved by the Duma and then by the Upper House but haven\u2019t, at least until this morning, received the signature of the President, but I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s a matter of time. And somewhere over the next few days, that\u2019ll probably happen. After all, I know it could be happening now.","And therefore, I assume that that legislation will get enacted. Two of its provisions that are really interesting and complicated are the ones that I picked on and speaking and Martina picked on a little bit too. One of those has to do with the on-soil requirement. And the definition of on-soil obviously will depend \u2013 the devil is in the details of what constitutes on-soil versus what constitutes not being there. Is it just a question of data moving, is it a question of clearing, is it a question of authorizing, is it a question of settlement, is it clearing, authorizing and settlement?","There\u2019s a gazillion different \u2013 and gazillion\u2019s a technical term \u2013 but there\u2019s a heck of a lot of these different permutations and combinations that we are working our way through. I actually don\u2019t have clarity on that yet because a lot will depend on the dialog with the Central Bank of Russia which will establish the rules and the processes by which the legislation actually gets implemented on the ground.","My sense is that could take anywhere between, if done rapidly, 60 days to longer than that. Given that Russia clearly feels that they need to get something done quickly, I would expect they will make some energetic efforts to get it done quickly rather than later. It was on that context that we came around to the belief that the limitation of the impact in 2014 will be small which Martina has factored into our estimate of our revenue growth for the year which is why \u2013 one of the reasons why even though our first quarter did a little better than we thought, we\u2019re still sticking around with the guidance we gave you earlier for the year as a whole.","Now, if Russia doesn\u2019t become as onerous than that or something else changes, then life will change. But right now, we\u2019re dealing with these imponderables. And we didn\u2019t want to not acknowledge the imponderables but at the same time tell you that in our head, there is some checking balance in that system bringing us back to the guidance we already gave you earlier in the year.","That\u2019s kind of how we are thinking about it. There is another very onerous element in the legislation which has to do with the provision of collateral that will be required if somebody is considered to be a foreign payments player. Now, what\u2019s foreign? What\u2019s domestic? How do you become more domestic? Does on-soil with clearing authorization and settlement make you more domestic? Is it something else that makes you more domestic? Not clear.","So I don\u2019t know all that yet. I worry about all this because I consider myself to be a worrier and a paranoid guy about some of these things but I don\u2019t know the answer yet. So however, I don\u2019t think that will impact us directly in a financial sense as hard as could some other elements of this.","Now, the third element of this is how our consumers in the market\u2019s economy in Russia behaving. In truth, the Russian economy was already slowing over the last couple of years. That\u2019s public knowledge. And we could see it in our data where we went down from very high growth rates and transactions and revenue a couple of years ago even though we\u2019ve been growing shares in Russia over the last few years, our growth rate is reducing \u2013 reducing but still very attractive in that sense.","What we have seen in the first quarter as Martina told you was really no direct impact. Our people were doing what they had to do. I guess that\u2019s how it would be. Remember that the sanctions of all the banks, including the more recent ones, in fact, less than 1% of the cards we\u2019ve issued.","So day to day sense, people are still buying the stuff. And what we are seeing changed, however, which is about to happen is some cross-border activity \u2013 people going in, people coming out. That I expect would happen when tensions increase in an area. And I expect that to be the first impact even going out further as the Russian economy continues to get impacted by whatever goes on in the geopolitics and the reactions of the United States and Europe and other countries.","That\u2019s kind of where I am. It\u2019s a long answer. It\u2019s a complicated issue. We\u2019ve tried to drill into it and come out with the thought that some impact will happen in 2014. And probably \u201815 and \u201816, that\u2019ll have more of the impact. We\u2019ve tried to give you guidance but at the end of the day, this is a little over 2% of our revenue. But it\u2019s a good growth market, so I don\u2019t like it but it\u2019s what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to deal with.","Jason Kupferberg \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Martina Hund-Mejean","As well as at least that \u2013 when you look at the domestic value, that has been going down from a growth rate point of view, from very high growth rates last year [indiscernible] trending down given what is going on from an economic, from a pure economic point of view in Russia.","And on cross-border volume, we really haven\u2019t seen a lot of change \u2013 a little bit of trending down but not a lot of change, certainly not in the first quarter. Only very recently over the last couple of weeks we\u2019ve seen a little bit less as I said in my remarks for the April 28th numbers, we\u2019ve seen a little bit more of the growth coming down from a cross-border perspective.","Barbara Gasper","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smittipon Srethapromote from Morgan Stanley. Go right ahead, sir.","Smittipon Srethapromote \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you. My question is on there but your competitor recently spoke about weakness and debit payment volumes while your numbers seem quite robust. Do you think you\u2019re gaining share or are there any notable differences in debit exposure to call out that drove that divergence in trends?","Ajay Banga","I guess the macro side [ph] we are gaining share but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the issue for the others in truth. I know that our in debit volumes continue to remain, as I\u2019ve said, above that 400 million transactions a month which is up from the hundreds that we used to have pre-Durbin. It goes up and down by 10 million, 20 million transactions depending on where we are on the routing table of the larger retailers.","We have a very sophisticated way of comprehending where they want to pass that transaction. But that\u2019s kind of where we are.","Barbara Gasper","Next question, please.","Operator","We have our next question comes from Craig Maurer from CLSA. Go right ahead, sir.","Craig Maurer \u2013 CLSA Limited","Hey, good morning. Thanks. Regarding how we\u2019re progressing towards a mobile payments infrastructure in the US, I was wondering how discussion with banks are proceeding in terms of MasterCard, perhaps filling the role of a central token provider that can aggregate all the banks into a single token source and make it easier for a mobile rollout from someone, say, like Apple.","Ajay Banga","So as you know, Craig, we put out this whole announcement not just with MasterCard, by the way, but as an industry \u2013 Visa, AmEx [indiscernible] in their announcement about providing tokenization as a way to help protect the increasing percentage of transactions that are digital because that\u2019s where this impacts the most. While at the same time allowing the right amount of information about which card is being used, which category, which type, which institution, who issued the card to flow back and forth between the merchant and the issuer. That\u2019s the whole purpose of what we\u2019re trying to do with tokenization the way that Visa, AmEx and us are trying to do it.","It\u2019s really not suspect to us only. The discussions are proceeding. We\u2019re talking to every institution, we\u2019re talking to merchants, we\u2019re talking to banks. We\u2019ve had discussions with legislators who want to understand tokenization although that\u2019s in very early stages. As you know, there\u2019s always interest in the legislative community around the whole mobile payment space more as a way of getting aware of what\u2019s going on in the space than any other comprehension.","So that\u2019s going on even as we speak. So the dialog is usual. We\u2019re making progress in being ready to do all of these things. We are \u2013 our technological development is continuing apace and in fact, it\u2019s going to keep adding to our CapEx. That\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve got to do. We\u2019ve got to invest money in tokenization and MasterPass and we\u2019re doing it. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.","But at the same time, as I\u2019ve said in my remarks, we\u2019re also working on different ways in which the mobile payments industry will develop. It could be through secure elements, it could be through postcard innovation. And there are different levels of interest from banks, merchants and hardware and M&O [ph] providers on those two elements.","And then there\u2019s of course the more old-fashioned way of mobile payments which is really more for transfers which is the SMS or simple wallet-based transfer of money. We\u2019re playing around with all of those, from Telefonica which was more in the simple transfer of money to the conversations that you\u2019ve had \u2013 you know we\u2019ve been having with more sophisticated players who are trying out different ways of doing mobile payments. So that\u2019s the whole range.","And as I said in the past, I don\u2019t want to pick winners and losers in this. I believe that one of the things we need to do as a company is to be a strong participant in these alternative ways in which digital payments will evolve. And I actually don\u2019t know that mobile payments is the only way digital payments will evolve. It may be through wearables.","And mobility as a whole will probably be an asset. It may not be only the phone. And so we\u2019re trying to play around all of those. And between Ed McLaughlin in our emerging payments area and Garry Lyons in MasterCard Labs, we have a very strong team that is working with our core products team to try and work with as many of these different methodologies as possible.","Craig Maurer \u2013 CLSA Limited","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research. Go right ahead, sir.","David Hochstim \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes. So I wonder if you can just clarify two things in the 2% of revenues from Russia, does that include cross-border volume and then could you give us \u2013","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes.","David Hochstim \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And so that could be a high percentage of that that might not disappear?","Martina Hund-Mejean","And you said \u2013","Ajay Banga","Actually, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not a high percentage.","Martina Hund-Mejean","It\u2019s not. It\u2019s actually a relatively low percentage. And first of all, we said a little bit more than 2% of our revenues but it does include all of cross-border and it\u2019s not a very significant \u2013 it\u2019s some portion but it\u2019s not the majority. It\u2019s much less than that.","David Hochstim \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And could you just clarify what the \u2013","Ajay Banga","Dave, let me give you a hint. An overwhelming majority of the Russian revenue is domestic. How\u2019s that?","David Hochstim \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And could you just remind us what the revenue could be once the base portfolio [ph] is slowly deconverted?","Martina Hund-Mejean","No. So David, we are doing it \u2013 all of my remarks that I have done for 2014 as well as for the longer period, 2013 to \u201815, obviously takes them \u2013 takes the conversion. But we are not calling out a specific number to a specific customer.","David Hochstim \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie. Go right ahead, sir.","Kevin McVeigh \u2013 Macquarie Research","Great, thank you. Just given what seemed like a little bit of higher level rebate incentives in Q1 and obviously Q4, should we expect that to tell off the balance of the year or just pretty consistent with historical trends as well? Should we see a bit of a step down given the investments in Q1 and Q4 or still at relatively historical levels?","Martina Hund-Mejean","So Kevin, let me just set this a little bit correctly. What happened in Q4 was basically a catch-up from the prior quarters. When you look at our Q2 and Q3, in 2013 rebate [indiscernible] the numbers were relatively low and then you had a catch-up in Q4 for that. What you\u2019re now seeing in Q1 of 2014 is very similar to what you have seen in prior years. So you can actually say that 2013 was an anomaly from a quarter-over-quarter performance, not from a whole year. And now in 2014, you\u2019re going to see something very similar to 2012 \u2013 in 2014 to 2012.","Kevin McVeigh \u2013 Macquarie Research","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Go right ahead, sir.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","Thank you. I guess the accelerating GDV and process transaction growth in the United States is pretty encouraging given the backdrop. Could you just talk about what\u2019s driving that? Is it your customer engagement or is it consumer spending more? And maybe you could just talk about kind of a broader lead across to the economy. Thank you.","Ajay Banga","Hi, Sanjay. So yes, as I said, spending falls short at 2 point something \u2013 2.8% or 2.9% growth in the first quarter ex auto. As you know, it was down from the growth rate of the fourth quarter over the same quarter of the prior year. All these numbers, by the way, are not sequential quarter. They are quarter-over-quarter, same quarter prior year.","The \u2013 and that is down \u2013 by the way, the fourth quarter was down over the third quarter. So in a sense, it feels like the growth rate of consumer spending ex auto in the US felt like it was slowing over these three quarters. But interestingly, when you unpeel the first quarter, I should see two things that make me feel that we shouldn\u2019t jump to that conclusion too quickly.","And the first one has to do with the regional spending trends in the United States in the consumer spending trend. Aside from the Northeast which actually in our SpendingPulse data, declined for the total consumer spending ex auto in the Northeast. And actually, the growth rate was minus. So a little decline in the first quarter of 2014 over the first quarter of 2013. And similarly, in the mid-West where there was very bad weather, we had a small decline.","Now, a larger proportion of the US consumer spending comes from the Northeast than the mid-West. On the other hand, the Western part of the country from Seattle down to California grew very, very handsomely, almost in the double digits. And the Southwest of the country, Texas through Florida, did something similar. So when you put the whole of the United States together, the weather truly, truly did seem to have some kind of an impact because it just matches too closely to this pattern.","The second thing that was interest \u2013 and I don\u2019t yet know how to calculate the impact of it \u2013 is Easter. Easter is coming at a different time and therefore, April\u2019s numbers by and large look a little better for most of us and for the consumer spending early data that I\u2019m seeing. I haven\u2019t yet seen our new SpendingPulse data. It will come out within a few days of the 1st of May which is now, so in a few days it will emerge.","That\u2019s kind of what I know so far. So overall, I\u2019d say that the US even though the numbers at a bold [ph] level look like the growth rate is reducing, I wouldn\u2019t jump to that conclusion too quickly.","Operator","And our next question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna. Go right ahead, sir.","James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Hi. And Ajay, I wanted to follow up on the Svenska Handelsbanken win. Congratulations, I know that\u2019s a very prestigious issue. I think you had in your comments suggested it was your largest conversion in Europe since Swedbank. So I don\u2019t have to spend $10,000 for the Nielsen Report, could you give us some context on Svenska, how big are they relative to Sweden \u2013 to Swedbank? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Ajay Banga","I think you spend the 10 grand and you\u2019ve got to pay for all this people too. I\u2019ll send you my copy. How\u2019s that? I\u2019ll tell you this. I don\u2019t want to talk about a particular institution. It\u2019s not what I would do in terms of their size. But I will give you this idea.","In the Nordics, there are three of four very large institutions and you\u2019re counting \u2013 the two names you mentioned are among those three or four right on the top. The Handelsbanken is actually the second largest retail bank in Sweden. It\u2019s presence outside of Sweden in the rest of the Nordics is lower than its presence in Sweden, so it may not be \u2013 in fact, I don\u2019t think it is the second largest for the whole of the Nordics. But it is very \u2013 one of the large three or four big ones there.","But it\u2019s pretty significant for us because we\u2019ve been trying to build our share in the Nordics now for a little while partly because that\u2019s one of the markets where cash is truly not king, where electronic payments are king. And so much so that I think the estimate of cash in terms of percentage of transactions in Nordics is between 5% and 10% or even lower in some cases which makes it quite the opposite of the world which is 85% cash and checks.","And so we\u2019ve been doing well there. We were not in a great position four, five years ago. We\u2019ve actually grown ourselves nicely and that\u2019s the flavor I was trying to provide you in terms of becoming among the largest players in the Baltics and now the largest debit card in Sweden and we\u2019ve grown our share in credit and commercial and installment cards and co-brand cards and I feel generally good about where we are there.","James Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Go right ahead, sir.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Yes, hi guys, good morning. Just more details that have come out on the European regulation front, so I just want to get an update from you guys on any details on the potential challenges the MasterCard \u2013 I know you guys mentioned that is something you\u2019re highlight. So what are the kind of things that you guys are looking at that could be a challenge?","Ajay Banga","Well, there\u2019s multiple things in that legislation the way it is currently worded, although it has changed also from the original wordings and in some ways the current wording is less onerous and in others, it is more onerous. The one that came through the last round added commercial card interchange to be controlled and dictated just as consumer interchange in the current space is going to be controlled and dictated.","I actually don\u2019t like that because it \u2013 remember we are inside this legislation. The aspect of other full party [ph] schemes as well as schemes that look like full party [ph] but may not be called full party [ph] are also included. But at the end of the day, I think what really happened here and this is information gleamed more from hearsay than reality, is that my sense is that the recent work was a confused one.","The legislators actually did not believe that commercial cards should be dictated in the same way as consumer credit cards but in a mix up in the wording pattern, it got worded the wrong way. I don\u2019t know whether that will get corrected over this coming process but that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re discussing openly and transparently with the legislative community and the regulatory community in Europe.","I would like that to not be in the rules really. But beyond that, there\u2019s a bunch of other rules that had started. Remember the one about separation of management between scheme and processing. And there was this whole thing of what\u2019s constituted in separation and what\u2019s not. We\u2019re getting a little more clarity it feels like the way it looks today, but management would have to be separated, you would have to have some legal entities separated. But the holding company could be the same.","Now, that\u2019s complicated but not impossible. It\u2019s a pain in the neck but it\u2019s not impossible. And so those are the kind of things we\u2019re working our way through. Some of them have more implications for other players in the ecosystem \u2013 for merchants, for banks, for us, it kind of varies each time. And we\u2019re trying to take a balanced view for it.","I know for sure that when regulation comes in, it causes some amount of uncertainty in movement. But on the whole, what we\u2019re trying to do here is work our way through the details of it, talk to the regulators and the community there about the whole aspect of the regulation. I think they\u2019ve tried to bring in more elements around the level playing field that they\u2019re asked for. I don\u2019t know that all the elements are there yet in reference to commercial card, for example, but they are in the others.","And so kind of a mixed bag. And I\u2019m not going to go much further on this call. But I\u2019m going to work my way through it over the next six months. Remember, we\u2019re talking about first half of 2014 when this will probably get batted down. And we\u2019ve got, as you can imagine, a number of very smart people working at it in some detail.","Martina Hund-Mejean","First half of 2015, correct \u2013","Ajay Banga","2015, sorry, not \u201814. Error. 2014 is what we\u2019re in. 2015. As you can see, I\u2019m losing track of time just like advancing age.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Looking ahead.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Okay, thanks for the call.","Barbara Gasper","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Go right ahead.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.","Thank you. Ajay, I wouldn\u2019t send that Nielsen Report because I don\u2019t think Nielsen likes that. There\u2019s a very sharp word in the \u2013 so I was just wondering if you could give \u2013 with the Russia noise, if you can give an update on China and have you seen any movements there for opening up local processing in country and if you feel you\u2019re in a position if they\u2019re \u2013 if you think that other countries are going to follow what Russia is doing and when you see the effects that sanctions can have on a payments industry and on the banking industry. So if you could talk a little bit about Russia, if you\u2019re seeing any movement there.","And then at what point do you just \u2013 I mean on Russia, I think one of the terms that I saw on one of the \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what exactly what they passed but they wanted Visa and MasterCard to put up $4 billion, $3.8 billion, two days processing or something like that is \u2013 at what point do you just throw in the towel on Russia?","Ajay Banga","So I mean there are two different kind of parts there. The one about the level of collateral and as I mentioned, that\u2019s one of the issues. I actually don\u2019t think the number is what you just said. I think it\u2019s a lower number than that. But having said that, it\u2019s not a number I\u2019m interested in. So to be clear, either which way, I\u2019m not a happy boy on that one.","But, I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re going to have the discussions with the Central Bank. We are very transparently in conversation with them. It\u2019s kind of interesting on the ground in Russia, banks and their clients and merchants are still doing a lot of new things with us. And it\u2019s almost like that\u2019s continuing. We\u2019ve actually launched new things in the last three weeks with them.","And then on the other hand and having a very open, by the way, transparent discussion with the Central Bank which, as you would expect with a good regulator, you would expect that transparency of discussion. Clearly, there is a political circumstance in Russia that is driving in a different direction. This whole thing of having domestic payment schemes is not new to us. But we\u2019re dealing with it in Europe for a long time before SEPA which of course changed it.","And as you know, that\u2019s opened the doors for us there. Recently in Mexico which has always been dominated domestically by two domestic payment switches that were owned by the bank, the Mexican government has just literally \u2013 and I think it\u2019s three, four weeks ago has put out a new regulation that actually opens that space for people like us and our competitors to attempt to begin to process domestic transactions. Now it\u2019ll be a long road. Nothing happens overnight.","I mean SEPA has been one of the longest winding roads that we can think of. But it\u2019s there. We\u2019re going to go after that kind of stuff. So stuff comes in, stuff goes out. I don\u2019t know that any one incident makes that whole domestic payment switch versus foreign company being \u2013 working here whether it changes the balance greatly. Stuff comes in, stuff goes out.","People keep talking to us \u2013 we get peaks and trust [ph] of conversation around that space. And remember, within it, there are flavors. There\u2019s domestic payment switch versus on-soil processing, what constitutes on-soil as I was explaining in the earlier answer is in itself a very detailed conversation. So that\u2019s kind of the whole element there.","China, we\u2019ve continued to grow in China with the partnership that we have with China UnionPay. As you know, there\u2019s been an actually overwhelming majority of the co-brands that get issued for domestic use with the cup blub [ph] on it and for overseas travel with MasterCard on it. And that\u2019s a good thing.","We\u2019re also doing things with them on eCommerce. We\u2019re doing things with them on expanding acceptance from China and outside. But as far as the regulator is concerned, my sense is that they\u2019re actually working their way through what kind of policy they would have to open up their domestic market while ensuring that their country\u2019s needs are met and protected.","So I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll go from having a completely closed domestic market to a US kind of market. I never expected that, to tell you the truth. The question is where in the middle does it come. And honestly, I don\u2019t know enough about that. To let you know, I was there, I don\u2019t know, five, six weeks ago at the China Development Forum. When I go and speak there and I talked about a few things and I met a number of regulators. I met senior leaders there.","And my sense is they\u2019re very engaged and very open about the dialog, but they\u2019re not there yet. They\u2019re still working their way through it.","Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.","Okay, thank you.","Barbara Gasper","Sir, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Of course. And our last question will be from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Go right ahead.","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks, guys. Listen, I saw your comments on the European regulations [indiscernible] the Russian invocations chase [ph], all three of those not impacting your guidance I guess long term is helpful. I just want to be clear. First of all, that is long term, right? That\u2019s the 11% to 14% CAGR you\u2019re talking about?","And then, Martina, just as a follow up around the dilution, I guess you mentioned earlier I think from acquisitions during the year being $0.06 to $0.07 now versus $0.01 to $0.02 earlier in the year. Can you just give a little more color on what\u2019s different now than in January? Maybe you can just brand [ph] the size \u2013 the relative size of the deals?","Ajay Banga","I\u2019m from the first part and let\u2019s not do the acquisition part as well. Let me give a little clarity of what I \u2013 I want to make sure that you hear where I\u2019m coming from.","The guidance we\u2019re referring to is up 2013 through 2015. That\u2019s the guidance we have given, that\u2019s what\u2019s called our long term guidance.","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital","Right.","Ajay Banga","I believe that what\u2019s going on between Russia and the European regulation, Russia actually could be even more complicated given the level of detail we\u2019re having here as a conversation. Europe could be \u2013 some early impact, this could be negative but that could be where if we are innovative, if we are creative and if we are competitive on the ground, I continue to believe that Europe is an enormous opportunity, given that so much of Europe\u2019s expenditure outside of the Nordics is still in cash.","And I think we bring a lot of assets to the table for the European government and the European consumer and the European merchant and the European banks and the European M&Os who are now good partners of ours. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re coming from and that \u2013 we think that there\u2019s a lot of negative in this but there\u2019s a lot of positives too in a business like ours \u2013 conversion of secular trends, the market share we\u2019re winning, the deals we are doing and somewhere in there is our attempt to balance and get to the guidance that we\u2019re giving you.","It won\u2019t be easy but it\u2019s what we are committed to doing. We have in the past found our way through somewhat complicated situations. And I have some confidence that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here too.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes. So as you can appreciate, we had to do a number of scenarios that gives us the comfort that we can go to the 11% to 14% for the 2013 to the 2015 period. And that we feel comfortable that we can do that.","Now you asked your second question on the acquisitions. What\u2019s changed is what acquisitions we have made. So first of all, we had only two acquisitions, Provus and HomeSend, this is the processing play as well as the remittance play that we talked about on the first quarter \u2013 on the fourth quarter earnings call in Chile.","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital","Sure.","Martina Hund-Mejean","And those were relatively small properties. The other two that we have announced, one we have now closed, was C-SAM that already Ajay quoted in terms of the mobile platform capabilities that C-SAM brings to us. That is relatively larger property as well as Pinpoint which is the loyalty play in Australia that will allow us to actually expand our loyalty capabilities all over Asia Pacific. So both \u2013 that hasn\u2019t closed, by the way. Both of those are a little larger and that leads to the $0.06 to $0.08.","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, got it.","Ajay Banga","So I got to add. Pinpoint\u2019s also factor into Martina\u2019s thinking even though it\u2019s not closed. That\u2019s the real clarity that we want to make sure you get. And by the way, back to the earlier question to make sure you feel comfortable where we\u2019re coming from. Honestly, what made me comfortable is the fact that there\u2019s a range there. And I don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019m no crystal ball to tell you I\u2019ll end up where in that range. And I know I\u2019m going to have ups and downs. But that\u2019s what you guys invest in us for which is to stay committed to trying to get to the right market share and revenue growth. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital","All right, very helpful, guys. Thanks.","Operator","And Barbara, do you have any final remarks?","Barbara Gasper","I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Ajay for just a second.","Ajay Banga","Thanks, Adrianna [ph]. So everybody, thank you for your questions and I\u2019m going to leave you with a couple of closing parts. So we\u2019re off to a very good start in 2014. We feel good about them despite the mixed economic conditions. And I think we all believe those mixed economic conditions will probably be around for the near term.","We do have some challenges with Russia and the European payments industry regulation with the new wrinkle [ph] of commercial cards potentially being included that I just talked about. But you know what, there are opportunities too around the world which we believe give us some balance. And that\u2019s what the answer was just now in the last question about our guidance.","As Martina said, we\u2019re staying with our long term guidance. We\u2019ve continued to make good progress in winning deals around the world, including our singles and doubles in US consumer credit. We\u2019re also investing in new technology and other services. We\u2019re doing it organically. You heard about that through MasterPass and tokenization. We\u2019re also doing it through acquisitions \u2013 C-SAM which will help us scale MasterPass and other things in that space, the loyalty acquisition, Provus and processing and so on.","All of these help increase our share. They\u2019re creating new opportunities for our business. And most importantly, they\u2019re driving the conversion of our set target, our 85% cash that exists in the world. So all in all, our business continues with strong momentum. We\u2019re focused on delivering another good year. And I want to thank you all for your continued support and your consideration of what we\u2019re doing. And thank you for joining today\u2019s call.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Barbara Gasper. You may begin, Barbara.","Barbara L. Gasper","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today, either by phone or webcast, for a discussion about our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer.","Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question. This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com.","Both the earnings release and the slide deck include reconciliations of any non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalent.

Ajay?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, before Martina gets into the details of our financial results, I\u2019d like to give you some of my thoughts from another level of looking at our business. In the fourth quarter, we reported net revenue growth of 10% and that\u2019s really 12% after adjusting for currency. And that drove operating income growth of 18%, which excludes last year\u2019s special item for the litigation charge and a reported EPS growth of 21% or FX adjusted that EPS growth is 24%. So this quarter completed a solid year with performance in line with our expectations.","For the full-year 2012 reported net revenue grew 10% that number FX adjusted is 13%. The primary drivers of this will process transaction growth rates that reached the mid-20s as well as annual GDV and cross-border volumes in the mid-teens. We also delivered a reported EPS growth of 18% for the year or 22% FX adjusted.","So, now let me talk a little bit about the global environment, and I know that\u2019s on everybody\u2019s minds and let\u2019s start with the United States where we continue to see a mixed economic picture. The economy was a bit choppy in the fourth quarter with Hurricane Sandy and the fiscal cliff debate negatively impacting both consumer confidence and retail sales. Consumer confidence levels actually declined 11% over the quarter, and our SpendingPulse data showed that retail sales growth x auto decelerated each moth from October through December.","For the quarter as a whole retail sales growth x auto was up 3.9% over the prior-year from 4.2% in the third quarter, so you can see that trend between the third and fourth quarter and within the fourth quarter the monthly growth rate was decelerating. However, there were also some positive trends. So, in December consumer spending increased in 8 of the 11 retail sectors that we track in SpendingPulse with the strongest growth continuing to come from furniture, hardware associated with what we\u2019ve been saying for a while was the rebound in housing. But this December, lodging and restaurants also showed strong growth in sales.","Unemployment rates have remained steady although this morning\u2019s picture does show an increase, but this is the fourth quarter we\u2019re talking about, and we continue to see improvements in the underlying housing market. So any optimism that we have about the economy however will be tempered until we see what happens to consumer confidence and spending once these fiscal policy issues are addressed over the next few months. All in all Q4 was worst than Q3 in terms of the market in terms of consumer spending and confidence in the United States, and despite that MasterCard's fourth quarter U.S. GDV growth was 7%, which kind of is the same as what we had in the third quarter.Let's go to Europe and as you know, the region's economic environment is complicated. It's probably going to remain that way over the next few quarters. Looking first to the UK where SpendingPulse data actually showed the year's strongest retail sales growth occurred in the fourth quarter, 3.8% and consumer confidence levels have improved over all these four quarters, the last four.However, the UK economy as a whole contracted in the fourth quarter and for all we know, it may be headed for another small decline in the first quarter. If that were to happen, it would make it the third time that the UK has had a technical recession since 2008. So we expect UK consumers to remain cautious. It's still not clear to me whether the positive spending and confidence trends will continue into 2013, but the fourth quarter was interesting at a good surprise.Looking across the Eurozone, consumer confidence declined slightly, business sentiment remained weak in the fourth quarter and as you know, Northern Europe still is in a different position from some of the impacted countries in the peripheral markets. But having said all that, reflecting on how this picture impacted us in Europe, we saw solid GDV growth in the mid-teens similar to the rest of 2012, driven by the relatively stronger economies as I just said of Northern Europe, but also Eastern Europe with Poland and Russia continuing to be key contribute. We also saw, as I said a little earlier, thanks to what happened in the UK, we saw an acceleration in volume growth for the UK in the fourth quarter as well.In Asia, business and consumer sentiment is mixed across the major markets because after all, economic uncertainty in the two largest consuming markets of the U.S. and Europe will have an impact on the region. But looking ahead, however, there may actually be cause for optimism. China's GDP growth is projected to increase this year over the number of last year and frankly because of its size, that could have a positive effect on sentiment across the rest of the region. For our business in APMEA, in AP, Middle East and Africa, fourth quarter GDV process transactions and cross-border volume growth, all of them increased more than 20%. Countries like Australia, China, India, South Africa, all contributed to that growth number.So now let's talk GDP in Latin America. Annual 2012 GDP growth estimates in some of the key markets like Brazil and Mexico. As you know, we're revised down in the fourth quarter with Mexico as it is always getting impacted by U.S. economic conditions. 70%-odd of Mexico's GDP comes from in some way a collection of the United States. In spite of that, consumer sentiment across most of the regions increased. All fourth quarter GDV and transaction growth was in the mid-teens, actually a slight decline over what we saw earlier in the year but Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela remained key contributors to our growth.So given all this, overall, we have still got a cautious outlook going into 2013. There is going to be uncertainty in Europe. The U.S. could well be on a path for a slow recovery, but the fiscal policy discussions and circumstances have not been completely resolved. They could affect consumer confidence further. That would impact spending for at least the first half of the year. In the meantime, we will continue to maintain our focus on the execution of our strategy which as you know, is the displacement of cash around the world supporting financial inclusion and also obviously driving to gain share in the electronic payments space and the 15% of retail payments that are already electronic.So, some highlights from our recent business activity. We've said a couple of times now that U.S. consumer credit is an area where we probably need to place more focus. As you know, our business is not one that turns on a dime, it's got long lead lag times to sell in, but we've got some new recent wins in this area. So the first one is, we've had a good relationship with the Intercontinental Hotel Group in other regions. We have just announced now a new multiyear agreement for the United States that names MasterCard as the exclusive payment brand for the Intercontinental Hotel Group consumer credit portfolio as well as actually even more interestingly a broad range of marketing, loyalty and innovation initiatives. So that's the first one.Second one, Bass Pro Shops. As you probably know of them, they're one of America's premier outdoor merchandise retailers. They will be converting their co-brand card portfolio starting in the middle of 2013 to us from a competitor. In the fuel sector, first, we just renewed our agreement with Shell for their consumer Co-Brand Card Program, at Gold, but in addition, we\u2019ve just had another interesting opportunity in this space and we\u2019ve become the exclusive payment partner for the Fuel Rewards Network Loyalty Program. So when consumers linked any MasterCard card to this program, and make everyday purchases at a participating grocery store, restaurant, online merchant, they get extra discounts on gasoline purchases at Shell stations. And this is in addition to the Shell Co-Brand Card, which I just talked about. So that\u2019s kind of two things in the fuel space.And in November KeyBank agreed to extend the exclusivity we have on that debit and prepaid programs to now include new issuance for both their consumer credit and commercial credit portfolio. So, as you know last year\u2019s announcement with KeyBank was the added Maestro PIN debit capability to their debit and ATM programs. We also signed them up for our IPS solution for their debit and prepaid transaction processing, so this is really on to their credit side now.And last quarter SunTrust launched a new portfolio platinum in world consumer credit MasterCard\u2019s which are being made available through online, but also through their branches. So that\u2019s some movement in that space.Moving now to Canada, we announced the launch of the Royal Bank of Canada, RBC Target Co-Brand MasterCard Credit Card Program. The card is going to be available online and of course in Target stores as they open new locations across Canada in the first half of 2013. Its kind of the middle the RED Card Loyalty Program in the U.S., which as you know is co-branded by a competitor. And this then reinforce the leadership position in co-brand programs across Canada, the kind of added target to a list of major merchants there, with whom we\u2019ve got successful partnerships, Walmart, The Hudson's Bay Company, Loblaw\u2019s, the whole lot..Continuing our momentum in the U.S. commercial space, we extended our existing agreement with the U.S. Bank to include exclusivity for their Fleet and Aviation Card Programs. This agreement also includes our EMS, that\u2019s Expert Monitoring Services, Fraud Monitoring Product, and MasterCard\u2019s payment gateway for segments of their Corporate and Purchasing Card Programs. And in 2012 U.S. Bank actually became one of our top 10 commercial card issuers with all the partnership we\u2019re doing with them.We are continuing our work with governments and other partners to support financial inclusion for the underserved. So let me highlight a few examples from Africa, I\u2019ve actually I\u2019ve just come back from a trip to Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. When I was there two weeks ago, we announced an agreement with Equity Bank in Kenya, one of East Africa\u2019s largest financial institutions.We\u2019re going to be putting $5 million EMV debit and prepaid cards in the market over the next 18 months, that\u2019s probably one of the largest deals of that size in the African continent. The rollout is expected to expand to Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and South Sudan, which will make it the largest rollout of EMV payment cards in Sub-Saharan Africa. That by the way 80% of the population is un-banked and that is the target that Equity Bank has. They aim for that segment of the population. That\u2019s their history.Last quarter we lost collaboration with Comviva Technologies and Tutuka to extend financial inclusion to millions of people across Africa. Operators providing mobile money services will be able to offer prepaid cards or virtual card numbers linked to a stored value account and so then they can make purchases at any merchant that accepts MasterCard. They\u2019re also going to be able to use the service to pay bills, do fund transfers, all the things that they would like to do given the circumstances of that market. Initial focus; African countries like Kenya and Nigeria where Comviva is selling or has sold services with Airtel.We\u2019ve also been working with the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Federal Government [ph] there I 3rd (3:56) met on this trip to modernize the payments industry and introduced acceptance training workshops highlighting the benefits of accepting electronic payments for merchants. In our adviser\u2019s team joined to the Central Bank of Kenya whom I also met on this trip to develop policies to support the modernization of Kenya\u2019s retail payment system. The Central Banks policies are basically focused on increasing efficiency and encouraging interoperability rather than siloed payment improvements improving safety and increasing financial inclusion through the greater use of electronic payments. So that\u2019s what's going on there.On the mobile front they\u2019re driving ahead of the IFS developed partnerships with network operators and other companies. And it's interesting just that I was putting this number together. We have 25 initiatives around the world in just the past two years; I\u2019m not counting what you were doing earlier. In just the past two years, 2011 and 2012 we have 25 new initiatives. So, let me give you two examples of what's going on in Brazil in this space. You know we talked in November 2011 of the joint venture with Telef\u00f3nica. We announced the next phase of the JV with the rollout of a mobile prepaid product in the second quarter, consumers will be able to load money to their mobile prepaid account, make purchases, conduct P2P payments, phone top-ups and other financial transactions with their mobile phones. They're also going to be able to load cash to that account at designated refill locations which are broader than just a Telef\u00f3nica store. It includes grocery stores and newspaper kiosks.And now we've partnered with Tim, the second largest mobile network operator in Brazil and Caixa Econ\u00f3mica Federal, which is a bank issuing partner of ours to launch a mobile money program in Brazil for Tim's 69 million subscribers. So these two partnerships combined in Brazil will help us to serve almost 150 million mobile phone subscribers which is about 60% of the Brazilian mobile market.So let's talk prepaid, a couple of wins that we've had from the U.S. and Europe which I can talk about. MasterCard will become Aetna's preferred payment brand for their healthcare flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts and prepaid stored value cards such as their Aetna ValuePass cards. So these plans allow consumers, as you know, to access money in an account usually attached to a health plan to pay for eligible healthcare expenses with pre-tax dollars.In Italy, we have recently announced a deal with ENI which is one of Europe's largest oil companies to replace their loyalty card with MasterCard branded PayPass enabled prepaid and credit cards. So cardholders will be able to collect loyalty points when shopping at ENI outlets or at any other location around the world where MasterCard is accepted. ENI is planning to install PayPass terminals in their gas stations and coffee shops which is great news for us because that will make them the largest PayPass merchant in Europe when they complete this.By the way, we're now up to about 700,000 PayPass outlets around the world, up from the 400,000-odd that we had at this time last year. So this is all part of what we are trying to do with that whole space. So now let's talk China and the Middle East for affluent travelers which I think will also help us enhance our cross-border business. Let me give you a few examples. The Bank of China launched a six-month program to drive cross-border transactions using our MasterCard reward services platform. Bank of China MasterCard cardholders are earning credits for up to 10% of their purchases when they shop at luxury stores which, as you know, is a good way for the Chinese to spend money such as Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Prada, Herm\u00e8s in the UK, in the U.S. and Canada.In Bahrain, Al Baraka Bank and Nonoo Exchange launched the first platinum prepaid card in the country. The card offers access to events and destinations as there is merchant funded discounts, shopping privileges and all other kinds of premium experiences that make sense in the Bahrain market. In the UAE, we recently launched GoCash with UAE Exchange, a leading regional remittance and exchange house. So GoCash is the Middle East's first six-currency prepaid travel card. So a consumer can load up six currencies, lock down the value of their foreign currency in advance of their travels. So that's kind of what's going on around the world.Let me turn the call over to Martina for the detailed update on our financial results and all our metrics. Martina.Martina Hund-MejeanThanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone. Let me begin on page 3 of our slide deck where you will see as reported growth numbers as well as the FX adjusted growth rates. And all of my comments on this slide will pertain to the FX adjusted figures.We are very pleased with our performance this quarter, especially given the tough comps that we were up against the fourth quarter of last year. Net revenue grew 12%, driven by volume and transaction growth which also reflects the impact of the deals that we have signed over the last year.Operating expenses grew 4% and together with net revenue growth resulted in net income growth of 21% and EPS growth of 24% also benefited from our share repurchase programs.Now cash flow from operations was 866 million and we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about 5 billion. During the fourth quarter, we purchased about 1.3 million shares at an approximate cost of $613 million.Through January 25, we repurchased an additional 322,000 shares at a cost of about $165 million. And we now have $440 million remaining under the current authorization. We will continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.So let's first talk about the operational metrics for the fourth quarter and here we'll start on page 4. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 14% on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV grew 7%. Debit growth in the U.S. remains solid at 11%. And credit volumes in the U.S. grew about 2% with commercial credit growth up from last quarter in the high-teens. U.S. consumer credit improved slightly versus the last quarter, but as Ajay said, it is not where we wanted to be and we work \u2013 keep working at.Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 18% on a local currency basis, and this includes to be driven \u2013 this continues to be driven by more than 20% growth in APMEA and mid-teens growth in Europe as well as in LAC. Cross-border volume grew 17% on a local currency basis, including high-teens growth in LAC and more than 20% growth in both Europe and APMEA.Let me turn to page 5, and here you see our processed transactions were up just over 20%. And that\u2019s our sixth consecutive quarter of 20 plus percent growth. As expected, we continue to see a deceleration, which was mainly driven by the full lapping of our processing win in the Netherlands, as well as some lapping of U.S. debit wins. So, let me drill further down into the numbers and a little less than half of the 20% growth comes from new PIN debit transactions in the U.S., leaving about 12% as the underlying growth rate, very similar to the last couple of quarters. Globally, the number of cards grew 8% to 1.9 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards.Let\u2019s now turn with this background to page 6, where you can see both the fourth quarter as reported and FX adjusted growth rates for each of our revenue line items. So, let me just comment on a couple of these categories. Domestic assessments grew 9% while worldwide GDV grew 14%. The gap between these two growth rates is 5 percentage points of which 2 percentage points is foreign exchange and the remainder is driven by relatively higher growth of ATM volume in emerging markets.On cross-border volume fees, they grew actually 14%, while cross-border volumes grew 17%. The primary reason for this difference is a higher proportion of intra Europe activity, so that really means Europeans stayed closer to home and the resulting spend came with a lower revenue yield than when they travel outside of Europe.Transaction processing fees grew 15%, driven mainly by the 20% growth in process transactions. Narrowing considerably from recent quarters, the gap between these two growth rates can be attributed to U.S. PIN debit transactions that come with a lower than average revenue yield. Only a small portion of the gap is explained by foreign exchange. And finally the distribution of rebates and incentives followed relatively the same pattern as last year with fourth quarter representing slightly less than 30% of full-year 2012 total rebates and incentive amount.Let me move to page 7, where we've detailed the as reported in FX adjusted growth rates for our expense line items. So within total operating expenses you see the increase in G&A expense was primarily driven by the impact of increased salary costs as a result of hiring more people to support our growth initiatives. We ended 2012 with approximately 7500 full-time employees. The net impact of foreign exchange activity was also a factor in the G&A increase primarily due to balance sheet re-measurement. The decline in advertising and marketing expense was primarily due to the non-recurrence of certain promotions.So, let me turn now to slide 8, and let\u2019s discuss 2013 starting with an update of what we have seen for the first quarter through January 28. Globally our cross-border volumes grew about 18% and that\u2019s just slightly higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter. This was primarily driven by higher growth in our APMEA and LAC regions. In the U.S. our process volume proxy for GDV grew 6% that's just a bit lower than our fourth quarter growth, primarily due to the lapping of some debit wins. We did, however, see a slight increase in our consumer credit growth.Process volume growth outside the U.S. grew 15%, which was a bit lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter. And since all of you have a keen interest in Europe given the economic environment there, our processed volume growth there was mid-teens similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.Globally, process transaction growth was 17%, down from the 20% we saw in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by the full lapping of our Netherlands processing wins as well as some lapping of U.S. debit wins.As a reminder, with the April 1st anniversary of the U.S. regulatory change relating to debit card non-exclusivity, we expect a deceleration in our process transaction growth rate for the rest of 2013.So looking forward, let me just start first with our long-term performance objectives. We remain confident that our business can deliver in a 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR and at least 20% EPS CAGR over the 2013 to 2015 period. These growth rates are on a constant currency basis and exclude any new acquisitions.We also remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. And as we've first told you at our Investor Day last September, based on our current expectations of the economic environment, we expect that net revenue and EPS growth in the early part of this three-year period might be slightly below the 11% minimum threshold for net revenue growth and 20% for EPS growth.In later years, assuming the world would turn to a more stable environment, we believe net revenue growth could be at the higher end of the range and that could also benefit EPS growth in that particular period.Just one other comment that I would like to make about our EPS CAGR objective, which we said was based on a normalized tax rate that excludes the impact of several one-time benefits that we were able to achieve in 2012.Our 2012 normalized tax rate is 31.8% and that will result in a pro forma EPS of $21.44 which becomes the base on which you should be modeling EPS growth beyond 2012.Now, I would like to share with you a few specific thoughts about 2013. Given the current economic backdrop that Ajay just discussed, we expect net revenue growth in the first half of 2013 to be below the 10.7% currency adjusted rate that we saw in the second half of 2012.Additionally, the tough comparison to the very strong growth that we had in the first half of last year is a factor in our outlook. Given our investments and initiatives such as mobile, ecommerce and information services, our total operating expenses will continue to grow likely just a bit below the 8% currency adjusted gross rate we saw in 2012 with more money being put to use in all of the expense line items.Therefore, we may be able to deliver some operating margin expansion in 2013. The amount of any improvement will depend on both top line growth and investment opportunities that may surface during the year. For modeling purposes, you should assume a full year tax rate similar to our 2012 normalized tax rate of 31.8%.With respect to foreign exchange, assuming the euro continues to trade at the $1.35 level and the Brazilian real at the $2 level for the rest of the year, we would expect about a 1 to 2 percentage point tailwind to as reported net revenue, net income and EPS growth for full year 2013.Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?Barbara L. GasperThank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. And in order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. John? Operator, are you there?Question-and-Answer Session","OperatorThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And we have a question from Craig Maurer from CLSA. Please go ahead.Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research DivisionYeah, good morning. Regarding your comments on European cross-border, you\u2019re seeing increasing activity in intra-EU, is this a trend you expect to continue through \u201913 and should we see the applicable yield also decline with that? Thanks.Ajaypal S. BangaCraig, its tough to say. This has happened over the last two years, a couple of times when if you go back through our earnings calls, you will find there were quarters when Europeans tended to travel within Europe. I think a lot depends on their feeling of confidence. My sense is, if you look at January, most of the cross-border growth that we\u2019ve talked about, Martina was very careful to say it\u2019s come from Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, because this European issue hasn\u2019t really completely changed in January. So, I don\u2019t know yet, but I\u2019d say that its going to go through its ups and downs. Its probably a fair question, which I don\u2019t have a good answer for it.Craig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research DivisionThank you.OperatorThe next question is from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionHey, thanks guys. Just wanted to ask a question here in the U.S. with the EMV, the first EMV milestone coming up quickly in April for the acquirers, and then of course the liability shift plan for October 15, there seem to be some outstanding questions regarding how EMV will be made compatible with the multiple debit network provisions of Durbin? So, curious if you think the April deadline will hold and then could that have any impact target timelines as well? Obviously, the banks and merchants still have a lot of work to do to become EMV compliant and we\u2019ve seen in other countries planned timelines, obviously, shift to the right. And then can you just also in conjunction with that comment on whether or not there will be any material difference in your network economics in the U.S., once EMV and chip-and-PIN, if it goes chip-and-PIN actually becomes reality?Ajaypal S. BangaSo the second one first, and just I\u2019ll repeat that from past time. We do not expect a material impact to our economics just because that hasn\u2019t happened elsewhere the EMV exists and that\u2019s kind of what we have been saying through times and my thinking of that hasn\u2019t changed.Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research DivisionOkay.Ajaypal S. BangaThe first one, when we started this whole EMV journey we have said many times over that it's possible that they won't meet their deadlines, but we put these deadlines together -- together meaning through a consultative process that involve acquirers, issuers, merchants and us. And that\u2019s how we did it differently from some of the other forces out there. And I think we therefore feel that we\u2019re in it together, we\u2019re working with them. We have recently announced that we\u2019re willing to do an OpenAPI on our EMV so that the regional debit networks can also be allowed to be enabled to participate without having to build all their own technologies which may take a long time, so we\u2019re trying our very best to be flexible and thoughtful and take all the ecosystem players along. But, that\u2019s how we\u2019re planning for it. I have no way of saying will October become December or will some of the trend move but, I got to tell you our discussions are pretty productive, and the announcement that OpenAPI was greeted with enthusiasm by a number of the players, because it gives them the chance to meet deadlines and schedules and be a player in the game.Barbara L. GasperNext question.OperatorThe next question is from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein. Please go ahead.Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.Yeah, so just a couple of questions about what's happening in Europe and from a regulatory standpoint I just wanted to start with the comment about your revenue yield on cross-border transactions in Europe being held back by more travel, actually occurring within Europe. So does the lower yield on inter European transactions have anything to do with the temporary interchange rate caps that you have in Europe which could be holding back your pricing or your revenue yield in Europe and then if that is a factor, looking forward do you agree that Europe is prone to pass regulation that might include permanent interchange rate caps for cross-border transactions over there. So we\u2019d love the comments on the European dynamics.Martina Hund-MejeanRod, this is Martina. I'm going to take your first question. First of all, as we had said a number of times, there is absolutely no impact from what is happening from an interchange environment on what's happening on our fees. As we have seen a number of times over the last few years many, many times, from time-to-time depending on how the European economy unfolds, Europeans are staying closer to home. And just by the effect in terms of how our cross-border fees are set up in Europe versus when Europeans are actually traveling overseas, that's where you see a change on our yields. But it has absolutely nothing to do with the regulatory environment.Ajaypal S. BangaAt the end of the day, they are also spending in the same currency. So we have that issue as well. You don't make the money that you would make, either the issuing banks or us on the FX. There's a lot of reasons. It's not the reason that you may otherwise think. It's actually logical that you will get a lower yield because of the way those fees are set as well as the FX.As far as Europeans being prone to passing regulations, that's a politically great statement but you know better than I do that they love passing regulations. It's just the reality. So, I don't know what to do about that as an answer, other than to tell you that they will, no doubt, at some point of time, do something because they have said that in the second quarter of this year, they will likely publish some legislation on interchange.What we have been doing with them is to take a thoughtful approach on legislating interchange and to make sure that they're still serious about continuing vigorous competition in the EU's payments market which, by the way, I think is a very competitive market. Any interchange in regulations got to be carefully weighed against the now known consequences of reduced trades. We've seen it in Australia. We haven't seen the benefit of lower pricing in the U.S. going to anybody, certainly not at a gas station.So in addition, a level playing field between open four-party schemes and closed third-party schemes has got to be ensured if they want to be fair in the legislation. So, there's many aspects to this. Will they pass legislation? Yes. Will that dramatically change the industry? I don't know, but we've been through these steps earlier and we're working with them in a constructive way to help inform them while they keep in touch with us.So, we're all in it together. Ask the banks and the merchants in Europe. I still think there's an enormous amount of opportunity in Europe, just given the quantum of cash in those economies. Germany is still 80% cash; just one number, Germany itself. You can forget before you get to the Italy's and Greece's of the world. So, yes they still happen. It's one of the things we've got to deal with, but we're dealing with it.Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.Ajay, could you have some more domestic processing wins in Europe in the hopper just to complete the European picture?Ajaypal S. BangaIf it was in the hopper, I wouldn't tell you, Rod, you know that. But yes, that is definitely part of the strategy. Absolutely, 100% part of the strategy. SEPA and the payment systems directive allowed us to play that game, as you know, so we're in it. It's just that you get portions. In fact, today, we see domestic processing transactions in most of the European countries which we did not see just three, four years ago.So, we're at different stages of opportunity in different countries. It takes a little time and we're kind of growing along as we go and it's not about a bad way. We're a 50-something percentage points up over the previous period on our European domestic processing number. That's a good thing, but it's off a smaller base than what we have in the U.S. and in Brazil.Barbara L. GasperOperator, could we get on the next caller please?OperatorNext question is from Sanjay Sakhranim from KBW.Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe Bruyette & WoodsThank you. Good morning. I've got a question on the U.S. credit card market for Ajay. You've talked about some of the impacts related to the mix of your customers which may have led to underperformance over the past couple of years. But do you feel like when the tide turns, you might see the opposite and kind of how close are we to that? Thanks.Ajaypal S. BangaGreat question, Sanjay. I don't know how to answer that other than -- let me put it this way. I don't know how close we are to the tide turning because that's why I'm uncertain about the U.S. economic situation. I genuinely believe that over a period of a couple of years, the United States has the opportunity to surprise people on the upside, just given how much restructuring in the economy has happened over the last two or three years, compared to some of the economies overseas. But the whole picture hasn't come together. Yes, some restructuring has happened but the regulations are still complicated. We've got moving parts from the fiscal policies, we've got consumer confidence down 11% in one quarter did surprised me.So, those are the kind of things that I don\u2019t know where the U.S. would go, until all those forces align you can\u2019t see the North Star being the revival of consumer credit, if you know what I mean. But there is stuff going on, housing\u2019s picking up, sectors related to housing are picking up.The other part of your question, the part about our mix of customers; it\u2019s kind of the business we\u2019re in, right. So we get a lot of business from some customers who got more impacted in the downturn. They\u2019re still to come out of it, you can look at their own results and you can make your conclusions on that. But from what I feel what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re doing some very intelligent things as institutions to help revive their businesses. So, when they do revive, yes, absolutely I\u2019ll also get an opportunity to ride their revival. But I don\u2019t know when that will be, because I\u2019m not party and privy to what they\u2019re up to inside. I just see what I see. So, you see as much as I do, more or less on that one. That\u2019s the part I don\u2019t know how to answer.In the meantime, what I\u2019m trying to do, is to diversify my customer base in the U.S. and that\u2019s what takes time, but I have over the last year or two won a number of deals in the independent bank and credit union and regional bank spaces and those are helping. They\u2019re very, very helpful, we\u2019re building new partnerships and new friendships along the way and we\u2019re looking at the right co-brand portfolios whether it would be Bass Pro or the Shell and the Fuel Rewards Network, there are others that goes in the hopper.Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe Bruyette & WoodsThank you.Barbara L. GasperNext question.OperatorNext question is from David Togut from Evercore Partners.David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research DivisionThank you and good morning. U.S. commercial credit continues to drive most of your GDV growth.Barbara L. GasperDavid could you speak up just a little bit, we\u2019re having a hard time hearing you.David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research DivisionOkay. Can you hear me now?Barbara L. GasperIt\u2019s little \u2026Ajaypal S. BangaGo ahead. You were saying something like U.S. commercial credit?David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research DivisionYes, so U.S. commercial credit continues to drive most of your U.S. credit GDV growth, Visa has made a lot of investments in their U.S. commercial credit platform even though they were really years behind MasterCard. Do you see the competitive battle with Visa changing a lot in U.S. commercial credit over the next couple of years and what do you see as your main competitive advantages in this area versus Visa?Ajaypal S. BangaI always think of all the competitors in that space as being relatively good at what they do. It\u2019s a well served market, both by AmEx and Visa, quite frankly, we all do a decent job. In many ways, I think our assets hadn\u2019t completely been owned at the front end of our business to give us the results that we\u2019re now beginning to get by realigning those assets.In the meantime, we put money into improving a number of our assets over and beyond what we had, let\u2019s say, a couple of years back. So, we\u2019ve got a new version of Smart Data out there, which is one of the reasons we win these deals and that new version is actually even superior to what we had earlier. So, we feel relatively good in that space. And vis-\u00e0-vis, with the other competitors in the space, if you travel outside of the U.S. and you do not only go to certain countries where you can go to the five star hotels and the bigger restaurants, I continue to make this point, that it just takes a few people in that company to have an unfortunate experience where their card is not accepted or doesn\u2019t work for that company to feel the need to empower their employees with the cards that work everywhere and that helps us win our deal. We believe that the power of our acceptance is superior to that of others.And so between different competitors have different advantages and disadvantages vis-\u00e0-vis us. My sense is between Smart Data, between the aspects of the acceptance and then all that we do with our small business rewards and all the activity in the commercial card space, I continue to feel that we\u2019ve got some runway for growth here for a little while. Now, I don\u2019t know whether the numbers will be as high as they\u2019ve been in the past year or two. Who the heck knows that, but I\u2019m pretty confident of our advantages and our product portfolio.David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research DivisionThank you very much.Barbara L. GasperNext question.OperatorNext question is from James Friedman from SIG.James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group, LLPHi. Thank you for taking my question. Since, it\u2019s topical this week, in this month, I just wanted to ask about the introduction of fees related to the merchant litigation settlement specifically some of the surcharging that you might be seeing if any at this point? Thank you.Ajaypal S. BangaHi, James. Not seeing anything new, just happened in the 27th and so, it\u2019s been three days and I don\u2019t know that anybody has done much in that space. But remember, first of all, a number of states in the United States, do not allow this even if the settlement provides for it. So, that\u2019s kind of one thing that you\u2019ve got to factor in and there are 10 states that don\u2019t allow it, but they also represent a larger percentage of the transactions just because of the nature of those states. But beyond that, all I know is what I've seen elsewhere. And I'm kind of using that to inform my thinking. Now, every market's different and the United States is different but if you think about the U.K. or Australia or other locations where surcharging has been going on for some years, I've seen it start in some ways, fizzle out in others, continue in merchants where their competitive position allows them to do so online, ticket sellers for airlines, for example, and so on. It could well happen, but it doesn't really go to a very large extent because of the obvious consumer dissatisfaction. I mean that's the reason the rule was enacted in the first place.So, it's that idea. But in the settlement, it is allowed. On the 27th, they could go ahead. I'm sure there are a number of them considering it and doing it. Even before it started, there were discounts being offered for cash vis-\u00e0-vis cards, in a number of merchants in the U.S. So I think the picture isn't as clear as some spreadsheet would give it out to be. It is a little murky, but that's how I think about it. I think over six, seven, eight, nine months, depending where this whole litigation goes with the court and the opt outs and the like, that's when you'll be able to see where really this is going. I doubt you'll see a great deal in the early part of these days.James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group, LLPThank you, Ajay.OperatorOur next question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank, North AmericaHi, guys. Just wanted to ask about the move to EMV chip and PIN. I assume that's going to impact your debit yields since the likely move to PIN will drive lower U.S. debit revenue. So, I guess just thinking about the strategy, how do you plan to offset that debit yield revenue loss? And then second question for Martina, the pick-up you expect in net revenue growth in the range after 2013, I think you said to even potentially the high end of the range. Is that purely economic driven? I'm just trying to gauge your visibility there. Thanks.Martina Hund-MejeanYeah, Bryan, let me take both of them because we just had the question in terms of whether the move to chip and PIN is actually impacting our economics. And Ajay had said no. When we look really at other markets where we had introduced EMV over a number of years, it really does not impact our economics. Every market is obviously different, but we really don't expect anything differently in the United States.In terms of the net revenues, moving potentially higher in the higher end of the range beyond 2013; yes, it's exactly how we laid it out at the Investor Day conference back in September. The one variation that we always have to deal with is really what's going on in the economy. And as you know, we are really relating that to our growth in Personal Consumption Expenditure and we do believe that in the early part of the range of the 2013 to '15 period, that really the Personal Consumption Expenditure is a little lower than what we've seen in the last few years. And hopefully as the world normalizes, that will move up.So it's only that one particular impact. It's not the other drivers that drive our revenues, which is basically the secular trend in terms of conversion from cash and check to electronic forms in payments, nor what we are thinking in terms of participating more in that 15% share that is already converted to electronic forms of payments.Ajaypal S. BangaSo, Bryan, think of it this way. When we make targets for these years out, we kind of look at all the factors, obviously, that change our revenue; one being the PC, which Martina just explained. We think the early part of these years may be tough, but just given what the economic environment is, I should think the first half of 2013 will actually be tougher than the second half let alone out into 2014 just given what's going on in the U.S. and Europe. But once we get past that, we are doing a bunch of things strategically to grow more share in the 15%, we're doing things to participate in the 85, all that's factored into the numbers we gave you.The only variable that we see changing, which is driving the guidance we are giving you, is what we think about economic growth. The others we are still plugging along. We are putting our money into the strategy, we're doing things to grow our business, we're doing things in mobile, we're doing things in prepaid, in commercial, in credit, in debit, in biometrics, in financial inclusion. That's not changed. It's the response from the PCE that really Martina is referring to.Second, a little clarification you might think about is let me give you one of the many reasons why EMV technology implementation doesn't equal diminution of economics. We can do many transactions that don't work on a single message format. For example, where the final amount of the transaction is not fixable at the time that the transaction is authorized which by the way are some of the most interesting transactions. You leave a tip at a restaurant. You got a $300 bill. You're going to put 35 bucks hopefully or 50 bucks or 20 bucks depending on where you are in the world on the tip. That entire transaction doesn\u2019t go through in a single message. That's a little different. If you stay at a hotel. You use a rental car. Those are all different transactions to just the ones that go through very easily on single message.So, EMV what it really does, it's a card authentication methodology. It tells you when that card goes in there is a dynamic encryption on the chip, it says that's a real card. It's not one that's been counterfeited or compromised. And so that's what it's about; and that's why I would encourage you to think about this a little differently from; oh my God, that just means everything is going to hell in a handbasket due to chip-and-PIN. We\u2019ve had 20 years of experience of doing this in Europe and Asia and so we've got some history behind us when we're telling you this. I hope that helps, Bryan?Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionNow that helps. I mean, the confusion always is that the debit market has two different yields for signature and for PIN, so that will be \u2026Ajaypal S. BangaThat\u2019s got a lot to do with the nature of debit as a business where you\u2019re really in fact if you think about outside of the U.S. it doesn't have such a widespread between signature and PIN. The U.S. had a developmental pattern where signature debit went all the way to signature credit, and that's what led to the Durbin Legislation. So, this is a self-fulfilling issue. I actually think that debit per se being the money of the consumer has a different profile and being direct access from the bank has a different profile in terms of the risk profile for the merchant, the risk profile for the issuer and therefore the interchange is today going to a lower level than it did in the past.Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. Helpful, thanks.OperatorThe next question is from Glenn Fodor a private investor. Please go ahead.Glenn Fodor - Autonomous ResearchHi, good morning, it\u2019s Glenn Fodor from Autonomous Research. Thanks for taking my question. Ajay, reports said debit issuance is beginning to gain momentum in some parts of your APMEA segment. What's the story here for getting more volumes? Is it just winning new issuing business or do these countries have local government bank backed debit schemes that you'll have to compete with similar to Europe and that could impact your growth rate?Ajaypal S. BangaGlenn, I didn't hear the first part when you started out. I heard the second part. You said something's growing in Europe and you went in and out on me.Glenn Fodor - Autonomous ResearchI'm sorry, I switched to the handset. There's just been some reports out there about debit issuance is gaining momentum in some parts of Asia Pacific, Mid-East and Africa segment. So, what's the story for gaining volumes? Is it just winning new issuers or are there debit schemes like there are in Europe owned by the banks that you could win and things like that?Ajaypal S. BangaGot it, got it. That\u2019s a great question Glenn. It's doing in different ways. There are a number of countries around the world, where there are local debit schemes, but unlike the way Europe originally developed when those debit schemes were mandated to be the only ones and nobody else could compete. In most of these countries, there is actually competition between a local debit scheme either run by the government or run by the local banks and us and most of them, not true for all, but in most of them. So, what we are trying to do is to try and be sensible about all those opportunities and play there and so, you know that we only see something like 50% of our process transactions around the world through all these reasons of the kind of schemes we're talking about. But that number's been growing, thanks to SEPA, thanks to the work we've done in Brazil, thanks to the work we're doing in a number of countries around the world, but this is a continuously moving issue. And most of the emerging market countries as they see the value of payments in electronifying their environment and country, they're more and more headed down the path of saying let's make sure that we have some control of the payment environment.So, you've got to deal with them and play with them. And a number of them, they\u2019re even trying to white label what we do, to help them setup their payments network so that they\u2019re embedded in where they are, and it's not just us doing it, it's others doing it too. So, all of that actually is great, because what it's doing is it's driving the move from cash to electronic. And I\u2019d tell you, the opportunity in places like Africa, I mean, this trip this week in Africa, just reinforced everything. And in December I was out in Myanmar and of course in the developed economies of Asia. But you go to Myanmar and you see the opportunity, it's not today, maybe my successor will get a great deal of benefit over Myanmar, but I\u2019d tell you for the next 20 years, you can see the opportunity if we do this systematically with technology, with care for local governments and being sensible about the role we play and that's what we're trying to do.Glenn Fodor - Autonomous ResearchThanks, Ajay. I appreciate it.Ajaypal S. BangaSomebody ask a question, Barbara.Barbara L. GasperNext question.OperatorAnd we have a question from Ken Bruce from Bank of AmericaKen Bruce - Bank of America Merrill LynchThanks. Good morning. My question really develops on a couple of the other questions and answers that you provided specifically around the secular growth potential. I'm wondering if you're seeing any changes to that aspect of the growth potential. Maybe if you just look at the past couple of quarters, obviously the economic backdrop is being quite low and has been creating headwinds, yet you continue to grow through that and I'm wondering is it that you're seeing the secular potential accelerate here to the upside or if it's more of the market share wins that is essentially driving that growth? And how do you see that playing out? And I have a follow-up after that.Ajaypal S. BangaYeah, I don't think the secular growth potential has yet all the work we're doing. Think of the mass we're dealing again. So, we launched 5 million cards in Kenya, that's interesting, but there's like hundreds of millions of people in Africa. When you do 10 million South African social security benefit cards, that's interesting, but there are 60 million people in South Africa alone. So what happens is that you make dents in the system, but as you make the dents over a period of time, it accumulates.It's also interesting that the emerging world and the developed world are kind of moving around in terms of their PCE growth. So what's happening is with the emerging world growing faster and with their PCE growing faster, but their level of electronification being lower, when you weight the whole thing together, the damn thing still looks like 85% cash and 15% electronic, even though it isn't that way if you go by country. There's a change happening in the emerging world that's pretty quick, but the total number doesn't change.So I don't know yet. I think that's what we've got factored in, in the guidance we've given you is what we see today in that secular growth. It isn't dramatically different from the last two or three years. What drives that is urbanization, globalization, travel, middle class growth, all the stuff that we all know about. I haven't factored in huge increases from that in my revenue growth expectations. If that changes, we will talk to you again. But right now that's where we are.Barbara L. GasperOperator, we have time for one last question.OperatorOur last question is from Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.Ajaypal S. BangaJulio?Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs & Co.That's my Indian name.Ajaypal S. BangaHow are you doing?Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs & Co.I'm good. So just real quickly on the cadence of spending, Martina, can you just go through that real quickly in terms of rebates and then also add marketing through the first half and the second half of 2013?Martina Hund-MejeanWell, as you know, the rebates and incentives are all baked in what we said already about revenues, right? And I really don't expect any different cadence in what you already had seen in the last year, which was up by the way not too different from 2011. From an A&M spend point of view, so I just want to draw you back. We said total operating expenses of 2013 is expected to be just a bit below the 8% currency adjusted growth rate that we saw in 2012 and really what you should be taking this -- in all line items. So G&A, A&M as well as D&A will be impacted from that point of view. So all of those line items you should be expecting to grow in order to get to this just below 8% on a total basis.Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs & Co.Okay, that's great. And Ajay, of the 25 new initiatives that you mentioned in mobile on a global basis, what is the base technology for that? Is it NFC? Is it Tap & Pay? What are you guys looking at?Ajaypal S. BangaGood question. It's mixed. The NFC Tap & Pay kind of stuff is in a number of the markets, but actually what's also doing really well is the joint venture we had with Smart which uses a basic wallet that allows SMS-based money movement. That's what Telef\u00f3nica has, that's what we're doing with a number of people; Tim. We're doing it with Turkey, with Toxel which actually is probably out there the longest and the most effective. So, it's a mixed bag there. Julio, there's both types going on.And as I said, I'm trying to put my best into multiple places in mobile because I think that this thing will develop in different ways whether it go NFC and Tap & Go, whether it go with the SMS, what rolled the wallets out there. That's why we're so keen to put our wallet as an open wallet rather than one where we own the consumer. We want to be seen as the brand, if you will, at the bottom right-hand side of the card for a mobile payment. So we're not trying to be the brand in any other part of the card. And that's kind of what our whole perspective is in this mobile space. So, it's a mixed bag of those. But maybe the next time we meet, we can talk a little bit more about it.Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs & Co.That's great. Thank you, guys.Barbara L. GasperBefore we sign off, I think, Ajay, you've got some closing comments.Ajaypal S. BangaYeah, just thank you all for your questions and Julio, I hope you don't mind my pulling your leg about your name, but I couldn't forget that when you came on. So, let me leave you with a few closing thoughts. We just ended a great 2012. We built off the momentum we had in 2011. 2011 was an even stronger year in terms of financial performance as you know.Now 2012, good performance is good, despite the somewhat unpredictable economic circumstances and these choppy waters globally that we\u2019ve just talked about, and as you all know, consumer spending and confidence were slower in the second half of 2012 in many parts of the world. That environment continues as we enter 2013. We are all very conscious of that, we\u2019re very watchful. But we\u2019re going to keep investing in the initiative that we see having the maximum potential for our future, some of the things we just talked about between the call and the questions. These are not things that Martina and I believe, can be turned on and off like a tap. So, all in all, we haven't changed our thinking from what we said to you at Investor Day last September.We are confident about our 2013 to 2015 objectives. We do expect performance in the early part of that period to be below the range. We think growth will pick up as we go along. As I said a little while back in answer to a question, I continue to believe that the U.S. economy has the potential to outperform over the three-year period and that will have a salutary effect on global economic conditions.Meanwhile, our task is simple, relatively simple, guide our ship through these waters, stay focused on both growing share in the current electronic payments business as well as just keep investing in driving the conversion of cash through technology, but also through public private partnerships around the world and that's what we\u2019re trying to do. So, thank you for your participation. Thank you for your support and thank you for being on the call.Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect at this time."],"14046":["Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May  2, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Barbara Gasper - ","Ajaypal S.

My name is Pam, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Pam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today either by phone or webcast for a discussion about our first quarter 2012 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question.","This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, at mastercard.com. The earnings release and slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A dial-in replay of this call will be available for one week through May 9. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. With that, I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajay Banga. Ajay?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. So in the first quarter, we reported a net revenue growth as reported of 17%. Now that's driven by healthy process transaction and volume growth, and this helped to fuel net income growth of 21% and EPS growth of 25%. We continue to see some improvement in U.S. economic news, with unemployment dropping to 8.2%, a 3-year low, below the 9% we saw a year ago. Consumer confidence, while roughly flat the month, is higher than a year ago, and of course, this was offset by news the housing market has recently hit its lowest level in a decade. You've seen the ADP payroll report this morning. Having said all that, the overall trend continued to have a positive impact on total consumer retail spending, as reflected in our SpendingPulse insight, which showed that in March, U.S. consumer increased spending in all 11 retail sectors that we track. The strongest growth came from restaurants, apparel, hardware and electronics. Now this trend should continue for a sustained period of time. We're going to look for additional improvement in unemployment and a positive turn in housing prices. ","Having said all that, the strength in consumer spending as a whole also showed up in MasterCard's own U.S. GDV, which is up 14% for the first quarter. In Europe, quarterly volumes remained strong, growing 19%, slightly above the level we've actually seen over the recent quarters. Now this is driven by both strong cross-border and domestic volume growth. And similar to the last quarter, process transactions in the region were up over 40% in the first quarter as they continue to benefit from the roll-on of domestic processing in The Netherlands. And while there has been renewed concerns in the press about European consumer confidence, it's little interesting fact, it actually held steady in the Eurozone this past quarter after significant declines in the second half of 2011. It does take a few quarters before changing consumer sentiment impacts our volumes in this region. And as such, we are watching our European business very closely. ","Looking at our first quarter, we saw process volumes of Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain in aggregate continue to post growth rates in the mid-teens. New business wins, particularly in Italy and Ireland, were compensating for the slowing in Spain and Greece in these peripheral economies as they're called. Elsewhere in the world, Latin America, the Asia Pacific\/Middle East\/Africa region, volume growth remains healthy, with domestic and cross-border volume growth rates all greater than 20%. Volume growth in these regions will have difficult comparisons, particularly in the second and third quarters of 2012. Also, be mindful that any softening in the major economies of Europe or the U.S. would likely negatively impact these regions as well. But in the meanwhile, we continue to execute our business strategy. ","And the first item I want to focus on is the U.S. debit market, where we are executing well in a challenging and shifting environment. We mentioned last year that the primary element of our U.S. debit strategy post the Durbin Amendment was to maximize our presence on these cards. Before the regulations went into effect, MasterCard functionality was an approximately 25% of U.S. debit cards. Now MasterCard is enabled on about half, including 3 of the largest portfolios in the market. In addition, we estimate that our share of PIN debit transactions exceeded 20% in April, up from high-single digits last year. It's too soon to know how routing will play out longer-term. In the short term, we have roughly doubled our presence in U.S. debit cards and nearly tripled our share of U.S. PIN debit transactions. ","At this point, I usually walk through a series of business highlights from around the world. But instead, given that we are past the 1 year anniversary of both the acquisitions of DataCash and Access Prepaid, I thought it would be helpful to use this time to update you on the progress we've made with these businesses. Recall that these extend MasterCard's capabilities in the payments value chain in fast-growing categories, e-commerce and prepaid. In both cases, the integration into the MasterCard business is largely complete and behind us. We have been moving people across the businesses, as you would expect, such as Ajay Bhalla, who moved over from our Asia Pacific\/Middle East\/Africa region to run the DataCash business; and Neville Hall, MasterCard's new Global Head of Compliance, who's coming to us from the Access Prepaid business, and there are others at all levels below them. And this type of movement will continue to ensure that we build over time and integrate a culture of innovation and accountability. ","Now let me talk about each business in a bit more depth. Let's start with Access Prepaid, which we bought from Travelex in April 2011. For us to be successful in prepaid around the world, we need to have 3 core capabilities: brand, processing and program management. This Access Prepaid acquisition provides us the program management capabilities across multiple markets with a strong position in the all-important travel vertical and a position we will continue to leverage for future growth. In this past year 2011, Access Prepaid saw substantial growth. Volume on Access Prepaid cards increased roughly 25% versus 2010. And just as important, we are continuing to build a foundation for future growth. Since the end of 2010, we have entered 7 additional markets, including Germany, China, India and South Korea. In India, for example, we signed a deal with Thomas Cook, the largest money changer in that country. They will begin issuing Access Prepaid MasterCards in the second half of this year, displacing the competitive cards that they currently distribute. In Australia, we launched a multi-currency purse that can hold as many as 10 currencies. This capability allowed us to gain a foothold with National Australia Bank, which traditionally has been an issuer of a competitive cards. ","So now let's move onto our DataCash Internet Gateway business, which we purchased about 18 months back. DataCash enables acquirers to efficiently gain new business. It also helps merchants and consumers connect via e-commerce or any type of device, the personal computer, the phone or a tablet with speed, dependability and security. And as we connect more high-volume merchants and more of the world's leading acquirers together, we increase our opportunity to drive acceptance and preference for MasterCard products. Like other e-commerce gateways, DataCash handles non-MasterCard transactions as well. So even if you don't switch the transaction, which does happen as you know in many markets, we'll still see it. We have an opportunity to gain insights from the breadth of transactions we see. Similar to Access Prepaid, we are expanding the geographic reach of DataCash services, helping to drive nearly 25% transaction growth over the past year. ","Let me tell you a little bit about how we are growing this gateway services business. The first way we go to market is to sell to merchants directly, and then deliver that business to acquirers. For the past year or so, we have directly signed up several thousand merchants, including many in the travel sector. I'll give you few examples: Jetstar and Scoot, both airlines in Asia\/Pacific\/Middle East\/Africa; Arik Air in the U.K; Eurostar, the European rail operator; Volotea, a Spanish airline; South Africa. We've added these merchants to a portfolio of customers that already included marquee names like Qantas and Singapore Airlines. There have also been numerous merchants beyond the travel sector such as Groupon in Taiwan and several retailers in the U.K., including Ocado, a grocery delivery service and Sports Direct Group. That's the first way we go to market. ","The second go-to-market strategy is to white label our services for acquirers to include in their offering to merchants. So Unicredit, for example, an Italian acquirer, also a big client of ours as a bank is live with the gateway functionality and first started servicing merchants in Eastern Europe. Elavon, part of U.S. Bancorp, is also actively using our white label offering for its own newly launched gateway solution in Europe, and there are more of these in the hopper to come. The third way we go to market is to bundle our capabilities as part of another company's prepackaged e-commerce solution. So take the example of Capgemini, which as part of its consultancy business, works with large merchants to implement payment solutions. We are prepackaged in there. Finally, we are leveraging our Internet gateway capabilities to gain further entry into large and fast-growing markets to maximize our participation in those markets and their growth. So for example, the Japanese e-commerce market is the third largest in the world. DataCash have just completed integration with JCB to enable multinational merchants to accept payments on their website from JCB cardholders in Japan. ","Similar example, moving to China, which is projected to be the second-largest e-commerce market in the world by 2016. DataCash have successfully completed the integration, technical integration, with China UnionPay, which as you know, was part of our MOU with them, thereby opening cross-border e-commerce for consumers in China. We're already working with a number of large airlines and retailers, travel agencies to enable use of these services. We're also in the process of customizing our fraud system for the Chinese market. That's an area of great interest in that location. These fraud management tools actually are excellent and, as you will recall, were one of the primary reasons we purchased DataCash. They provide cross-sell opportunities to existing customers, as well as open the door with potential new customers as they address a major paying point with e-commerce merchants. And as we connect to more merchants, we increase our ability to deliver these fraud management tools, as well as other value-added services. ","So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial for the first quarter. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 3 of our slide deck, you can see that we're delivering a solid top line and bottom line results. Net revenue grew 17%, driven by strong volume and transaction growth, as well as new deals. Pricing contributed about 3 percentage points of this growth. Total operating expenses increased 14%. That resulted in an operating income growth of 20%. Bottom line, we delivered net income of $682 million, up 21% and diluted earnings per share of $5.36, up 25%. Cash flow from operations was $427 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of about $5.1 billion. ","While not shown on this chart, let me put our results in the same terms as our long-term financial objectives, which are on a constant currency basis. On that basis, net revenue growth was 19% and EPS growth was 27%. So there was a 2-percentage-point impact on each quarter from FX. Operating margin was essentially unaffected. ","On the next couple of slides, we are presenting the operational metrics for the first quarter of 2012. So let's turn to Page 4, and here you can see that worldwide growth dollar volume or GDV was up 18% on a local-currency basis, including double-digit growth in all regions. U.S. volume growth was 14%, driven by almost 21% debit growth, as a result of stronger underlying volumes, including prepaid, as well as recent signature debit wins. Credit volumes in the U.S. grew about 7%, with consumer credit growth staying steady with previous quarters in the 3 to 4 percentage range, and commercial credit posting its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. ","Outside of the United States, our volume growth was 21% on a local-currency basis, including about 23% growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific\/Middle East\/Africa and 19% growth in Europe. The growth rate of volumes outside of the U.S. were driven by strength in both MasterCard credit and debit volumes, which were up 20% and 22%, respectively. Cross-border volume grew 18% on a local-currency basis, and we saw double-digit growth in every region, including growth rates above 20% in Latin America and APMEA. In total, European cross-border volume growth was in the high-teens, consistent with previous quarters. ","Turning to Slide 5. You can see that process transactions were up 29%, and this is the highest quarterly growth rate for process transactions since we went public in 2006. The growth was primarily driven by the U.S. and Europe as we continue to see the impact of debit regulation in the U.S., as well as new deal signings in both regions. Global card growth was 9% to 1.8 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards. ","So now let's turn to Page 6, where we can discuss our revenue growth in a bit more detail. The higher volume trends that I described when discussing GDV drove domestic assessments and cross-border volume fees growth of 16% and 15%, respectively. Transaction processing fees grew 21%, driven mainly by the 29% process transaction growth. So there continues to be gap in these 2 growth rates. Also this gap is slightly smaller this quarter than it was last quarter due to pricing. If you exclude the impact of pricing, the gap actually widens to about 12 percentage points. The majority of this gap was due to the addition of transactions outside of the U.S. Recall that the incremental revenue from most of these new transactions comes at a lower-than-average revenue yield. Total revenue grew 29%, driven by the acquisition of Access Prepaid, which anniversaried at the beginning of April, as well as other non-volume-related fees. And finally, rebates and incentives increased 24%, driven by the impact of new and renewed deals, as well as strong volume growth.","Moving to Page 7 for some detail on expenses. So within total operating expenses, you see that general and administrative expenses increased 17%. 5 percentage points of this growth came from the inclusion of Access Prepaid, and the remaining 12 percentage points primarily came from the investment in strategic growth initiatives. Advertising and marketing expense was actually 3% lower than last year's first quarter, mainly due to the impact of foreign currency. And depreciation and amortization increased about 30% due to the amortization of intangible assets in Access Prepaid and increased capitalized software associated with our strategic projects. ","Turning now to Slide 8. Let's discuss 2012, starting with an update of what we have seen for the second quarter through April 28. Our cross-border volumes grew about 18% globally, in line with the growth that we saw in the first quarter. This was driven by continued healthy growth in all regions. In April, our U.S. process volume of proxy for GDV grew about 10%. This is somewhat lower than the 15% we saw in the first quarter, largely due to the impact of the extra day in the quarter, leap year, the tax refund programs that we've seen in the first quarter and the lacking of new business wins. Process volume growth outside of the U.S. was just above 16%, slightly below the 19% growth that we saw in the first quarter primarily due to the leap year. And in Europe, which I know is of particular interest to many of you, process volume growth softened slightly by a couple of percentage points. Globally, process transaction growth was about 32%, and reflects the impact of U.S. debit rule changes, as well as the continued roll-on of domestic transactions in The Netherlands. ","Based on what we see now, let me give you some thoughts for full year 2012. So we had a good start off to the year, though we do not expect the first quarter net revenue growth rate to be the run rate for the balance of the year. In addition to the items I just mentioned, which benefited Q1 versus April, there are several other factors that you should keep in mind, the anniversary of the Access Prepaid acquisition, the lapping of our April 2011 pricing and the expected timing of new and renewed deals over the balance of the year. We also have generally tougher comps in the next 3 quarters, given the very strong revenue growth we saw in the last 9 months of 2011. So while Q1 saw consumer confidence at decent levels, as Ajay told you, this is an economic indicator that we're watching very carefully, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. So you should keep this in mind as you're looking out over the rest of the year. ","Assuming the euro trades around the 130 level and the Brazilian real around the 175 level for the rest of the year, we continue to expect about a 2 to 3 percentage point headwind to as-reported net revenue, net income and EPS growth for full year 2012. Based on our current plans for 2012 strategic investments, we continue to believe that we might have an opportunity to deliver some operating margin expansion this year. However, the amount of any improvement will depend on several factors, including global economic conditions and investment opportunities that might surface during the year. Our plans currently call for G&A growing at a higher rate than advertising and marketing expense. We also expect our depreciation and amortization to grow by roughly $30 million this year as a result of our strategic investment activity. And as I said at a conference earlier this year, other income and expense should be negative for the year, driven by anticipated equity losses associated for the 2 Telef\u00f3nica JVs in Latin America, which are typical in the early stages of many JVs, especially in these new spaces. Also remember that our cash is held in extremely safe and liquid investments, which currently offer de minimis yields. ","Turning to the tax rate, we now believe that we could see a full year tax rate of around 31% versus our previous expectation of slightly below 32%. This is due to certain tax planning initiatives from which we expect to recognize some benefits that were not previously anticipated, along with a likelihood that some local tax examination could result in a onetime benefit to our 2012 full year effective tax rate. So for modeling purposes, you should not assume that all of the benefit in the tax line drops to the bottom line since we would opportunistically look to reinvest some of these savings back into the business. ","Finally, we remain focused on our objectives for the 2012 to 2013 period of a net revenue compounded annual growth rate of 12% to 14% and minimum annual operating margin of 50% and an earnings per share CAGR of at least 20%. These objectives are all on a constant currency basis and exclude any new acquisitions. Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?","Barbara Gasper","Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Pam?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I wonder -- yesterday, the federal reserve board put out some updated data on debit interchange. And I wondered if you could comment about their observation that network fees made by large issuers seem to have declined from 2009 to the end of 2011. You didn't -- obviously, you didn't talk about acquirer fees or any other pricing changes you've made. Your pricing's held up, but I just wonder if you have any comment on what the fed seems to be suggesting.","Martina Hund-Mejean","David, I'm going to take that one. First of all, as you said, the results were only released yesterday, so we're still working through the details in terms of what was really released. But when we're looking at the published network fees, there seem to be some potential disconnects in the comparisons, and we want to understand those before we draw any conclusions. So I'm going to give you a couple of disconnects that we need to understand. So first of all, the fed compared the network fees in the fourth quarter of 2011 with full year 2009. As you know, any fourth quarter is usually a high-spend quarter. So issuers will pay effectively lower fees since core fees are tiered based on volume. We can't really compare a fourth quarter to a full year, and that's one thing we're just going to have to deep dive into it more. The second thing is the fed had actually requested different categories of network fees for each of these periods. So the calculation and the comparison of the pure cost transaction is unclear. In 2011, I can tell you the fed had asked the networks to provide only off-tier [ph] settlement fees. And back in 2009, we provided all fees collected on a transaction. So therefore, the network fees that have been compared in the report might be apples and oranges. The last thing I want to tell you is that we have actually not changed our fee structures to issuers on the debit business. In fact, as you know, in every quarter, we are going after our business very surgically and opportunistically. And we're signing deals, both signature deals and PIN deals in every quarter, and quite frankly, you can see those results in our numbers today. So a lot more to clarify, but I told you as much as we know at this point in time.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wonder if you could give us a little more detail, little more color on the U.S. process transactions growth. I think you said it was above or globally above 30% in April and some benefit from the April 1 exclusivity provision. Can you give us any color on what your U.S. volume looks like in April on a process transaction basis and where you're seeing those gains?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Look, April is very similar to the first quarter, but it's a higher growth rate, right. So the growth rate in first quarter was 29%. In April, we're seeing 32%, and the growth is both benefited by what's happening in the United States, as well as The Netherlands but very, very typical trend. In the 29%, by the way, that we saw in the first quarter, we believe that a fairly significant portion probably in the neighborhood of 13 percentage points is due to new deals and really adds to what we need to be doing in the market. April is not shaping up any different, it's the same, just continue to get the business.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess my focus was more on the PIN debit business and how much that's moving the needle in April?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Again, as I said before, it's very similar to the first quarter. April is just an extrapolation for what happened in the first quarter. We're seeing more PIN business.","Ajaypal S. Banga","You just got to remember that the -- a lot of the cards that got enabled for PIN didn't get enabled in the first day of January. They kind of got enabled over the course of first quarter. So over the next 2, 3, 4 quarters, you will get moving around on the PIN debit transaction growth because you will get cards coming on, but you'll also see routing changes as merchants and acquirers respond to what issuers, networks do. So it's going to be a little bit of in and outs for the next few months, and that's how we think about it. But our first task, as we said, was to get onto these cards and be enabled on them. That's what we've been trying to do over the last few months. And our next task is to try and surgically manage as much of that routing as makes economic sense for us. That's kind of how we're approaching this business.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Question on your EMV initiative. What kind of merchant pushback are you getting, if any? And what do you see as some of the hurdles to completing the migration by the 2015 liability transfer date that you've established?","Ajaypal S. Banga","All right. So Bill, the fact is the way we went about EMV was that we actually created a consultative process with a ton of merchants, issuers and acquirers, and had them come in together and talk about what's involved in saying that EMV should happen as compared to just mandating it, which we felt would have been one way of doing it, but probably not the best way to get so many people together on the same page. And thus far, by and large, the reaction of the roadmap has kind of been sort of the same consistency of we've got to make sure that we can get this done. We've got to make sure that the investment that goes into it make sense. We've got to -- there's a lot of moving parts around how it will actually get implemented. What we did was we created a set of incentives for merchants and issuers to use the most secure verification methods, and we created a sliding scale on that security angle. So the more secure your verification as an issuer or as a merchant, the liability shifts and the incentives go towards that party. And that's what they're trying to work their way through and understand and work with. And so frankly, right now, what we've got is a good dialogue going on. At this early stage, you expect some issuers, some merchants, to go in slightly different directions, and that's what we are seeing. But in truth, when they come together, we have a healthy dialogue. They kind of come around saying, \"Makes sense, right thing to do. It gives more security.\" The question is if they're incented, it makes it easier for us to do it, all that have been factored into the way we've constructed our EMV strategy. But it's very early days, and it's going to take a few quarters to work its way through the way we actually deliver what they're going to say they will deliver.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And can you talk about how we should think about the economic impact to your P&L given that EMV economics -- our understanding is they're PIN-debit-like? How should we think about that? And that's it.","Martina Hund-Mejean","So first of all, just because by the implementation of EMV, you should not be jumping that everything goes to PIN economics. For instance, EMV has been rolled out in a significant way in Europe, and you have -- there's absolutely no difference from a signature credit PIN point of view, for instance, from a pricing. So you cannot analogize EMV everything goes to PIN pricing. It does not.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What's been the impact on the market on Visa's new merchant pricing initiative and maybe you can update us on the strategic direction MasterCard plans to take due to what Visa's doing on merchant pricing?","Ajaypal S. Banga","So Bryan, it's Ajay. And I -- in truth, you've got to ask you Visa what they see as the response from merchants to that. From our perspective, it's very early. I haven't seen much happen. There's -- remember, the first quarter was where all this is being constructed. It's really over the next few quarters, as I said, in response to an earlier question, that these routing transactions will become clearer. And as I've said a couple of times now, our focus is going to be on making sure that we operate strategically and surgically to try and keep those routings with us to the extent we can and to the extent it makes sense economically. The -- we did the same thing with getting ourselves on the back of issuers' cards. We're going to do the same thing with working with merchants and acquirers on the routing. So it's early stages. That's where it is today.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, just a quick follow-up. Any update on the mercenary exchange litigation settlement? I know we have a trial date set that's coming up here in September.","Ajaypal S. Banga","No, nothing new at all there, nothing new. No change to our views, by the way.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Over the past few quarters, we've seen obviously Huntington, Sovereign, Swedbank and then in Europe, Italy and Netherlands, and then PIN debit wins among others. I think you mentioned Italy and now Ireland actually, which sounds a little newer. Can you just help us understand the opportunity actually in Ireland? And then more longer-term and just overall, are these opportunities similar to what we've seen in The Netherlands and obviously in Italy? And how long is this runway? And then lastly, is there other conversions like the Huntington or Sovereigns that we can expect in the near few quarters?","Ajaypal S. Banga","So the fact is that we had a lower market share in some of these markets, as you know, and that's what we are basically trying to win back deals in. The Ireland deal win is the beginnings of what we hope will turn our business around Ireland, but it's going to be a 2, 3, 4, 5 year slog because typically, deals with the other banks have signed up with competitive brands for certain number of year at a time. So I kind of tend to view these as building blocks, and I tend to view our business and approach to selling in these countries as building the right relationships, bringing value to these clients and starting to win small business and the ones that have large business tie-ups with competitors, and then wait for our opportunity to get a bigger deal with them. That's true of every market around the world. What you're seeing in us in the last couple of years is an engagement with issuers and merchants both -- both financial institution issuers and non-FI issuers, as well as merchants around the world to build our position and our relationship with them. So we're in the right place, we're trying to take advantage of opportunities as they come up. It's nothing more strategic or rocket science than that. It's global fashion selling. Now, as far as what's going on in The Netherlands is concerned, The Netherlands in particular was a large, onetime switch of the way in which those transactions are processed from a local debit switch to us. Now that's giving us a lot of benefit in lap. We're working on other such things in SEPA, as a whole, in the European area, our -- actually our transactions seen are up 280% over the prior quarter, which by the way, is similar to the number in the prior quarter. The fact is we are beginning to see transactions in France and Belgium and Germany and Italy, not with the same kind of impact as The Netherlands mass movement, but we're beginning to see them. So I think we are on the spot of building our business brick-by-brick and deal-by-deal, and what we're getting is the result of that. So I wouldn't conclude that there's some dramatic thing that's going to happen tomorrow, neither would I conclude that the runway is nearing anywhere near an end. We've got a lot of market share to gain and bigger than that, we've got this whole fight against cash, which is where our real growth is coming from. So we've got both things to do here, but it's going to take years to fulfill that strategy.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess when I look at the rebates and incentive lines, I look at it relative to gross revenues. That percentage was up like 100 basis points to 25%. Can you just talk about how much of that increase was driven by wins versus renewals, and then how we should think about that line going forward?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Sanjay, first of all, a lot of this was actually driven by the volume increases that we had. So the business has increased. So obviously, with volume increases, you're paying more rebates out, and then a smaller portion of that was related to new and renewed wins. I'm not going to break that up for you. But again, yes, you didn't see an increase in this quarter. I also said in our thoughts of 2012, we -- and as Ajay was just saying, we are running after other deals. And depending on when they come through, in which quarter, you will see some changes to rebates and incentives. But I know you guys have a love for looking at rebates and incentives as a percent of growth. I -- look, in 2010, the contra as percent of growth was actually 27%. It was 25% in 2011. It's now a little higher. As you can appreciate over the last 5 to 6 years, first of all, it will jump around by year, depending on what kind of deals we do and what the volume development is in that particular year, and you have the same kind of phenomena also on the quarterly basis. So all I want to tell you with all of these is there is nothing to read into this. This is just us going after the business the right way.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan with Janney.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Can you help us quantify how much of your revenues today have already benefited from your increased penetration in the U.S. debit business as a result of Durbin? And then looking ahead, can you help us quantify what you see to be the incremental revenue you expect to pick up? I know it's hard to -- there's probably going to be a range based on your execution of getting your brand put on a lot of the issuer debit cards here in the United States. So just trying to get a revenue impact from all of these activities.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Look. I mean, the only statistics that we have from a revenue perspective out there on the debit side is that at one point in time, we told you that debit is about, what, 14% of revenues. It's a little lower at this point in time, 13% of revenues, but that's just because of how actually our overall business has been growing both in the United States on the credit side as well as overseas outside of the United States. So revenues are growing in the debit business. And as you can see from Ajay's remarks earlier this morning, we're winning very nicely both from a signature, as well as from a PIN share point of view.","Ajaypal S. Banga","I'll give you this little additional thought around this, but I'm not going to make a prediction going forward on what I think revenues could be from PIN debit because of 2 reasons. One is I don't like making those predictions and two, I'm genuinely unsure of how routing will play out over the next few quarters. So I actually haven't really got a lot of revenue built in from there in my expectations. But you have to remember the dynamics of this revenue. PIN revenue in the United States is a low-yield business. And by low, I mean substantially lower than the other yields we have. The only good deals is because they're leveraging our fixed cost infrastructure for driving this volume even though its billions of transaction incrementally. The good news is that the profit yield from these transactions is still attractive to our company. And so we look at it that way that our revenue yield will probably be small, but our profit yield will be attractive enough for us to keep going after it. But it's difficult to predict, given that we've just completed one part of the chessboard game, which is the getting ourselves on the back of the issuer cards. The second part is going on right now with the merchant acquirer incentive play. And then there will be the third part that will come in a year or 2, which will be the increase in payments towards EMV, which will also change this mix a little. So I kind of view this as interesting, nice to have, worth showing that we can bid our share on it, but kind of move from it. There's a lot more going on in our business that has greater revenue impact than just the PIN debit business in the United States.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Brien with Brown Advisory.","Patrick O'Brien","A couple of questions. Your tax rate is going down quite a bit over the years, I guess, as the earnings from lower tax jurisdictions become more important. Is that cash now trapped in low-cash, low-tax environments, or do you have a policy for repatriating it?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Okay, Patrick, it's Martina. So let me take that. First of all, yes, your observation is absolutely right. We have been working on our tax rate quite considerably. There are number of factors that you work on from a tax planning point of view, one of which is obviously which -- the one that you were referencing. You make earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. It's lower tax there to the extent you can actually lock those earnings into those jurisdictions, and then you have the whole issue of how can you bring the cash back. I have to tell you we are in a very early innings of this game. MasterCard essentially was a 2-country kind of company: United States, as well as Belgium and Europe, and we've been diversifying quite significantly from that. You might -- when you read our annual report as well as our Qs, you might be able to pick up that we've been actually trying to make sure that our Asia Pacific\/Middle East\/Africa business get recognized as such, doesn't get run back into the United States, but gets run into Singapore, where we obviously negotiated a great tax agreement with the Singaporean authorities. And over time, and this will take a long time, we will be having the benefits of those kind of structure. At this point in time, we have mostly cash sitting in the United States, as well as in Europe. We have not built up a significant amount of cash in other jurisdictions and with the way that we built up our structure for the foreseeable future, so let's say for the next few years, I see absolutely no restrictions on being able to utilize the cash wherever we need to utilize the cash in the world, be it for what we're doing at the moment from a share repurchase program point of view or, at some point in time, acquisitions.","Patrick O'Brien","You suffer a tax consequence for using that cash in a low-tax jurisdiction?","Martina Hund-Mejean","What I wanted to tell you is at this point in time, I don't have that tax consequence because we put some planning strategies in place, as well as we are only in the early innings of actually pushing earnings out to lower tax jurisdictions. So it's going to take some years to be building up cash in those lower tax jurisdictions, and then it's going to take some time for us to ever having to use those -- that cash somewhere else.","Ajaypal S. Banga","The only thing I'd add to that is think about what those jurisdictions are. We are investing a lot of time, effort and energy into building our footprint across Asia, and in Singapore is the hub of where we're putting a lot of this. And in truth, I see a lot of opportunity for growth in that part of the world over the next 2 years. So in fact, if that cash were to be there, I believe it will give us some opportunity for adding to our footprint and our franchise through an acquisitive nature of growth in that part of the world. So I think there's going to be opportunities to use that right now. We're fortunately at very early stages of this. So as Martina was trying to tell you, we are in a type of stage where we have this as an issue. We actually see this as a big opportunity for our company over the next 4, 5 years.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Donald Fandetti with Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Ajay, I just talked to the bank issuers on the card side, they clearly seem to be struggling with some regulatory issues from the CFPB and others. I'm just curious on your thoughts in the U.S. It seems like a pretty good environment for you right now. Is there anything percolating? Or do you generally feel pretty about the good environment from a reg standpoint?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Yes. Well, I -- the fact is that -- I can tell you what my perspective is as the MasterCard guy talking to these banks. I think they're all going through the early stages of trying to figure out their new P&L and its construct, given all the regulatory changes. And you know those regulatory changes extend way beyond the card business to very fundamental things and the way the money center banks are constructed, how their capital is used and what they can do with it. So I think they're all going through that phase right now. In our specific space, the fact is the payments industry probably becomes a little more interesting in terms of its capital utilization for banks over a period of time. So they have also realized, as we all have, there's an opportunity to grow there. How they grow and how they construct that growth is what they're all working their way through. So it's actually good discussion. I feel that these are discussions that are -- that changes stuff for them. But eventually, coming out of this 1 year or 2 down the road, I suspect we'll all be in a better place, and that's what I'm hoping for. So we are engaged in a constructive, practical way on payment strategy with a number of banks in the U.S. and elsewhere. That's kind of where I am right now.","Operator","And your next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just maybe focusing on credit trends. I think Martina, you said that credit trends in the U.S. remain stable. I think from a gross dollar volume perspective, they're up maybe 6%, 7% for the quarter or similar to last quarter. Rest of the world looked better, globally, it looked better. What do you think we should kind of look for, for the remainder of the year?","Martina Hund-Mejean","You asked again a good question, right. So this is always tough to do. I think you have to put it into the context of what we said about the economic environment. We are very much focused on making sure that we understand where consumer confidence is, what's happening on the unemployment rate, what's happening on housing starts. We're, obviously, feeling relatively good, what we've seen in the first quarter. But this has to persist for the rest of the year in order to have these kind of growth rates coming in. The other issue that you're going to have to think about is, look back to the last 3 quarters, in particular, the last 2 quarters in 2011. Those had already some fairly healthy rates. The credit growth in the United States in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2011 were 7 percentage -- 7% each. So I would suggest to you that there might be a bit of a tougher comparison coming in. And that's why we also said when we talked about our revenue growth, don't just take the first quarter revenue growth and chart it out for the rest of the year.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Do you think it's too early to say that this is an inflection point on the credit side? Or as you said, we have to keep on looking at that environment?","Martina Hund-Mejean","I think we have to look at it. I think it's far too early to say that there's an inflection point on the credit side.","Ajaypal S. Banga","A lot depends also on the specific institution and its appetite right now. You will see that for the last few quarters, different banks and institutions have moved differently in terms of acquiring new credit cards. Some that were very aggressive till a couple of quarters ago have slowed down. Others have moved up. I've seen that happen with a number of issuers. So I think it's still moving around, and it's connected a little bit to Don's question earlier about how the banks are looking at the payments business. So it's not -- it's a bit tough to declare this as an inflection point yet. I look at all the banks. I look at their delinquencies improving. I look at early-stage delinquencies coming down. So I think about all of that change in their portfolio. And I think about the fact that they do want to grow their revenue. But it's based on the risk appetite, but they need to get into a place, depending on how the regulatory capital needs move around and then across their entire franchise. That is happening as we speak. So tough to say it's an inflection point, but it is not in bad shape. April is the month where you see all the consumer spending. That's the time we know how April did, but 1 month does not a quarter make and does not a trend make. And I said March was a good month. 11 out of the 11 retail sectors were positive, by the way, so was February and that is not the case in January. So if that's anything to go by. Remember, February also has a little benefit of an extra day, which is 1 day out of 90 is more than a percentage point of growth for a company. So you've just got to factor all that in, and not conclude yet that we're at that inflection point. That's how I see it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Marc Lombardo with Meredith Whitney Advisor.","Marc Lombardo - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC","I just wanted to hear if there was a restatement on the split of debit and credit for Rest of World volumes and if there was, just what the motivation was around this?","Martina Hund-Mejean","I'm sorry, can you repeat that question? You were very faint.","Marc Lombardo - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC","Yes, so just wanted to hear if there was a restatement on the split of the volumes for credit and debit for the Rest of World?","Martina Hund-Mejean","I'm not sure what you mean about restatement.","Marc Lombardo - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC","So the split from fourth quarter volumes of $405 million for worldwide for credit and charge. When we look, this quarter is now $384 million for GDV.","Martina Hund-Mejean","I don't understand what he means.","Barbara Gasper","There hasn't been any restatement.","Martina Hund-Mejean","No, there hasn't been any restatement. There hasn't been any change whatsoever. Are you looking at local rates? Because you got to have to look at the volume growing in a local way not on U.S. dollar because U.S. dollar is distorted, obviously, by the foreign exchange impact. But there has been absolutely no change in terms of how we're reporting it. And look, maybe we should take that off-line, Mark. So if you can -- we can call you.","Barbara Gasper","We'll get in touch with you.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just had a question for Ajay regarding what's going on in the U.S. It seems to me that the U.S. issuers have a complete disconnect versus with merchants and the way U.S. issuers are strategizing around their rates and their product emphasis is in complete opposite of what retailers are thinking about, which is pushing large retailers to again discuss their own payment system. I was wondering how you talk to issuers about being more retailer-friendly or else this might become the type of issue that eventually comes back to kill their own business if they don't be careful.","Ajaypal S. Banga","Craig, boy, you chose to put a grenade on the table, which I'm trying to figure out what the -- so here's the thing with that. I think that this disconnect is more is made out of it than is true. At the end of the day, in most of these banks, there is -- the fact is that merchants have got one perspective in growing their revenue and their P&L. And at the other end of the pipe is the bank that's trying to grow its revenue and P&L. And all that happens is the natural tension of the 2 opposing views between these parties. I actually think a number of the banks and issuers have built reasonably good relationships with some of the big merchants over the last few years. They're doing a lot of promotions together. They're doing a lot of things together. But the fact is that the economic value of what's involved in the payment system is a constant matter of interest to merchants, as well as to the banks, and so there's always some hustling going on there. But even we ourselves have been in regular contact with a series of merchants over the last few months, and I haven't seen anything new in that dimension compared to what it used to be 1 year or 2 ago, but it's the natural tension that you're referring to between those 2 constituents of the payment system. So that's kind of what's going on there. I don't think there's anything more than that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ajay or Martina, whoever wants to take it, since the Durbin regulation went into effect, you've done a very good job of winning PIN business. But if you had to apportion the wins that you got, can you characterize for us how much of -- what percent of them were you winning, all the business -- PIN business outright versus just a portion of it being just the second mark on the card?","Ajaypal S. Banga","So we aren't at liberty unfortunately to tell you that because every single issuer is being cautious and careful in this environment about how this is explained and talked about. Remember, they don't have to reissue the cards with the brands at the back, and so everyone's on that statement right now. So unfortunately, I don't have the liberty to tell you that. We've got a mix of both. We've got a mix of deals where we are the only PIN brand at the back, and there are deals where we are an additional PIN brand at the back along with other PIN brands. I just am not at liberty to tell you what the break up is.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. Fair enough. Just switching to -- just some color on investments. It's clear you're still investing. This is what people want to see. But investors also want to be able to characterize the go-forward trajectory, the pay-off of those investments, and how it's going to contribute to revenues and margins. So can you give us perhaps a view on fiscal '13? I guess, every year has a certain amount of revenue growth that's attributable to investments that were made, say, in the last 2 or 3 years, so some of those are now going to be paying off in '13. So is the contribution of growth investments in '13 going to be, say, bigger than it might have been in '11 and '12? Or is it kind of like an average year? How should we think about your investments today and when they're going to be paying off?","Martina Hund-Mejean","So Glenn, thanks for trying on this one. Well, first of all, I mean, you obviously know that for 2012 and 2013, on a combined way of compounded annual growth rate for net revenues, we said 12% to 14%, right? So in the 12% to 14%, we obviously have to make our judgment of how much our newer investments would be contributing to the top line. And I think you have heard me lay out before, many of you heard -- that we have investments in the category that are more shorter-term investments, return investments, mid-term investments and longer-term investments. So for instance, when we invest into the commercial business or in the prepaid business, we probably get a payoff over an 18- to 24-month period. So of course, you should be seeing in 2013 some contribution of these kind of investments. Conversely, when we go to the longer-term, such as for instance, the mobile investments that we have been making, we've been very public out there that we might not be seeing a return for 4 or 5 years, okay. So we obviously wouldn't be putting a lot of that into our revenue lines for 2013. But I think that's how you're going to have to think about it. And when we put out in a public way our net revenue growth like we did for the next 2 years, the 12% to 14% is basically recognizing the investment and how it might come to fruition from a return point of view over time.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just check in on a couple of quick things on the expense trends for the year and also the joint venture losses for the rest of this year, just how to think about the seasonality of any of that? Or if there's anything unusual that you'll be rolling on, rolling off?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Well, let me take the last one first because, obviously, when you look at the other income and expense line, it will be tracking differently than what you have seen in the prior years because we are charting the investments that we are making in the joint ventures in Telef\u00f3nica in there. So you see, almost $1 million negative in Q1, which has a number of components in there, right. It's not just the Telef\u00f3nica JV. You have what's happening from an interest, income and expense point of view, et cetera. And basically, you should be taking this forward and you should be thinking about negative numbers, a bigger magnitude as the quarters go along because remember, we only started the investment in the joint venture for Telef\u00f3nica in Brazil very recently, right. So you're going to have -- you have to recognize that every quarter, we'll be investing a bit more. So this will be a negative trend. From a G&A point of view, I am not sure if I can say more. What we basically said is you will -- you should expect some growth in G&A for sure. I think we gave you a little bit of the split in the first quarter, so that you can analyze Access Prepaid, right, which was 5 percentage points out of the 17, so the 12 was kind of the baseline. You will continue to see some increase in G&A. Remember, we hired about a little over 1,000 people back in 2011, of which around 400 people or so Access Prepaid. So organic hire was 700 people. That's kind of a 12% increase on our headcount, which has to work its way through the personnel line. So, you're going to have to look at that. And then for advertising and marketing, we definitely said that, that will be a lower growth rate than G&A. It will be just slightly higher than what you see in 2012 -- in 2011, sorry.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No impact from the Olympics or anything along those lines to think about...","Martina Hund-Mejean","What you might see of us, and this why we are not giving you the quarterly cadence. We're moving some monies around, obviously, quarter-over-quarter, depending what kind of activities are happening in the world where we want to participate.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of John Williams with UBS.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick question, Ajay. I know you've mentioned a couple of times you've seen positive trends in the 11 spending categories. I just was hoping you might be able to provide a little color on what you've seen perhaps among the high-end, the luxury categories, the shift, credit versus debit, or perhaps nondiscretionary versus discretionary?","Ajaypal S. Banga","Yes. John, I haven't seen a lot of shift in credit versus debit in total because I think that's still early days, and I'm not sure that there's any great trend coming out of that yet. Actually, I haven't even seen a big shift between PIN and signature other than the fact that our own volumes, because of the PIN deals we have won over these last 2 months, are moving around a little bit. But your question is more about the market and the consumer as a whole rather than MasterCards, per se, right? So I haven't seen any great moves on that. What I would tell you is that what's really been interesting, I've been tracking SpendingPulse for the better part of 2.5 years now because I have a frequent call with some really interested parties, who take this information from us and use it as part of their decision-making process in various governmental bodies. And it's fascinating what's happened over the last 6, 8 months -- 6, 7 months ago, hardware, electronic, stuff that had to do with home improvement were actually languishing in pretty negative territory. In the last few months, that has moved to the point where now those are actually the growth areas, and that tells me that people are either using that to reinvest in renovating their homes or they're putting it into their homes that they are buying and it kind of links up with some of the things you're reading about some activity improving in home building and home buying, still not showing up in the prices of homes, but has it bottomed out. So that's the first thing I'm seeing there. The second thing I'm seeing is that in luxury goods, jewelry, fine dining, slightly different trends. Luxury goods and jewelry were doing well. Jewelry is moving around a little bit, a bit depends on festivals and stuff like that. But mostly luxury goods were doing well. Fine dining, on the other hand, has moved through cycles, where they're in great shape, and then it's taking a beating. It's actually taking a beating recently again, but casual dining and family dining has come back up on that growth rate. So it's kind of moving around on us a little bit, and I don't yet have a good trend on that aspect.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's super helpful. Just one other question on -- Martina, I think you had mentioned Europe's process volume had come down by a couple of percentage points. I just wanted to make sure you weren't specifically saying 2% or anything like that. You were just giving kind of a general direction there, right?","Martina Hund-Mejean","You're assuming?","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, correct.","Martina Hund-Mejean","Yes, yes, I was just right. Well, look, I can give you the numbers, right? So Ajay was saying 19% growth in Europe for the first quarter. When you actually do the analogous process volume calculation, as we do it, it's about 17%. So the 19% is equal to 17%, and what we are seeing in the first quarter of -- what we are seeing in April is about 15%, which is -- so it's a very healthy growth rate, let me tell you, 15%, that is a couple of percentage points below what we are seeing -- what we saw in the first quarter.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Have you directionally given what an equivalent same -- I guess, cards sales metric would be in terms of x-ing out the impact of perhaps the new portfolios that you've signed?","Martina Hund-Mejean","Well, I think, no, we have not.","Ajaypal S. Banga","No, we haven't, but I can tell you little bit. If you look at things like SpendingPulse, you can come to conclusions pretty quickly, about what's going on at the core versus new business. And very similarly in Europe, spending is actually holding up. What happens, as I've said about Europe very often, in the global days, Europe never went crazy with spending, and now there is -- they have a far more stable pattern on saving and spending in Northern Europe. Southern Europe can be a little complicated and can move a little differently from Northern Europe. In our company, it's interesting, but a majority of our European business, because of the way it was constructed from its beginning, as well as the acquisition of Europe peers that happened along the ways some years back that our predecessor have done. We've actually got a mix of volume that comes more from Northern Europe than from the Southern European countries, which actually have seen us have a more stable pattern over the course of this last year or so. Now, the other good news is we are winning deals in some of those Southern European markets. So even if Spain and Greece are slowing down, that's where the Ireland, Italy angle came from. So we've got a mix of portfolio changing, along with the nature of the business on how consumers are spending in Europe. But essentially, consumer spending as a whole in Europe is holding up, and consumer confidence as a whole in the first quarter actually held up. Now it moved differently. Germany went up. The U.K. went up. Spain and Greece went down. But Europe, as a whole, held up. That's actually public data on consumer confidence that you can get from the Nielsen guys, which I just saw again the other day. Thanks a lot for your questions.","Operator","And with no further questions in queue, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ajay Banga for closing remarks.","Ajaypal S. Banga","So let me leave you with just a few closing thoughts after those set of questions. We are off to a good start for 2012. We have made some really solid progress, particularly, as we've all been discussing in our U.S. debit business. But of course, there's more to come there. Just remember that any incremental PIN debit transaction come at a lower-than-average yield, though with good profitability and things are moving around with the routing. Remember that as Martina mentioned, our first quarter net revenue growth rate will not be a representative run rate for the balance of the year. That's because we will be faced with more difficult comparisons as the year progresses, as well as several items that lap, which by the way, contribute to the difficult comparisons, including the Access acquisition and several new business wins that we had over the course of the previous 2 years that came up with cards in this period last year. I also want to remind you that there is the potential for us to increase our level of investment, depending on how much room we have in our P&L. That room could come from things such a stronger than expected top line growth or the potential lower tax rate that Martina mentioned. There is no shortage of growth opportunities in this business, and we want to evaluate as many as we can. We will act on the ones that provide the best potential for maximizing our long-term growth and let anything left over drop to the bottom line. Net, we're working hard to deliver another good year and meet our performance objective. Thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in MasterCard.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Fourth Quarter Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Carol. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open to accept registrations.","You can access on the earnings release in the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was filed with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a currency-neutral basis and excludes special items unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents.","As a reminder, as we initiated last quarter, we've also added the table the end of both documents which provide additional information about the impact of Article 8 of the EU's recent payment regulation on our GDV and purchase volume growth rates. Our comments on the call will be on the basis of rates adjusted for these impacts. In addition, we are introducing a new name for what we previously referred to as processed transactions. Going forward, we will now refer to these as switched transactions. Our methodology for calculating this metric has not changed. We are simply changing the name to more explicitly align with the information provided, that is transaction counts that Mastercard has authorized, cleared or settled or in other words switched. This is distinct from transaction where we provided value-added processing services, such as issuer or acquiring solutions which extend our capabilities beyond switching. There is no change to our nomenclature for transaction processing fees as these include switching fees, connectivity fees as well as other processing fees.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at end of our press release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga. Ajay?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Thank you, Warren, and good morning everybody. And this is Warren's first call and as you noticed in his first call he's made the first change of changing nomenclature from processed to switch. So welcome to the place. Our business continues to perform well. We're very pleased to have delivered a strong result for the year driven by solid execution of our strategy. For the quarter, our net revenue growth was 10%, EPS growth 7% or 31% EPS when you normalize for taxes. And what those numbers mean for the full year of 2016 is we saw net revenue growth of 13% and EPS growth of 11%, or 19% when normalized for taxes.","We continue to see bright spots as well as some areas of concern in the global economy in the US. Post-election optimism remains relatively high. Consumer confidence, unemployment, wages all seem to be holding steady. It's still too early to tell what impact any new policy proposals might have on the US or other economies. But like all of you, we're expecting to see initiatives around taxation, regulation, infrastructure spending and trade. And in fact on regulation, you've all seen the recent executive order talking about taking out two regulations for every one proposed.","Turning to Europe, the economic recovery is persistent in many markets throughout the prior year, throughout 2016, led by Germany. And the prospects for this coming year of 2017 seem encouraging as economic sentiment and unemployment continue to improve. The UK appears to be stable. We're seeing continued growth in travel to the country as a result of the weaker pound, and it's going to take a few years obviously to work through the specifics of how Brexit is implemented. So, we remain watchful of the implications of that on the UK and broadly on the EU.","In Asia, we remain cautious, largely as a result of the prolonged slowdown in China. In India, the government has recently implemented a plan to address its parallel economy and to help drive the shift from cash to electronic forms of payment. Given the heavy reliance on cash in that economy, this is expected to soften consumer spending in the short term, but could well fuel economic growth and modernize the payment system in the long term.","In Australia, both consumer and business confidence remain weak. While Brazil's economy appears to be emerging slowly from a deep recession. The road to recovery for Brazil is expected to be long, as there is still political uncertainty.","So with that as the backdrop, what are we doing is to continue to focus on executing our strategy and growing our business. We're seeing double digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. We're continuing to win deals by leveraging our service offerings.","On the legal front, we received positive news yesterday regarding the judgment on our case for ten retailers in the United Kingdom representing approximately 40% of our existing damages exposure. We're delighted that the UK court found that Mastercard's interchange fees do not restrict competition, and actually are necessary for the functioning of the payment system.","So finally, on the legal side, still let me provide you with a brief update about our planned acquisition of VocaLink. We've been working with the UK competition regulator to secure approval of the transaction, and we're really pleased as they have accepted in principle our proposed solution to address their one concern regarding the LINK ATM scheme. And we're now looking forward to working with the regulator for final approval of that solution. We expect to close the transaction sometime in the spring of 2017.","So now, let's move on to a few highlights from 2016 and some of our recent business activity. Overall, 2016 was a year that had its economic and regulatory challenges, but I think we've navigated those successfully while putting significant points on the board as a result of our investments in digital, in safety and security, in data analytics, loyalty and processing. This last quarter, we continued our momentum in the US, pleased to have renewed a number of deals including SunTrust Bank for their credit, debit and commercial business, which, by the way, includes Labs as a service to help drive their innovation agenda, as well as the First National Bank of Omaha, one of the largest private banks in the US, for their credit and commercial portfolios.","In addition, we've given you several examples in the past as to how we've been extending our capabilities beyond switching into processing, back to Warren's clarification, enabling us to drive more deals and touch more transactions. This quarter, we've renewed agreements with USAA for debit card processing services and with Jack Henry & Associates to provide processing solutions for credit, debit and commercial to their more than 10,000 clients.","Outside of the US, we're continuing to make significant progress as well. In Europe \u2013 I'm just giving you a few examples by the way \u2013 in Europe, we signed Amazon for their credit co-brand business in the UK, renewed our debit agreement with ABN AMRO, one of the largest banks in the Netherlands. In Latin America, we signed a new deal with Caixa in Brazil for credit and debit, which also includes Advisor services. Additionally, we renewed agreements with Bancolombia for credit and debit with a focus on affluent, as well as with Santander in Mexico for credit, debit and commercial, and a flip of their commercial business in Brazil, while in Asia we renewed our agreement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the largest bank in that country.","Finally, while discussing these, let me touch on the domestic opportunity for China. We continue to speak with the regulators there to better understand the entry requirements, and to clarify our options and how best to approach that market. In the meanwhile, what we're doing is focusing on driving single branded card issuance. We're pleased to add Bank of China this quarter, bringing the total number of programs for single branded card issuance launched in 2016 to 44, with more than 10 banks. All of these are aimed at driving cross-border spend with the country's growing affluent segment.","So let me move on to digital. As we've often said, that this is a marathon not a sprint. But I believe we are executing well against our strategy, and have made some good progress in 2016, and starting at Masterpass, where we continue to focus on driving both user adoption and acceptance. We've talked to you about our Digital by Default strategy, which basically enables issuers to auto-enroll cardholders through their online banking app, and helps to drive scale, but at the same time keeps the issuer at the center of their consumer relationship.","We're pleased to have achieved our stated goal of enabling 80 million accounts by the end of 2016. The services have been rolled out globally with several banks, including Bank of America, Capital One, Citi, Nordea, and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. With a healthy pipeline to build on this momentum in 2017, we've also added five new Masterpass markets in 2016, bringing the total to 34. Last year, Masterpass became the first digital payment service to work across all devices and channels, which helped drive acceptance and enabled consumers to shop online, in-store, or in app using a bank-branded offering from the issuer of their choice.","So from an acceptance standpoint, we've added roughly 80,000 new merchants, bringing the total to about 340,000 for online and in-app purchases, as well as more than 6 million locations in about 80 countries that allow contactless payments. This quarter, we're pleased to announce partnerships with Dunkin' Donuts, Walgreens, Gulf Oil, Wyndham Hotels, and so on.","Last quarter, we highlighted our agreement with the Ecobank Group to roll out Masterpass QR. That's a mobile person-to-merchant service across 33 African countries. This quarter, we're building on that momentum. We've partnered with SnapScan, a mobile QR-based payment solution backed by Standard Bank in South Africa, as well as the Government of India and RBL Bank to add a combined 40,000 merchants who will now be able to accept secure digital payments quickly and without the expense of a traditional POS terminal.","So let me move on to Mastercard Send. This past year, we highlighted our partnership with Green Dot and Uber, Stripe and Lyft as well as Allstate, and how they are using the platform to make convenient and secure payments to drivers, delivery people, and claimants, among others. This quarter we added Wells Fargo Bank, who will leverage Mastercard Send for their treasury and merchant services customers.","So let's keep going a little bit with the partnerships in digital. This past year, we helped Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay and Microsoft Wallet to expand to several new countries. We've added Spain, Ireland, Poland, Russia, and Hong Kong, bringing the total to 17 markets around the globe where consumers can use one or more of these services. We also enabled several of them to allow their consumers to shop online, in-app, and check out using their same MDES tokenized login credentials at the hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where Masterpass is accepted. And by doing that, obviously this also benefited our merchant partners, as they did not have to do any additional development work to support these services.","Finally, as part of the innovation agenda, we've been looking at ways to combine digital payments with artificial intelligence to create better and more personalized experiences for consumers. And to give you an example, this past year we launched an AI bot platform, which is similar to human interaction and enables consumers to buy products via messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and check out using Masterpass.","So building on that theme of AI, we've also launched Decision Intelligence, one of our safety and security products which uses machine learning to score transactions based on an individualized risk profile in order to reduce false declines, while at the same time mitigating potential fraud.","That brings me to services. And remember, our focus on services is in delivering capabilities that connect right back to our core business, providing great value and competitive differentiation to our clients while giving us an incremental revenue stream. I think we've made significant progress in this area in the prior year. Still, let me quickly run through a few examples, starting with safety and security, which has been a key area of focus for us this past year. We continued the rollout of our leading biometric authentication product, Identity Check, fondly known as selfie pay, to 16 markets around the world, in addition to the launch of Decision Intelligence, which I just mentioned.","On the data analytics front, since the acquisition of APT, we've integrated the sales and product organizations at APT with Advisors to drive significant benefits. We've added more than 60 organizations who have subscribed to the APT platform in recurring subscription-based contracts. So in addition to McDonald's, which we mentioned in the past, we got JCPenney and Duracell in the US, Asahi Breweries in Japan, Thomas Cook in the UK. In fact, there were 28 deals in total that were additive to APT's business as usual efforts. So with assets like these, we not only deliver great insight, we're actually building even stronger relationships with our merchant partners as well.","So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone. Starting on page 3, you will see we have delivered another strong quarter. Overall, the results were in line with our expectations. However, as reported net revenues were impacted by the stronger US dollar versus our assumptions when we talked last to you in November. The figures on this chart exclude the impact of a special item.","So, here are a few highlights. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out will be on a currency neutral basis. Net revenue growth was 10% and operating expenses declined by 1%. This resulted in strong operating income growth of 23%. EPS was $0.86, up 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by our strong operating performance. Share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. As a reminder, the tax rate was much lower in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to discrete tax benefits in 2015. And when you normalize for that in both periods, Ajay already told you that the EPS growth was 31% for the quarter. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion.","So, let me turn to page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV growth, was 9% on a local currency basis, down 2 PPT from last quarter, primarily driven by the rolloff of one agreement in the US and lower cash volume in India. As a result of the government's initiative in India that Ajay already mentioned, ATM cash withdrawals in the short term have declined more than the growth that we saw in purchase volumes. However, purchase volumes in India was up significantly, 75% year over year, and over time, these volumes are expected to continue to ramp as acceptance grows.","US GDV grew 3%, made up of credit and debit growth of 4% and 1%, respectively. And outside of the US, volume growth was 11%. Cross-border volume grew 13% on a local currency basis, up 1 PPT from the 12% we saw in the third quarter.","Turning to page 5. Switched transactions grew 17% globally to $15.2 billion with double digit growth in all regions other than the US. Globally, there are 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued.","Let me turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items, again described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Net revenue growth was 10%, driven by an increase in switched transactions, domestic and cross-border volume, as well as utilization of our services offerings. Rebates and incentives grew 21%, reflecting higher volumes and increased incentives for new and renewed deals.","Looking quickly at the individual line items for revenue. Domestic assessments grew 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 9%, the difference being primarily due to unfavorable mix. Cross-border volume fees grew 10% while cross-border volume grew 13%. The 3 PPT gap is mostly due to higher intra-Europe growth. Transaction processing fees grew 17%, in line with the 17% growth we saw in switched transactions. And finally, other revenue grew 20%, driven primarily by Advisors and our safety and securities services.","On page 7, you can see that expenses remained generally steady in each subcategory. Excluding the special item, total operating expenses declined 1% on a currency-neutral basis with ongoing cost management activities offsetting our continued investments in strategic initiatives.","So I'm going to turn now to slide 8 and let's discuss what we have seen in January through January 28, where most of our drivers are slightly better when compared to Q4. The numbers through January 28 are as follows. Starting with switched volume, we saw global growth of 10%. That's similar to the 10% growth we saw in the fourth quarter, with double digit growth in each region outside the US. In the US, switched volume grew 3%, down less than 1 PPT from the fourth quarter, with higher growth in credit programs, but lower growth in debit programs. Gas had slightly less than a 1 PPT positive impact to our January growth.","Switched volume outside the US grew 18%, up 1 PPT from the fourth quarter, with higher growth in each region. Globally, switched transactions growth was 19 %, up 2 PPT from what we saw in the fourth quarter, primarily due to growth in India, Brazil, Venezuela and Russia. Switched transaction growth outside the US was up 3 PPT, while the US growth was similar to Q4. With respect to cross-border, volumes grew 14% globally, slightly higher than the fourth quarter.","Turning to our performance objectives for 2016 to 2018, we continue to expect to grow net revenue CAGR at a low double digit rate, deliver an operating margin of at least 50% in each year, and drive an EPS CAGR in the mid teens. As a reminder, these objectives are on a currency-neutral basis, exclude special items and M&A, and are normalized for tax. We are off to a solid start in 2016 as we delivered net revenue growth of 13%, exceeded our minimum operating margin target and grew EPS by 19% using normalized tax rates for 2015 and 2016. As is our historical practice, we will update you on our longer-term expectations at our Annual Investor Community Meeting.","Now turning to 2017, we expect the global economic outlook to be similar to what we saw last year, and we expect foreign exchange to remain a headwind to our business. However, our underlying business fundamentals remain strong with a number of factors driving revenue, including growth in our core business driven by a mix of new deals, renewed agreements and the expansion of our differentiated service offerings. We expect net revenue to grow at a low double digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, consistent with our three year performance objective.","And when you model on an as-reported basis adjusting for the FX impact of all currencies, we estimate there would be a headwind of a little more than 2 PPT to net revenue growth and 3 PPT to the bottom line given the current strength in the dollar relative to the euro and the British pound, in particular. Our plans assume continued strengthening of the US dollar to about $1.05 to the euro. From a sensitivity standpoint, a $0.01 change in the value of the US dollar relative to the euro is expected to have just a $30 million annual impact to revenue, considering both transactional and translational foreign exchange effects.","We expect net revenue growth in the first half of the year to be lower than the second half of the year, due to higher incentives for new and renewed agreements and the rolloff of one agreement.","So for 2017, let me call out several things that you should also consider. For rebates and incentives on an as-reported basis, we currently expect to see about the same 20% growth that we saw in 2016, reflecting the impact of volume growth and deal activity.","And on expenses, let me just give you a couple of comments there. In 2017, we're continuing to invest in key long-term growth areas, such as digital, including Masterpass and MDES, safety and security and investing in geographic expansion. Through our ongoing cost management efforts, we expect year over year operating expenses to grow in the high single digit range on a currency-neutral basis, and we expect foreign exchange will have about a 1 PPT benefit to as-reported operating expenses for the year.","Also of note, we're accelerating our advertising and marketing spend into the first half of the year to support the rollout of Masterpass. In particular, first quarter A&M spend will be up by about $40 million versus the year ago, quarter. In the other income and expense line, interest expense related to the additional debt we issued in November adds approximately $15 million to our normal underlying run rate of roughly $25 million per quarter. Finally, you should assume a tax rate of 28% to 29%.","Now let me turn to Warren to begin the Q&A session.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer session. In order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question this morning comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, it's Bryan Keane. Just wanted to talk about rebates and incentives. It looks like it's going to be up 20% again for the second year in a row, so it seems like we have a more consistent pattern. Can you just talk a little bit about that line item versus incentives and renewals at pricing, because we always get a lot of questions about the growth there? Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Sure, Bryan, and good morning. Really, no change from 2016. As you know, back in late 2014 and early 2015, we actually had renewed a couple of agreements that were for a very long term. One was 10 years and one was actually 20 years. And at that point in time, you actually saw the rebates and incentive growth coming up a little bit more because a number of the items that we had in the incentive line had to be amortized in the early part of the agreement \u2013 of the term of the agreement, rather than in the later part of the agreement. At that point in time, I said that that will be with us for a number of years, and 2017 happens to be still a year where we're seeing that. In addition, when you put the volume growth that we are actually expecting for the year, when you put all of that together, that will drive the 20% \u2013 roughly 20% growth in rebates, incentives versus 2016.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the impact of any potential pricing actions you've already taken that are going to impact the 2017 revenue guidance and anything that you might be contemplating that's going to roll in and affect the full year?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Jim, actually there's fairly little impact from pricing actions in our 2017 numbers. As you know, we really look at pricing from a long-term perspective. It has to be strategic. We are doing that every year, depending where the market environments are; but for 2017, there's relatively little comprehended.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, good morning. Ajay, your guidance for 2017 still has pretty attractive low double digits net revenue growth. As we look around the world and we see a lot more direct out of bank account type payments from Alipay, and you see what's going in the U.S., are you still as constructive on a secular growth opportunity as you have been?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Yes, I absolutely am. Remember that in the retail business alone, the consumer to retail payments, 85% of the world's retail payments are still cash and check. So, there's a lot of opportunity there, first; second, there's the whole commercial space that's got a great deal of opportunity that we've been assiduously building on; third, we've got our services revenue; and fourth, we've actually beginning to participate in the direct to bank account payments once the VocaLink acquisition is complete. So, to me, we're building the right portfolio to take on the opportunities that this secular growth represents over the next decade, not just one or two years.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Thanks, guys. So just thinking about the three-year performance objectives, and we're still talking about the mid teens kind of EPS growth in constant currency. I mean, you did 19% on this as adjusted basis in 2016, so I guess there's some implied deceleration in 2017 and 2018, unless the guidance proves to be a little bit conservative. So, can you just remind us what would potentially drive that. Is it just kind of expense timing or other factors?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Look, Jason, we're only one year into our three-year performance period, so at this point in time we're not yet refreshing our performance objectives. And typically, as you know, we're doing that in September at our Investor Meeting; so, we believe it's too early. You see that we are thinking that we are going to put really good points on the board for 2017, and I don't think you should be reading into anything for 2018.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning. Ajay, I want to put you on the spot and ask for your thoughts on how some of Trump's initiatives might impact Mastercard's business, like cross-border activity or thoughts on deregulation and Durbin and whatnot. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Who allowed you to ask that question, Tien-Tsin?","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I don't know, figured just for giggles and fun. Everything looked clean, so let's ask you a tough one.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","It's nice to hear from you. So, I think that it's early days to talk in great depth about what all could happen, but I'll tell you my views that are on the positive side of this, and then you can see, obviously, through the news that there are people who are concerned as well about the negative side of it. The positive side of it to me, his regulatory announcement, the fact that he seems genuinely concerned about the manner in which regulations enacted are creating millstones for business, both small and large, to grow in the U.S. I think that's pretty clear, and he is definitely committed to helping make it easier for businesses to open, operate and run profitably in the system.","Now, what that means specifically for a company like ours, or for merchants or for banks who are in our ecosystem, I don't yet know, because you'll only get to know that over a period of time. My general belief is that, certainly, it'll help both of the other parties, the merchants and the banks, in the ecosystem in different ways. They'll end up winning on some and losing on some. I just don't know which ones will go where.","I do know that in an environment which talks about regulation being something you need to watch carefully so that you enact the right kind of regulation, but you don't stifle innovation and growth, that could lead to definitely a constructive view. That's kind of where I'm coming from. I don't yet know, specifically, how it will impact our company or those in our immediate ecosystem.","I do believe that in the space of infrastructure, there will be some form of investment or the other funded in some form or the other into infrastructure, both physical and digital, in our country. I believe that will only increase the velocity of money in the country. That will be helpful for a company like ours, both in retail and commercial payments. So, I look forward actually to that, both as a direct impact on our company, but also, frankly, traveling the way I do and the way most of you do, the infrastructure in our country could do with the benefit of a sustained investment program, both in physical and digital. So, I think that's important.","The aspects of taxes, there's all kinds of discussions floating around about what kind of tax rate. I'm talking corporate taxes right now. What kind of corporate tax rates could come to if it comes down from the current level that we're paying, which as Martina told you, 28%, 29%. If it comes down to anything below that, you should expect us as a company to benefit from it directly to the bottom line. There's rumors that it will go to 20% or 25%. You can put your own probability factor on which one. I think there's lots of things to be worked out about how you pay for that reduction in taxes and what impact that has, border taxes, adjustments of import and export circumstances. All of these have implications for us as a company.","Mostly we are a net exporter of service rather than a net importer of service as a company, because of the fact that so much of our back office and our technology and our product development has historically been developed in the United States with US IP. We do have a lot overseas. We do have stuff in Asia. We do have stuff in Dublin and Europe, but net, I think you will find us to be a net exporter rather than a net importer. So I guess on all of those aspects on taxes to regulatory to infrastructure, I can find ourselves finding this to be net positive for our company over the next four to five years.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. I appreciate that.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","The aspects of trade, Tien-Tsin, as you know, my normal approach to trade is that I continue to believe that the United States is way too large a marketplace for companies and businesses to feel that they shouldn't be involved with having on-soil presence and on-soil activity and frequent travel in and out by business executives alike. So, I consider the US to be too attractive for that to change dramatically. I do believe like everybody else that in the corporate world, there are a lot of us have built our business on the freer flow of cross-border trade, data and people. If that were to change over time, that would be a problem, but I don't believe that that's what the administration wants to do. They want to grow the economy. The economy is not going to grow without the right inputs in the right places. It may change specifics of the way trade gets enacted, but I continue to be relatively bullish on where this economy could go over the next four to five years.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. Thank you.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","You're welcome. Don't ask questions again, man.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. I guess, Ajay, I want to talk about the European market. I think I heard you say you guys won the Amazon co-brand relationship. But just maybe you could talk broadly about the competitive environment with Visa in that market in a broader way, as well as PSD2 and then lapping the interchange changes, as well. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Sure. So, the interchange changes have already gone, and as you know, some time back, and so have all the other rules that went with it, including the co-badging. And that's why there's an Article 8 and Article 7 implications. They're all baked into our earnings calls for the last two, three quarters. First of all, I actually am beginning to see an expansion in acceptance, for sure, across the EU, probably facilitated by the lower interchange rates that merchant who earlier were reluctant to accept electronic payments are now willing to do so. That's for sure. That's a good thing.","There is obviously an impact on bank P&Ls caused by the lower interchange rates. Every bank, as you know, is working on other ways to find ways to get to their P&L again. That includes fees. It includes services. It includes alternative products. It includes an emphasis on commercial in some cases. There's a whole series of actions that banks in different countries across Europe have been taking to try and find a way to put some energy back into their P&L.","My sense on the other aspects, PSD2, as you know, it's still two or three years away from fully being implemented. 2018 is when it starts hitting the road. But there's a lot of energy and a lot of passion going into preparing for it. I actually believe that VocaLink could play a very instrumental role for banks in the EU to help them actually find a way to navigate through PSD2 and to maintain scheme-like look and feel to the ability to create payments in a way that they can manage through their customer relationships and their chargebacks and their fraud management and the like. So, I believe that to be an essential part of our strategy for Europe.","On the Visa, Visa European competitive environment, honestly, it's still very early days. They've just about closed. As you know, they're going through their own adjustments across the world on catering for that acquisition. We're in the marketplace, looking at what anything happens in the market on either pricing, in which case we may have some opportunity, or on volume growth and share growth, which we continue to pursue and we're continuing to win some deals in Europe. So, it's kind of early days. We're in the game. We're looking at everything. We'll see how it goes.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Yeah, so let me just add something. As you know, economic growth in Europe is generally much lower than what we're seeing here in the United States, though when you actually look at our numbers, in terms of we are producing high double digit growth, both in volume and in transactions in Europe, right. I mean close to 20% for each of those numbers. There are really two factors that fuel that growth. One is secular trend. A lot of parts in Europe outside of the UK are still using a lot of cash. And secondly, the market share gains that Ajay was referring to that Javier, our President, and his team have been able to gain over many, many years, we don't really expect to see much changes to that. We think that we continue to grow in that way, going forward for a number of years to come.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Martina, I think you mentioned that, at least quarter to date in the US, you're seeing faster relative credit growth, volume growth. Can you just speak to whether or not you think that's cyclical or if there's a change in consumer behavior or if it's simply transitory?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Andrew, I think it would be hard in four weeks to be really figuring out what is going on. In there we saw a little bit of a decline in the fourth quarter, now we're seeing a little bit of a snap back. So, I can't really point that to a consumer story or to another story. I think it's just a typical trend at this point in time.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. I wanted to ask again about the now famous commentary and slide from the September 7 Investment Community Meeting, the one about services, Martina. In that one you disclosed services as a percentage of total revenue and the margin trajectory. I know, Ajay, you called out some of the trends that you're seeing on the security side. But what is your forward expectation on services? Do you think the future growth will parallel that that we've seen in the recent past?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","So, I continue to believe that the entire services space, remember, there's a set of different businesses inside it. So, there's safety and security, there's Advisors in the consulting business. There's the information services and data analytical space. There's the space of loyalty and rewards and there's processing, which actually allows us to get a role to play in many of the other services we want to be participating in.","They've all got different growth rates and trajectories. Safety and security happens to be one of the fastest growing, along with information and data analytics. That's because one, they're intertwined, but two, that's a very important topic right now for consumers, merchants and banks. And I believe we have cutting-edge products that are differentiated and are capable of helping institutions across the world plug in and help them manage potential fraud while work on declines, and so help them really maximize their P&L in attractive ways when they're looking for revenue. So, I continue to believe those two will be very attractive growth areas over the next five to ten years.","Our processing grows when we win deals, but processing, and when we get into more footprints, processing tends to be a very local business. It has some global transferability, but it tends to be quite local. And therefore, it tends to have also a different margin profile than safety and security and information analytics because local means you've got to build locally and that creates its own expense profile. We also tend to make more money out of the transactions we see rather than in the processing business itself. So, it tends to be a input into deal winning rather than part of the revenue cycle as much as the others.","The loyalty business is actually very interesting. We started with a relatively good platform in MasterCard Rewards. We've added to it over the years with merchant funded rewards by buying into Truaxis in California and buying into Pinpoint in Australia. We're actually getting some nice wins in that space and we continue to believe that the loyalty and rewards space will be a good growth area and a good sticky area with our customers.","So, do I see this as being a relatively attractive growth area, a faster percentage of growth than our core business? Probably, because it's off a smaller base as well. Do I see this changing dramatically over the next couple of years? No, but beyond that, we'll see. This is a live area. We're investing in it both organically and inorganically, so it's kind of a live growing segment for us.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Jamie, interesting that you're referring to the now famous charts. I think I have not heard that term that way. But just to leverage off Ajay's comments, we have really not changed our story on this. We are very encouraged in what we have seen in the rest part of the year since September. You know it's about 25% of our total revenues. That has not changed in a material manner. You know that exuding acquisitions, the growth was roughly 14% for those kinds of services. We believe that these services can continue to deliver great growth. And as we're scaling those services, we will be able to expand some of the margins on those services. Again, that was on the chart. So, story hasn't changed and we believe that in 2017 some of the thoughts that I've put down for you does include exactly that kind of growth trajectory. By the way, I have to correct one number. I said 14% organic growth. It's 18% organic growth that we actually saw when we talked in September.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","(46:26) Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey guys, thanks. And, I guess my main question, I guess transaction and other both grew about 20%, those two segments last year. And you kind of answered that other will continue to grow pretty fast, but then assessments and cross-border both grew more like 8% to 11%. Is that sort of mix that those two faster growth segments will continue to be transaction other and then assessments and cross-border continue to be a little on the slower side of your total company growth?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Yeah, I think that is a trend that we have been seeing now a number of times. And there's a number of things happening. First of all, when you look outside of the United States, we have been growing in a number of countries such as India and Brazil and Russia, et cetera, where you're typically seeing lower volume coming per transaction, but more transactions. And then in the United States, as you might remember from last year, which also helped us in the fourth quarter, we saw more PIN transactions because of the number of deals that we have been doing. Again, that adds to the transactions. You don't really see that showing up in as big of a mover, needle mover on the volume side.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","And those PIN transactions go up and down, as we've told you a few times. There's months and quarters when they are growing faster. That tends to be a more, it's almost a weekly and daily issue that we deal with. But, if you're talking about generally long-term trends, you should expect that the two will grow faster than the other two. The fact is that even at 8% or 10%, core payment transaction growth of 8% or 10% is attractive. That reflects the secular change as well as all the day-to-day activities that Martina just referred to.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you very much. Wanted to ask a question, maybe for Ajay and Martina combined, around the opportunity to support some of the other new payment schemes that are emerging in different countries around the world, including RuPay, et cetera. I know you've talked a little bit in the past about the opportunity to provide services to some of these new payment schemes. Can you just expound on that, as to how you think about that opportunity set and how important those new partnerships could be to continuing to drive services growth? Thank you very much.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Well, there have been for years in the industry these alternative payment schemes to the global networks. In fact, I used to say that our competition is not just the global networks. And of course, it's not just cash that we've been talking about for a while, but it's also these local payment schemes country by country. Europe had a number of them. Mexico has them. Canada had them. Australia has them. Russia now has it post the sanctions in the Crimean circumstances. India has launched RuPay and UID. China's always had one, called China UnionPay, which kind of most people know lots about.","And so, in every marketplace there have been these schemes. These schemes are either owned by the local banks or by governments in some cases, so CUP is owned by the Chinese government, whereas a lot of the other schemes are owned by local bank associations. Cartes Bancaires in France, for example, is owned by the French banks.","They play different roles. They play roles where they will look at all the debit transactions locally. Others, like CUP, all domestic transactions are mandated to go through them, and so on. So, there's a whole range of these. What we've been trying to do is to go back into marketplaces that we believe that the existence of these schemes is, one, either creating an imbalance in the market or holding back growth, and attempt to either work with the government or the banks to find ways to either partner with those schemes or find ways to change the laws around those schemes so that you can have a more open marketplace, which should benefit merchants and should benefit banks and should benefit consumers. And we've had different degrees of success over the years. The European Union, as you know, through its directives over the years in PSD and \u2013 what is it called, the other one? The European Special?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","SEPA.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","SEPA. I get mixed up between SEPA and SIPA (51:07); but, SEPA. Those have created opening up of these schemes for people like us to be able to play. I continue to believe that the model will be a mix of all of those. The one you're specifically getting at is more like the Russian model, where there is a domestic payment scheme generated and created, and we have helped them put their technology together and connect with them and provide services that are value added from safety, security, cross-border approvals, transaction management to information and data, which are provided by our better capable systems than they have of their own.","And the fact that we see global transactions and they tend to see localized transactions adds a long-term value differentiator between what we can provide and what a local scheme can provide. It's the same with the RuPays of the world or others. We're always looking for ways to cooperate with them, in some cases successfully, in others not so.","I'm sorry it's not a clear answer because this is not a clear space. It's a space that evolves and breathes and lives every day and week depending on the circumstances of a marketplace. And you should just know that our country managers on the ground have this as one of the major objectives in their evaluations, and the decisions in how they get paid.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. good morning. In keeping with the theme of putting Ajay on the hot seat this morning, do you mind commenting on how you see Mastercard's relationship with Alipay and Ant Financial evolving, like friend, foe, frenemy, both in the context of China, India and expanding elsewhere in the world?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Well, in China right now there's nothing to say because we are still waiting for clarity on how we could be partners domestically in China. Having said that, we have had a relationship with Alipay and Alibaba for the last couple of years on helping them think through how to use our technology to figure out different aspects of their own service, including the detection of fraud products on their website. Some of that relationship has worked well. Some of it, it depends on the energy on both sides of the partnership to implement that.","I consider different forms of payment to all be competitive, but also conducive to the bigger challenge of fighting the 85% that is still cash and check in retail payments; and that's always been my stance and I haven't changed. So, I've had the same view of PayPal. I have the same view of Alipay. I have the same view of all of these, that I think there's enough place in this market for all of us to play, and there's enough, let's say, challenges in the marketplace for all of us to put our shoulders to it. We've come at it differently. We'll win some deals; we'll lose some deals. But I kind of believe there's enough secular growth opportunity in this space for a lot of us to flourish.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Mihalos from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question, guys. Martina, just had a quick question on the guidance as we look at 2017. Obviously in 2016, from a revenue perspective, you outperformed, 13% constant currency top line growth. As we look at 2017, it seems you're implying 11%-ish. Can you just maybe bucket for us what are some of the headwinds, 2016 going into 2017, outside of, obviously, the USAA de-conversion? Thank you.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Yeah, look. It's a number of things that are impacting 2017 or that are driving growth for 2017, as I did say low double digits. You can come to your own conclusion in terms of the specific number. But the combination of one of the agreements, USAA rolling off, as well as quite a few agreements actually rolling on, as well as the growth in our services offerings are all making up the numbers. Also, what I said in my script, so that you guys are all having the right kind of modeling down is we said that the growth rate will be lower in the first half of the year than the second half of the year, and that is obviously impacted in terms of how agreements roll off and roll on.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks so much, good morning. Can we just talk a little bit more on the ground level of what's happening in India? Where do you stand from an issuing relationship with the major banks? Are you sort of spurring the adoption of alternative payments through terminalization and helping merchant acquirers get terminals out into the market? And I think you noted in the prepared remarks a very substantial increase in volume. I know it's off a low base. Maybe try to size that market for us a little bit over the next couple years would be great. Thank you.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Sure. So, India has only 1.4 million terminals actually at the point of sale, and it tends to be a very cash dominated market. I'd say 95%-plus of the transactions in retail are cash. When the demonetization happened, the two biggest currency notes were taken out of circulation, the INR 500 and the INR 1,000 notes constituted 86% of the currency notes in circulation. That's the shock that is referred to as what could lower consumer spending for a couple of quarters. We saw that because restrictions in cash withdrawal from banks and from ATMs were instituted as the government tried to catch up with the demand for cash. With the new notes, they were printing, those notes had to be put into the market. The ATMs had to be redesigned. Their hoppers had to be redone. Or you can just imagine the level of work in a country where the largest public sector bank has 18,000 branches, and is spread across a relatively large country. So, that's what caused some of the dislocation.","Now, 1.4 million merchant terminals. Their point of sale payments can take this, but behavior habits that used those terminals very infrequently. The 75% increase in purchase volume you're seeing is because people began to use their cards more frequently at those very same point of sales terminals. What's going on now is a concerted move to increase the number of point of sales terminals, double plus over the next I'd say three to six months. That work is being done by the acquirers, the banks, the networks, us, Visa, others, but also by the government actively pushing that logic.","Second, there's a great deal of partnership with merchant organizations on the ground. The Confederation of All India Traders estimates that there's as many as 60 million casual and regular merchants in India. Even if you were to go from 1.4 million terminals to 5 million acceptance points in the next two years, we're talking 5 million out 60 million. So, there's a long way to go before we get to a ubiquitous terminal acceptance model.","There's a lot of work going on on cheaper terminals. QR codes is an example of almost zero cost for terminals for a merchant. We are actively rolling them out. You heard that in my prepared remarks with the Government of India and with RBL and others of that type. We're working actively with issuers, acquirers and the government in short on this topic, but don't expect this to change in a quarter or a month. It is a long fight, and I think the Prime Minister is to be credited for his willingness to take it on, because in the medium to long term, this could be transformative for the way India's economy operates in the recognizable formal economy, as compared to the informal economy, where it's denied taxation and denied credit and denied insurance. I think he's really trying to do something pretty brave here.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks so much.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Operator, I think we have time for one final question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Can you just touch on the, first of all, the cross-border volume trends and just bigger picture, what you're seeing regarding sort of the headwinds and tailwinds globally? I know you started touching on that before and saying that maybe there were some elements that might be a little bit slower on the volume side. But I guess I also just want to understand. The cross-border revenue growth rate during the quarter on a constant-currency basis was I think 10% versus volume of 13%. So, is anything going on on pricing or anything else you could explain around that? We'd appreciate it. Thanks.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","So first of all, Darrin, on your last question, the difference, the 3 PPT difference was really the relative higher intra-Europe growth, which you know comes at a lower yield versus the inter-regional growth, which typically comes at a higher yield. That's all that's going on. We've seen that going for quite a few quarters, eight quarters or nine quarters. So, there's really nothing else in there. It's really nothing.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","That's Europeans traveling within Europe. That's basically what's going on.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Europeans are staying closer to home.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Mastercard, Inc.","Right. From an overall cross-border trend point of view, what we have been seeing lately in the fourth quarter was that actually more Chinese, Hong Kongnese, Japanese have been traveling in Asia-Pacific. As well in Latin America, we are starting to see Brazil coming back a little bit more. However, some of that was offset by what's going on in Middle East, Africa, in particular those economies that are hurting because of the low oil price, right. So, you have a particular impact in Nigeria and Qatar and Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia based on that. But when you take all of this together, we are still seeing a very significant cross-border volume growth. And you saw that in the first four weeks of the year that has been going up a little bit more, mostly predominantly to Latin America, so that is the Brazil phenomena. That country is obviously working itself out of a very deep recession and we're seeing some good signs there.","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","The UK is interesting. Inbound into the UK is up substantially. Outbound from the UK is negative. Not just down, negative, substantially. That's because of what happened to the pound versus other currencies. So, it's kind of a mixed bag across the range.","Warren Kneeshaw - Mastercard, Inc.","Thanks, Ajay. Any final comments?","Ajay Banga - Mastercard, Inc.","Sure. Thank you all for your questions, and Tien-Tsin, special thanks to you, buddy. I'll leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. We had a strong year in 2016. Our financial performance was driven by the growth for our core business and our ability to continue to differentiate ourselves with services. That led to significant business wins this year. As I just said in some of the Q&A, the secular growth opportunity in our business remains very strong. India is just a great recent example of this. The actions taken there has the potential to be transformative. We will continue to invest for that future.","We're going to shape the payments landscape through innovation and expand into new payment flows, hence the interest in VocaLink and other such efforts, to ensure that we are well positioned for success for many more years to come. Obviously, in terms of what this means for 2017, we're going to remain focused on growing our business by driving the shift from cash to electronic payment, by building new service offerings, by advancing our digital strategy, and hopefully closing in the spring on our acquisition of VocaLink, all this while Martina ensures that we all very carefully manage our expenses.","So, we appreciate the continued support of the company and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion about our third quarter 2015 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question. Even if you think you have already dialed into the queue, you will need to register again following our prepared comments.","This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. These documents include a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents and have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one month.","Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Ajay.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody.","With the backdrop of this continuing uncertainty in the global economy, we're actually quite pleased with our results this quarter. After adjusting for currency, we reported net revenue growth of 8%, in line with what we thought we would get, and an EPS growth of 11%. And this excludes the impact of a special item, and Martina will touch on that later.","So now let's take a quick look at what's going on in the global economy. And it's been challenged in recent months, and while the U.S. recovery remains among the most solid \u2013 job gains have steadily lowered the unemployment rate to just over 5% \u2013 but job and wage growth are starting to slow. Consumer confidence is only moderately up, and as you know, given yesterday's announcement, uncertainty about rising interest rates remain.","So when moving beyond the U.S., the economic picture is more mixed. Global growth is clearly slowing, particularly in smaller, emerging markets, and a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China is affecting many other economies. Exporters to China and those with close trade links \u2013 Russia, Brazil, for example \u2013 would probably will be the most impacted, adding to the downward pressure on oil and commodity prices. In Asia, India is less dependent on global demand and should continue to grow. But in Australia, consumer and business sentiment has weakened again, as their economic growth has slowed for what is now the fifth consecutive quarter. Growth in Europe, on the other hand, is improving, but not as fast as previously expected, and the unemployment rate continues a gradual decline. The U.K. remains steady. Economic growth is expected to continue through the rest of this year and into next year. And Germany's also showing some signs of strengthening. In Latin America, Brazil continues to be in a recession. Economic conditions continue to worsen in Venezuela. The lone bright spot there appears to be Mexico, where the economic recovery continues, led by relatively strong consumer spending and the lowest levels of inflation in almost 50 years.","So when you put all this together, what we're really talking about is some period of economic uncertainty, fueled by the slowdown in China, combined with continued lower oil and commodity prices, as well as this continuing uncertainty of rising interest rates in the U.S. And so overall we remain cautious about the outlook for the global economy. Now, in saying (4:33) all of this, our business continues to grow; our fundamentals remain strong. We're seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets as a result of our efforts to drive the shift from cash to electronic payments, but also as well as our continued business growth.","So before we go to our business highlights, I want to say a few words about the opening of the Chinese domestic market. Since the final Chinese regulations have not yet been released, we have no new insights to add beyond what we all told you at our recent Investor Day last month. We continue to execute against our plans to be technically ready to process domestic Chinese transactions by the end of 2016, and we're working on expanding issuance and acceptance in that market while we wait for clarity on the regulations.","So now results of (5:24) our recent business activity. You've already heard a great deal from us at Investor Day. You've had an opportunity to see firsthand a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling out. So let me just mention a couple of items very briefly. First, we continue to grow in the co-brand space. In the United States, we're pleased to be able to confirm our agreement with JetBlue to launch a new co-brand credit card and convert their existing credit card portfolio. BarclayCard will be the issuing bank. We also won several other co-brand deals around the world, including CIDF \u2013 that's the largest travel company in China \u2013 Coles, the largest supermarket chain in Australia, and of course one of the co-brands for Aeroflot. Aeroflot has a number of co-brands; we've won one of those. They're the largest Russian airline, as you probably know. We've also signed a strategic partnership with Citi for an affluent co-brand with a large global airline based in the Middle East.","Moving beyond specific customer agreements, I'd like to talk a few minutes to you about some of the developments going on in our space, in the payments space in particular.","And let's start with EMV in the United States. And, as you know, the liability shift went into effect October 1. We're kind of pleased with the progress we are seeing thus far. We now expect 60% of cards at approximately 40% of terminals in the United States to be chip-capable by the end of this year. By the way, this is true for us, but it's true for the industry as a whole. We expect almost all cards in the market to be upgraded to chip by the end of 2017, and we've already seen tens of millions of chip transactions. By the way, another little side benefit of EMV is that it'll likely give a boost to the adoption of contactless or NFC payments, because the latest generation of EMV-enabled terminals also contain contactless capabilities.","And that kind of leads me to the next topic I'd like to talk about, which is to give you a quick update on the progress we have made in the digital space. And, over the past year or so, you've heard us make several announcements related to MasterPass. Just to put it together for you, we're now live in 24 markets, we're accepted at over 250,000 merchants, a list which recently added Burger King and Firehouse Subs. In addition, we recently announced MasterPass will be fully tokenized using our MDES platform \u2013 that's M-D-E-S \u2013 starting with the United States in 2016. And that'll give consumers EMV-level security and the ability to shop more securely online or in-app, from any device across all card types.","So let me give you an example of a breakthrough which can really drive the growth of MasterPass. And despite the challenges going on recently in the Russian market, we're working hard to extend our capabilities there. As I recently \u2013 we just had a partnership announced with Yandex.Money, one of the largest payment service providers in Russia, that extends the use of MasterPass to their 22 million customers. And, talking about scale, the State Bank of India, which is the largest bank in that country \u2013 it's got more than 15,000-plus branches \u2013 have also launched their mobile wallet solution with the help of MasterCard. And that solution enables consumers to load money, perform a P2P transfer, pay bills, things that the average consumer in India is really keen to get with. And the State Bank of India is the right partner for that.","And as you know, we've been putting a lot of emphasis on tokenizing transactions using MDES. And most recently you've heard about Android Pay and Samsung Pay, who've been added to the list of providers leveraging that service. And as we said before, we were the first network to extend support for private-label cards. In fact, Kohl's and JCPenney have now gone live with that service. In addition to small-business cards, we were also the first network to announce tokenization for all commercial cards. And all that means is that all of our card products and channels can soon be tokenized, so it becomes ubiquitous for us.","We also announced the launch of our Digital Enablement Express Program, which basically expedites the process of digitizing and tokenizing accounts using MDES. Any financial institution can gain immediate access to all our latest digital payment services, while our partners \u2013 that's digital wallet providers, device manufacturers, other digital payment providers \u2013 they can all have a simple onboarding process to engage with all these participating banks. Google, Samsung, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, KeyBank are among the first companies to announce their participation in the Express program.","Now the Internet of Things, something everybody's been talking about, continues the convergence of the physical and digital worlds that began in mobile devices. And that new generation of connected devices, smartwatches, wearables, this will collect and transmit vast amounts of data, and the idea is to be able to use that to provide new insights, new services. To give you an example, data from a smartphone indicating that a consumer is in a retailer's store location could trigger a discount offer for using their credit card. Now that may sound futuristic, but to help fulfill that vision, we've actually just launched a new digital enablement program that'll turn any accessory or wearable into a payment-enabled device. And that gives consumers the ability to shop using the thing that is most convenient to them with the highest level of security available.","That program will launch with the support of several marquee partners across multiple industries. Prototypes from a fashion designer, Adam Selman, automaker General Motors, smartband developer Nymi, and fashion brand Ringly were all on display using our technology at Money20\/20 just earlier this week. And we worked with NXP and Qualcomm to develop the technology, and Capital One is actually the first issuer to embrace it. In addition, Capital One has also announced the availability of contactless mobile payment capability to its wallet app, and actually becomes the first issuer in the United States to do so using our cloud-based payments technology.","And these announcements kind of endorse how we're trying to advance our digital strategy, eliminate the boundaries of how consumers pay, by delivering a secure digital payment experience to virtually anything. Every device can be a device of commerce; that's the idea. So mobility, cloud-based payments, the Internet of Things, and Big Data are all coming together. EMV, contactless, and our MDES-enabled secure transactions across all channels, all devices. And as new players enter the digital payments landscape, we continue to see our technology as the foundation for new, innovative payment services.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Martina to update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.","So let me begin on page 3 of our slide deck, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro\/U.S. dollar exchange rate. Now, these figures also exclude the impact of a special item of $70 million on a pre-tax basis \u2013 $79 million on a pre-tax basis taken this quarter related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.","I'd like to point out a few items here, and then I'll talk about the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. First, EPS growth was 5% or 11% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control, executing on our tax strategies, and repurchasing shares all contributed to that performance. And, as expected, acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of EPS dilution in the quarter. Second, the tax rate was 28.2% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on better aligning our tax structure with our business footprint. Third, share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our third quarter results. As of October 22, we have $1.2 billion remaining under our current authorization. And, lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and other liquid investments of about $5.1 billion.","So let me turn to page 4, and here you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local-currency basis, and that's pretty much the same as the last quarter. Overall, our U.S. dollar GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 9% and 7%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was up 1 ppt versus last quarter, with stronger growth in our consumer credit programs, offset by slightly lower growth in our debit programs, primarily due to lapping some debit wins and a continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 16% on a local-currency basis. That's, again, same as in the last quarter, with mid to high teens growth in each region. Cross-border volume grew 16% on a local-currency basis, slightly lower than the 17% we saw in the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe.","Turning to page 5, here you can see global processed transaction growth slowed slightly to 12% from the 13% we saw in the second quarter, primarily driven by fewer PIN POS transactions in the U.S. We continued to see double-digit growth in all other regions. And, globally, the numbers of cards grew 8%, with 2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued.","Now let's turn to page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 2% as reported or 8% FX adjusted, given currency headwinds. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was slightly higher than we expected at about 3 ppt, primarily driven by the Russian ruble to the euro and the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar exchange rates. After eliminating all impacts of currency, our underlying net revenue growth was 11%. And acquisitions contributed about 1 ppt to that net revenue growth.","Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis, the domestic assessments grew 9%, while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 4 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency, somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 11%, while cross-border volume grew 16%. Of the 5 ppt gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of intra-Europe activity, some local-currency impact, as well as lower inbound U.S. cross-border volume. Transaction processing fees grew 16%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in processed transaction and some pricing. Finally, other revenues grew 15%, driven primarily this quarter by our safety and security products and the APT acquisition.","Moving on to page 7, here you can see that total operating expenses after excluding the special item increased 1% in the quarter or 5% on an FX-adjusted basis. Of this, M&A activities contributed almost 4 ppt to total FX-adjusted expense growth, and you can see the impact acquisitions had to the individual expense categories in the lower box there on the chart. After excluding the special item, the growth in G&A of 3%, or 6% on an FX-adjusted basis, is mostly due to the impact of acquisitions. And, finally, most of the increase in D&A continues to be also related to acquisitions.","Turning to slide 8, let's discuss what we have seen in October through the 21st. Our business drivers are similar or just a bit lower compared to the third quarter, so the numbers through October 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 12%, which is unchanged from the third quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 7%. That is also unchanged from what we saw in the last quarter. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 17%. That's about 1 ppt lower than the third quarter, with similar growth in Europe and slightly lower growth in the other regions. Globally, processed transaction growth was 11%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S., which grew in the low single digits. This slower U.S. growth was driven by routing decisions of PIN debit transactions. With respect to cross-border, our volume grew 14% globally, 2 ppt lower than our third quarter growth, with slower growth in all regions except the U.S. Our APMEA region saw the largest slowdown, driven by the timing of holidays in the Middle East versus last year.","Moving on, our volume and transactions metrics, as you can see, show that our underlying business remains strong. When looking at our full-year 2015 outlook, it's mostly unchanged from my comments last month at our Investor Day. I'll just quickly call out a few items that have changed very slightly or need some clarification. First, similar to what we saw in Q3, we now expect a slightly higher local currency headwind of about 3 ppt in Q4, which primarily impacts net revenue. And when you combine this with the impact from FX translation, the total expected impact of currency on our results continues to be a 8 to 10 ppt headwind for fiscal year 2015, depending whether we're talking about revenue or net income.","Turning to rebates and incentives, we continue to expect the full-year 2015 growth rate to be similar to the growth rate we saw in Q1. However, the individual quarterly impact has changed slightly due to the timing of some deals shifting from Q3 into Q4. And when looking at expenses, we haven't changed our expectations for total operating expense growth, but we have had several questions on this topic as some of you work on your models. So when I spoke previously about expecting mid-single digit growth for full year 2015 on a, quote, \"as-reported basis\" so that excludes any of the special items taken this year, but it does not exclude the impact of last year's Q4 severance charge, as that was not a special item.","Finally, let me just make a quick comment on our 2016 to 2018 performance objective that we announced at Investor Day last month. Based on some conversation that we've had, I'd like to clarify a couple of points around how we look at our long-term performance objective to help you with your modeling.","So first, our objective to present a compound growth rate over a three-year period. So as you know, actual performance could be above or below our stated three-year objective at any given year. Factors that could impact any individual year include things like the economic environment, the impact of local FX that we don't adjust for, or market share changes. In fact, we expect that we will likely see 2015 come in lower than the range of our 2013 to 2015 objective based on the first two factors I just mentioned, even though we expect to meet our three-year objective.","Second, I said at Investor Day that our 2016 tax rate would be about 29%, higher than our expected 2015 rate, since we don't expect the discrete and one-time items that already have or could occur this year will repeat in 2016. Remember that our practice has been to adjust for one-time tax items in the base year from which the three-year EPS CAGR is calculated. We will be providing you with a pro forma fiscal year 2015 EPS figure on our year-end earnings call based on a normalized 2015 tax rate. And as you begin to model out future years' performance you need to factor something about this into your thinking until we have the final numbers to provide you at the end of January.","Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Thanks, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question and answer period. And in order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Chris?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And the first question is from Don Fandetti with Citi. Your line is open.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Ajay, I was wondering if you could, just given the volatility of the economics around the world and a little bit of a dip in cross-border this quarter, although last year you had a similar sort of holiday seasonal dip, is there any concern structurally about cross-border? Or do you feel like it's likely to remain on track despite what's going on?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think it's more likely remain on track despite what's going on. Just the reality is when the dollar's strong you're going to get some lower inflow into the U.S. of tourism. We have seen more Americans travel overseas over the last six, seven months, and that does show up in some of our results in terms acquired volume in countries overseas. The Europeans continue to be traveling, but they travel more in Europe than outside than two, three years ago. There's kind of these trends moving around. Fewer Chinese are traveling overseas, no doubt, and that's all part of it, the way the Chinese economy is. You'll see ins and outs. I don't think I can give you a clear prediction of where it could go. But I don't see any structural change, if that's what your question was.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. (25:44), what do you think from a network perspective? And are you just waiting to see if any of your issuing banks decide to pursue some type of Chase Net type approach? Or do you feel like that's something you might push the issuers to kind of maintain market share?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, you got to remember that Chase Net is a very unique piece for Chase, which has a certain size of an acquiring business and a issuing business. And they tend to be similar size in terms of market share, and they own the acquiring business. There aren't a lot of other banks around the world that do that directly. It doesn't mean there isn't potential to be discussed with every one of them. And a lot of them were interested when the first set of announcements came out. There is lower interest over time because people are still trying to figure out what the benefits and the pluses and minuses \u2013 the puts and takes out on it. I don't think there's clarity yet, but the conversations continue in all kinds of countries. We've done something similar in a couple of countries overseas, but it just depends on the construct of a country.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just hoping to get some comments on USAA's Bank \u2013 I guess their flip over to Visa. I guess they were talking about the benefits, including the elimination of foreign transaction fees. But just trying to get a sense of what exactly happened in your guys' eyes there. Thanks.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So USAA is a longtime client of ours, and we actually think they're a very good client. So it's pretty sad for us that \u2013 inside the company we feel bad about the fact that we no longer have them as our client over the course of the next year. We still are going to be doing work with them on services, on rewards, and debit processing. And in that form we'll remain in contact with them. The fact is that we tried our best to pursue that business, but at a point, we lost out. And that's just the way it is.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, and one thing I just want to jump in. We knew this unfortunate loss before we actually had our Investor Day, so for all of those who had asked Barbara over the last few days, we had actually factored that already into our long-term guidance.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, what kind of impact will it have on the numbers in 2016 or 2017, Martina?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Well, as you know, Bryan, we are not calling out individual years. We factored it in for a three-year period, and we feel like that we can digest that given the kind of targets that we put out there.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, super. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Martina, maybe you could go back through the expense growth guidance. Looked like the margins in this quarter were way above our expectations, and I suspect generally most people. Could you clarify what you're sort of suggesting or was implied for the fourth quarter expense guidance as it relates to that mid-single digit reported expense growth?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, guys, you have now three quarters of actuals. And so for the full year, what you're going have to do from an as-reported basis, which is excluding the special item, actually excluding that $79 million -","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","\u2013 and last quarter's litigation.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, and last quarter's litigation reserve that we took. So exclude those, but then for the whole year you should be lining up the fourth quarter so that you're getting into mid-single digit growth for the full year of 2015.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Weren't you suggesting an adjustment from last year, too, though?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","What did you say?","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Weren't you suggesting there's an adjustment to make from last year's numbers as well?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","No, no. What I was suggesting, you're not making adjustment for the 2014 numbers. You might remember that in Q4 we took a severance charge of around $87 million last year. That was not a special item. So do not pull that out. You need to put that and keep that into the base expenses when you do the calculation of mid-single digit growth.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on USAA. Just trying to \u2013 been thinking about it a little bit. Just trying to better understand how you balance pricing discipline, which I think was mentioned in a few articles, with the indirect cost of losing economies of scale, given that it's such a big client. I know Visa's obviously bigger. And they're going to get even bigger with this win and Costco. So just trying to understand those dynamics, if that makes sense.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure, Tien-Tsin. Actually, in terms of economies of scale, this is not a material enough dimension to move when you've got tens of billions of transactions and so many clients. Look, we win business and we lose some business. It's the nature of our business. When it's very large, it can make an impact to the way we think, but remember that Chase was a very large movement away, and we still navigated our way through the years delivering on our three-year commitment. USAA is nowhere near the size of Chase. You all know that. And so it's well factored into our thinking, but it's not a scale versus pricing issue. At the end of the day, it's not just pricing. There's a lot of factors that go into winning and losing deals. Pricing is one of them. Pricing's always a first conversation in a B2B business. And we kind of felt at some point in time, this was a business we couldn't win, and we had to get away from it. It's very sad, because as I said, good client, and somebody we had for 30 years. But we're going to still keep doing business with them in portions of processing with rewards and the like.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jason A. Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. So just wanted to ask a little bit about the commercial business. We've been doing a lot more work on that. Seems like you guys have a really good position in the virtual card space specifically within commercial. Can you talk about some of the growth rates you're seeing here, maybe which verticals are dropping, some of the strength in virtual specifically and the commercial business more broadly? And then just a quick one for Martina on buyback authorization. Any reason we haven't seen a refresh on that now that you're down closer to $1 billion left?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Martina, you want to cover the buyback first?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Look, I mean, Jason, we have a particular cadence in terms of \u2013 established, although not many years, in terms of the buyback authorizations, and I don't think we ever had a reauthorization when we were still over the $1 billion mark. So that's a decision that will be taken at some point in time. But at this point in time we still have plenty of opportunity and room left on the current program.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Jason, back to the commercial cards, I think they continue to be area of growth. We just spent a little time, as you remember, at Investor Day on the topic. And we recently signed a deal with Barclays in the U.K. We're continuing to see sort of strong adoption of our product Smart Data, which is our reporting and reconciliation tool, as well as InControl, which is the virtual card question you were getting at.","What I'm also seeing is some increasing interest beyond the typical bank card issuers, and you see technology providers who kind of embed commercial payment solutions either into their software or their platforms, and as well as some payment aggregators in verticals like insurance and healthcare. All-in-all, this global business remains robust. We are looking at low double digit volume growth over the past several quarters, and there's no doubt that virtual cards are a key part of that growth area. As you know, InControl, when we bought Orbiscom years ago, InControl came with some IP protection around the virtual card space, and it's embedded into what we're doing in the commercial space.","Jason A. Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. I just want to go back to some comments of yours, Ajay, on the Chase Net deal, and how \u2013 you guys have a similar product, and I was just wondering, specific to the United States, I mean, have there been a steady stream of discussions with some of the banks that are able to do it? And what's their interest level? Thanks.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There've been discussions over time. I wouldn't call it a steady stream. It's kind of some banks pursue it for a period of time; others come in and out of the discussion. I'd say every once in a while, there are conversations on it with different banks here. Just \u2013 it's not \u2013 there's nobody else who's got that same position. But, yes, it's something that we're doing overseas, as I said, in some countries, and there's always the opportunity to do it in the U.S. as well if the stars and the moon align.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","One quick follow-up on EMV. You guys mentioned a pretty big number of EMV-capable terminals, but how many are actually using it?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So 40% of them are capable is what I said, and I actually don't have a specific number off the top of my head as to how many are using it, but we've seen tens of millions of EMV transactions already between this last few weeks. So it's picking up. I'm quite hopeful that the way the Payments Security Task Force, that is set up between the industry and merchants some time ago. That Payments Security Task Force had some assumptions of how cards would get replaced and how terminals would get upgraded, and while the end of 2017 is when all the cards get replaced, it's actually not a linear line to there. It's pretty high already at 60-odd percent by the end of this year, and I think by end of next year, it's mostly done with a few left in 2017. It's a similar trend for terminals. But, remember, smaller merchants will take longer because they've got to work through the ISO network, and there's a whole game out there to be played. But it's \u2013 over the next couple of years it should be quite well embedded.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Which by the way, is much faster than we've seen in any other country around the world.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Your line is open.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Another question on Chase Pay and MasterPass. Can you just talk about your strategy as it stands today for merchant adoption on the online wallet side? (36:21)","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so you're talking about the recent announcement at Money20\/20 when Chase Pay talked about linking up with MCX, right?","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Well, that's (36:34)","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Chris, if you have a headset on or something, you're cutting out.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Chris?","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Chris, we can't hear you.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Better?","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Much better.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. (36:53) two-part question. One is the (36:55) in I guess primarily...","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Chris, sorry...","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","...in the U.S. for MasterPass in the online space and trying to compete with PayPal and all the other competitors that are targeting that space. It just doesn't seem like we've seen a lot of traction. You've got some big-name merchants, but I just don't understand exactly why merchants aren't eager to adopt something that would help consumers check out. And the second part of the question is, when it comes to MCX, just any current thoughts on the competitive threat there? Do you expect it to be included in MCX at some point? Do you expect to also include your two-stage wallet fee as part of any arrangement with MCX? Thanks.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the first part, the part about adoption. Building acceptance is a relatively long marathon, and we've kind of all forgotten that, because we've built it into the physical space over a period of time with cards, and as cards became more or more ubiquitous, acceptance tends to grow faster. But we know what it's like to build acceptance in emerging markets, for example, where the infrastructure may not be as strong or where the number of cards in people's pockets may be lower.","It's a little bit of a chicken-and-egg. Merchants begin to accept electronic payments when there's enough pull from consumers for that. Consumers also tend to pick up electronic payments when there's enough acceptance for them, and this symbiotic thing takes a little time to pick up and roll on a mountainside \u2013 a bit like a snowball rolling downhill. Think of it that way. And it's pretty much the same here. PayPal's been around for a long time. They've done a very good job of building their acceptance. We've only started a little while ago, and I think as you make progress on building acceptance on this, you get chunks of merchants at some times and other times it's a one-by-one kind of thing.","One of the things we had learned is that it's really important to build acceptance for this in the day-to-day merchant usage category, because that will encourage consumers to use their MasterPass wallet or their bank wallet more often. And the moment you do that, the merchant gets reinforced because this is a good thing to connect up with, and that's what we're trying to do. So you'll see us make a lot of effort on this as you'll see the whole industry making efforts over the last year or so. You'll see us all doing this for the next couple of years.","And don't judge MasterPass or the digital payment system as a whole by a sprint. Judge it as a marathon. Otherwise by that logic, none of the current mobile payment or digital payment systems have reached any scale. Don't do that, because I think it's a cumulative effect over a period of time. That's the way I'd look at it.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And on MCX?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I think MCX is interesting. I haven't changed my opinion about the \u2013 my previous view. I haven't yet seen anything new roll out from them. I consider them to all be very large and useful merchants with whom we have many relationships. And so we're kind of working with all of them. And we'll see. We'll see when they launch something, which \u2013 and what the consumer experience is.","Finally, in digital payments or mobile-based payments, a lot of this is going to be about the consumer experience, because if it's going to be clunky, then what problem are you trying to solve with that technology that the consumer's feeling today with a card? You're not solving for their convenience and for the ease of use. And so it's all about the consumer experience in addition to all the other elements of the ecosystem. So I'm waiting. I'm working with them. We meet them. We talk to them. We'll see.","The staged wallet fee is very much something that's a principal policy in our company. We believe that if you were to take funding sources from different sources and not provide clarity to the merchant, the consumer, and the issuing institution, at the end of what funding source was used for what purchase, you're kind of mixing up a lot of things. You're mixing up a lot of the issues in the marketplace, including how you provide customer service and the value of different payment systems, both for the merchant and the consumer and the issuing bank. So we've kind of got a policy around that, and we're sticking to that policy.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from Smitti with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Just wanted to follow up on the debit business. I'm just wondering if you could give more details in terms of what happened to the PIN debit business in the past quarter and if those same factors will continue in the coming quarters. And while we're on the topic of debit, I was just wondering, too, if you could share with us your thoughts on what you potentially see in terms of the competitive dynamics in the signature debit market given that one of the largest acquirers will be entering that market next year.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","So first of all on the first question, Smitti, look, the PIN POS business is a tough business, right? It's a very competitive business. We've been explaining to you that we are extremely price conscious about that and that every month we are making sure that we get the right kind of transactions and the right number of transactions coming in, into our network. But things move, right? Competitively they move. Some cards get added, other PIN options, so that moves then in terms of what you see on all your network. And so every month we're basically working it off, and this month or this quarter you saw a little bit of a stepdown. You also saw that in October. I think over the next three, four months we'll be regaining some of that as we're working through that competitive environment.","Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","And then the signature debit?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Can you repeat your question on signature debit and what you're trying to get after there?","Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, so signature debit, right now it's just you guys and Visa, right? And First Data has talked about entering that market next year. I was just wondering if we could get your thoughts in terms of how you see that market developing.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Look, Smitti, we'll see. I mean, obviously in a number of countries around the world, you're not having just one or two choices, right? You have a number of choices including local providers, and we'll see what happens in the United States. But at this point in time, it's a little too early to pontificate about how this could happen and how this would be impacting the business.","Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. In the other revenue line, you called out, Martina, safety and security solutions and I'm wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on that in terms of being able to monetize or commercialize tokenization and encryption offerings, or what specifically is in there? And can that be a driver of revenue growth at the margin looking out over the next several years?","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Look, safety and security you can't just look at this in terms of what we're doing on the tokenization or on the MDES piece. Safety and security is a much broader kind of umbrella. And we actually pulled all of our safety and security product offering together a couple of years ago under one leadership. And what is really what we're after is what are kind of products and services can we offer that keeps the consumer safe, that keeps the merchant safe, and that keeps the financial institutions and the processor safe in the space? So you have a number of players in the industry that are having the same kind of thinking in terms of keeping everybody safe. We have a ton of unbelievably interesting products that we have built on a very good base over the last couple of years.","I'll give you one example. So for instance the product that we call SafetyNet \u2013 and some of you saw that, of course, at our Investor Day. Right? On SafetyNet, we basically have in the network algorithms that allow us to detect if particular cards or portfolios have been penetrated in such a way that there are red flags coming up, and we have to make sure that the financial institutions or the related party actually knows how to deal with that. And we do that within nanoseconds, right? Those kind of products, which have been rolled out worldwide \u2013 SafetyNet has been now rolled out worldwide \u2013 we can absolutely charge for. And that is some of the things that \u2013 the charges that people will agree to \u2013 they have to agree to if they want to utilize this product. And those are the kind of revenues that you see coming in here.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So you had a second part of your question, which was about tokenization and all that mixed up inside that. And the safety\/security business to me is about prevention, detection, and finally enhancing the experience of the consumer and the merchant and the issuing institution. And we're actually building a strategic path process in it over the last couple of years, not just selling product. And you're seeing the result of some of that beginning to show up in our revenue lines. I'm quite hopeful that safety and security will be a good way for us to grow. We are a natural provider of some of these thinkings for those people in the ecosystem. And it's necessarily a part of what we do. For a consumer we've got ID theft solutions to we've got Authorization IQ solutions for merchants, to issuing solutions to using data, to all that.","And we've got new technology stuff coming in where the tokenization comes, but also \"selfie pay\" and biometrics and heartbeat monitors with Nymi. And we've launched that with TD Bank in Canada. This is the whole series of things in this space.","I don't think tokenization itself should be counted as a revenue stream per se. Tokenization is probably like table stakes; we don't charge for EMV. A chip manufacturer may be charging some money to provide the chip. We don't charge them extra. That's table stakes in digital. So that's not what I'm trying to do with tokenization. Kind of make it safer, most secure, EMV type security in digital for the future of payments that are going to grow digital. But there's a lot of other places in safety and security where you can make good money and good revenue for providing a service that people can opt into and use. That's what we're trying to do.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Jim, are you on mute?","Operator","And we'll move on to the next question from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Look, I wanted to ask about how you think your positioning might be in a post-Visa\/Visa Europe environment if they were to consolidate. We've heard some opinions that it could be a benefit for you guys given that obviously pricing can become more rational. And maybe you could touch on that, as well as maybe market share. Just given that right now obviously Visa Europe's owned by the banks; some of that loyalty may break apart.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's a lot of questions back and forth on Visa and Visa Europe. I think we've answered them a few times now, but I'll go over a couple of parts for you. And the first one is that whatever price and whenever the deal happens, there is going be some period of time during which the integration of these businesses from a technology, culture, operation point of view, will take some energy, effort, and dedication. And we've seen that in our prior transactions in MasterCard even before I joined. Not just at the IPO, but even before the IPO with the purchase of Europay. And there is a fair amount of work and challenge that needs to go into it. That'll happen. When that's done over a period of some years, there's no doubt that one of the things that we do use today to go talk to global banks or global merchants \u2013 and recognize there aren't too many global banks left, but there are global merchants \u2013 the ability to offer a unified proposition. That one, which was unique to us in some ways, will no longer be unique to us. And that'll change the competitive landscape in some ways when this integration is completely done.","In the meanwhile, there'll be lots of moving around and lots of opportunities. And you yourself raised some of those around maybe it's pricing, maybe it's deal terms, and all those could be interesting ideas for us to explore. We're going to try. And as you can imagine, we've got people who have been thinking about this for a while. I'm pretty certain that as Visa is going through their thinking, they've got people thinking about how to prevent that from happening, and that's the usual game in B2B. It'll be a lot of fun.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just my quick follow-up is on the regulatory changes in Europe also, that's something that's been presented as an opportunity and obviously an impact. Have you quantified any of that? It's obviously in your guidance already, but have you really counted on any market share gains on the local networks into your guidance? And then thanks a lot, guys.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","So the only thing that we comprehended in our long-term guidance is what we have been doing over the last many years. As you know, we've been gaining market share profitably in Europe over many, many years, and you know that our business is in the mid-teens kind of really driving very significant bottom line results for us. That's the kind of continuation that we baked in. We did not bake in anything above that.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful, guys. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah, hi. I was just hoping you could help me think about some of these recent co-brand deals where interchange has been presumably guaranteed at a much lower rate. In these warehouse deals like Costco and Sam's Club, where you might see a large influx of small-business spend because of the nature of those businesses, how do you reconcile for the bank where interchange has been cut down to 40 basis points but they might have a small business card with 150 basis point cash back and no receivables balances that roll over? I mean, I would imagine there's got be over the coming years some breaking point in this paradigm where something has to change.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Craig, I mean, that's a very specific certain aspect of our business, right, and I don't know all those numbers you just talked about because some of them are unfamiliar to me and probably known to somebody else who may have done deals of that type. But I don't know about those.","I do know that at the end of the day, interchange, which was once upon a time, many years ago, just basically a announcement that went out with some kind of levels built in for category of spend, over the years, as you've noticed in many parts of the world, interchange discussions aren't that inflexible, and they do have discussions with merchants. It's not just in the United States; it happens elsewhere as well. If you, for example, were to look at the interchange on a high-value payment for electricity bills or for utilities, it's very different from the interchange in a different kind of store. And so, in a way, in fact, the setting of merchant discount rates and interchange based on these kinds of conversations between merchants and acquirers and networks and issuing banks is part of what the industry is dealing with. And I don't know that that's such a bad thing.","I think in fact if anything, it makes some of the claims of there being only a one-sided perspective of this pricing being one way a little less tenuous, a little less provable, because if these transactions are being discussed, then at that point of time, that means there's a relatively open negotiation between some categories of merchants and some acquirers and some issuers and some networks and so on. I don't know that all of that is a bad thing. And I think the fact that rewards are in some cards and some cards may go to one merchant which may have a different interchange flow, makes you think that the only revenue stream for a card is from interchange, and I think that's inappropriate too. There are multiple revenue streams into a card, multiple revenue streams into an issuer, multiple revenue streams that get used for providing a series of consumer benefits across tens of millions of merchants, not one. So I wouldn't try and equate one merchant with one card. That's kind of not how this business is built.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","And then if I can follow up quickly. We've seen Congress look at why merchants are not getting any break for putting EMV in place if it supposedly will lower fraud costs. It just seems like the networks are missing an opportunity to grab the narrative. You have the most secure technology seen in payments ever with tokenization biometrics out there. I mean, it would make sense to me to grab that narrative back. And say you put in this capability and we will offer a discount, but you have to do this for us, and we'll reciprocate. I'm not trying to (54:51) -","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Craig, the liability shift is what that's all about.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Exactly.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's exactly what the liability shift is. It is actually about saying...","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Understood.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...that if a merchant were to put in the appropriate level of terminal and type, they will have the benefit of that. That's exactly what it is.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Understood. But you have a technology out there that goes beyond EMV.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, no, no. Not \u2013 but...","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","And there's...","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...digital is a very small start. And we are still talking \u2013 look, 1% of the transactions are right now in a mobile phone in some cases in certain markets. 99% of the stuff is still happening in a certain way. Even e-commerce, in browser-based payments, e-commerce is 6% or 7% of retail transactions in the U.S. So I'm very focused on making sure that we get the EMV done. Get the liability shift discussion out there. Have it established. Have it be the way in which the system is set. And I'm sure over time, when the digital space becomes larger, similar logic will prevail. I don't know exactly how it'll prevail. I don't know what the nature of it will be. So I'm not going to speculate. But one step at a time. This itself to me (56:03) the liability shift, you remember, when we first announced it a couple of years ago, we were pretty much out there on our own for a while. Because it's new. And it needs to settle in. So I say watch that space over time as it grows.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Tom McCrohan with CLSA. Your line is open.","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, guys. And I just had a question on the appetite that you're seeing in your conversations with your largest issuers to invest in new client acquisition, particular given that rates still are low; are they waiting for rates to go higher before they do that? And there seems to be a lot of turmoil in the market, and particularly at American Express with all the management changes. I'm just wondering what kind of conversations you're having with your largest issuers?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Tom, my sense is that over the last year or two, a number of the larger, and even some of the medium-size and smaller issuers, are clearly back in the market with an appetite for driving consumer acquisition. And I mean that in the credit-debit kind of space. Prepaid has been growing for a while. Commercial's been growing for a while. Some banks even during the crisis were able to sustain their ability to keep acquiring. You know that they've come out of this with the right vintages. And you can see the result in their growth rates of card ownership and spend rates. Others had to hold back for a while and are now back in the market.","I kind of see things happening. I don't think that card acquisition growth rates are being held back only by rate differential. It's also by their comfort around credit quality. And in fact that's where it starts from. And you can see that as credit quality for the banks has improved, delinquencies have come down, write-offs have come down. Their whole approach to being thoughtful about how to acquire consumers is very much back in the space.","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. You're now a few quarters in to the APT and 5one acquisitions. Can you just, Ajay, give a little bit of an update on how you feel like those are going, what kind of traction you're seeing incrementally on the merchant side as a result?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","APT actually is just a quarter. The second quarter's now, right. So it's very new news, but making good traction with APT. We've actually got a number of deals that are in different stages of either having been signed and getting implemented as pilots, because that's typically how this \u2013 it's a Test & Learn thing. That's what APT's into. You tend to start at the pile of the client. If it works well, you'll get a bigger piece of business from them in order to move into a different space. And that's pretty much what's going on.","We're actually very excited about APT. It's got a huge potential for us in merchants. Remember, the best part about APT is that the data doesn't have to leave the merchant shop. It stays into the merchant shop. What's built into the terminals at the merchant shop is different tools that the APT team develops with their intellectual property on the Test & Learn capability. So it makes merchants far more comfortable. Our anonymized data can be used to make that tool even more predictable, but that data doesn't leave their shop. So it's actually a pretty interesting opportunity.","5one, 5one was a much smaller business when we bought it, but it's completely integrated into what we're doing and giving us a great deal of merchant traction across the world. They were very focused on a few markets. It's moving to other places, and you saw us, when Kevin Stanton was standing up at the Investor Day recently, he talked about examples of what we were doing with merchants, and that's where we're headed. I'd say watch the space. It's early days. We're beginning to see good relationships and frequent repurchasing from the merchants of things we're doing with them. It will take us three, four, five years to make this what we want it to be, but we're very focused on it.","Martina Hund-Mejean - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, and, Lisa, what's good is even early days, I mean, even for 5one which we've just about had for a year. So for both 5one and APT, we already put some points on the board in terms of real agreements that are driving some revenues for those businesses. And that's very gratifying to see.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Certainly. The final question is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. My question's probably a little far afield, but there's a lot of energy going into this topic, and I'm interested in your perspective on how blockchain technologies or distributed ledger technologies may be integrated into remittance and payments generally and specifically what MasterCard's activities are in the space. Now, ignoring Bitcoin. I have no interest in that. Really just blockchain technologies, please.","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Ken, I think blockchain's got potential. I've said this publicly quite a few times now on different panels and statements that I make. I think the real issue here will be will legal dispute settlement systems accept a distributed ledger as a way of resolving a conflict if and when it were to arise between a payer and a receiver?","Finally, the whole payment system works on two or three things. Trust that the money will get there. Two, that it will be accurate. Three, that if it's not accurate there's a methodology to get your money back. I think that's going to have to be both the methodology of reaching people, which in this case if there's a distributed chain that you don't know who the hell they are, that's a little complicated. And then alternatively, a legal settlement process that you have recourse to.","I think all that needs to be figured out. In addition to the basics, which is, will all this be accepted for in the case of remittances and other things? Will it be accepted for the right kind of level playing field by the regulators on KYC and Anti-Money Laundering and those kinds of things? I believe that over a period of time either the blockchain the way it is today or some derivative of it as we all experiment and evolve with it and engage in a dialogue with it, I'm sure it'll have a role to play, whether it's in remittance and payments or it's in different kinds of record-keeping audits and asset transfer audits, a mix of all those, I don't yet know. But I think not engaging with it would be a serious error.","And a lot of people in our MasterCard Labs \u2013 Garry Lyons, actually if you ever run into him \u2013 that would be a good guy to talk to about this. He knows more about this than I'll ever learn. And he will tell you that we've been experimenting in this space for a while. We've got patents in the space. We've got experimentations and lab designs in the space. We've got investments with venture capital firms in the space. We've got investments directly in companies in that space to learn and I guess make our mistakes along the way, but that's what we're doing.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Barbara L. Gasper - Executive Vice President & Group Executive","Ajay?","Ajay Banga - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So thank you all for your question. I'm going to leave you with a very short list of a few closing thoughts. And the first is I continue to think our business is performing well. You can see that reflected in our continuing strong volume, strong transaction growth. Global economic uncertainty remains. We are seeing that in the periods of growth in some regions in some aspects, as the first question I got about cross-border. We're pleased with the progress of the rollout of EMV in the U.S., continuing to build on our momentum with MasterPass and MDES and tokenization in the digital payments space, but it's early days. We remain focused on driving future growth opportunities while managing what we're going through today and the needs of our business today.","So thank you so much for your continued support of the company, and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
