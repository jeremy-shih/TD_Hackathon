If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this moment.","Now, I will turn the meeting to President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Martin Mucci. Sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Great, thank you and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning before the market opened we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2014. We will file our Form 10-Q which provides additional discussion and analysis of our results for the quarter within the next few days. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.","On today\u2019s call, I will review highlights from the second quarter and our operations, sales and product development areas, Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance, and then we will open it up for your questions.","We were pleased with the second quarter results. We continue to see growth and have good progress on our key initiatives. Payroll revenue continues to advance as a result of increases in revenue per check and client base growth. HRS revenue grew at double-digit rates in the second quarter led by our success in selling HR outsourcing solutions to our clients.","Total service revenue increased 10%. From the sales perspective, we saw continued progress during the second quarter, particularly in our Paychex HR services and retirement services. We are fully staffed, rep retention and development is on track, and we have continued to be successful in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements as well as increasing our web leads in addition to our CPA referral channel.","Our partnership between our selling organizations has never been more efficient as they help our clients realize the full value of the breadth of services that Paychex has to offer, including our newest offering stratustime, the leading cloud-based time and attendance solution in the market from the addition of our nettime solutions company acquired last June.","We are also seeing an increase in the sales of our healthcare reform related product. We are in a unique position with both payroll data and insurance agency to offer our clients assistance in value and understanding the impact and requirements of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on their business and their employees. We can bring clients great value by helping them navigate the complexities of the act and stay in compliance with their requirements.","From a technology perspective, we continue to focus on bringing industry leading products and enhancements to the market to meet the growing needs of our clients. Our innovative leading edge technology coupled with our exceptional client service we believe sets us apart in the market. During the second quarter, we introduced Paychex Flex, a product offering which integrates our leading edge software-as-a-service platform with our newly expanded service offerings. Paychex Flex offers powerful capabilities and a simple user experience that responds to the needs of our clients across the human capital management spectrum. Our new service initiatives offers clients the flexibility of choice for their service needs. This approach gives clients access to a variety of customer service options based on their size and complexity, including our new 24\/7 customer service center. Paychex Flex offers a unique blend of both software and service and we believe again it differentiates us Paychex in the marketplace.","In Q2, we also enhanced our mobile app with the introduction of Paychex Time, a mobile time punch app that offers the quickest mobile punch possible. This app enables client employees to securely record their hours and avoid time consuming log-ins.","In summary, we are pleased with our continued execution of our sales and service teams, our product strength and the financial performance. And I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team across the country and in Germany and Brazil.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty and good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call \u2013 during today\u2019s conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risks, refer to the press release for a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. You also may recall that during the latter part of last year, we have introduced new health insurance offering within our PEO. For PEO clients and worksite employees, due to the self insurance provisions within the new offering, we began classifying certain PEO direct costs as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. This change had no impact on operating income. This new product offering had an impact on our fiscal 2015 second quarter and 6-month results as it was not initiated until the second half of fiscal 2014.","As Marty indicated, our second quarter financial results for fiscal 2015 represented continued progress from the solid start we had for the year. Here are some of the key highlights. I will provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2015 outlook. Total service revenue grew 10% for the second quarter to $666 million and 9% to $1.3 billion for the six months. Interest on funds held for clients increased 4% for the second quarter and 3% for the six months to $10 million and $21 million respectively. These fluctuations were driven by an increase in average investment balances.","Expenses increased 10% for the second quarter and 11% for the six months primarily in compensation related costs and PEO direct costs. The increase in the portion of PEO direct costs is the result of the new health insurance offering, which accounted for approximately 4% of total expenses for both the quarter and the year-to-date periods. The increase in compensation related costs was driven by higher employee benefit related costs mostly medical costs along with higher sales headcount and performance based comp costs. We also continue our investment in our product development and supporting technology.","Operating income net of certain items increased 9% for the second quarter and 7% for the six months $260 million and $517 million respectively. We maintained strong operating margins and anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance range, which I will discuss shortly. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.47 per share for the second quarter and 7% to $0.94 per share for the six months. Net income increased 9% to $173 million for the second quarter and 7% to $344 million for the six month.","Payroll revenue, payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the second quarter and six months. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting along with the impact of increased product penetration. We saw a moderation in the growth in checks per payroll. In Q2 expect that that will continue through the year. HRS revenue grew 21% for the second quarter and 19% for the six months. The increase reflects an increase in PEO revenue as a result of the new minimum premium plan that I referred to earlier. This represented approximately 7% of total HRS service revenue for the quarter and six month periods. In addition we experienced strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex\u2019s HR, all of the metrics \u2013 operational metrics on the HRS side are trending very positively. Retirement services revenue benefited from pricing together with increase in the number of plans and average asset value of participant funds. Our online HR administration products contributed to the growth through sales success of SaaS solutions.","Turning to our investment portfolio, our goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We invested in high-quality lower risk instruments primarily variable rate demand notes and bank demand deposits for short-term funds of mutual bonds for the longer term. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the second quarter and six months consistent with the same periods last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the second quarter and six months primarily driven by wage inflation together with growth in the client base.","I will now walk you through highlights for our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $928 million as of the end of November and no debt. Funds held for clients as of October \u2013 November 30 were $4.0 billion compared to $4.2 billion as of May 31, 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.6 billion both the quarter and six months. This reflects growth of 4% for both periods. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $1.8 million reflecting $276 million in dividends paid during the six months and 1.3 million shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 35%.","Cash flows from operations were $405 million for the first six months, a slight increase from the prior year. This change was the result of higher net income on cash flow from operations offset by fluctuations in working capital. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll income tax and other liabilities. All of these were affected by cut offs in a given month. It is common for working capital to fluctuate between quarters.","Now let me turn to guidance for the remainder of the year. I would like to remind you that our outlook is based on current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes and that is our expectations and our guidance is unchanged for the year. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 10% but the ranges for payroll and HRS consistent with previous guidance.","Let me provide additional color on the second half of the year. We expect that payroll services will be at the very low end of the full year guidance range in the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be above the midpoint of the range and this really just has to do with some timing of revenue shift from third into fourth quarter. It doesn\u2019t affect the year as a whole.","So, let me just repeat that again. We expect payroll services revenue to be at the very low end of the range in the third quarter, but above the midpoint of the range in the fourth quarter for the reasons that I just mentioned. We have also updated the supplemental guidance schedule to reflect HRS revenue expectations in the third and fourth quarters and you will see that those ranges have been tightened somewhat. These changes which are modest changes to update the ranges a little more precisely, so you can update your models to have no impact whatsoever on full year guidance. Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 6% to 8%. Our operating margin tax rate for the year expected to be consistent with prior guidance.","Now, I will turn it back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Great. Now, Derrick will open it up for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Alright, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. David Togut of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","David Togut-Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning, Marty and Efrain.","Efrain Rivera","Hi, David.","Martin Mucci","Good morning, David.","David Togut-Evercore ISI","Do you have any early read on the calendar year end selling season in client retention?","Martin Mucci","Yes, client retention continues to be very strong. So, we feel very good, very consistent with that and the early look obviously you don\u2019t know until it \u2013 obviously, we are through January, but it looks good to us and selling continues to progress well. It is early particularly in the small market side to know for sure, but we are, I think we are off to a good start through November and December from what we are seeing. We have got full rep headcount. We have got turnover pretty consistent to where we wanted to be and we are feeling at this point pretty good about it.","David Togut-Evercore ISI","What is client retention running currently?","Martin Mucci","I say we are very consistent still around 82%, which is basically our all-time best.","David Togut-Evercore ISI","Got it. And can you quantify for us bookings growth in the November quarter?","Martin Mucci","No, we don\u2019t really \u2013 we don\u2019t give that out. We certainly would wait until we get through the selling season before we talk about kind of how it was. We feel pretty good about it though. We mentioned in the first quarter that we felt good about Q1. Q2 was very consistent from a revenue part growth, annualized revenue sold.","David Togut-Evercore ISI","Can you quantify growth in checks per client?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, checks per client were under 1% in the quarter. I mentioned in previous calls that once we started dipping under 1%, we wouldn\u2019t call out the exact tenths of a point. We saw some moderation in checks per client. We are looking at it. It seems to be consistent with what we are seeing in the \u2013 and what seems to be happening in the under 50 space, which is around 1%, a little bit under in terms of employment growth, but we will have to say it can vary sometimes from quarter-to-quarter. This wasn't a particularly strong quarter from a checks per payroll standpoint.","David Togut-Evercore ISI","Understood. And then on pricing, can you quantify what the net price increases running after discounting?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, David, I wouldn\u2019t go any further than to say we are still in that 2% to 4% range. I feel pretty comfortable it\u2019s holding. I don\u2019t see any significant issues there.","David Togut-Evercore ISI","Understood. Just a quick final question, ADP completes their transition of their small business client base to run they say by the end of fiscal \u201815 ending June. What impact will that have in your view in terms of direct head-to-head competition versus ADP? And if you could maybe frame that in terms of any new products you have in the small business space?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So, David as far as we can understand their strategy, they appear to be obviously moving a lot of people on to their run platform and also moving a lot of people to an online service model that has some strengths and some weaknesses associated with it. We think there are challenges in the lower end to operate with that model and we think we have differentiated service that will compete very well from a platform perspective, from technology what they offer versus what we offer in the small market. We feel pretty comfortable we can compete pretty effectively and we think we have got the better service model.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think just to add to that they have been going through this platform change for a while and I think we have competed very well. In fact if you kind of look at the gains and net gain from our numbers, we are gaining slightly from that. And we always lose some and take some. And I think we are still doing very well, so we don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t really anticipate much change there. As well as Efrain said I think we compete very effectively from the product standpoint, our SaaS-based products our online interface and mobility apps I think are the best out there right now and we just continue to keep adding to them.","David Togut-Evercore ISI","Understood. Happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thanks. Same to you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Sir your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning guys. Hi, I just wanted to start with a follow-up question on the checks per client, I know you said that you expect the slowdown to continue in the second half, what\u2019s your sense of kind of where it will actually bottom-up, I know you are still trying to get to the root cause here, but do you think it could even go negative and anything you can give us in terms of sort of revenue sensitivity when this metric moves by I don\u2019t know 50 basis points or 100 basis points?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Okay. So checks per payroll when you start getting down below 1%, there is a lot of variability in that number and it\u2019s affected by the mix of what\u2019s happening with new clients compared to other clients that are trading out of the base. I think we are reaching some sort of steady-state here where that number will oscillate between flat and 1%. That seems to be consistent with what we are seeing in terms of our small business index numbers and seems to be implying and its fair \u2013 you have to be careful because this is one quarter of data. It seems to be implying that you are reaching some sort of more moderate state of employment in the small market space. We had two or three years of really strong checks per payroll and employment growth in the small business space it seems like that\u2019s starting to moderate. The impact on revenue, so what I would like to say is if you have about a point growth in checks that\u2019s typically going to give you anywhere from 25 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the mix in revenue, so it should be relatively modest. And we should settle in somewhere in that range.","Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies","And that would be specifically for the core payroll?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. It mostly affects payroll service revenue, yes.","Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies","But the 25 to 50 bps is specific to that line, not total revenue?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, that\u2019s correct. Yes, that\u2019s correct, sorry.","Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies","Okay, just wanted to clarify that. And then\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Go ahead, finish.","Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies","No, I had another question, but then you want to finish your answer. So just on the CPA referral channel, I know you had mentioned last quarter that you were penetrating some newer CPAs, but I wanted to see if there is any update in terms of latest data on percent of your new sales coming from the CPA network or what percent of them are exclusive to Paychex for payroll referrals and is there any uptick in competition for this channel?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent competition in the channel. What we were \u2013 what we have done is kind of changed the sales force around a bit to have some CPA centric reps, so where we have a lot of concentration of CPAs. In the past we hadn\u2019t done that. We have been pretty clean on the territory of who own the territory and kind of everything in it. So we have added more dedicated reps just to that CPA channel. I think it\u2019s early in that process, but we continue to get a majority of our referrals, majority \u2013 a large sense of our referrals from CPAs. And that\u2019s been fairly consistent at times. I think it\u2019s competitive I think it\u2019s picked up may be a little bit from a competitive standpoint meaning from one competitor there is really not many that come after that channel. It\u2019s really two of us. And I think there has probably been a little bit more competition from incentive to the CPA I guess I would say. But we are still \u2013 I still feel good about that. And I think we will have the best sense of that after third quarter.","Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies","That\u2019s fair. Just last question on the margins, exclude income obviously running around 39% through the first half of the year, you have got the typical I guess seasonal headwinds in the second half. I know you are still endorsing the full year range of 37% to 38%, but should we be thinking about the upper part of that range being more likely or does it feel more like kind of right down the middle sort of year?","Efrain Rivera","It feels right down the middle sort of year right now, Jason.","Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies","Okay. Okay, thank you guys. Happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. George Mihalos of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.","George Mihalos-Credit Suisse","Great, good morning guys. Efrain, I know you don\u2019t want to get too specific as it relates to pricing, but I think on the first quarter call, you had mentioned that pricing trends were kind of trending toward the midpoint of your 2% to 4% range. Would you care to update that at all or?","Efrain Rivera","I would care to reiterate what I say.","George Mihalos-Credit Suisse","Okay, perfect. That\u2019s\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I think what we see George is very consistent there. So, we are holding, we really feel like we are holding the price and the price increase and nothing has really changed in Q2 from Q1.","George Mihalos-Credit Suisse","Okay. And then I know its early days here in the selling season, but would you categorize what you are seeing so far as ahead of expectations in line with your expectations?","Martin Mucci","It\u2019s hard to say. I think I would say certainly in line if not a little positive, a little above, but it\u2019s early, but you never know especially in the small business market, because so much of it is done at the last minute and we get a lot of sales in at the last minute, but right now, I would say certainly at expectations or a little above.","George Mihalos-Credit Suisse","Okay. And just last question for me, I just want to make sure I understand it, the deferment of some payroll revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Can you just remind us again what\u2019s driving that and have we seen that before or is something going on here that\u2019s a little different?","Efrain Rivera","Well, yes, so let me explain that in two ways. So, if you look at last year\u2019s results in payroll service revenue, we started the year relatively low 2.4 accelerated in Q2 and Q3 and then ended the year at 3. That had to do with days. This really didn\u2019t have anything to do with days compare. It\u2019s simply that cutoffs in a given quarter may affect where revenue falls on the edge of one quarter or another. We looked at \u2013 there is 14 revenue streams that comprised payroll service revenue as we looked at it. Our best estimate is that some revenue that we would otherwise see in Q3, because of timing it\u2019s going to fall in Q4 of this quarter. So, it didn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t always happen, but if you look at the payroll service revenue line over the last couple of years, we see it bouncing up and down, not because it\u2019s that variable, but timing can affect it, days can affect it and that\u2019s why I caution that you really need to look at the year as a whole.","George Mihalos-Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks guys and happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Sir, your line is open.","Joseph Foresi-Janney Montgomery Scott","Hi. I guess my first question here is could you give us some sense of what the client growth was like this quarter? I know you talked about the checks per payroll, but I was wondering how is that been trending?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So, Joe what we said was we had a goal of growing clients 1% to 3%. We certainly feel pretty comfortable about where we are in that range and we got off to a good start through the first 6 months. Feel like we are on track in terms of where we expect to be in the year in that range.","Joseph Foresi-Janney Montgomery Scott","Got it. And then on the year-over-year revenue growth has ticked up over the last couple of quarters, can you give us a sense of how much of that is associated with this, I guess either new business or penetrating your own businesses versus the general macro backdrop?","Efrain Rivera","Well, I think it\u2019s probably a little bit of all. When I am asked that question, I say we could statistically say its 95% execution. The reality is you need a better environment. So, the environment is better. Our execution is better. Pricing is a little bit better. And the opportunity in the under 50 space overall was better and we are executing better against it. So, I think it\u2019s a mix of all of those issues. I would say though that our execution on the sales side has been really strong. And it\u2019s been strong for a number of quarters now and we feel pretty comfortable about where we are positioned competitively.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I agree.","Joseph Foresi-Janney Montgomery Scott","Are there any, I mean, I guess just two parts to the last question, any metrics that you can provide that you would like to share with us about the execution on the sales front. And then the second part of that question and it\u2019s more of a competitive one, a lot of potential competitors have gone public, are you seeing them in the general arena or any change in the competitive environment?","Martin Mucci","I will take the last part and then turn over to Efrain and I think we have seen the \u2013 certainly some of the more competitors showing up in that mid-market space in particular. And but I think we are doing well against them. In fact we have \u2013 they are going to pick off some clients at some point because they are new in the market and they have got something to show. What we have done is started to win back some already which we think is a very positive thing. And overall it\u2019s not having any sizable difference to us. So I think while they are out there, I think we have invested very well in the past particularly past three or four years and it rolled out a lot of products now that I think has positioned us very well against competitors. So I don\u2019t \u2013 while they out there, we still have the widest breadth of services to offer and certainly the best service and service options along with the mobility. And when you think about all the interconnection, it depends on the client, but when you think about all of the service offerings that we have to connect you and a platform of 401(k) payroll HR administration, time and attendance, etcetera it makes us a much better from a competitive standpoint. Efrain you\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Actually other thing Joe is that we call it out in the press release what we don\u2019t give the specifics when we get to year end you can calculate the number. We talk about revenue per check and revenue per check is a combination of number of things that obviously includes pricing. But I think what you are seeing there is sales to a little bit bigger client on the core payroll side and more sales of the precisely the kinds of products that Marty just mentioned to that sales force. Our cross-selling abilities have never been better and our team selling has never been better. So I think it\u2019s all of those working in combination. And while it\u2019s easy to look at just what\u2019s happening in payroll service revenue and ignore what\u2019s happening in the HRS, the reality is that there you have to look at both and our growth rate is a combination of ability to do both of those things well.","Joseph Foresi-Janney Montgomery Scott","Thanks. Happy holidays.","Efrain Rivera","Sure same to you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Sir, your line is open.","Kartik Mehta-Northcoast Research","Hey, good morning Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Good morning Kartik.","Kartik Mehta-Northcoast Research","Both of you talked about selling season being good and I think you have given some thoughts behind why and I was wondering if you look at the fundamentals or at least the fundamentals you will look at to determine this will be a good selling season or not. How have those trended and what are some of those fundamentals that you would look at that kind of predict how the selling season is going to go?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think one \u2013 at this early stage you will \u2013 obviously you look at submitted we don\u2019t get into that amount of detail, but you look at what kind of sales have been submitted already. And as Efrain mentioned that\u2019s not only payroll but that\u2019s the PEO business, the 401(k) business, etcetera because you will get a sense of those a little bit earlier and even then small business payroll and things look pretty solid to us. The other thing you look at is what\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a little more subject to what\u2019s the pulse of the sales folks and the sales leadership and it\u2019s pretty strong right now. As Efrain mentioned we got great teams selling going on, we got retention in good place. We got full reps all out there, all positions are filled, in fact we are a little slightly over so all the positions are up and running. Leads are coming in very well. So I think all those early signs we hate to talk about it until the third quarter is kind of over and you will get a sense of it. But it\u2019s a pretty good sense right now of what we are seeing and again you really to see January to know. But it\u2019s a good sense. And competitively we feel very good. There is not a lot of things that are popping up competitively that are saying, hey there is someone out there with a real aggressive pricing like we have had years ago that was really taking some share at a very low price or high, high discounting or something. We are not seeing anything like that. So we feel we are competing very well and the products are going over really well. The retention also looks good at this point. So you don\u2019t know again. But again retention we are at our best ever and that feels good.","Kartik Mehta-Northcoast Research","And then Marty in the press release you talk about the minimum premium health plan that doing really well, is that strictly a reflection of the ACA what your customers are trying to do or are there other drivers helping that business grow?","Martin Mucci","I think talking about that plan specifically to the PEO and we introduced it in the last half of last year. I think what that really implies is the PEO is doing well. So, right now in the marketplace, PEOs come on very strong and we certainly have felt that kind of from the end of last year through this year, little slow at the beginning of the year starting, but we seem to picking up great momentum. I think some of the target is definitely healthcare reform. They are looking for the strength of coming into a co-employment position, but I also think we are having great sales execution in the PEO side. We also \u2013 we expanded it. So, we are selling \u2013 while you still sell the majority in PEO kind of \u201cstates,\u201d we are selling it nationwide and we are getting very good sales execution on the PEO side, something we have been in the long time, but we think the product and the sales team are really kind of hitting at their peak right now.","Kartik Mehta-Northcoast Research","And then just one last question, Efrain on the float portfolio, any thoughts about changing investment strategy or any other aspects of it considering the rate environment?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, you know Kartik, that\u2019s a good question. So, our duration now is 3.2 and our yield is about 1.6% on the long end of the portfolio. You can see if you look at that line that we are ticking up gradually. We obviously invest differently than they repeat us. We don\u2019t push everything out longer term. Look, we have a conversation about that in the spring. We will take a look at it. I don\u2019t anticipate any major changes. We were very, very positive about rate changes 3 to 4 weeks ago. And now, I am thinking that while we will see some rate changes they are going to be moderate. And so you are going to have to think about how you position the portfolio in that environment and we may be there for a longer period of time. So, yes, we will give some thought to that as we get into the back half of the year. I don\u2019t anticipate a significant shift, but it looks like we have got low interest rates here for some more time given the collapse in oil prices.","Kartik Mehta-Northcoast Research","And thank you very much. I hope you guys have a great holiday.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you too.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Efrain Rivera","Hi, Gary.","Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets","I guess on the HRS revenue growth, you have given and I guess you have updated this morning this chart of how adding in the new health plan changes the growth rates and that chart sort of implied 4% acceleration Q1 to Q2 in HRS revenue. Is that really why we see the acceleration or is the underlying momentum in the business adjusting out the impact that the revenue recognition change is having? Is it really picked up momentum?","Martin Mucci","We saw some improvement in the second quarter. So, we had versus first quarter Gary. So, we had strong performance literally against every single product line and insurance which started a little soft in the first quarter for us had a good quarter. In the second quarter, we expect that to continue. So, we anticipate that we will continue to have strong performance to the balance of the year.","Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And so the deceleration implied in the back half is more just how it flows through and then started to lapse some of that revenue being in last year, not anything about underlying?","Martin Mucci","No, no, sorry Gary, I probably misunderstood your question. That\u2019s correct. So, what happens is in the back half, you anniversary the changes in the minimum premium plan. By the time you get to the third quarter, you are getting about roughly about half of the impact and by the time you are in fourth quarter, you have anniversaried it completely.","Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets","Great. And then on the PEO and more broadly HRS strength, I mean, there are several competitors that are public now that we see PEO seems to be doing terrific everywhere. Do you have any \u2013 and obviously there seems to be some benefit from health reform, but do you have any fears that sort of demand is being put forward with everyone doing well or it sets up really difficult comparisons once we get into calendar 2015 and more of the mid-market customer they have to be in compliance? And so then you have sort of done that or is this got people really more willing to consider the benefits of this model and you think that the momentum can remain for a while?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, at some point the growth itself from PEO will slow down a bit. It\u2019s early to talk about where we are in terms of \u201816, but we have had a strong year and a half with respect to PEO. We will see where we end the year. Marty was mentioning about sales season, sales season and Q3 is important for the PEOs where we end up they will give us a good indication where we are from \u201916. But and I will let Marty talk specifically about employees \u2013 employer shared responsibility which is also an important component of our thought process, but it certainly gets the conversation about PEOs going in a way that probably was different than two or three years ago.","Martin Mucci","I think also I would \u2013 as Efrain said obviously when you look year-over-year and when you get into \u201816 there will be tougher comparison on the PEO side, but I think we are very - still very early stage on healthcare reform. As Efrain mentioned our healthcare reform product is just starting to pickup steam now and we really had it in place before anybody a year ago. But with all the delays and the changes in the regulations, I think it took a while to get going. But we are seeing a nice pickup now from healthcare reform whether it\u2019s PEO or not. And I think this will just add to it. So I think it\u2019s still pretty early and I think this will give us some growth for certainly for the rest of this year and then into next year.","Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets","Great. And then just one last one, on the strong HRS growth has \u2013 if we look today versus say two or three years ago has the mix of what\u2019s coming up sell to existing customers who may have already been a payroll client versus new customers that just want these services and you sell them because they are interested in the HRS maybe more than being legacy payroll, has that changed at all or is it really the same mix and sales process that you have been executing for\u2026?","Martin Mucci","It\u2019s similar, although I think a couple of things have picked up. One, Efrain mentioned insurance and health insurances has picked up particularly recently and so that\u2019s in there and that started to pick up again. I think 401(k) was very strong a few years ago and it\u2019s kind of leveled out, it\u2019s got nice growth, but the fastest growing is HR outsourcing whether it would be the PEO model or the ASO model or our kind of phone support model. All of those I think the HR support has seen the fastest growth in the last two years anyway and that\u2019s picked up a little bit faster in the mix of things. And I think that\u2019s just the fact that you have seen HR outsourcing and the complexity of HR come down in the client base. So where it used to be that was the 50 plus or at least 30 or 40 plus, that\u2019s coming down more and more into where we have a lot of clients. And so I think we have gotten very good at selling the value of HR supports at various levels to smaller clients. And Efrain mentioned earlier, the team\u2019s selling approach that we have gone to which is if a client is of a certain size, we go in with multiple sales teams together on the front end instead of coming at them after they have payroll I think has also helped to helped to get that growth going higher.","Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Tim McHugh of William Blair. Sir you line is open.","Tim McHugh-William Blair","Yes. Thanks. I guess can you update us I guess at this point in terms of how much is the sales force or your sales resources kind of up year-over-year as we go into the selling season and is that a fair bogie for how you think about it, I know you said 1% to 3% client growth for this fiscal year, but a lot of that was dictated by last selling season, so I am trying to get a sense for how we should ballpark kind of what the potential is for this upcoming season in terms of client growth?","Martin Mucci","I think from a sales headcount perspective I would say it\u2019s up around 4% maybe 4% plus a little bit, so a little stronger and we were kind of holding constant for a few years. Last year we were up a bit and this year we went up again across the various sales organizations around 4 plus or a little bit over 4% against.","Efrain Rivera","I didn\u2019t catch the second question back half\u2026","Tim McHugh-William Blair","And is it fair to think about the target and I guess for client growth would be around that number, I know you said 1% to 3% for this fiscal year, but I would assume most of that was driven by last year\u2019s kind of selling season?","Martin Mucci","No, I would that just start by saying, remember that sales team is across all divisions. So it\u2019s not so much on the payroll growth as we have probably seen more increases in the HRS teams as well and also we have moved up some of the virtual sales teams on some of the products like time and attendance and merchant services and so forth as well. So it\u2019s a mix across that Tim. So I wouldn\u2019t say that that necessarily have given you anything on the client growth. The client growth we still think we are in that 1% to 3%. Okay, Efrain takes over them, yes.","Tim McHugh-William Blair","Okay. And then the new PEO or kind of the new health insurance product, I get a lot of the focus, I mean, there is an accounting impact of just adding that in there, but how is the client reaction I guess then as we look back at this point? It feels like it\u2019s been adopted a little more broadly even then you would have thought? And I think the follow-up is how \u2013 what does that imply? I think you only were started doing this in a few markets initially, so do you get more aggressive what\u2019s rolling this out?","Martin Mucci","Yes, sorry go ahead.","Tim McHugh-William Blair","No, that\u2019s it.","Martin Mucci","I think of it as really two different. I just don\u2019t want to mix up two different things there. There is the healthcare plan, where we took on more in the PEO and that was primarily in Florida and that\u2019s the market that we are trying it there. So, you are right there, we are doing in Florida. We are getting good feedback on that. It gives us more flexibility on the rates and in the whole process of how we sell and so forth, we have gotten good feedback on that and that\u2019s part of our PEO growth I believe that you will see continue. On the healthcare reform specifically, we have introduced the product across the country and that\u2019s not just PEO, that\u2019s to all clients and its various products of helping them, but primarily helping them understand and give them reporting on the number of clients that they have as full-time equivalents whether healthcare reapplies to them. If it does apply to them, do they have all of the right things in place and how are they going to file the requirements of the health \u2013 of the Affordable Care Act. So, I would say both, they are a little bit different. I don\u2019t know if you were combining them or not, but the PEO is going well there in Florida in particular. We reintroduced that plan. And then the healthcare reform products as we talk about there is really the reporting and the compliance and that\u2019s across the country and that\u2019s really this second quarter just started to really start to pickup some steam. So, we are anxious to see how Q3 goes.","Tim McHugh-William Blair","Okay, right. Yes, I was talking more of the Florida product I guess what would you want to see to take that more broadly across the rest of the country?","Martin Mucci","It\u2019s just a matter of Tim you get the right plans in place and is the risk reasonable for us to take on. This is where we are taking on more of the risk ourselves and we felt it was certainly a very big PEO market when you think of really two or three key states for PEO at least right now. That was a good one to take on. It was worth it because of the size of the market, the number of sales we have there and of course the plan we are able to get and workout through the Florida Blue. So, we continue to look at those all the time and we are looking at them around the country as to whether that\u2019s the right move or not. It\u2019s the combination of all those things.","Tim McHugh-William Blair","Okay. And if I could slip in one more, there is just this weak news of a new legislation around that PEO sector in terms of having some certification and you are kind of clarifying some of the tax simplifications of adopting a PEO I believe. Can you give us your thoughts on, is that meaningful as you think about the growth of that business?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So, you are talking about, I think it\u2019s called SPEA, another great government acronym. At the margin, it\u2019s positive for PEOs. It recognizes them as an important solution within the marketplace. There was some ambiguity about how the government was going to look at PEOs. And we think that it\u2019s just going to make the attractiveness of that offering greater in the marketplace, where we are digesting all of the provisions of the legislation, but we think at this point our compliance group, legal group think it\u2019s going to be positive for a PEO.","Tim McHugh-William Blair","Okay, great. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Take care.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Smitti Srethapramote-Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. So, there has been lot of tension on the growth in the FSA and HSA\u2019s accounts in the U.S. Can you talk about what role you expect Paychex to play going forward whether it\u2019s continuing to work with partners or becoming more directly involved and how big an opportunity could this market be?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think FSA has come under some pressure because of some of the changes on it and so forth in legislation and the deductibility of it and everything. I think that\u2019s going to slowdown a little bit. I think HSAs will become stronger. I think that what you will see there is it gives us more opportunity, because I need more health plans and this could be through the agency as well through our insurance agency, you will see more health plans go more toward HSAs. They are going more toward obviously the high deductibles and then giving HSA money to employees. I think it\u2019s an opportunity for us. I don\u2019t know how \u2013 if it\u2019s going to be a major impact at this point, but and I think you will see us do a combination of and probably always partnering to some degree with it because of the back room requirements of it, it just makes more sense sometimes to partner than to build. But we have been in FSA for a long time. I think we will be able to handle it very well and we will be \u2013 it will continue to be part of our package.","Smitti Srethapramote-Morgan Stanley","Great. And then maybe just a follow-up on the partnerships that you have developed where the companies like [indiscernible] can you talk about how payment and payment processing is going and if there is any other type of \u2013 similar types of partnerships in the pipeline?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think the [indiscernible] partnership is going well. We were a little slow on it of the gate. On the selling and merchant services, I think we felt that the field sales would be able to sell that well and they were first in for some new businesses and so they will be able to sell it. It turns out, we learned a lot in different trials on that that it\u2019s a complicated pricing structure based on your type of business and so forth and very competitive. So what we found was we now have the field sales team refer back into an internal team, which we increased the size this year and they are doing very well. So we have gotten some real traction this year on the inside team that sells basically virtually. So the field sales refers it back and inside team will then talk to the client and sells their credit card the merchant processing. And that started to pickup some real steam.","Now, it takes a lot of clients given the commission structures there to have substantial revenue given our revenue size. But we do think it\u2019s got great momentum and we are continuing to see that. So it\u2019s been a nice partnership and I think it\u2019s starting to take off. Other partnerships like that, can\u2019t think of too many other than Paychex accounting online. We have invested in with Kashoo in their Paychex accounting online. Again a little slow getting going. I think we are learning a lot about the marketing of the product and how to integrate it more into the marketing. Our clients still view us very much as the human resource outsource \u2013 human capital management, payroll and HR and time and attendance and getting them to view us as an accounting offering as well with the Kashoo product has been slower than we thought. So we are learning on that. But we are always open to that. And of course Brazil is a 50-50 partnership with Semco down there to help us get started. And I think just starting in January we are off to a pretty good start. I wouldn\u2019t give a client count at this point, but it\u2019s starting to pick up traction as well and we feel very good about that decision.","Smitti Srethapramote-Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the lines of Ms. Sara Gubins of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Ma\u2019am, your line is open.","Sara Gubins-Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question about the new platform, I had a chance to take a look at it at the recent HR tech conference and was particularly interested by the Flex enterprise platform for larger clients, I know it\u2019s really early, but I am wondering what the feedback has been from the sales force in early demos and if you think that is now fully competitive with some of the via more recent entrance at least from \u2013 to the public market? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we do \u2013 obviously we have been able to show it at some of the shows and the sales force is really picking up steam on it now. I think we sold another platform for a long time, so there was a lot of learning there and we have been enhancing it very quickly. The thing that changes so quickly today is when you release something almost every month there is a new release that\u2019s adding something to it. And so that\u2019s probably been the biggest challenge for the sales force is all the changes to it that we have been adding. That\u2019s a good thing because its added enhancements, we have gotten good feedback on it. I think the clients really like the way it shows the user interface is very simple and very direct for them. We are working on integrating more and more of the other products that we have into that. So it\u2019s \u2013 there is a full suite of products and combined with that great user interface and the mobility platform and multiple products that are going anywhere from recruiting on boarding to payroll to HR administration time and attendance, all of that\u2019s bundled in and we are giving more service options now with between user interface to mobility and 7x24 client service. I think the differentiator will be technology to some degree, but it will also be the great service that we can provide that I don\u2019t think anyone else is focused on. So it\u2019s getting good traction with the sales force and we are anxious to see the January results.","Sara Gubins-Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. Following up kind of on that theme of being able to do payroll in a lot of different forms, given all of the objects that you have been making to mobile and your platforms, are you starting to see \u2013 are you continuing to see a shift towards more online entry as opposed to phone and fax? Is there anything appreciable really happening there? And if there is do you think that we might see an operating margin benefit over time from that?","Martin Mucci","I think we are seeing some shift towards that. And it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s particularly we just saw like a big shift on mobility for like the holiday, for Thanksgiving. So, you are seeing it around certain times where \u2013 which is exactly what we like where the client has a choice each and every week or every other week whenever they do payroll. They can go mobility this week. They can go online next week. They always have their dedicated personalized service to fallback on whenever they need it and they can just call up and give their payroll over the phone as well. So, we are seeing some shift, but the thing that we are seeing that\u2019s very positive to us is that clients are using the multitude of options available to them, which is what we wanted to give. We don\u2019t want to force them to online. We don\u2019t want to force them away from a payroll specialist who gives us the great retention numbers that we have. So, I think there certainly has been some opportunities there and you will see us with our industry leading margins, you will see us continue to find ways to keep those. You may find us reinvesting as we have the last 4 years though right back into technology, because it\u2019s going to be this combination of service and technology that makes us successful.","Sara Gubins-Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just last quick question, last quarter you talked about an uptick in sales to new startups, you mentioned here it continued to strengthen under 50 and I am wondering if that sales to startups continued this quarter?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it did. We are continuing to see a positive uptick compared to last year. And so we are still seeing that the new business startups as you know I am sure still are not back to what they were pre-recession levels, but they certainly have ticked up over 700,000. They are just not quite back up from what everything we see or back up over that 800,000 level kind of countrywide. So, we are encouraged that we are seeing more sales from new businesses and that\u2019s always been a big part of our business. So, yes that has continued in Q2.","Sara Gubins-Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you, Sara.","Operator","Thank you, ma\u2019am. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Bryan Keane-Deutsche Bank","Hey, guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I just want to look at big picture, maybe Marty, when you look at payroll services growth and HR services growth and you look at the guidance, is that the right model to growth rates or you are leaving some growth on the table, just kind of how do you think about the big picture as we go out for the next couple of years?","Martin Mucci","Well, is it the right model? I think we will always see the HR service revenue growth growing faster. And I think that the good thing is there, Bryan is that we have got a lot of opportunity for when you think of the penetration rates that we are at. So, even as long as we have been in this business and successful at selling into that base, we still have low penetration rates in a lot of services right from 401(k) to insurances and so forth. So, I think you will always see that, that growth is higher. I think the interesting thing approaching $1 billion in revenue in HRS is really exciting to us and going well beyond that. Payroll service revenue growth is always to be somewhat tied to the economy, but we feel like we are executing well on everything that we can control. And I think you will see frankly a blending more of that. It won\u2019t be so much about how much is payroll service revenue growth and how much is HRS growth, but how much is the combined service revenue growth. And we are trying to continue to drive that to upper \u2013 into a consistent upper single-digits kind of place to be. And given that, then keep those margins up and expanding and we have got something very unique here. So, we are excited about how we are executing and certainly about the opportunity in front of us.","Bryan Keane-Deutsche Bank","What the acquisition pipeline look like? And is there any appetite to take on larger deals moving forward?","Martin Mucci","Yes, there is. We have come close on a few. I think that the tricky thing is the valuation. A lot of these things in the pipeline are priced or valued at almost what I would say is a perfect acquisition. So, it doesn\u2019t leave you a lot of room for error in our opinion. We have been very successful at the product tuck-ins and the acquisitions like SurePayroll that we have done. And so we are very careful about what we acquired, but the pipeline is pretty good. It\u2019s just the valuations got to be right or we are just \u2013 we are not going to do it. But we have got the cash and the flexibility. And I think we got a nice track record of executing. So we are pretty aggressive about looking at everything that\u2019s out there right now.","Bryan Keane-Deutsche Bank","And would everything be in kind of the HR area or is there certain other maybe verticals that you guys will look at?","Martin Mucci","I would say pretty much anything that we are into right now would be in our space, so anything from payroll to PEO and product tuck-ins but certainly larger deals as well. And like I said we have come pretty close. But the valuations are pretty steep and so again if we don\u2019t feel like we can make that difference we are going to be pretty disciplined in our pricing.","Bryan Keane-Deutsche Bank","Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Happy holidays. Thanks Martin.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you. Same to you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Sir, your line is open.","Jim MacDonald-First Analysis","Yes. Good morning guys, just a couple of quick follow-ups. On the HRS growth as I remember right, the 401(k) restatements has \u2013 had some impacts in the quarter, could you talk about that and was it confine to this quarter?","Efrain Rivera","Jim, it\u2019s part of your decision on pricing. HRS was strong for in virtually every single line. You make a decision as to whether you want to take that pricing or not, but in the 401(k) business in particular, we had higher assets are moved to bigger plans and that certainly played some part in it and will continue to play a part for the remainder of the year, but that\u2019s not the sole thing driving growth in that business.","Jim MacDonald-First Analysis","Right, I was just trying to figure out that was a little more than normal this quarter?","Efrain Rivera","It was a little bit more than normal this quarter, but again 401(k) part of the way that we make money in that business is a number of different streams and all them were up.","Jim MacDonald-First Analysis","Great. And another follow-up, so just on the new Flex product, could you talk a little bit more about what your primary or where you think it will sell the best which size range of customer?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think we are seeing mostly anywhere from 20 and up, 15 to 20 and up is probably going to be seeing that the most this is where they \u2013 the good news is I think that\u2019s probably been lower than we had expected for a full suite of the products. Now Flex can encompass as little as payroll and as large as the entire suite. And so I think that \u2013 but overall when you see multiple products being purchased as a bundle it\u2019s in that 20 plus which is I think a little stronger than we expected. And I think that that\u2019s because again that the market is changing and things are coming down. The need for HR administration, time and attendance particularly as the technologies made it better we just introduced Paychex Time which I mentioned. And you know here is a mobile punch that now allows you to go in and punch and actually keep the punch, keep your time open on your mobile phone for 70 \u2013 up to 72 hours, so you don\u2019t have to login again, get into your mobile app as an employee and then punch in. You can actually leave it open for multiple time periods. As that stuff gets easier and easier we are findings smaller businesses are finding big benefits. We are able to sell them on the big benefit. So we are excited about Flex and the fact that they kind of bundles all this together along with the service options. It\u2019s appealing to 20 and above, but certainly has some \u2013 it certainly fits even below that?","Jim MacDonald-First Analysis","Great. Happy holidays guys.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Same to you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Sir, your line is open.","David Grossman-Stifel Financial","Thank you. Good morning.","Efrain Rivera","David, good morning.","David Grossman-Stifel Financial","Just a couple of very quick follow-ups, I was just wondering. I assume you track some of tracking of revenue per clients and I am wondering if you could help us understand how that has been trending given all the changes in the underlying services and some of the enhancements to the products that you are making to kind of accommodate a bundled type of sale?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. It\u2019s been trending positively David. I think that what Marty was saying earlier about team selling and cross-selling, I think we have just gotten much better at understanding what a client\u2019s needs are based on size, putting the right set of solutions in front of them and because we have breadth of service \u2013 I am sorry breadth of product offering that\u2019s pretty unrivaled, we can typically get a client the solution they need from the first instance, which is a little different than what we are doing probably 4, 5 years ago where we would wait for payroll and then do the sale sequentially. So, look I wait till the end of the year to quantify it, but we are pretty pleased in terms of the revenue uplift that we have been getting per client. So, what that implies is that, that the game no longer has just simply got units and then add ancillaries, which is what we talked about 5, 6 years ago? It\u2019s really get the revenue on initial sale for the right kind of client and we are executing pretty well against that strategy.","David Grossman-Stifel Financial","Is there anyway you can disaggregate how much of that phenomenon is contributing to your growth rate? And I guess on the same line, can you help us understand the margin profile of those clients versus what they look like historically [indiscernible] payroll and other services on top of it?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So, margin profile is not significantly different than what we have seen historically. If you go back 4, 5 years, our operating income net of flow was about 400 basis points lower than it is right now. So, we obviously have been able to execute that strategy and grow margins at the same time. That\u2019s one. To disaggregate it, I need to give you year end client data and then you need to compute what average revenue per client is. So, you can get a sense of that if you do that analysis from last year. I won\u2019t \u2013 we will probably update that at the end of the year, but we are getting the pretty nice revenue uplift. And the issue is that we think that, that we can continue to execute that strategy into the future.","David Grossman-Stifel Financial","And maybe just a related question as it relates to the margin, as you think about these acquisitions that are out there and I know valuation separate issue, but as you think about that as well as some of the enhancements you are making to the platform and some of these newer segments that you are going after, is the company perhaps thinking more holistically about kind of the margin in terms of that balance between growth and margin or has there really been no change internally about that?","Martin Mucci","Well, yes, sure I mean, I think we are always looking at \u2013 we are trying to get that upper \u2013 consistent upper single-digit growth in the top line and continue to be very shareholder friendly on the bottom. And so I have the high margins, but it is a balance. If we see a good opportunity to drive growth that might hurt the margin a little bit, then we would \u2013 we are not going to hesitate to do that. It\u2019s always going be a balance. So, we want to drive both, but if in the short-term, it hurts you a little bit, I think we are willing to be able to do that. So, we are investing I think we have been very successful at over the last particularly 4 years is driving margin improvement and also investing it very heavily in technology and I see it along the same lines. We drove cost out of operations who got very productive, tried new things and still got us a great client retention and satisfaction and we funneled out those dollars into technology, where we were behind 4, 5 years ago and put us in a great spot from a technology position now and a competitive situation. So, we see the same thing with an acquisition. Hey, if we are going to take it or it takes on some additional expense, where also we are going to be able to cut to be able to offset it.","David Grossman-Stifel Financial","Right. And just one last thing then going to the international expansion, this has been a long road for you guys starting in Germany years ago and you now have this joint venture in Brazil. I mean are you getting any more encouraged or less encouraged about the ability for the model to be expanded outside the U.S. and could you share any insights into kind of where it heads out in terms of kind of taking this into other geographies?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we\u2019d like to as a team we talked about the strategy a few years ago and decided hey, look let\u2019s try to pinpoint 3 or 4 countries perhaps, let\u2019s get our thing, let\u2019s get it growing. I think there wasn\u2019t a focus on it for quite a while. It was kind of a nice idea, but it was not always a focus. We have started focusing on it. We have really doubled the size of Germany through acquisition and through additional sales people. So, we are pretty encouraged there and think that there is still opportunity there, but it has moved slower than we expected, but frankly the culture is slower to still outsource than we had expected. But so we feel pretty good about the fact that I think acquisitions are opening up as well as the opportunities for sales there.","In Brazil having only been there less than a year really I think we have learned a lot. It\u2019s also a little bit slow to come out from the CPA or the client doing it. So we have worked a very good process and with becoming the CPA\u2019s back room. I think that's brought down the revenue per client less than we expected, but it\u2019s helped to accelerate the growth in blocks. So you go to a CPA and you take their business, you build credibility with the CPA then we will move into the direct sales to the client because we will have market share and credibility and that\u2019s actually picking up some nice traction. And Semco has helped I think knowing Brazil and partnering that was a different approach than Germany, where we kind of it took us a long time because we did it ourselves. And then we are still looking at one or two countries where we can get in either through acquisition or startup primarily probably through acquisition. And we think we are trying to build it to where it\u2019s meaningful to our revenue which is difficult given where we are growing, but I still think it\u2019s a nice opportunity.","David Grossman-Stifel Financial","Okay, very good. Thanks for that and have a very nice holiday.","Martin Mucci","Thanks David.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line to Mr. Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Efrain Rivera","Hi Jeff.","Jeff Silber-BMO Capital Markets","Thanks so much. And I know it\u2019s late actually wanted to ask one question. Efrain I think you had mentioned earlier the potential impact of oil prices on your stocks regarding interest rates, are there any \u2013 is there any other impact potentially on the rest of the business from the decline in oil prices?","Efrain Rivera","No, I highlighted that because obviously it\u2019s had an impact on the Fed\u2019s thinking around interest rates. I was just reading an article before the call around what they expect to see in terms of consumer uplift. It\u2019s hard to peg any of that to have a direct impact on our business. So no, it shouldn\u2019t have an impact.","Martin Mucci","We are hoping that it brings up at least in the short-term some consumer confidence which may gives them some discretionary income to spend and it might bring small businesses up, but it\u2019s going to help small businesses a bit as it works through depending on the business. And so hopefully it has some positive impact, but we haven\u2019t seen too much yet.","Jeff Silber-BMO Capital Markets","And do you have any specific geographic exposure to the states in the U.S. that have a lot of energy production?","Martin Mucci","We are seeing that overall from our small business index. We are seeing that the Central part of the U.S. is where we are seeing the best small business job growth because you are seeing increased jobs in the drilling and fracking and so forth and that\u2019s the Central. It\u2019s anywhere from Texas to North Dakota. So it\u2019s interesting that they are having kind of the best job growth right now where the costs have come down some. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s had any dramatic effect, but I think that it\u2019s been a positive but mostly in the Central U.S.","Jeff Silber-BMO Capital Markets","Yes, I was actually looking at it from the opposite perspective with the decline in oil prices if you have seen a slowdown in job growth there?","Martin Mucci","Not that we seen, no. Not \u2013 we have not seen that.","Jeff Silber-BMO Capital Markets","Alright. Thanks so much. Happy holidays.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of S.K. Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","S.K. Prasad Borra-Goldman Sachs","My questions, firstly \u2013 Hi, how should we think about revenue per check and probably just following on one of the earlier questions when you think about it, it is dependent on pricing, but also the kind of product portfolio you have, what is the price differential between the most basic versions of products which you are selling compared to a full blown out version. And what kind of penetration levels do you have like if let\u2019s say put 100 figure to the most basic product to say 20% or 30% penetration of the full portfolio, so if you could probably give any numbers around that, that would be helpful?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Well, S.K. I think the best way, let me start with the end and then come back to revenue per check. So obviously, we think that revenue per check has been going up and will continue to grow. If you look at each of the product lines we have and I say this frequently, Marty does too that we have about 10% on average of the base penetrated right now, that\u2019s what\u2019s generating the HRS revenue. So I will let you figure out your model what that equates to, but certainly we think 10% is pretty underpenetrated for the base. And there is probably multiples of that kind of opportunity that exists within the base ignoring whether you get growth in the base, which we think will get over time. With respect to each of the products, it really \u2013 it really \u2013 it depends on the product. When you attach an HR outsourcing solution to a payroll client, you are getting multiple Xs of that payroll clients\u2019 revenue and that ranges anywhere from 1x to 2x on a 401(k) plan as I said to multiple Xs of that payroll revenue in an HR outsourcing solution. So, it really will vary depending on where the opportunity is and the rate of penetration by products, but we think we still have a long way to go in terms of getting to a point where we have saturated the base with the suite of products that we have.","S.K. Prasad Borra-Goldman Sachs","Okay. And just one other question, for the last few years, you have been exactly investing in products and a point which Marty was mentioning about continuous investments in technology and this year you have invested quite a lot around sales and marketing. So, when do you expect a more normalized investment here? Is it going to be FY \u201816, FY \u201817 yes, any views on that?","Martin Mucci","I think you will always see some growth from a sales and marketing perspective. I think just to keep up with the competitive environment I think it\u2019s fairly normalized. It wasn\u2019t a huge increase in sales and marketing, but I think when things have kind of at a normal pace, we are typically trying to grow the sales force by 3% or so. From a technology standpoint, the increase \u2013 the level of increase has slowed and I think it will be what you can always spend millions more on technology. I think we have got a great product portfolio and roadmap that we invest in and then tried to slowdown the increase of spending, but the level of spending will probably stay relatively the same. So, I think we are in kind of a normalized \u2013 we are kind of heading into a normalized period right now.","S.K. Prasad Borra-Goldman Sachs","Thank you. That\u2019s pretty much from my end.","Martin Mucci","Take care, S.K.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Sir, your line is open.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Happy holidays Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Thanks Mark.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Couple of quick questions. Just on the PEO side when you are getting new clients, are you typically seeing brand new clients to the overall solution or what \u2013 or how many of the new clients that you are getting are competitive takeaways. How would you describe that?","Martin Mucci","I think I would say it\u2019s kind of 50:50. I think we are selling into the base as well as brand new clients on the PEO concept. So, I would say probably it varies month to month, but probably around 50:50 is fair. I think we are putting a little bit more emphasis on brand new clients, because I think there is a real opportunity out there. I think our sales force is executing well and really can sell the benefits of the PEO to a brand new client and it\u2019s part of as Efrain has mentioned a number of times this kind of team selling. So, you don\u2019t necessarily have to go in and just sell them payroll. Are old model is selling them a complete suite if they need it and value it. And so you will see us focus probably some reps just on PEO selling outside the base.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Great. And I mean obviously there is a couple of states that are well-penetrated in terms of the outside of those core two, three states that are really well-penetrated. Are you seeing an increasing level of acceptance of the PEO concept?","Martin Mucci","Yes. And I think this legislation that Efrain mentioned earlier may accelerate that a little bit too, but I think so yes, we are typically Florida, Texas, let\u2019s say Georgia, I think even New York now is starting to pick up and some other states that we really haven\u2019t seen that much growth before. So, I think there is more acceptance and I think the legislation will make that even better.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Great. And then on the competitive takeaways on the PEO side, what\u2019s the primary reason why somebody would come to you from a competitive perspective?","Martin Mucci","I think the insurance plans that we have I think as well as the service and then the technology of the product that you have. And I think when you look at a few of us that are in the PEO business, I mean, there is only a few that really have that wide breadth of that. Also there is you have really got to count on somebody large and I think sometimes people go into these, there is a lot of small PEOs, I think clients go in there thinking they are going to get something that in the end, they can\u2019t provide from service and technology perspective. And just safety I guess I would say of the insurance plan. So I mean it\u2019s a combination of product offering, technology service and strength of the company behind it.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Great. And so when we \u2013 with the supplemental schedule that you provided when we take a look at the fourth quarter number for HRS is \u2013 do we have a full comp in, in terms of the insurance so that the fourth quarter is kind of indicative of the longer term growth rate to expect out of HRS?","Efrain Rivera","Okay. You are good you had me until that last statement. So I can\u2019t give you next year\u2019s guidance, but Q4 certainly is indicative of a full compare. I would hesitate, Mark to say that simply because we are having \u2013 we have been having a very strong year in PEO. When we do our plan we will figure that out. I don\u2019t anticipate it will be quite that strong.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Okay. So but we do have the full compare in terms of the insurance plans, but the factor to think about is that even though Q4 has that full compare, we are then going up against a really strong year and so therefore there should be some, but \u2013 so let\u2019s say that we end up being 100-200 basis points lower than that fourth quarter number, does that seem like a pretty good long sustainable?","Efrain Rivera","Mark so my answer, you deplorably is that we target around double digit for HRS and year-to-year that can vary a little bit, but that\u2019s kind of what we are trying to get to.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Got it. And then you said something interesting on the core payroll side which is that you are already starting to see some clients come back to you from some of the newer solutions, can you give a little more color around that?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think what we have seen, it\u2019s a small sample set, but we have seen is the service model being probably the biggest impact. I think what selling some of the new companies that have come out is user interface and technology might look good to them. The service model has not been as complete or as strong as I think as they expect. And some clients see service as possibly a commodity as there going in and it doesn\u2019t turn out to be that way. When you think of the breadth and experience that Paychex has versus some of the startups and the rate that they are trying to grow you are going to have service issues. And I think that\u2019s been the primary thing that\u2019s driven back to us.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Great. And then on the new clients that you are getting, are they typically on the smaller end of your range or the higher end of your \u2013 and I am talking about on that under 20 core side?","Martin Mucci","It will be over the 20, it will be more in that mid-market space, anywhere 20 to 200 really.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Alright. I wasn\u2019t referring to the ones that are coming back, I just meant in terms of the overall client growth that you mentioned the 1% to 3%...?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Some markets skewing smaller.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Yes. What I meant was, is it relative to where it\u2019s been historically, is it skewing even smaller?","Martin Mucci","I can\u2019t really answer that specific question, but it is in general smaller.","Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird","Okay. Great. Happy holidays again.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks a lot.","Martin Mucci","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line the Ms. Lisa Ellis of Sanford Bernstein. Ma\u2019am your line is open.","Lisa Ellis-Sanford Bernstein","Terrific, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call here at the end. If I unpacked the accounting impact, it looks like your underlying apples-to-apples margins are trending up, is that accurate. And can you give some color around that?","Efrain Rivera","They trended up from Q1 Lisa. And but \u2013 and I think I was asked earlier kind of where are we in the guidance range, we still think we are in solidly in the middle. We will see. We will update it as we go through quarter to quarter.","Lisa Ellis-Sanford Bernstein","Terrific. And then just a follow-up and on the competitive environment in the small business space, you gave a little bit of color earlier around Kashoo and Paychex online \u2013 sorry Paychex accounting online as well as your sort of net win backs that you are seeing from some of the new entrants, can you specifically give some color around into it. They have been pretty aggressive in a lot of their earnings calls talking about their traction in payroll, I would be curious to see your view on that?","Martin Mucci","Yes. We have not really seen losses to Intuit. In fact, we have seen as we dug deeper into some of the gains, we have been gaining some from Intuit on a net basis. So, we haven\u2019t seen a big impact there. I do think they go after a little bit different market while people always think that they maybe taking share from us, we don\u2019t see that. We do see they compete more with our SurePayroll, brand and company and SurePayroll is still doing pretty well. So, they still have double-digit client growth and so forth. So, I think they are still doing well and we haven\u2019t seen a big impact from Intuit. So, they maybe getting it more from those who are manual and kind of moving to a software, which is what we see happening with SurePayroll.","Lisa Ellis-Sanford Bernstein","Terrific. Thanks, guys. Happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ma\u2019am. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. [indiscernible] of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning guys. Just I will be quick, I know it\u2019s a long call. So, just clarifying on the PEO front, I am curious have you changed your sales philosophy at all with respect to pushing or promoting PEO, it sounds like you had I don\u2019t think, I believe you sell both PEO ASO together. Has that changed?","Martin Mucci","No, not really. We sell them \u2013 we do sell them together. I think I did mention though that we do think that there is a growing opportunity for the PEO. And so we are going to look at we are adding some reps that are just PEO centric. So, just kind of dedicated to the PEO, but we are still the vast majority or still selling both products, because we still think we have seen good opportunity in both of them.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks for that clarification. So just the new folks if you are bringing in are dedicated PEO, got it. And then just from the same kind of the clarification, forgive me if I missed this, just on the HRS guidance in the slides where you show the third quarter, fourth quarter guidance, it looks like it changed a little bit. So, what is that, just the math kind of thing?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. You know what, [indiscernible], so what ended up happening when we issued the guidance for the beginning of the year, the attach rates on healthcare influence the ranges that\u2019s really basically what\u2019s going on. So, we looked at where we expect to be in the third and fourth quarter and just wanted to tighten the range so that the midpoint obviously is where we think we are going to end up, but that could vary, because attach rates on healthcare can change quarter-to-quarter. It\u2019s really we are being punctilious.","Unidentified Analyst","Nice. I like that. Alright, well that\u2019s all I needed. Have a safe year end guys. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And for our last question, the line comes from the line of Mr. Matt O\u2019Neill of Autonomous Research. Sir, your line is open.","Matt O\u2019Neill-Autonomous Research","Yes, hi. Thanks for squeezing me at the end. I was just curious going back to the 1% to 2% client growth, how you guys are thinking about that? It sounds like you kind of answered it already and that the SurePayroll is still growing double-digit just as far as the mix as it starts?","Martin Mucci","We don\u2019t really break it down. I think we are seeing growth from both of us. They are a little bit faster. I remember they are much smaller base from where they are coming from. So, we are seeing growth across \u2013 kind of across the board really.","Matt O\u2019Neill-Autonomous Research","Got it, okay. And just one last follow-up if you don\u2019t mind, I was just thinking through the kind of profile of the clients that rollout of the Paychex business versus the new sort of class of clients that come in every year. Is that profiling aggregate or different? Is there anything to think about the client that\u2019s leaving the business versus the new client that\u2019s coming in? It sounds like maybe a little bit on the average number of employees coming down a little bit, but aside from that, are there any bigger differences to think about conceptually?","Martin Mucci","No, not really. I mean, we track to the last penny revenue we lose the size of client, what products they have and it really hasn\u2019t changed much.","Matt O\u2019Neill-Autonomous Research","Okay, thanks very much. Have good holiday.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Operator","And as of this time, sir, there are no further questions.","Martin Mucci","Okay, thank you. We will close the call if you are interested in replaying the webcast, it will be archived until around January 19. I thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call. We are excited about year end, a great time for opportunity to show our clients what we bring them from a service perspective is they closed it year many of them and certainly a big time for us in the selling season. And we are excited about all the work that our Paychex employees are doing. With that, we wish you all a very happy holiday season and thank you for joining us.","Efrain Rivera","Take care.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","Now I will turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July.","This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will update you on the results of our business in the fourth quarter and fiscal year and Efrain will review our financial results and discuss our fiscal 2018 guidance. After that, we will open it up for your questions.","Fiscal 2017 ended with solid revenue and earnings growth and progress on our key initiatives. Over the past three years, our service revenues and operating income have experienced strong compound annual growth rate of approximately 8% finishing fiscal 2017 with over $3 billion in service revenue for the first time. We continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of human capital management or HCM solutions. Attachment of our various HCM service modules continues to grow driving 12% growth in our HRS revenues for fiscal 2017.","Our comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions which are our ASO and PEO offerings have continued to experience strong demand in the marketplace with nearly 500 Paychex HR specialist providing service to over one million worksite employees, a milestone we reached in fiscal 2017. In addition, we have experienced strong demand for our time and attendance solutions among other offerings.","As of May 31, 2017, we served approximately 605,000 total payroll clients, consistent with a year ago. Client growth was impacted by a challenging demand environment compared to last year and a modest decline in retention. Our business model is resilient and we believe we will resume client growth in fiscal 2018. The past few months have been a time of political uncertainty and we believe this has impacted outsourcing decision-making in the mid-market in particular. We are constantly evolving to enhance our competitive position and are focused on showcasing the value proposition of our full suite of HCM solutions.","Last year in fiscal 2016, we had a particularly strong sales year across many divisions, driven in part by an increased demand for the outsourcing of HR and payroll solutions and our Affordable Care Act product in the mid-market as a result of the ACA requirements. This created tough comparisons for fiscal 2017 sales. Our fiscal 2017 mid-market payroll sales declined from the high level of activity experienced a year ago and this impacted the number and size of clients sold.","Our client retention within our total payroll client base was approximately 81% and we have been engaged in a realignment of our service organization to allow greater flexibility and customization of our service the clients receive and we completed this effort in the fourth quarter of this past fiscal year. This project included the creation of our multi-product service centers, our 24x7 dedicated service centers as well and as part of this initiative, there has been a reallocation of client service specialists and clients among different service organizations.","We believe this movement contributed to the modest decline in client retention this fiscal year, just off our near record high levels of the last year. We anticipate that retention will return to prior levels as this change is being completed and we transition back into the higher tenure. In addition, this was the first year in the past few years that we have seen a slight uptick in losses due to clients going out of business.","Small business sentiment has remained positive, however the pace of employment growth seen in the first quarter of the calendar year has reversed in this past quarter. While the level of job growth has declined, there has been a steady increase in wages. A recent survey of our small business clients shows the changes that would most benefit their future success and growth are job creation, tax reform and healthcare reform. These are all priorities of the current administration's agenda and policy changes in these areas will likely lead to more HCM outsourcing demand.","We have also seen an increase in the level of state regulations including specific minimum wage changes and over time rules even as the federal government has taken steps to reduce similar regulations. Many multi-state small and mid-size businesses should expect to experience an increased demand for outsourcing of their HR requirements given these changes and we are well positioned to support them through our technology and dedicated service.","Throughout this last fiscal year, we have continued to offer new innovations to our technology platforms and value-added service offerings. A differentiator for us is our approach to user interface design. Our mobile-first design delivers the same client experience across any device, tablet, phone or desktop. It provides our clients immediate access to payroll, HR and reporting data from a single application.","In addition to the technology innovation, we are continually making investments to respond to changes in client service needs, never losing that focus on delivering dedicated personalized service any way our clients want to receive it. In December, we were honored with the Brandon Hall Group bronze medal for the second year in a row. This award recognized Paychex Flex for the best advance in HR or workforce management technology for small and mid-sized businesses.","In May, we, we were honored to earn two Stevie Awards. One was a silver award in the Company of the Year - Large category and we also received recognition for Customer Service Department of the Year. The Stevie Awards are presented annually by the American Business Awards and are considered to be top honors for sales and customer service.","We recently also received Ethisphere's honor as one of the world's most ethical companies. This is the ninth time Paychex has been honored with this prestigious recognition and we appreciate the importance that our clients and employees place on this key value as a company.","Paychex earned placement on Forbes' annual list of America's Best Employers on the list of large employers. This recognition is a result of Forbes polling employees on everything from company culture and trends to benefits and human resources. Paychex jumped up more than 50 spots from its 2016 ranking.","And just yesterday, we announced that for the seventh consecutive year, we ranked as the largest 401(k) record keeper by total number of defined contribution plans, according to PLANSPONSOR magazine. In addition, we are in the ranking of largest record keeper by total plans with less than $10 million in assets. These honors are owed to the thousands of Paychex employees who deliver on our service premise each and every day.","I would also like to note our PEO was one of the first to be certified to provide PEO services under the Small Business Efficiency Act. To be certified, we had to meet strict auditing and reporting standards. We have over 20 years in the PEO industry and achieving this certification reaffirms our position as a leading provider of PEO services in the U.S. We are proud of our market-leading positions and drive innovations in product and service to remain so.","We continue to focus on being shareholder friendly company as well. For fiscal 2017, we returned over $800 million to our stockholders. Dividends paid were in excess of $660 million or 81% of our net income and we continue to repurchase our common stock opportunistically to offset dilution and utilized $166 million for that purpose last year. The strong cash generation in our business model allows us to reward our shareholders with a high dividend yield without constraining our ability to invest in our business.","In summary, our fourth quarter closed out another successful year for the company. In these uncertain times for our clients in terms of HR and regulatory requirements and their need to efficiently grow their businesses to recruiting, engaging and supporting their employees, we are poised as an essential partner for their success. We believe we have sustainable growth within our market ecosystem with the combination of our state-of-the-art technology, full suite of HCM product offerings and the world-class service that meets clients' needs as they grow.","I appreciate the great work and efforts of our Paychex employees and management team and I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera who will review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Marty and good morning to everyone. I would like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, refer to the customary disclosures. Fourth quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 marked continued progress. I am going to touch on some of the key highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. I will provide greater detail in certain areas and then I am going to wrap up with a review of the outlook for the upcoming fiscal year in 2018.","Total service revenue, as you saw, grew 6% for the fourth quarter to $785 million and 7% for the fiscal year to $3.1 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $14 million and 10% for the fiscal year to $51 million. These increases were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned.","Expenses increased 5% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the fiscal year. Expense growth in both periods was impacted by higher wages and related expenses due to growth in headcount primarily in our operations areas. Expense growth was moderated by lower variable selling costs.","Our operating margin was 37.4% for the fourth quarter, an 80 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. For fiscal 2017, our operating margin was 39.3%, a year-over-year improvement of 50 basis points. We continue to maintain industry leading margins while investing in our operations and in technology.","Our effective income tax was 35% for the fourth quarter compared to 35.5% in the prior year. For both the full year 2017 and 2016, the effective tax rate was 34.3%. The effective income tax rates for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 were impacted by discrete items recognized. In fiscal 2017, discrete tax benefits recognized included the impact of adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation payments. This new guidance has resulted in discrete tax benefits recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. In fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer facing software that we provide.","Net income increased 10% to $195 million for the fourth quarter and 8% to $817 million for the fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share also increased 10% to $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter and 8% to $2.25 per share for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income increased 9% for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year to $194 million and $779 million respectively. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10% to $0.54 for the quarter and grew 8% to $2.20 for the year.","Note that these two non-GAAP measures exclude the certain discrete tax items that we previously discussed. Please refer to our press release for a discussion of the non-GAAP measures and reconciliation to the related measures under GAAP. So basically what we are doing and as we talk going forward here, we are going to exclude the benefit of those tax benefits when we talk about adjusted net income.","So if you look at the slides that are on our investor page, you will see on page 16 a very clear and detailed example of what we are talking about. So if any confusion, just look there.","Payroll revenue increased 2% for the fourth quarter to $441 million and 3% to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2017. The growth in payroll revenue is largely due to better revenue per client as a result of price increases, net of discounting. Year-to-date payroll cable service revenue growth of 3% included approximately a little bit less than 1% from the impact of the Advance Partners.","Similar to the emphasis I made last quarter, with the evolving nature of our business to an HCM service provider, our offerings of bundle product products to our customers have increased. Revenue from those bundles is allocated in a portion between payroll and HRS. Payroll growth remains steady in the low single digits and HRS revenue growth reflects the sale of more services declines and greater revenue per client. Average client size, as we have discussed previously, have been trending down slightly this year and this had an impact on revenue growth during the year.","HRS revenue increased 10% to $344 million for the fourth quarter and 12% to $1.3 billion for the fiscal year. It was actually 44% of service revenue in the fourth quarter and it shows that within a short period of time we will be about half-and-half, payroll and HRS. The increase in HRS reflected continued growth in the client base across all major HCM services including comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. Retirement services also reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participants' funds.","Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our ACA compliance service as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants along with higher average premiums and an increase in our workers' comp product. For the fiscal year, the impact of the Advance Partners was also approximately 1% of the growth of HRS revenue.","Turning to our investment portfolio, our goal is the same as it's always been, protect principle and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primarily short-term investment vehicles are bank demand deposit accounts, variable rate demand notes. In the longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Our long-term portfolio has a current average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.2 years.","Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for the fourth quarter and 1.2% for the fiscal year, up form 1.1% in the respective prior year periods. During fiscal 2017, the Fed increased the federal funds rate twice, 25 basis points in December and 25 basis points in March, 2017. We have seen a modest impact from these rate increases on our fiscal 2017 results, but anticipate a greater impact in the upcoming year. The Fed again increased the market interest rate by another 25 basis points earlier this month.","The impact to net earnings of a 25 basis point increase in short-term rates is estimated to be in the range of $3 million to $4 million after taxes for the next 12-month period. It's incorporated in the guidance. We don't make any assumptions in the guidance at this stage as to future Fed rate increases, although we believe that there will be some. Average investment balances for funds held for clients were down modestly in the fourth quarter and about 1% for the year.","I will walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $777 million as of May 2017. During the fourth quarter, we ended the year with no debt. We paid down a small amount of debt that we have outstanding during the year.","Funds held for clients were $4.3 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 31, 2016. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and average $4.3 billion for the fourth quarter and $4.1 billion for the fiscal year.","Our total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $32 million as of the end of the year, compared with an unrealized gain of $40 million as of May 31, 2016.","Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of the end of the year, reflecting $662 million in dividends and as Marty mentioned, $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was not only sterling but a very sterling 42%.","Our cash flows from operations were $960 million for the fiscal year, a modest decrease from prior year. This was the result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and non-cash adjustments contributing to the working capital growth where growth in accounts receivable balances as of the end of the year from our Paychex Advance business and we had a very large client that we brought onboard testament to their success and winning business in that part of the market and that impacted balances as of the end of the year. We will see the benefits of the client as we go through next year.","We remind you, talking about guidance, that this outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes. Our guidance for the full fiscal year is as follows.","Payroll service revenue anticipated to be in the range of 1% to 2%. HRS revenue growth anticipated in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients anticipated to grow in the mid to upper teens. So that means 15% to 20% reflecting the benefit of recent increases in short-term rates.","Total revenue including interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow approximately 5%. Operating income expressed as a percentage of total revenue, anticipated to be approximately 40%. Investment income net is anticipated to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 35.5% to 36%.","Adjusted net income is expected to increase approximately 7%. Adjusted net income excludes the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2017 relating to employee stock-based comp payments. We made no assumptions as to future benefits to be recognized in our fiscal 2018 projections due to the uncertainty of measurement involved.","Please refer to our non-GAAP financial measures disclosure in our press release and our investor presentation page 16 for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to GAAP basis net income for fiscal 2017 as well as further discussion regarding our use of this measure.","GAAP basis net income is anticipated to grow approximately 5%. GAAP includes the impact of $18.3 million in discrete tax benefits recognized this year related again to that same issue, employee stock-based comp payments.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share. So now we turn to EPS, again, non-GAAP, is anticipated to grow in the range of 7% to 8%. This measure, again excludes the impact of the tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2017 related to employee stock-based comp payments. As previously mentioned, you can find it in the press release and you can find it in the investor presentation.","Now what many of you are waiting to hear, further detail on the annual guidance. So I will provide this detail on the gating for fiscal 2018. First, growth in payroll services revenue is anticipated to be within the full-year range for the first half of the year and toward the high end of the range for the second half of the year. So I am going to repeat that again, growth in payroll service revenue anticipated be within the full-year range for the first half of the year and toward the high-end of the range in the second half of the year.","Growth in HRS revenue is anticipated to be within or above the full-year range for each quarter with one exception, which is the first quarter, which will fall below the low end of the range, of the ranges we anticipate at this point that it's going to fall below that range.","Total revenue growth as a consequence, in the first quarter will fall below the full-year guidance range, modestly below but below. Growth in net income on a GAAP basis is anticipated to be essentially flat for the first quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, that's when we recognized a large tax benefit from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based comp payments. As previously noted, our guidance for fiscal 2018 does not include any assumptions around this benefit, but we anticipate we may realize a modest benefit during the year. So to just reiterate there, on first quarter we anticipate at this point that it will be flat with prior year on a GAAP basis. If you look at what we did in Q1, you will understand what's going on there.","So that concludes my discussion. And I will turn it back over to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Great. Thanks Efrain. Operator, we will now open up the call to any questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Mr. David Togut from Evercore. Sir, your line is now open.","Rayna Kumar","Good morning. It's Rayna Kumar for David.","Martin Mucci","Hi Rayna.","Rayna Kumar","Can you please call out what the 4Q 2017 bookings growth was? And if you can just discuss your expectations for FY 2018 bookings?","Martin Mucci","Yes. This is Marty. So we don't talk so much about the exact growth. I think what we saw was overall PAR sold was down from last year. It was more on a normalized basis if you look at the year before and the couple of years before. We were more on that level. Last year we peaked, in fiscal 2016 we peaked. I think with ACA we saw a lot of, not only the ACA product sales, but we saw a number of opportunities for payroll and time and attendance and other products, people made decisions because of ACA to outsource and so we had a bump up. And then this last year, fiscal 2017 we had a lower overall PAR sale than that level, but more on a normalized basis. And when we look at this year, we certainly expect the growth to be back up.","We don't really talk about exactly where we are on that, but we feel good about the changes in go-to-market strategy that we are making, some things we are adjusting to. We are increasing the spend in digital marketing because we are seeing a larger number of leads coming in, obviously on the web and we feel good about the marketing that we are doing and we are increasing that investment. And we are also increasing the number of virtual sales reps because the leads that are coming in, we need to sell even faster and clients are looking to sell them over the phone through chat, et cetera and we have positioned ourselves to be able to do that frankly and already set up that positioning in the fourth quarter. So down a bit from last year, however we feel good about going into this year. The growth in PAR sales that will bounce back.","Efrain Rivera","Hi Rayna. Our acronym internally for bookings, it's PAR, Paychex annualized revenue, if anyone is sort of wondering what PAR is.","Rayna Kumar","That's very helpful. And just lastly, could you discuss the pricing trends you saw in the fourth quarter for both payroll and HR services? And how we should think about pricing for FY 2018?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I don't think we saw any big change. I do think overall pricing competition picked up a little bit in the year, not so much in the quarter but in the year. And so we didn't feel like competition change all that much from a technology and product offering, we feel very good about that. I think pricing got a little more aggressive during the year probably because everyone faced the same issue, which was kind of a decrease in opportunities as a result of ACA the previous year. Now fewer people were outsourcing. There were fewer opportunities. Everyone got a little bit more aggressive on price. Nothing significant. And we still feel that as you look at that fiscal 2018, this new fiscal year, we should still be able to have a price increase in our normal range and we didn't have any major drop-off because of that.","Rayna Kumar","Great. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","Danyal Hussain","Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to ask, maybe first on retention. You called out that you have worked on the service initiative in part to address this. I just want to know if there's been any change so far and what have you observed, I guess at the end of the fourth quarter and so far has there been any improvement?","Martin Mucci","Yes. In the fourth quarter, what we saw was a trend of bringing tenure back up. What basically happened is and we knew there would be some client disruption because of this, over the last 18, even 24 months, we have been moving and I talked about this a little bit, we have been shifting to different client service segments. So while we have sold a lot more of our HR administration online, our time and attendance offerings, et cetera. We started moving clients to multi-product centers where we have teams of people where you just don't have payroll, but you have payroll and time and attendance and HR expertise in a team setting that is still dedicated to the client, but now you have that full team setting.","We also saw an increase in number of online clients, clients doing payroll themselves over the last few years and we shifted them to what we call a dedicated service center because they are more inbound calls, then they are our normal service model of calling out to the client at a specified time. We had more inbound kind of as the client needed the service. So we shifted them to dedicated service centers where we are open 7x24 and we have much better technology, enhanced technology that we put in place that we invested in as well as chat, et cetera, our web chat, et cetera.","So we finished that in the fourth quarter. All of that move, that disrupted some clients, meaning that a dedicated payroll specialist that I had prior, I may have lost because I moved more tenured people into multi-product centers or other areas. We then, during the course of the year, hired a number of new client service specialist who had less experience and that caused some disruption in the clients and in the level of service. And so our near record high client retention of 82% fell to about 81%.","We expect that to come back. What we have seen in the fourth quarter already, client satisfaction numbers coming back up, client service specialist tenure, so then the experience, the certification, the months of experience are coming back up as well. We are back even above where we were at the beginning of the fiscal year. So we think now we are obviously coming out of that and expect to get ourselves back up near record highs by the end of the year.","Efrain Rivera","Just to add to that, the fact that retention went down was not a complete surprise to us. We had planned it to be down about 50 basis points. Obviously, it was higher than we anticipated by the time the year concluded.","Danyal Hussain","Okay. Thank you. And then just a clarification on sales bookings. Marty, you said that you feel good about growth for the year. Has there been any change in underlying client behavior? Or is this more a function of just easier comps and the fact that you are investing in maybe some of these higher growth digital channels?","Martin Mucci","No. Well, I think it's a combination of both. I do think there was some customer behavior that changed last year which, as I described, was that the year before, in fiscal 2016 with ACA coming on very heavy in the requirements, we saw a number of new opportunities and I don't think at the time we realized as much that they were a big jump in the number of opportunities that were out there, where people said, hey, it's time for me to outsource everything, payroll, HR, et cetera.","Then in this last fiscal year 2017, those number of opportunities were decreased. There wasn't as much of a push on that. So there was a little bit of a macro change there. I do think that, as I mentioned in my comments, what we are seeing is the level of regulations, while they may be reducing on the federal level with the current administration, state regulations are increasing. Minimum wage specific to cities and states are changing. Over time rules are being put in place in states as opposed to federal. Everything is getting more complicated and we think this will produce even more opportunities. And then internally, the changes we are making with the virtual sales increase and the additional investment in marketing spend, we really think is going to drive the growth back up to where we would like to see it.","Danyal Hussain","Thank you. And maybe just a clarification on the earlier point on pricing. Was that elevated pricing competition up in the mid-market or throughout?","Martin Mucci","Mostly in the mid-market. We actually felt pretty good about the small-market this year, when you look at the total clients. And so it was a little bit more, I mean there was more competition, I think, in all markets, but I think the mid-market was a little more aggressive and I think that was folks coming, I think that was competitors also coming off of the higher year with HCA.","Danyal Hussain","Sure. Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Thank you","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open","Martin Mucci","Hi Jim.","Jim Schneider","Hello. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe just give an update and touch on the federal regulatory environment? Clearly we have had inaction on ACA Repeal-and-Replace for some time now. What are your clients in the mid-market telling you about or what's their behavior telling you about their intention to kind of put on new bookings or generate new sales in the face of that? Or we are going to have to wait until that is kind of fully resolved and baked before that part of the market gets unstuck? Are you seeing some parts of the market get unstuck now? And I guess just kind of broadly speaking, do you still see that as a headwind incorporated in your fiscal 2018 guidance?","Martin Mucci","I think there's a couple of points I would make. One is, the good news is the retention of the ACA product with our clients is very good. So even though there's all this talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act and the mandatory requirement, we are not seeing much drop-off in the number of clients in the Affordable Care Act. I think what we are seeing in the behavior is, hey, I am still going to have to do something. I may not have a mandatory requirement to hold insurance but I need to report something and I am going to stick with the product.","In addition to that, what we are also seeing the behavior is, hey once I put insurance as a benefit offering to my employees, I can't just say I am not going to offer it anymore because it's not required. It's been used to recruit and keep, retain employees of our clients and I don't think you are going to see a big drop-off of those that are necessarily providing insurance now just because the mandate is not there.","I do think though, as I mentioned that we are seeing in our jobs index that's more small businesses under 50, that there has been a drop-off of the employment growth rate. And so they are not hiring as many and I do think there is probably some of that macro out there where, hey I am a little confused as to what's going to happen on tax reform, what's going to happen with the Affordable Care Act and those kind of things.","Jim Schneider","That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up, on the HR growth, clearly the 8% to 10% growth you are calling out below this fiscal 2017 level, but I think you are indicating that that's largely due to difficult comps and ACA. So I guess maybe it's still a deceleration over the trends you have seen in the past couple of years. So how much of that is cyclical? And then as we head into the back half of fiscal 2018, what's your visibility on that growth rate kind of improving? And I guess to the point you made earlier about increasing state regulations, what opportunity do you still see remaining on HRS from a state level? And over how many states is that?","Efrain Rivera","Hi Jim. I will take the first part of that question. So the answer is, the 8% to 10% range versus double digit really has a lot to do, as you said, with the fact that our assumption is that Affordable Care Act revenue and modules are likely to be flat to down slightly with this year, given the amount of uncertainty going on and the fact that we anticipate sort of the normal amount of attrition that we see with those clients, we have not been aggressive in our assumption around what happens with ACA. And obviously we had a nice benefit from that over the last couple years. So I would say that's part A.","Part B, remember that we had about little bit over 1% contribution from Advance Partners. They are doing very well, but we obviously don't have that going into next year. So if you stripped out those factors, we are growing double digit in HRS. And I think you are absolutely right. I called out in the first quarter that HRS is below the range of total guidance for the year for revenues, just because of the comp primarily with the Affordable Care Act. As you get through first quarter, the comps get easier and then we resume more normalized patterns of growth. So in the second half, HRS growth is certainly stronger than the first half. That's at least at this point what we anticipate.","Now with respect to state regulations and all that, I will just turn that over to Marty to talk.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think from a state perspective, we are probably seeing almost half the states look for ways to put in their own regulations to make up for the federal reductions. So they are looking for minimum wage increases. They are looking to put in new overtime rules for the state. They are looking for all kinds of things and I don't think that will even, now you are even hearing about, depending on what happens with Affordable Care Act, various taxes, new taxes, payroll taxes, possibly to make up for some of the reduction and what the feds are subsidizing at the state level.","The other thing on the HRS revenues, every product, every client base or proper set we have all increased in this fiscal year. So we continue to feel really good about 401(k). We are still the leading provider of the most plans of anybody. We have over a million worksite employees, more than anyone on our HR outsourcing. And we were one of the first to be, as I mentioned, on the PEO certification. So we feel very good about HR outsourcing in particular coming back pretty strong. So once we get past some of the comparables that Efrain mentioned, I think we continue to feel really good about HR outsourcing, PEO and ASO.","Jim Schneider","That's helpful. Thanks. you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from the line of James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is now open.","James Berkley","Good morning guys. Thanks for the time. Marty, if you just could provide some more color on the mid-market versus down-market? You called out the mid-market as a challenging area last quarter, obviously. Just getting a lot of questions from investors around how much of the challenging environment, particularly in that mid-market, is uncertainty related and ACA driven versus competition related, if at all? Just especially given strong growth rates you have seen from some smaller players that focus on that space, Paylocity, for example. Those other guys offer ACA solutions as well. Maybe part of that disconnect has to do with the fact that the smaller players have less robust ACA offerings and easier comps? I am just trying to get a better feel for what's going on there.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think that certainly can be part of it, but I think we feel good. We do feel good about the technology and the offering that we have as well as the service. I think we have talked about that some of the mid-market, we are working through a migration from an old platform. Now 96% of our Flex clients are on Flex. So it's not like it's a large number that we still have to work through. But I think all of that has had some impact on mid-market.","I think we feel very good about, from a technology. Pricing, a little bit tougher. Again, I think people, all of us, all competitors were challenged a little bit coming off the ACA year and so pricing down a little bit more aggressive, but we feel very good about the offerings that are out there. We are very competitive and we are not really necessarily losing that much more to anybody in particular. I think it was just a tougher compare year.","Macro-wise, I think there is, as I mentioned, some impact of for those larger clients over 50 employees, okay, what is exactly the impact on a B2B from all of the administration and they are probably a little bit slower.","James Berkley","Okay. Thanks. And then just could you talk a little more about the large client you alluded to? How large? What impact you see it having to growth next year? What drove the client decision to us Paychex?","Efrain Rivera","That was specifically related to the advance funding portion of the business. So if you notice there was a bump in receivables. The way that business works is, if you find a large client, you get the receivable impact upfront and then you start realizing the benefit as you collect fee. So I was just calling out specifically what was happening with Advance Partners. And by the way, that business grew strongly and has been a tremendous contributor during the year and we think going forward it's very bullish on what's going on there.","James Berkley","Thanks for that clarification. Last one here, just to build out Jim's prior question around HR revenue just being a little slower than we have seen in the past. Could you break out what's going on there and touch on how confident you are in top line guidance with margin expansion is a lot higher in the guidance there than we typically see? So just kind of like what's going with few things? And then you may have previously set the bar low, it seems, just because last year you had probably tried to avoid lowering guidance like you saw last year. It looks like maybe you set the bar low.","Efrain Rivera","Great question. I would say, if you look at us over the last six years, we have never missed earnings. So I would say that we have generally beaten on the upside. So there is always an element of conservatism in our guidance and I hope that that continues into next year. But though what's going on is that we have a grow-over comparison. And by the way, we are the first to report and I am certain that others will say exactly the same thing.","There is a grow-over comparison on ACA modules that everyone's going to face. For us, the impact is more significant in the first quarter and it abates as we go through the year. And the second part, as I mentioned, Advance Partners was a contributor to revenue for the year and HRS a little bit over 1%. But most of that benefit occurred in the first half of the year because we acquired them in the second half of 2016. So basically that's what's going on there.","On the margin guidance, just remember that when I said margin guidance, sometimes I talk in the past talk about operating margin excluding float, it's up and then operating margin in general, it's up, of course because now we are getting the benefit of investment income. But we are very proud of operating at 40% margins. That always is a number that we think we want to beat.","So last year, if you remember what the guidance was, we have said it appeared to be flat, I got a lot of questions and I said, even in a year where we were investing in operations, for the reasons that Marty mentioned before, pivoting to a much more dedicated service options for clients and we still, despite those investments delivered 50 basis points. Part of that was lower variable selling costs. So we feel very comfortable on the expense guidance because we have specific plans against that. And our job is to figure out how we can do even better than what we put out there in terms of our guidance. So that's a little bit of color on what our thought process was.","James Berkley","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Sir, your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hi. How are you guys. Good morning.","Martin Mucci","I read your policy questions, by the way. I read then all. We talked about them, just so you know, okay.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Yes. Thank you. I wanted to sort of go back to this notion of payroll and HRS becoming equal sized. There are a couple of things, I think, going on there. One is sort of from a headline perspective, the takeaway can be that there is a slowdown coming a little bit more permanent in nature for HRS, but then you also look at the penetration metrics that you guys have provided and you guys are what, 15%, 20% penetrated with regards to your payroll base. So I guess the question becomes, with that level of penetration, why isn't the pace of growth and rate of penetration higher? Is there something you can be doing there t make it higher? Is that opportunity real, in other words?","Martin Mucci","There is definitely opportunity for improvement and we feel it's a great opportunity. I think one of the things that's probably challenged us in the past is the size of the client. So when the clients are smaller, obviously they don't need as many of the HR outsourcing type products. However two things.","One from a macro environment, we are seeing more and more of those regulations and those needs come down in size. So a client a few years ago that was 15 employees didn't need HR outsourcing, but today due the complexity in the requirements and compliance, they do. So we think there is a growing need for the HR outsourcing at smaller levels of a client which is good for us.","I think we have gotten better and better at providing a full-service sales opportunity right upfront. One of the things you are seeing in our go-to-market strategy for sales is to offer the clients the full value of our products in the first conversation with them as a prospect, which in the past we sold payroll and then we came back later and sold them other products. And I think we are seeing that the clients are needing more things up first and frankly we weren't servicing the full value of what they were looking for. And that change we have made and we think that that will drive that that as well.","And I also think that you are seeing as more clients are taking a bundled product, it's becoming more difficult to separate payroll and HRS as a revenue source because these products are bundled and we are doing some allocations now. But it's going to get more and more difficult to do that.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And then the lower permanent hiring growth that you alluded to, should that translate to higher temp hiring growth that helps Advance Partners? And is there further M&A opportunity then in that direction?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think, as Efrain said, Advance Partners had a great year, better than we expected and great leadership there in the team and they have done very well and I think that the temp environment is definitely picking up. We have even seen in our own numbers that clients with less than 50 employees, the part-time workforce by itself has gone up to become more than 10% of the workforce from about 6% just a few years ago, three or four years ago.","So you are definitely seeing more businesses take part-time and temps and we are continuing to look at rollup strategy as part of getting a great company like Advance was that there are number of these funding companies out there that are small and that could benefit by a rollup strategy and the technology and innovation that advances those. So we definitely think there is more opportunity there and definitely think there will be more temp and gig economy type part-time employment where people are working multiple places part time instead of full time.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. One last clarification question. The investment income outlook was a touch higher than what we were looking for. And I just wanted to clarify, is there a breakage assumed in there where you are taking gains? Or is it fairly straightforward?","Efrain Rivera","No. We wouldn't give guidance assuming a breakage. I think if you are looking at year-over-year, Ashwin, there are a number of items that run through that. So this year we wrote off a small investment, several small investments that we had made or wrote down the value of those investments. So this year was a little bit artificially depressed and next year we are not assuming we are going to do that. Very modest immaterial number. So no, there is no gains. That what's going on.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. Got it. Thank you guys.","Martin Mucci","Okay. Thanks Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","Martin Mucci","Hi Gary.","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys. Good morning. I think I ask you this every year in the fourth quarter. So I will keep the trend going. Can you give us an update of just penetration within the payroll client base of some of the key HRS offerings? And how do you think about the opportunity remaining, the ceiling? Where you are getting closer to that? Just any color to help us think about the long-term potential of HRS. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Yes. Gary, I don't think we are getting near any ceilings. I think we have lots of opportunity and in fact, as I mentioned on the last question, I think the opportunity is growing because the needs are coming down in size. So I think the opportunity is very strong there. I think the fact that a 10 or 15 company may need more support on HR and that we have tailored our products and the service teams to support that bodes very well for us. I think the most penetrated would obviously be workers' comp. 401(k) is pretty strong as well. And HR outsourcing. All of these leave a lot of opportunity, insurance being the smallest penetration and the newest that we have offered, meaning H&B, health and benefit insurance. So lots of opportunity there. We don't disclose it exactly, but there is a lot of opportunity there for us. And in fact, I think the opportunity is increasing, particularly for HR support.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. Great. And then you talked about the internal stuff impacting the retention. Was there any change in competitive intensity in terms of the number of losses on where the losses were going? Or was it, you mentioned some increase in out of business and then your service changes, is that it? Or was there also, you know -- ?","Martin Mucci","A little bit on competition, but I think that the vast majority frankly was kind of self-driven, unfortunately that we knew, as Efrain said, we projected some because we knew that we would have to disrupt some clients and their payroll specialist or their client service specialist that's dedicated to them. The good news is, that provides us great retention. The bad news is, when we have to change it on a client and move them around a little bit, at first that causes disruption and there was a lot of newer people brought into the mix. We didn't shutdown an area necessarily and close a business or close a location and move it, but we did move a lot of people around and are doing that kind of still across the country, but we are doing it virtually in a lot of places.","So we moved a lot of experienced people into multi-product centers to handle other kinds of businesses and that disrupted the clients. So I would say, we really feel based on all of the stats we have, most of the change in retention from our near high best to down about a percentage point was really caused by the service disruption, the changes we made and now we are past that and we already see it starting to bounce back at the end the Q4. So we are feeling good that we will get back there through this next year.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. Great. And then just on the client funds balances, can you give a little more color on why that's been moving slightly lower over the past year or so? And what's the outlook within the guidance you have provided for the trend in that? Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So let me start. I mentioned this a couple of times. So I think the first thing is, we made a change in terms of the timing on when we remit payments to taxing authorities in certain states. I won't bore you with the details, but suffice it to say that brought balances down a bit and that's been a headwind through the year. We think that that starts to abate next year. Client mix has had some impact. Our client mix is skewed smaller during the year, so slightly smaller. It depends on what assumptions you make about wage growth but we expect we will be flat to up slightly going in the next year as opposed to being down slightly this year. So those are the things impacting balances.","Gary Bisbee","Great. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Martin Mucci","Hi Brian.","Bryan Keane","Hi guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just wanted to ask on client growth. It was flat and I guess you usually that's up a couple points. I think it was up 2% last year. I know attrition played a role here. But just thinking about other factors that maybe caused that to be more flattish this year. And then when you think about a potential rebound for fiscal year 2018, what might cause that?","Martin Mucci","I think as we have talked about, Bryan, I think most of the impact of that has been the increase in losses. So the drop in retention rate was probably a bigger piece of that. And I think, as I have talked about, I think all of the changes now being done in the fourth quarter from moving clients around into better service segments and service models, I think we are going to see that bounce back, because I think everything's in place where we are seeing the tenure of our specialist move up.","I also think that being now in the right place, the reason we did it was to drive client retention even higher which was, hey, when you are an online client and you are mostly calling in, we needed better technology tools that are web chat, et cetera to handle the client the way they wanted to be serviced and all of that now is in place. And so we feel that we are really well positioned in multi-product centers before where if you had payroll and time and attendance, we had a specific team on time and attendance that we move you to, we now combined those teams.","So we have the best expertise and a combined team to handle multi-product clients. We think that is going to help, particularly in the mid market where we have sold multiple products and we have increased, of course, that penetration. So we really feel like that will bring us back into that kind of growth rate.","Bryan Keane","Okay. What about changes in new business starts? It sounded like also you maybe mentioned that bankruptcies picked up a little bit here as well.","Martin Mucci","Yes, we did. We saw, that was a little surprising to us because given all the things you are seeing in the economy, we are little surprised, but we have seen a few more losses as a result of that. Don't really know why. We have seen new business starts. We are not expecting a big change in that. They have kind of come back up to where they were pre-recession and they have held there. And so I think that will work in our favor.","And there was something else you mentioned that I was going to say. But I guess the other thing I was going to say is, our go-to-market strategy that I mentioned earlier on sales I think will also drive more sales, particularly on the low-end for these new business start-ups. What we are seeing is, more clients coming to us from the web as opposed to from a call and client referral, that type of thing. They are coming in. They are searching, as you would expect. They are going on the web and they are contacting our team that way. We would then give that to a rep in the field, even if they were a small one, two, three employee client startup.","And what we are finding today is, many clients don't want to wait two days to have a rep come and visit them. They are ready to buy on the phone. So we have increased our digital spend pretty significantly and we have increased our virtual sales reps who are selling 7 days a week and almost 24 hours. They are ready to handle the sale right over the phone and the client is ready to buy that way. So we think that's going to really help us. All that's set up and already running.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then last question for me. Efrain, you talked about the seasonality for fiscal year 2018 as I understand in HRS and payroll services, I think it's kind of in the range and then it goes to the high-end during the back half. Is that seasonality as well? And I know last year we talked about some difference in processing days. So is that not a factor this year? Thanks so much.","Efrain Rivera","No. I mercifully do not have to talk about days in 2018. So that has no impact, Bryan. No, I think that the way, if you look at where our growth was last year, the compares in the first half are a little tougher and then they ease in the back half on the assumption that the way that we think the sales year unfolds that way. So that's basically what's going on.","Bryan Keane","And does that make 2% a more normalized growth rate then going forward, as we think about the model?","Efrain Rivera","I think, Bryan, I would withhold that until we go through the year. I would anticipate, I think that implicit in that guidance is that we are still assuming a little bit of client mix occurring during the year. So I would say, just given the amount of change that's happened already, I would think that coming out of 2018 we should see a little bit higher growth than 2%. But let's get to Q4 and we will have another conversation.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair. Sir, your line is now open.","Tim McHugh","Hi. Just one question. I guess maybe I don't know if it was just my impression, but I think the prior call or two, you had obviously about this weakness in the mid-market that you have been seeing. This call, I don't know, if it's just because of the year-end, but it seems to be a little bit more talk of small business market in terms of retention and kind of choppiness in that market? Did it change late in the year on the small business market? Or is it just talking about full-year? I guess I am trying to understand if you saw some incremental weakness and whether it's retention or new sales more in the small business side of the spectrum late in the fiscal year?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I would say the impact of the small business actually was, we felt pretty good from, I think overall when you look at small business, the sales were pretty good, nothing major change there. The retention is where we took some of the hit in small business and again self-inflicted with some of our changes when you think about moving some clients that were on dedicated service specialist to multi-products because they bought more. Remember, small being under 50, so they have multiple products also moving them to the online centers. So I think the impact on small was really more from retention, which we think is we will recover out of that now the things are kind of done.","The mid market was more of an impact on sales from less opportunities coming out of the ACA year and a little bit more aggressive competition because I think everybody felt lower opportunities. I feel very good about where we are from a technology standpoint and a product offering, but the pricing got a little bit stronger. The pricing competition probably got a little bit strong. We still held our own pretty well there. But I think again if you look at sales growth, we were down from last year in total amount sold, but it was more even on a normalized basis to where we were the year before that. And so I think hopefully that clarified it a little bit.","Tim McHugh","And when did you, the service alignment, was that in the fall you started rolling that out?","Martin Mucci","Yes. It was really this last year is where most of it happened, this last fiscal year. We kind of finished up at the beginning of fourth quarter. A little of that went into the previous year too. But I think we saw the biggest impact during the middle of this year as we got around the selling season. I think we paid a little bit for more drop-offs in clients during that third to beginning of fourth quarter type of thing because of just issues with disruption and so forth. But that's done now and everybody's kind of in the right place and we have hired back up and we have got the tenure back up and the training and certification levels back up.","Tim McHugh","When you say it's done now, have you seen, is that just I guess the change on your end is done? Or have you seen enough data points in terms of retention metrics? Has it been long enough that you look at kind of the client behavior to say your past issues with that?","Martin Mucci","What I would say is, the changes are done and the numbers as far as having the client service specialists in place, the tenure, the certification, that's done. And some of the satisfaction numbers, net promoter scores, have begun to increase back kind of towards where we were. I wouldn't say the retention has changed yet. That's going to take a little longer over, I think the next few quarters to get back. But we feel like we are aiming to get ourselves back to all-time highs or near all-time highs by the end of the fiscal year.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I know it's late. Efrain, just a couple of numbers related questions.","Efrain Rivera","Sure. Go ahead.","Jeff Silber","As far as giving the seasonal guidance on the revenue line, anything to point out on the margin or expense side?","Efrain Rivera","No, Jeff, other than what I said in first quarter that that's the anomalous quarter just because we booked the stock-comp expense benefit in that quarter and so on a GAAP basis I called out that first quarter is going to be essentially flat year-over-year. So I think that's the other. And then and then obviously we show a decent improvement in margin. And that I think should get you where you need to be in terms of your modeling for the year.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Great. And then in terms of annual numbers for share count and capital spending, what should we be looking for?","Efrain Rivera","Good question. So CapEx will be in the range of about 3.5% of sales and the share count at the same level or slightly below. Jeff, when I say slightly below, half a million to a million shares could be as low as that for the year.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Fantastic. Thanks so much.","Efrain Rivera","Compared to this year, I should say. So okay, thanks.","Jeff Silber","Got it. Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Mark Marcon from R. W. Baird. Sir, your line is now open","Mark Marcon","Good morning, Marty and Efrain. I was wondering if you could drill down a little bit more with regards to just the client service. With regards to the small-market clients, so those with 10 to 50 employees, are they still primarily serviced by one single client service associate? Or is it going into a team?","Martin Mucci","No. They are still to a dedicated payroll specialist that we have always been known for. They are still with the dedicated. What's happening is, as more clients have moved to online, our model was a call-out model. So we called you at 10 o'clock, 10:00 AM every Monday morning to get your information. Or you could do it other ways, of course. But that was normal. And as more clients move to online, they were doing it themselves, calling in. The answer performance wasn't as strong as we would like. We started moving more online clients to a ded, what we called a dedicated service center. You are still assigned a dedicated person but you can reach anyone in that case. But the normal client who is not online gets a dedicated payroll specialist who still calls out for them.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then was the attrition any different between, I am not talking about the micro-part of the market, but between say companies with 10 to 20 relative to 50 and above?","Martin Mucci","I would say it was roughly the same. The impacts were kind of across the board, maybe for different reasons. But all the clients, because most of the clients did see some, many of the clients did see some change, even as you talk a little bit larger, many of them went from the local person who was just there to a dedicated to a multi-product service center and so they were serviced, not only with a dedicated person but more of a team. They may have reached someone different. So I would say it was kind of split across the different size clients.","Mark Marcon","But I mean, they should be reaching the same person, I mean on a go-forward basis. Your primary contact should still be your primary person, right.","Martin Mucci","Correct. Now one to go-forward basis, but I may have moved you, but I did move many of them to a new person during the year to get them in the right kind of service model but now they have a dedicated person. No matter where they are, they still have a dedicated person. And so now that's why we feel, hey, I think we are in good shape now, but it certainly caused some disruption. And you might have had a new person who was brand new in some of these cases because we pulled a tenure person to go to a multi-product service team and then they got a new person who wasn't as trained, was not the same person they knew for the last couple of years and that did have some impact, unfortunately. But we think this is the right setup for the future. We are done and we are building expertise now in those areas.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And the net promoter scores, how are they indexing relative to your norms?","Martin Mucci","They are coming up. So our onboarding, we also moved to a new way of onboarding our clients that we think is more efficient and better service value to them. That onboarding and net promoter score has gone up from the beginning of the year nicely and our overall service number has gone up as well. So we are feeling like it's early from the fourth quarter results, kind of, the end of the fourth quarter, but we are feeling like things are turning very positive.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And then of the 605,000 clients that you have, how many have solutions that would typically be within HRS? I am not asking about specific penetration, but just overall like how many would have multiple modules?","Efrain Rivera","Hi Mark. I think we will disclose that in the K. So we have got a pretty extensive disclosure as to who takes what there. And I think you will be able to see that revenue kind of, I can't recall it off the top of our head.","Mark Marcon","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay. Mark, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The last question will come from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Ma'am your line is now open","Lisa Ellis","Hi. Good morning guys. Efrain, a couple quick ones for you. Can you remind us of how you think about your dividend policy when you go through the sort of periods of ups and downs?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Lisa, we peg it at about 80% to low-80s in terms of percentage of net income and that's kind of what we target as a payout rate.","Lisa Ellis","Okay. So the growth rate and the dividend gets impacted when the business kind of go through elevated periods of faster growth and then slower growth?","Efrain Rivera","Right. So if it slows down and we try to just target, titrate it down a bit so that it stays in that range.","Lisa Ellis","Okay. And then the second one somewhat related I guess is, you did call out that cash flow from operations was down 6% year-on-year but highlighted just fluctuations in working capital. So is your expectation that that would revert year-to-year? Or is it more also driven by underlying performance?","Martin Mucci","No, not at all. That was anomalous. So what ended up happening Lisa is, if you break down what happened this year, we had about $60 million more in tax payments. Some of those are temporary differences that will reverse in the following year. We had additional funding requirements for Advance Partners that were unusual because right at the end of the year we brought on a very large client. Those situations should not be present next year. So it will conform to more customary patterns, but it's pretty identified what exactly happened there.","Lisa Ellis","Okay. Terrific. That's it from me. Thanks guys.","Martin Mucci","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you everyone. At this time, we don't have questions on queue. Speakers, you may proceed.","Martin Mucci","Okay. At this point, we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the web cast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our fourth quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

Now, I will turn the meeting over to your host, Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2018. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on the website for approximately 1 month.","On today\u2019s call, I will review the business highlights for the second quarter and Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2019. And then we will open it up for your questions.","Financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 reflect good progress against our objectives in growth across our major product lines. Our total revenue growth was 7% for the second quarter, management solutions revenue grew a solid 5%, and PEO and insurance services revenues grew a strong 15% compared to the prior year quarter. Sales momentum has been positive. We have added to our sales force and are fully staffed for our peak selling season and we have implemented a number of tools and strategies that are aiding in that momentum.","With respect to client retention, we continue to be pleased with current trends and our strong client satisfaction performance. On November 26, 2018, we announced an agreement to acquire Oasis Outsourcing Group Holdings, L.P. for $1.2 billion. Oasis is the largest privately held PEO in the U.S. and an industry leader in providing HR outsourcing services. This acquisition is anticipated to close in this quarter. Oasis is a good fit with our PEO growth strategy adding to our scale, expanding relationships with new insurance partners, creating up-sell opportunities into the existing Oasis customer base and augmenting our leadership talent with the addition of an Oasis experienced leadership team. This acquisition will significantly advance our leadership position in HR outsourcing and when close Paychex and Oasis combined will serve more than 1.4 million worksite employees through our various HR outsourcing services.","We expect to finance this acquisition with $800 million of new debt along with cash on hand. Our Paychex IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch shows the light labor market continues to create a challenging hire environment for many of our clients. The workplace has been evolving partly due to this tight labor market and as a result of technology advances. In August, we were named one of the world\u2019s most innovative companies by Forbes, and in this vein, we continue to focus on enhancing our products and technology to increase efficiencies for our clients. Recent enhancements to features and functionality in Paychex Flex will simplify the complexity of finding and retaining talent, optimize HR and overall business performance and remove obstacles that stand in the way of our client\u2019s productivity. We have enhanced our HR dashboard, creating the functionality that will make it the destination for clients looking to manage and develop their workforce. This dashboard includes advanced analytics, seamless access to Paychex learning and a state-of-the-art performance management process. New workflows and approval functionality in Paychex Flex ensure proper checks and balances occur with employee self-service activities, which have also increased. The use of self service will drive greater efficiency for our clients.","During this summer, we introduced live reports with turnover and headcount data allowing clients to view consolidated data to quickly identify trends and gain meaningful insights into their business and we are now adding the ability for clients to compare turnover rates \u2013 employee turnover rates with similar companies through our benchmarking live report. These significant technology product enhancements in the last quarter support our clients in recruiting, on-boarding, training and developing their employees in a market, where it is increasingly difficult to find and retain employees, particularly for the small and midsized companies.","In addition to our technology, our team of over 500 HR specialists around the country serve our clients growing HR needs as states have increasingly made it more difficult and challenging to run and grow their businesses without this expertise. We also continue to evolve our Paychex Flex APIs to give clients the ability to add new worker using our API. This allows us to continue to develop new partnership opportunities with third-parties that our clients engage.","I would like to congratulate our Paychex Insurance Agency, which has been named in the Business Insurance Magazine\u2019s list of best places to work in insurance for the fourth consecutive year. This ranking improved one spot to number 12 this year, I am very proud of the Paychex culture that fosters engagement and growth among our employees. I will conclude by saying that our state-of-the-art technology, our full suite of integrated HCM product offerings and personalized service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth in our markets. Our employees make this combination successful with their hard work and commitment to our clients each and everyday.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty. Good morning. I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call contains forward-looking statements that refer to future events and such involve risks. Please refer to our earnings release that includes a discussion of these statements and related risk factors. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measures exclude certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release and investor slide presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation in the second quarter to their related GAAP measures.","I will start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I will touch briefly on results and wrap with a review of our fiscal 2019 outlook. Total revenue and total service revenue both grew 7% for this second quarter to $859 million and $841 million respectively. The acquisition of Lessor Group accounted for less than 1% of the growth in service revenue. Expenses were up 10% for the second quarter to $552 million, Lessor accounted for approximately 2% of this growth. The remaining growth related to accelerated investment in sales and marketing, product development as part of our tax reform investments, together with growth in PEO direct and insurance costs. In addition, we incurred some one-time expenses relating to the Oasis acquisition. Operating income increased 1% to $307 million. Operating margin was about 36% for the second quarter. Margins were impacted by accelerated spending and growth in the PEO.","Our effective income tax was 23.8% for the second quarter compared to 34.8% for the respective prior year quarter. The significant decline year-over-year on the effective tax is due to tax reform legislation. We anticipate that effective tax rate will be approximately 24% for the remainder of the year. Net income increased 19% to $236 million for the second quarter and adjusted net income increased 20%. Diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.65 for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20%.","I will now provide some additional color in selected areas. Management solutions revenue, which includes our payroll service revenue, together with our HCM products included in many of our product bundles increased 5% to $685 million for the second quarter. This increase was driven by growth in client bases across our HCM services, including payroll, ASO, retirement services and time and attendance solution. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in the asset value of participant funds. PEO and insurance services revenue increased 15% to $155 million for the second quarter. In August, we anniversaried the acquisition of HROI, growth was primarily driven by continued strong demand for combined PEO services, which along with WSE growth in our existing client base resulted in double-digit growth in client worksite employees served. Our insurance services revenue benefited from growth in the number of health and benefits applicants.","Interest on funds held for clients, it increased 31% for the second quarter to $18 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Investments and income, our goal as you know is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 2% and average duration of 3.1 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.9% for the second quarter, up from 1.5% last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were relatively flat for the second quarter primarily driven by the impacts of wage inflation offset by lower client employee withholdings resulting from tax reform.","Year-to-date let me briefly summarize the 6-month period. Management solutions revenue increased 4% approximately 1% was contributed by Lessor. PEO and insurance services revenue increased 26%, 17% on an organic basis. Interest on funds held for clients increased 28% driven by interest rate increases. Total revenue up 8%, operating margins were 36.4%, tempered somewhat by accelerated investments in the business and growth in PEO direct and insurance costs, net income increased 70% and adjusted net income increased 19%, diluted earnings per share increased 18%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 19%.","I will now walk you through highlights on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $769 million as of November 30, 2018. Funds held for clients as of November 30 were $3.7 billion compared to $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018. Funds held for clients as you know vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the second quarter and 6 months.","Our total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $45 million as of November 30, 2018 compared with $38 million as of May 31, 2018. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.4 billion as of November 30, 2018 reflecting $403 million in dividends paid and $33 million worth of shares repurchased during the first half of fiscal 2019. Our return on equity for the past 12 months is a very respectable 45%. Cash flows from operations were $497 million for the 6 months, a decrease of 4% from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by working capital fluctuations related to timing around collections and related tax payments for our combined PEO business and a decrease in accrued liability balances in connection with the termination of certain licensing agreements. Other impacts on non-cash adjustments were offset within working capital fluctuations.","Fiscal 2019 guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based on current view of economic conditions continuing at no significant changes that will give guidance excluding any anticipated impacts from the Oasis acquisition and then follow with the anticipated impact of Oasis on our results. We have tightened some of the guidance we have previously provided. The revised guidance is as follows. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow 20% to 25%. We assume no interest rate rises after this anticipated December raise. We will see if that occurs today. Investment income net is anticipated to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Net income and diluted earnings per share anticipated to grow approximately 4% and adjusted diluted earnings per share anticipated to increase now in the range of 11% to 12%.","Other aspects of our guidance remain unchanged from what we have previously provided. The guidance is reiterated as following. Management solutions revenue is anticipated to grow by approximately 4% for fiscal 2019. PEO and insurance services revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 18% to 20%. Total revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 6% to 7%. Operating income as a percent of total revenues is anticipated to be approximately 37%. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 is expected to be approximately 24%. And adjusted net income for non-GAAP expected to increase again in the range of 11% to 12%.","I will now provide you with a little additional color on the second half of the year. We anticipate that management solutions revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2019 will be approximately 4% with Q3 at or above this rate and Q4 below this rate due primarily to the anniversary of the Lessor acquisition. For PEO and insurance services, revenue growth in the first half was significantly higher due the timing of the HROI acquisition. We anticipate growth for Q3 to be in the range of 15% to 17% and for Q4 to be in the range of 10% to 13% due to the challenging compared with strong PEO growth in the later part of fiscal 2018.","Assuming the completion of Oasis, the Oasis acquisition which we expect to occur in the future, we anticipate that Oasis will have an incremental impact on revenue in the range of $155 million to $175 million for the balance of the year. We expect that approximately 45% of this incremental revenue will occur in Q3 and the remainder will occur in Q4. Excluding one-time costs related to the acquisition, we anticipate that Oasis will have minimal impact on our diluted earnings per share for the year. With one-time acquisition costs, we anticipate that the acquisition will be approximately $0.03 dilutive for fiscal 2019 primarily due as I said to the acquisition costs.","And now with those comments, I will now hand it back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Great. Thanks Efrain. Operator, we will now open the call to questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin McVeigh","Hey, how are you?","Martin Mucci","Good.","Kevin McVeigh","Just real quick. Really good results. Obviously, there has been a lot of unevenness in the market. Any change at the margin in terms of the client discussions, I mean it seems like the payroll really scaled up nice, so really nothing in the fundamentals. But anything you would call out just given obviously some of the noise that\u2019s been occurring since you last reported?","Martin Mucci","No. I think what we are finding is that we are getting \u2013 we are seeing momentum on the sales side and we are seeing retention numbers that are very positive and heading back toward our all time best on the client retention. So we are feeling good about the momentum in the first half of the year. Of course, we are heading into selling season, we are in selling season, which is really an important time for us and we are feeling good at this point. We are seeing business kind of environment pretty good and certainly in need of HR outsourcing in particular, because of all the things that are going on with state regulations in particular. And I think that\u2019s really helping what you are seeing is kind of that double-digit growth on worksite employees, particularly in the PEO business. So we are seeing a good need for the HR services and all of our products.","Kevin McVeigh","And just Marty, following up on that client retention at an all-time high, what\u2019s been driving that? And are you seeing any kind of trends in the smaller businesses as opposed to larger, just really nice job there and should we expect that to continue?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think as I said we are heading kind of \u2013 we are getting closer to that all time high in retention we had. I think that we are still seeing the same kind of number of businesses going out of business. I think we are seeing an improvement in those that left for service or price. I would say the competitive environment is about the same. There is always some pressure there, but we seem to be doing very well from a retention standpoint and from a selling standpoint. We have got some momentum there. So I don\u2019t think we are seeing a lot different in competition and I think we are really holding our own and showing some momentum on the sales side.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Berkley from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","James Berkley","Good morning and thanks guys and congrats. How are you doing?","Martin Mucci","Good.","James Berkley","Just a quick question on Oasis, could you just talk about what you expect the accretion to look like there on a cash basis just given that you tend to accelerate D&A for tax purposes. I would think it looks even more attractive on the cash side, but just wanted to hear your thoughts?","Martin Mucci","Yes. James, I\u2019ll hold that a little bit. We do expect it on a cash basis for it to be accretive. Their margins are at or above our margins on PEO. So that will be a positive going forward. We will talk more once we have closed the acquisition in Q3, but we think it\u2019s going to be a nice add from a cash basis.","James Berkley","Okay, thanks. And then obviously that was the largest private PEO provider in the U.S. and if you could just comment on what other M&A opportunities you see and your thoughts on timing, your comfort level with leverage and just how you think about your broader PEO strategy going forward? That would be really helpful.","Martin Mucci","Sure. I think from an acquisition, we are always looking at a number of opportunities. I think certainly there is a number of other PEO opportunities there and we are looking \u2013 and Oasis was pretty active. As a private company, they were pretty active on the acquisition side, particularly on the smaller ones and being able to integrate those in. So we think that gaining scale in the PEO business is very good. Obviously that was part of this move is it gains us more scale with the insurance carriers. It picks up new markets. And we have been able to do some thing \u2013 we will be able to do some things, I think with Oasis clients that if they don\u2019t fit in the underwriting, we can get them to our insurance agency which is the 20th largest insurance agency in the country right now. So we feel there is a lot of opportunity on the PEO side. In other areas, there are some acquisitions as well. I think we have been closed on a few, not too worried about, I mean we are always watching for the leverage, but from a debt perspective, but this was \u2013 I think we will be very successful in getting a good debt placement here. And I think that given our balance sheet and cash flows that we will have other opportunity to do more if we need to do it. We are always watching for that shareholder return and be sure that we are using cash obviously in the best way for our shareholders. And I think we have got a long track record of that, but acquisitions are certainly always on the table and we are looking at a number of things.","James Berkley","Thanks a lot. Appreciate the time.","Martin Mucci","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. Happy holidays. How are you?","Martin Mucci","Thanks.","Jason Kupferberg","Good, good. So I just wanted to circle back, if we think about last quarter, you guys had given some kind of quarterly layout on payroll, what you were thinking about the respective growth rates? And I think for Q2 and 3Q, the expectation was to be at, at least 3%, if I am not mistaken, because that\u2019s the high end of the full year 2% to 3% guide. And I think you came in at 2.8% in Q2. Are you still thinking Q3 will be at least 3% or any changes around the edges in the thought process there?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Jason, I don\u2019t see any reason why that wouldn\u2019t be the case. So, we feel pretty comfortable about where things are. And just to add a little bit of color about why we feel comfortable, Marty mentioned, I think sales process has \u2013 we have seen some momentum there. Retention has been good and then pricing has been stable. So I think all of those three say we should be certainly in that range.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And just want to go little deeper on some of the macro dynamics, but I know you guys do fairly regular surveying of the small business base. So, just in terms of confidence and sentiment and sort of forward-looking indicators like it sounds like everything was fine in this latest quarter, but as you head into the new calendar year, are you detecting any changes at all just in terms of hiring intentions or prospects for new business creation?","Martin Mucci","Jason, I think the interesting thing is the one thing we keep hearing is it\u2019s just tough to get employees. And so for small to midsized businesses, it\u2019s tough for them to recruit and retain employees. And one of the positives for us, because of that is they are looking for more benefits. They are looking to offer insurance. They are looking to be able to have better benefit enrollment kind of opportunities, better technology, self-service type of technology for their employees. And so generally, I think you still look at like the NFIB optimism, the business indexes are all near \u2013 still near historic highs and consumer optimism is high \u2013 consumer confidence. And so everything is high, but there is this concern about can I get the employees and we have heard where some small to midsized businesses have \u2013 and some of our surveys have actually said, hey, I have turned down some business, because I just can\u2019t get enough employees to do it. But there is still \u2013 the good news is there is optimism that there is work to do. It\u2019s just with a low unemployment rate, can I attract enough employees to get the work done.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And just last from me, in terms of reinvestments, I just wanted to catch up on that topic at least for [ESR] [ph] model your margins came in better than expected. I know you are not changing the full year forecast. So quarterly cadence of reinvestments, just commentary there for the back half and then just your latest thinking on whether or not you think these reinvestments could cause a little bit of uptick in underlying revenue growth as we start to think ahead to next fiscal year directionally?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I would say this, so we did have a little bit lighter spending than we had guided in the quarter. It won\u2019t affect the back half of the year. Our perspective is if it wasn\u2019t spent, it wasn\u2019t spent. But I think the other part of the margin story was that revenue came in a little bit better than our plans had anticipated and so that dropped down to the bottom line. So we see strength, we will see what happens in the back half of the year, but it was a combination of both.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Ramsey El-Assal","Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the Fed in the path of rate hikes. I know you only have a single additional raise contemplated in your guidance, but would a slower pace of increase by the Fed cause you to change any internal plans about business investment or timing of investments or headcount additions or is there any other business impact or is your internal plans very much aligned with your sort of external guidance?","Efrain Rivera","It\u2019s pretty much aligned with the external guidance, Ramsey. It really wouldn\u2019t change. I think when we came into the year, our thought process was we look at the same data you all look at. And we looked at the probability of raises, they were talking about 3 and 4 in calendar \u201819, we weren\u2019t buying it at the moment. And I think now that\u2019s become a little bit more uncertain, but it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it further raises are more uncertain. But it doesn\u2019t affect what we do. And I would say it\u2019s interesting that the macro backdrop has been uncertain and volatile. A lot \u2013 if you look at the vectors in our business, they are pointing up, not down, they are not pointing neutral, they are pointing up. And so when we look at the wealth of data that we have everything from business bankruptcies to the clients who go out of business to sales to new clients, it looks positive to us. So, now we are in a situation where things can change rapidly, but nothing that we are seeing says there are clouds on the horizon certainly in the back half of our fiscal year.","Ramsey El-Assal","Yes, that\u2019s great to hear. And it doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t tuck ourselves into a recession. It would do the same. On another topic, I wanted to ask you about sort of the sales process and strategy in PEO. I mean you just rolled up Oasis. There is a handful of larger players out there like yourselves, there is a bunch of smaller folks out there as well. From the standpoint of a prospective customer, how do you close that sale, is there a big price discovery process? Is it expectation of service levels? What is it that gets them to go into your camp rather than to one of your competitors?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think it\u2019s always \u2013 it\u2019s not as much price I think it\u2019s going to be really the value of the technology and the service. And what we have been in this \u2013 Paychex has been in this for 20 years the outsource \u2013 HR outsourcing through both PEO and ASO and we have 500 HR specialists around the country that are dedicated to helping small and midsized business clients with their needs. So, you have good technology that they can use to enroll benefits and help their employees enroll in benefit, good insurance options for them particularly on the PEO side, the larger you get the more options you\u2019re going to have from carriers and those are really important benefits right now as I said earlier on, because of the competitiveness of attracting and retaining employees and then it\u2019s going to be that service piece, so from a client\u2019s perspective, it is getting more challenging every day whether it\u2019s marijuana use and whether it\u2019s legal or not, whether to do drug testing, how to handle drug testing, immigration, minimum wage, paid family leave, you need an HR support as a small to mid-sized business New York just came out with the need for a non-harassment training, that has to be done by the pretty much of the middle of next year for a company of any size basically I mean, these are a lot of needs and that\u2019s how you sell the HR outsourcing ASO or PEO. And PEO is becoming much more comfortable and things that well, it\u2019s not just limited to Florida and Texas it\u2019s a real need, and in this competitive environment for employees, that\u2019s how you sell that is your service and your technology.","Ramsey El-Assal","A related and a final question for me, a brief one you basically also called out this Flex API and increased kind of capability to plug into potential partners QuickBooks integration, you talked about Facebook integration with social component in the last call are you going to lean deeper into sort of a partnership strategy to enhance the client bundle of a value proposition? Or is this just is this a trend? Or is this more just sort of a string of kind of one-offs?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it\u2019s a great question I think we\u2019ve always had kind of the value of Paychex has been, I can offer you that full suite of products on our Flex system, everything fully integrated, real-time, mobile first design, single employee record kind of thing and we still offer that, however, you do find particularly in the mid market is more clients who say, hey look, I\u2019m used to having this record keeper for my retirement services or I\u2019m used to this time and attendance solution and I\u2019m just not ready to get off of all of that yet and switch to you so what we have found over time is particularly in that mid-market, we\u2019re opening up more and more APIs to say, hey look, you can stay with who you have if you wanted and of course, partnerships are always powerful from if you pick the right ones, to grow your base and do what you do best and things like QuickBooks were good fit particularly for the small and some of the lower end of the mid-sized for us so it\u2019s just a way of broadening out, whatever clients want, they can get from us, however, the real value I think we bring still is that on Flex, you can have the full suite of products, you can have retirement, nobody else provides the suite of products that we provide with a single employee record in the technology and service.","Ramsey El-Assal","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Keene from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brian Keene","Hi guys. Good morning. I want to ask about Oasis, just what\u2019s the organic revenue growth profile of the company? And then what do you expect going forward? Is there any synergies between the two companies that could push it higher?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Brian, it\u2019s a upper single digit grower they also did some inorganic, we think that\u2019ll be part of the mix, which can drive that organic growth higher there are certainly synergies between the Oasis business and our existing PEO business as we add two of them, that will be working on aggressively the thing that we\u2019re in the process of looking at also is, look there\u2019s as you\u2019ve seen our results over the last certainly, three to four quarters, PEO is growing pretty rapidly and what we want to do is fuel growth not necessarily cut costs out of the business it\u2019s not one of those acquisitions, and one of the issues that we\u2019re looking very closely at is, do we add more sales people to get even greater coverage than we currently have so we\u2019re looking we\u2019re trying to balance the cost savings with additional investments to fuel even faster growth for Oasis.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think, Brian that when you this is a kind of perfect timing from a market standpoint the need for HR and the acceptance of PEO in particular, now you\u2019ve got two teams as I said we\u2019ve been doing this for 20 years, we\u2019ve got a very experienced team they\u2019ve got a very experienced team they\u2019ve been doing acquisitions of smaller PEOs they\u2019ve got insurance carrier relationships that we haven\u2019t had they\u2019ve got other markets where they\u2019ve got more scale that we haven\u2019t had it\u2019s a good combination at a good time in the market to really grow and obviously through the double digit worksite employee growth, we\u2019ve already been doing pretty consistently we expect this has really got a lot of more, as Efrain said, more revenues and top line synergies this isn\u2019t so much about cost cutting as it is about growing the business been a perfect time in the market.","Brian Keene","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then just curious to get an update, Marty, I know you talked about increasing the sales force, just trying to see if you can quantify that going into the selling season here?","Martin Mucci","I think we\u2019ve been fully staffed, pretty much for this year so we\u2019re up, I think 3% to 4% maybe closer to 5%, if you put all sales teams in there and we\u2019re feeling very good about that we have been able to fill those spots particularly in mid-market and in the PEO and ASO services, and they\u2019ve got some nice momentum as we go into this as we\u2019re in this peak selling season.","Brian Keene","Okay great. I will leave it there. Happy holidays guys.","Martin Mucci","Thanks same to you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi thanks. Good morning guys. So a question on Oasis and HROI I mean, as you guys know we\u2019d love these businesses but I know historically concerned factor you guys have raised about doing acquisitions in the space has been around getting comfortable with the insurance risk in the underlying book so can you just talk about how with a company like Oasis you manage that and get comfortable with that? And I guess building on the experience with HROI?","Martin Mucci","Yes, sure. I think obviously the due diligence, we\u2019re very careful on that and how we look at the company, they have not taken risk, and we felt based on some not only our own but some third-party analysis, that they were in very good shape from a book of business and so we are careful about who we pick, but we\u2019re very pleased with how Oasis look to us in the way they\u2019ve been doing business and what their book of business look like.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, and the other thing, Lisa, that I want to add to that is, they while they do attach healthcare like all PEOs do, all of their business is based on guaranteed contracts so compared to other acquisitions that we have looked at, they\u2019re not taking risk on the healthcare side so that made it attractive to us especially given how they had built the business and how they were growing.","Lisa Ellis","Got it. Okay, thank you. And then a question just to follow up related to the macroeconomic environment can you just describe on how if and when we ever do see a slowdown in the U.S., that impacts Paychex\u2019s business and sort of a second order basis meaning, of course, and slowdown in employment is not good, but I mean do you does that end up driving additional demand for things like PEO and ASO when you\u2019re in a downturn I\u2019m just curious kind of what the second order impacts are in your business?","Martin Mucci","Yes, obviously as you said, the first order is fewer businesses more going out of business that kind of thing but in second order, you\u2019re right I think particularly in the environment we\u2019re in now versus even 10 years ago, there\u2019s a much bigger need now when there\u2019s a downturn, how do I attract and retain employees? Do I have the right technology, so can my employees use mobile apps? Can I be so when can I be more productive and use my employees to be more productive to help me be more productive? They\u2019re going to look for ways to cut costs, and using our technology and a lot of the self-service is going to help them to be more productive on the other side, they\u2019re going to have to attract and retain more employees or if they may have to lay off or do something like that, they\u2019re going to want to know how to do those things and do them right so that they don\u2019t face legal consequences I think more than 10 years ago and that\u2019s going to be an HR need for PEO, for ASO, time and attendance, you name it, I think those things will improve so second order, while there\u2019s certainly a first order hit of businesses out of business, loss of jobs and so forth, that second order is okay, it\u2019s more complex now, I need more help in other services.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thank you. Thanks guys. Happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi good morning. Happy holidays upfront here. You guys went through a lot already I just curious just maybe bigger picture question on Oasis why now do a deal of this size? I know this has been around for sometime, just curious why you felt like now was the right time to do such a large deal?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think I do think that timing is by view we\u2019ve certainly known them for a long time and been an had an eye on the PEO, we felt that our own PEO was particular with HROI now with our PEO, we\u2019re really at a very mature level of leadership and sales performance and underwriting so we felt really good about where we were now than Oasis where it is right now, and the need in the market again as I\u2019ve said a couple of times that HROI need is really picked up and PEO is not just a Florida, Texas kind of thing, it is really taking off now with the need for HR support and the acceptance of PEO of the PEO business has really taken off so I think we gained more experience, we felt more comfortable with how strong our existing team was, the integration of HROI and how well that\u2019s gone and now it was time to take on the largest private PEO and make ourselves the second largest PEO, and frankly, the second largest HR outsourcer by worksite employees.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it. That makes sense. I am just curious then with Paychex now going after growth here, especially on the PEO side, and then also investing as you\u2019ve talked about in the past will we be able to break out or appreciate or evaluate the impact of margins from Oasis as well as the impact of margins from your investments, and then the subsequent benefits you might be getting from those investments? Just trying to understand, how if there\u2019s a way that we\u2019ll be able to evaluate the return on investments that you\u2019re making away from Oasis? Does that makes sense? Efrain, I know we\u2019ve talked about this.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so short answer Tien-tsin is yes, we\u2019ll give more information as we go through the year through the year so that people can make those judgments on what\u2019s going on so and you\u2019re right there are there are value enhancing investments that we\u2019re doing in the management solutions side, that over time we would expect improved margins there and there\u2019s acquisitions that we are doing on the PEO and insurance side that will help to fuel revenue growth and over time also improve margins there so we\u2019ll give more color as we go through.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great. Thank you both.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. Just a follow-up on that, I know you said Oasis margins are similar to your PEO margins I guess can you give us color on what that would be I guess as we roll this in?","Efrain Rivera","Tim, I\u2019ll leave for now the discussions of specific margins I think we called out where we\u2019re going to be for the balance of the year, but from a PEO perspective, I just leave it right now, that Oasis is pretty comparable to where we are from a margin standpoint on PEO and actually in some cases a little bit better, because they don\u2019t take any risk on health insurance we\u2019ll update more once we close the deal and then can provide more definitive information going forward.","Tim McHugh","Okay given the way they structure their contract, is there as much passthrough revenue?","Efrain Rivera","No so I mean that\u2019s a good point, and that\u2019s one reason why we\u2019ll talk more once the deal is closed so because and as you know, Tim, because you know the space pretty well everyone accounts for PEO revenue differently, in our case, if it\u2019s a guaranteed contract, we don\u2019t run that through revenue, we were running through revenue the healthcare costs that we\u2019re taking risk on because Oasis doesn\u2019t do any healthcare, any take any risk on healthcare, that revenue does not run through their revenues they obviously have work comp revenue that they take risk on that runs through their revenues, but so there\u2019s differences in terms of a little bit of difference between their revenues and ours because of that, where we have guaranteed contracts we don\u2019t run it through the P&L either so margins actually that\u2019s why I say margins on an apples-to-apples basis are at or above our PEO margins.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And then going back to I think the comment earlier was the sales force can depend how you want to count and up 3% to 5% do you mind how does that compare to last year and the year before, I guess, how much more resources are you going into the selling season with versus what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years?","Martin Mucci","Yes, Tim, we typically be up around 2% to 3% and I think this is 3% to 5% is more like you\u2019re adding the other work other sales forces in as well, so pretty much have grown across the board as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve moved some into what we call virtual for the \u2013 on the payroll, particularly, the small in payroll side we have moved inside in tele-sales, but we\u2019ve also added a number of sales people on the PEO, ASO side, the mid-market side is pretty strong as well, and because we took a little bit of a dip last year, but we\u2019re feeling good about the fact that we\u2019ve got good momentum in the first half of the year, and we\u2019re fully staffed as we\u2019re in this peak selling season.","Tim McHugh","Okay great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.","David Grossman","Thank you. Good morning. There is obviously a lot of discussion about the PEO and you\u2019ve changed your revenue segmentation, and I guess what I\u2019m curious about is if you could give us some insight into the changing business mix in new sales how much of these new sales are standalone payroll versus the bundle products compared to where we were maybe two or three years ago?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I would say it\u2019s different bundles I would say it\u2019s more of a bundled product these days and kind of taking that full, looking for a full product on a very low end, you\u2019re still seeing, hey, I\u2019m looking for basic payroll to help me get started in the business and that one to four or even one to two employees size but above that five employees size, you\u2019re definitely seeing a larger interest and need for time and attendance solutions, HR support etcetera. we don\u2019t necessary breakout percentages, but it\u2019s definitely trended up, and that\u2019s one of the reasons to expand on the HR and the PEO side is that where 5 years ago, David, you\u2019d see, you needed 25 or 30 employees to really say hey I\u2019m interested in PEO or in HR outsourcing, now that is honestly 10 to 15 employees, sometimes need that support, because of the legal issues today, the requirements of the States, the minimum wage changes if you\u2019re multi-state employer, it is really tough even if you\u2019re small, and these rules don\u2019t apply to hey, you have to be 25 and above it\u2019s typically like this harassment \u2013 non-harassment training that\u2019s needed in New York, it\u2019s like one employee and above, you have to do this training by the middle of next year so they\u2019re seeing a lot more need so you\u2019re getting much more of the approach, the go-to-market approach and sales is much more about the full package, and the HR, you\u2019re leading much more with HR or a time and attendance solution etcetera. and the payroll is kind of yes it includes payroll, but the need is for much more of a fully comprehensive solution.","Efrain Rivera","And it\u2019s just shifted to bundles.","David Grossman","Right. I was just kind of thinking pricing aside, unit sale, how is that trended over the past couple of years in terms of what kind of revenue you\u2019re getting per unit sale versus what you\u2019re getting a couple of years ago?","Efrain Rivera","I think you\u2019re talking about revenue per client, or.","David Grossman","Right revenue per client on the unit sale.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, revenue per client has been growing you look over I afraid I\u2019ve said, last three years, you\u2019re up in the 5% 6% range.","David Grossman","Okay. And then just a follow up, I think Marty, actually both of you had mentioned this that the scale of Oasis relative to Paychex in certain geographies may help you can you give us sense of what percentage of your payroll installed base is in those geographies?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I would say that\u2019s an interesting question I don\u2019t have the number of the top of my head. I can tell you that our PEO is certainly covered, probably where the majority of our payroll population is but we definitely have scale of payroll clients and other products in those areas, where they are and we don\u2019t have PEO so we think about it more as, there is in these markets that we\u2019re expanding and probably 10 different new markets, where they have some scale and we have not built it up, it\u2019s because we haven\u2019t built up the PEO in those in those areas and we haven\u2019t had the relationship with the carrier, the insurance carrier, who are the strongest in those markets and now we\u2019ll have scale with that carrier in those markets, and we certainly have enough clients existing to be able to sell PEO into and remember, we sell PEO directly as well so we sell to brand new clients, and as we just talked about that\u2019s a growing need, is they\u2019re interested in PEO right up front they are interested in HR outsourcing right up front, they\u2019re not it\u2019s not just the payroll base that we\u2019re selling to so while we have clients there I\u2019d say the majority of our client base payroll client base, we have covered with PEO, but these new markets, we certainly have thousands of clients that we can sell into, but again, we sell the PEO directly to brand new prospects.","Efrain Rivera","And our PEO, David, as we\u2019ve talked before, it\u2019s predominately a California and Texas and Florida gain, and this gives us strength outside of that so I don\u2019t have a exact percentage for what California, Texas and Florida represent there, but this gives us access to a lot of markets that or at least strength a lot of markets we really weren\u2019t strong in before.","David Grossman","Right and then just one last question, I would say there\u2019s been a lot of kind of headlines about the ACA the last week so the ACA was obviously a big catalyst for this industry a couple years ago, and obviously, we\u2019ve kind of anniversary and we\u2019ve kind of seen the reverse impact of that so any thoughts on directionally what the possibilities maybe for the PEO based on the outcome, what\u2019s going on right now?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think I see, it\u2019s been very interesting, I think even there\u2019s so much confusion in the marketplace among everybody, of course, as to whether it\u2019s in or out we have actually there\u2019s still been plenty of notices that have gone out to clients and non-clients of ours that have said, hey, you have a penalty, and you have to respond to this and so even though, it feels like it\u2019s people aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s on or off, clients are still getting penalties from previous years, saying that, they owe significant sums of money we have been very successful in helping not only our clients, we\u2019ve also offered a service, where if you weren\u2019t a client of ours, but you have a penalty notice and you want to come and talk to us, we\u2019ve been able to help a number of clients and have abated a significant millions and millions of dollars of potential penalties for them so it still is a very much a talking point to new clients and a retention point to existing clients that they need to report, they need to keep the information to report, and that they may get letters from the government saying, you owe something and you\u2019re going to need support on how to get out of it.","Efrain Rivera","But the other part I build on from what Marty said, the tailwind we see for PEO, really has something to do with I think it got turbocharged by Affordable Care Act but really much more \u2013 it\u2019s much more now that integrated HR and benefit play and we saw strength, we saw strength starting two years or so ago, and that strength has continued and some of it has to do with ACA related issues, but a lot of it is really more HR than technology related.","Martin Mucci","And the point I made you made earlier that in the on in such a low unemployment rate, these small and mid-sized companies are really looking to someone to help them have better insurance benefits, offer insurance benefits, help them enroll their employees in these benefits, because they\u2019re having to compete with really large companies and what their benefit plans are.","David Grossman","Thanks for that and happy holidays.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Samad Samana","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was wondering on Oasis, so are all of their customers\u2019 PEO, the 270,000 WSEs, and I know that Paychex historically has included both ASO and PEO clients in their WSE cap could you give us maybe an apples-to-apples number of what the PEO WSE cap looks like following the Oasis acquisition?","Efrain Rivera","Well, we don\u2019t breakout separately we\u2019ll do that as we close the acquisition when we give you the $1.4 million WSEs, there is a significant amount of those that obviously are ASO employees when they when you\u2019re using the 270 figure, they have some ASO employees included in that, they are between 200 and 300 closer to the midpoint on PEO clients, so some of their clients on the numbers that are floating around really are ASO, so we would count them as ASO clients.","Samad Samana","Great thanks for that clarification and that\u2019s why I asked. And then I know that Oasis, I think they were using a third-party software vendor called Prism HR I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re factoring in the opportunity to migrate those customers over to Paychex Flex or if that\u2019s something that\u2019s further down the road and maybe help us understand if there\u2019s a revenue or margin opportunity and the magnitude of that?","Martin Mucci","I think yes, certainly will be looking at that and looking at how what Prism, the flexibility in the offering of Prism, which we think has been very solid for their clients and certainly Flex is for ours so we\u2019ll be looking at the two platforms and it will be further down the road, that is not a necessarily a big savings or anything a synergy that we\u2019re counting on there, because this is more of what provides the best client service and technology for their clients for our clients, and we\u2019ll be looking at that, but that\u2019s not a big part of the synergy is to try to save and that we want to make sure it\u2019s a great experience for the clients no matter what platform they are on.","Samad Samana","Great. And maybe just one last one retention was mentioned a couple of times on the call and improving, and I\u2019m curious if you could just remind us what the peak retention rate was before? And do you think with PEO now and the mix and that being more strategically valuable for customers, holding all else equal, do we think that retention can kind of eclipse the prior highs going forward, maybe just some color on that would be helpful?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think the all-time best was around 82% and as I said we\u2019re approaching that best. I think you make a good point that certainly as you take more products that\u2019s always been part of our model, as you take more products and particularly HR, that drives better retention. But you still have to keep in mind that 80% of our clients are under 20 and many of those still take payroll only and so that will make it more difficult to get that retention much above that kind of all time high we\u2019re always looking to do that there is certainly the possibility is there if they take more products and that their client and that their employees are more tied into things like our mobile app and the technology but I think it\u2019s a little bit tough given the dynamics still at the base.","Samad Samana","Great thanks very much for my questions and next quarter guys. Happy holidays.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","James Faucette","Hi good morning Efrain and Marty. I just had most of my questions have been answered but I was looking for a little bit of color on a couple of things that you\u2019ve talked about in addition to strong attention, you\u2019ve also mentioned new bookings in payroll anything to call out by market or are you seeing any differences in behavior among mid-market or micro-enterprise, among your customer base within whether it\u2019d be retention and new bookings at all?","Martin Mucci","Well, it\u2019s always hard to say before we get through kind of this next this current quarter this third quarter, because the selling season is such an important part of it but we are feeling momentum kind of across the board, whether it\u2019s on the small end of payroll, the mid-market, we\u2019re feeling momentum pretty consistently certainly as well as we\u2019ve talked a lot about the PEO and ASO, time and attendance, retirement, really seeing pretty consistent momentum across the board.","James Faucette","Great. And then second question is just as it relates to your partnerships and wondering if it\u2019s if we\u2019re far enough along to see a trend of middle market clients that were exposed to you through partnership transition to complete solutions or how and if they\u2019re mixing and matching with partners? And I guess just trying to get a sense of how you\u2019re managing that potential channel conflict besides looking at incremental opportunities?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think definitely, the sale is about what\u2019s best for the client and what where do they see the most value we certainly try to make sure that we demonstrate to them that, the vast majority of our clients are still taking a full service, full Flex offering, because of the great benefit of a single employee record, a unified user interface that whether you have retirement you\u2019re on one platform no matter how much you grow for payroll and HR, and that it\u2019s fully integrated so when you\u2019re taking Flex, when you just think of what we just offered in the last quarter, the learning management system, the Flex learning management is giving you training, we are building that into some of the bundles, some low \u2013 free training and then you can build and design your own training to tie that into performance management, that ties to your payroll, that ties to your workflow for HR. So I would say the vast majority are still sold as the full bundle, but you do find in the mid-market, there are clients that say, hey, I am just not ready to make a full switch, if I am already up with a retirement provider or a time and attendance solution and okay, if that\u2019s the way you want to do it, we will go with an API and we think that\u2019s efficient. But in the future that also gives us an opportunity to go back to them and say, hey, this would be even better if you bought more services on the Flex platform.","James Faucette","Great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is now open.","Henry Chien","Hey, guys. It\u2019s Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Thank you for squeezing me in. So lot of stuff was covered. I just wanted to ask sort of big picture question on the Oasis acquisition. So, as we think about the PEO business, I know you touched on it a little bit. What are the kind of synergies that you get from combining sort of two PEO businesses, I know you mentioned there are the carrier relationships, but how does that translate into growth in your business as that let you offer better insurance rate or better products, just sort of what are the benefits of combining two PEO businesses?","Martin Mucci","Yes, sure. And it\u2019s very much about again that top line as we have talked about that really the revenue synergy, the growth synergy. So when you talk about like a carrier relationship, we have had very good carrier relationships, but not with all carriers, because of the markets that they are in and we are in. And now when you go into new markets and you have a strong carrier relationship and now you \u2013 let\u2019s say, you double the size or you increase the size tremendously. Now, when you go to those carriers, they are much more interested in giving you more attention to say, hey, let\u2019s give you the best benefit packages, let\u2019s give you some more support as far as the integration with the carrier, you are dealing with the carrier customer support from the carrier, you are just a larger customer and they are going to give you a lot more support therefore you can offer necessarily more benefit options, packages to clients to be able to give to their employees and a better benefit enrollment experience. And so just think of it from that sales perspective. And then just when you think about all of the various markets and then \u2013 so there is that \u2013 that are just additional markets, where they are in that we are not as Efrain said. We have been in primarily Florida, California, Texas and Georgia and they are in different markets. And now we have some clients there, but we weren\u2019t scaled enough necessarily to deal with those carriers. Now we are going to be scaled between the two of us to be larger in those markets that opens up a great possibility. And also you are dealing with a PEO that didn\u2019t have an insurance agency with it. We have an insurance agency that top \u2013 the 20th largest insurance agency. And when you don\u2019t fit the underwriting profile for PEO, they couldn\u2019t go anywhere else for that. We now take these clients and say, hey, if we can underwrite you as a PEO client, I have an insurance agency product that I can offer you for insurance. So now, you have just opened up a whole new opportunity for them and their PEO clients can now buy retirement services from us, they can buy time and attendance solutions from us and a lot of things that were much larger at that they didn\u2019t necessarily offer to a large variety of their customers.","Henry Chien","Got it, okay. No, that\u2019s really helpful. And maybe just final question, what\u2019s your sense of the \u2013 I mean, it sounds like that the PEO and sort of these combined HR services are really starting to inflect in your view. I mean, what sort of innings or stage you think of adoption you think PEO is in right now?","Martin Mucci","It\u2019s pretty \u2013 I think it\u2019s pretty early, because I don\u2019t see the \u2013 I don\u2019t see the requirements from states or federal government frankly getting that much easier, particularly the states. And I think that more and more clients \u2013 and then as the economy has gotten more, it\u2019s gotten tougher from an unemployment. So, unemployment has gotten lower, harder to find workers, you have gotten a lot of companies, who for the first time have said, okay I really have to offer benefits now. I have to really be sure that I have benefits that I make it easy for my employees to get them or I am not going to track the employees. And by the way, I also have to offer more technology and make it easier for employees to do self-service, to talk, to do things on their mobile phone, to enroll in their benefits, change their benefits and so forth. So I think actually, it\u2019s pretty early innings from adoption of a PEO or frankly any HR outsourcing. Remember that, we are very large in both markets, so PEO is great, ASO is great also and we have over 500 HR people. We are one of the largest obviously and the second largest we will be in this space and that gives us a lot of clout to get in front of clients with technology and service.","Henry Chien","Okay, great. I really appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we don\u2019t have any more questions on queue. You may proceed.","Martin Mucci","Alright. At this point, we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. I thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call and for your interest and investment in Paychex. We hope you and your families have a joyful holiday season. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] ","Now I would like to turn the call over to your speaker, to President and CEO, Martin Mucci. Sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Tanya. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Release Call. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. Efrain will review the financial results for the quarter and our guidance for the full year after my opening comments, and then we'll open it up for any of your questions.","Paychex has made good progress in many areas during the third quarter. We continue to focus on our strategy as the leading provider of payroll human resource and benefit outsourcing to America's businesses. We are driving growth in revenue and profits while providing industry-leading service and products to our clients and their employees. ","We were pleased with many of the key business indicators in Q3. Our checks per payroll has improved for 8 consecutive quarters. Growth in checks per payroll continue to be positive, with the third quarter comparable to the second quarter. Client satisfaction results continue to be at strong high levels, indicating excellent operational execution. And I find this particularly rewarding and telling of our employees the great work they're doing with increased complexity of regulations at the federal, state and local level. And our client retention continues to improve, with payroll client losses down another 5% from the third quarter of last year."," Our third quarter encompasses an important selling period, as you know. Sales of new payroll clients, excluding share payroll during the third quarter, increased moderately compared to the same period last year. While we continue to experience the impact of a challenging environment for new business formation, we find that in the third quarter period in the last 2 years we have seen, this is the first third quarter period in the last 2 years where we have seen an increase in sales compared to the prior year same quarter.","We are experiencing favorable results, I think, from our focus on CPA referrals channels and search engine marketing, and we also did well against all of our competitors. SurePayroll sales have also performed well. Our results reflect the sales force that is doing a great job communicating the strength of the Paychex brand and our product and service quality. With a solid sales leadership team, this year's new compensation plans and sales support tools in place, we have continued to also experience a decline in the payroll sales representative turnover, a statistic that had increased the same period a year ago.","Investing in our business remains a priority. We are excited about our achievements during the third quarter, which include the following: We launched additional enhancements to our software-as-a-service product offerings with our Paychex Online Mobile applications for tablet devices with our Paychex Android app. This will permit clients and their employees to have full access to products and do anything they do now over the web or on a PC or laptop. This is a continuation of our aggressive technology introduction this fiscal year that started with our single sign-on and landing page in October, our iPad app in November, this Android app just released in February and our smartphone app anticipated in June. ","We also unveiled 2 new products. First, our Business Insurance Payment Service relieves business owners of the administrative burdens associated with paying their insurance premiums. Second, our Paychex Advisor Select 401(k) is a new offering that is specifically designed for the fee-based financial advisors. ","We acquired Icon Time Systems, a provider of time and attendance solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. We have had a successful relationship with Icon being sold through our core sales force and related to our time and attendance offerings, a clock really for the under-20 employee group. And there was an opportunity to incorporate them into our company, which we seized upon. We continue to invest in our Paychex next-generation and its suite of innovative products. We believe this is the key building block to our future success, and we're excited about it. ","Our 2 acquisitions from 2011 are creating excellent opportunities in both their markets. SurePayroll continues on track in the do-it-yourself SaaS market. And we continue to make in-roads into the financial advisor marketplace with ePlan services, which further expands our successful 401(k) services, where we continue to sell and service more plans than anyone else in the industry. Both SurePayroll and ePlan offer quality service and from a client standpoint, allow Paychex to offer a full range of payroll and 401(k) outsourcing alternatives. ","We have reaffirmed our expectations on full year guidance provided last June. We expect that increases in checks per client will continue to moderate, and we also expect to continue our planned investments in our business, which will impact our operating income margin. As we move toward the end of this fiscal year, I am proud of the efforts of our employees in all areas of the company. And on behalf of our clients and shareholders, I'm excited about our progress. ","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review the financials in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Yesterday afternoon after the market closed, we released financial results for the third quarter and 9 months ending February 29, 2012. We also filed our Form 10-Q. It provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the year. These are available by accessing the IR page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, and it will be archived and available on our website for about one month.","As Marty indicated, Paychex continued to deliver positive results during the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Some of the key highlights are as follows: Checks per payroll increased 1.8% for the third quarter, which was consistent with the second quarter. This has moderated slightly from the 2.0% for the first 9 months. This moderation is anticipated to continue and will eventually impact quarterly comparisons in both payroll and HRS revenue. ","Checks pay per payroll -- and let me just clarify that checks per payroll are exactly the same calculation we did and referred to as checks per client. We simply think it's a bit more accurate to refer to it as checks per payroll. It's an estimate of the average number of checks issued per client payroll run. During the third quarter, the estimation process was refined. Previously disclosed growth percentages are moderately higher, 2\/10, 3\/10 higher. But directionally, they were unchanged. Also at this point, we don't include SurePayroll in our checks per payroll statistic. ","Sales of new payroll clients, excluding SurePayroll for the third quarter, moderately increased over the prior year third quarter. We saw mid-single-digit growth. Total service revenue grew 8%, both for the third quarter and the 9 months. If we exclude SurePayroll and ePlan, the growth would have been 5% for the quarter and 6% year-to-date.","Operating margin, which is operating income net of certain items as a percent of total service revenue, came in at 35.7% for the third quarter. Our year-to-date margin is 38% -- or was 38%. And we'll talk more about this in a little bit. The interest rate environment remains at low levels. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the third quarter and 1.2% for the 9 months, down from 1.2% and 1.4% last year, respectively.","Now, I'll walk you through our results as presented in the consolidated income statement, with some additional highlights for the third quarter and first 9 months. ","First, payroll revenue. It increased 5% for both the third quarter and 9 months. Organic growth in payroll service revenue, excluding SurePayroll, was 4% for the respective periods. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll and modest increases in revenue per check. Revenue per check was impacted by price increases, offset by discounting. We often get questions during the call regarding pricing in the market. We believe we have a reasonable level of pricing flexibility and some discounting on new sales occurs and is to be expected. We saw nothing out of the ordinary.","Now turning to HRS revenue. It increased 12% for the quarter and 14% year-to-date. Excluding ePlan, HRS revenue growth would have been 10% and 11%, respectively. This growth in HRS revenue reflects the growth in clients and price increases. In addition, our insurance services continue to benefit from growth in health and benefits revenue, which was up 25% for both the quarter and the 9 months, as the number of applicants continues to increase.","Our HR Solutions revenue growth rate is impacted by the mix in our clients. Our HR Essentials produced a lower revenue per employee than our traditional ASO clients. Our PEO business tends to fluctuate with changes in health care rates and workers' compensation plans experience. We've experienced increases in health care insurance rates that have impacted the business over the past 2 years. We've also made significant improvements in our PEO offering and expect that it will get back on track. Meanwhile, our ASO product is posting strong growth compared to a year ago.","Combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income increased 5% for the third quarter and 7% for the 9 months. Yields available on high-quality securities continue to remain low but are being somewhat offset by increases in average investment balances. Expenses increased 8% for the quarter and 7% for the 9 months, partially due to expenses from SurePayroll and ePlan. Excluding SurePayroll and ePlan, total expenses would have grown 5% and 3% for the respective periods. We continue to invest in product development and technology innovation. ","Operating income, net of certain items, which excludes interest on funds held for clients, increased 7% for the third quarter and 10% for the 9 months. As discussed previously, operating margins were a shade under 36% at 35.7% for the third quarter and 38% for the 9 months. As we've indicated in prior quarters, we typically anticipate that our operating margin drops in the second half of the year. Expenses tend to be higher in the third quarter due to cost to support our calendar year and operations and heightened sale season activities. Also, we planned spending in our technology and products that somewhat negatively impacted the margins. We do anticipate that expenses in the last quarter fiscal 2012 be slightly higher from the same period a year ago, and our operating margin will be impacted. We, nevertheless, continue to expect that operating margins will be in the range of 36% to 37% for the full year.","A brief discussion on our liquidity position. Financial position remains strong. Cash and total corporate investments are at $799 million as of February 29, 2012, and we have no debt. That compares to $652 million for the same period last year. Our cash flow from operations were $563 million for the 9-month period, a 2% increase compared to the prior year. The results from higher net income and noncash adjustments to net income, partially offset by fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities due to timing, drive that result.","Working capital fluctuated with the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax and other liabilities. Noncash items increased due to additional depreciation and amortization from our business acquisitions. And as we discussed on the last quarter call, the timing of when a quarter close can impact sometimes the quarter view on cash flow. You can see through 9 months that we're on track.","With respect to investments, funds held for clients as of February 29, 2012, were $4.2 billion compared to $3.6 billion as of May 31, 2011. Funds held for clients vary widely day to day and averaged $3.9 billion for the third quarter and $3.4 billion for the 9 months. This amount represents a year-over-year increase of 7% and 8%, respectively. It's due to a variety of factors including SurePayroll client funds; wage inflation; increases in state unemployment insurance rates, about 2.5 basis point impact, by the way, for the 2012 calendar year; and also increases in checks per payroll. Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $68 million as of February 29, 2012. The same amount for the comparable period was $59 million. ","Our investment strategy is conservative. We have not recognized or realized any impairment losses on our investments. A substantial portion of the investments are high credit quality rated AA or better or A-1\/P-1. Our priority has been and will continue to be to ensure we can meet of our cash commitments to our clients. ","With respect to equity, total stockholder's equity was $1.6 billion as of February 29, 2012, up from $1.5 billion as of May 31, 2011, resulting from earnings and reflecting $344 million in dividends paid during the first 9 months. As you recall, in October, we increased our quarterly shareholder dividend 3% to $0.32 per share. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 35%. ","I'd like to remind you about a couple of our policies regarding guidance. Our outlook is based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Projections don't anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. We expect fiscal 2012 results to be consistent with outlook we've provided back in June and subsequently reaffirmed. We expect checks per payroll will moderate through the remainder of fiscal 2012, and that will impact comparisons in both payroll and HRS revenue. I won't go through the entire guidance, which we repeated at -- both in the press release and in the Q. It's unchanged. The only thing I would point to is the slight change in the effective tax rate approximating the rate impact for the first 9 months of the year.","With that, we'll go into the Q&A.

","Before I turn it over to Marty, Marty and I have been speaking with several of you, with many of you and mentioning that we'd like to have an Investor Day. We're going to be holding that in mid-July. Registration information for the Investor Day will be posted on the website after this call. Please take the opportunity to register on the website. That should be up today, and we hope to see many of you this summer. ","I'll turn it over to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Great. Thanks, Efrain. Yes, as we've talked about that Investor Day, we think it's a great opportunity. This will be the first one that Paychex has had, certainly, in many, many years, and we look forward to elaborating on our story and our future. ","So with that, Tanya, I'll open it up to any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to start with a question on the expenses side of things. You've been very consistent telling us that the expenses are going to elevate in the second half, the products, the technology, et cetera. I wanted to get a sense of whether or not you see that elevated level of investment bleeding into fiscal '13 or do you feel like you're going to capture most of the incremental spend that you need to make in fiscal '12?","Efrain Rivera","Jason, we haven't obviously completed our plans for 2013, but I think that what we recognize is that we need to continue to invest in technology. I think we've done a good job over the past, certainly, 3 to 4 years of offsetting that with other efficiency increases. So our intention going into the planned period is that we'll continue to spend at a reasonably high level and look for offsets in other parts of the P&L.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And just to switch over to the sales front for a second. I think you said mid-single-digit new sales growth here for the February quarter, is that right?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, right.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","When was the last time it was that high in any quarter, I mean let alone key selling season quarter?","Martin Mucci","It's been a couple of years since we've seen that kind of increase.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. Do you feel like that's sustainable? I mean, is this is a little bit of an inflection point or should we not make too much of it because it is the key selling season and things can bounce around?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think anytime you see it for the first time, you want to be a little bit careful. And -- but we're certainly pleased with it because it has turned in this important selling season. I think the sales folks did a great job. And -- but I guess I'd say, we're kind of being conservative in waiting and seeing how the next 2 quarters come out. But we certainly were feeling good about the increase since it's the first time in a couple years.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes. And just last one for me. I was hoping we could get maybe a little bit more of a detailed update on the CPA referral channel. How many CPAs are part of it these days? Is that network growing? Any latest data on the percent of your new sales that come from the CPA network, as well as anything you can tell us about what percent of those CPAs are exclusive to Paychex for payroll referrals and what the competitive environment looks like in terms of going after the CPAs?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think, we don't give -- Jason, we don't give that much out. But I will give you the sense that we feel we've -- it's always been a strong channel for us. We've seen this one come back stronger so where you see new business starts. When you look at the sales increase and you see new business starts still fairly flat year-over-year, sales from new business starts, so we know that's still a challenging environment. So we stepped up the communications with the CPAs, which are a very important channel to us, and the value that we add. I would say, that the number of CPAs that are referring are probably up a little bit. But I would say, that generally what we're seeing is more referrals from the CPAs that we've been in contact with and have relationships with.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you quantify your preliminary views of your fiscal '13 price increase?","Efrain Rivera","We're still in the planning process. It will be in the low single digits.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. And could you also update us on initiatives implemented by your new head of sales, Mark Bottini, since he took over in October of last year?","Martin Mucci","Sure. I think Mark has been spending a lot of time in the field. And he has been out talking to all of the sales reps and the different divisions, the leadership. He has spent a lot of time making sure that the changes we made last year -- beginning of the fiscal year, including the new compensation plan for the core payroll sales reps, have been working well. He has been making sure that we're executing on the training initiatives, as well as all of the support tools that we have given the sales force. We gave them higher-speed tablets over a year ago and have put sales force and so forth on those. He has also brought back to the marketing and support teams in sales the additional things that are needed, so we're doing some new things on sales demos and some other support tools. I think he is extremely active, fitting in extremely well and really getting a great handle on it. I think the biggest thing is just making sure that the focus is on execution, not only in units, but on revenue per client and that we're continuing to grow in all markets that we can.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Do you think that you are seeing a significant increase in revenue per client, I mean, outside of existing price increases?","Martin Mucci","No, I wouldn't say that. I think what we're doing is focusing on maintaining that. You always have the competition out there. And we thought we did well in the third quarter against our competition, frankly, all competitors, and that you're always balancing pricing and discounting. And he's keeping a focus on -- the focus is on executing both unit sales and that you keep the revenue per client that we're expecting.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And just finally, can you quantify sales force turnover in the third quarter?","Martin Mucci","We don't give the number specifically, but I'll tell you that it's in the low 30%, 30% to 33%, and that's back to historic levels. So we're pleased that, as I said earlier, that all of the actions that have been taking place and then Mark coming in and the leadership team that is out there is really driving this retention back to the historical levels. We'd like to see it get even better, but it certainly is back down significantly from last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to go back to Jason's earlier questions about expenses and any spillover into fiscal 2013. Just some commentary, is there anything unusual that you guys would expect to preclude you guys from being able to show continued margin expansion as we move into fiscal 2013?","Efrain Rivera","Julio, this is Efrain. Without going through a plan -- but the reason why I hesitate is we're not -- we're in the middle of a plan process. So the answer to your question is sure, there's one thing that could. We could have initiatives that we decide we want to fund that could cause us in a given year to say, we're not going to create margin expansion. And also, it depends on the mix of sales we're delivering. So we're still -- it's still early to be able to make that call. But in a normalized year, we would be able to leverage. It depends on what initiatives we decide will be part of this year's planning cycle.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you guys have done a really nice job of bringing in new assets, acquiring some higher growth pieces. As you guys look across the landscape, and we think about the longer-term opportunities for continuing to drive the total reported revenue growth with M&A, any particular pieces to the offerings that you guys are kind of looking at more broadly, maybe trading off the health -- sorry, the HRS side versus the payroll side? What would the priorities be more from an M&A perspective at this point?","Martin Mucci","Well, the focus -- I guess, I'll just start and then let Efrain jump in. I think the focus certainly is on growth. The challenge for us always is the growth. Finding the high growers is good, but the margin -- that have margins like us are not. They're tougher to find, but we're looking across the entire landscape. Anything that can assist and drive value to our small- and medium-sized business clients, I think, is important to us. And we've really kind of searched the gamut anywhere from the PEO business to payroll companies to product add-ons. And that's what's -- and I think, as you can see, we've been much more aggressive the last 1.5 years on that between SurePayroll and ePlan and now Icon for the clock for us and the time clock. So we'll continue to look. And anything that's a good deal, we'll certainly go after.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, and I agree. The HRS space, obviously, is very active at the moment. Valuations are very high. But we look in both core payroll and also on the HRS side for products that are interesting and would be good add-ons, both from a standpoint of being easy to sell through our sales force and value to clients.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, the answer probably is no change, but I'm just curious on the commitment to the dividend and the payout ratio going forward.","Efrain Rivera","No change.","Martin Mucci","Yes, no change.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wonder if you could talk -- if we could just go back to the demand environment. It's obviously picked up a little bit here on the new sales front. Could you tell us if that's more macro driven or do you feel like maybe it's just kind of falling through because you got the sales force more organized? I know it's just one quarter, but I'm wondering if you could characterize it for us.","Martin Mucci","Yes, it's a good question. I think it's a mix of both. I think, when you look at the macro environment, we don't see new business formations picking up much. They're still pretty flat. And in the sales from those new business formations have pretty flat. Where we're seeing an increase is coming from search engine marketing, where I think we're doing a much better job marketing the company and attracting those leads, as well as the CPA channel. So I think that there's a macro piece that's picking up slightly in certain areas of the country. It seems to be getting a little better but not a lot. And then I think there's just better execution and better focus on the CPA channel and some of the things that we've been doing with the sales force and that the leadership has been driving there is starting to pay off, so I think it's a balance.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, just kind of looking at your technology rollout. It seems like you've hit some of your goals here at some of the mobile launches, et cetera. Maybe you could talk about what your plans are going forward and maybe what inning you are in the process of sort of updating the technology side of things.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we've been very pleased with the plans that we've put in place and been able to hit the targets for us. Definitely, it's a SaaS-based focus. It is making sure that our clients have the ability to do what they want to do when they want to do it and where. We've been very pleased with the feedback on our single sign-on page, where we've integrated. So you're going to see more online, more SaaS, more integration of data in products. There are single sign-on and landing page we did back in the fall. We got very good feedback from clients, where they can see all their services online and maneuver around those services much easier. They have -- the iPad app has been very popular. And the Android app just released, I think, will go over well. We built those also very carefully to optimize whatever piece of equipment that the client is using. That's a little bit different than some of our competitors, and we feel that the smartphone app that we'll come out with in June will be superior. And again, it's that ease-of-use. So as we focus out beyond that, we continue to work on what we call Paychex next-generation, and that's the technology that will continue to more integrate our services and just make it easier and bring more value to our clients. That's really the simple answer.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, maybe you could talk about SurePayroll and how that SaaS offering is going. Any numbers that you could share with us would be great and how you're integrating that into your sales process if there's any cross-selling.","Martin Mucci","Yes, we've actually -- they're doing fine. They have continued to do well on the sales side, and they are focused really on their market. We've left them somewhat separate on purpose because they are a SaaS offering and they appeal to the do-it-yourself market. The whole reason that we acquired and brought them into the Paychex family was to be part of this growing manual market that now this do-it-yourself that's doing it manually will now come over to a SaaS-based model. And so while our sales forces can and do trade leads and so forth but that's really at a minimal level, and it's more that our sales force is focused on that one that wants to outsource, that client that wants to outsource. And the SurePayroll SaaS model is really more driven by Internet lead search, and they go directly to them and they're sold over the phone. But they're on target. They're growing well, and we're pleased with the performance that, that group is doing.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. I mean, if could show us, is that accretive to margins at this point?","Efrain Rivera","No, it's not. And we've said, Joe, that this year would be slightly dilutive. It will start to get better in the outer years, mostly because with the roll-off with the amortization of intangibles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Marty, I wanted to just ask you about SurePayroll and how you're pricing the product. Have you changed the pricing of the product since it's gotten into the Paychex family [ph]?","Martin Mucci","Kartik, it's hard to hear you. You're breaking up quite a bit.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","I'm sorry, Marty, maybe this will -- I apologize. I wanted to ask you about the pricing for SurePayroll and the pricing of that product now that it's in the Paychex family versus when it was in another company. Have you changed that at all? And if so, is that having an impact?","Martin Mucci","No, we haven't. We saw that as -- they were pretty well set up in the pricing plans that they had in the model and in the way that they're competitive there, so we have not changed their pricing. We're always looking at it for fiscal '13, but I don't see any major changes to their pricing model or their approach in fiscal '13.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And Efrain, I think you said, expect low single digit for pricing. And I'm wondering, do you anticipate discounting? I know a couple years ago, discounting became a big issue because the environment wasn't very good and because new business formations are still weak. Would you anticipate discounting for new businesses to be a little bit more so than it has in the last year?","Efrain Rivera","You know what, Kartik, I don't have a good read on that. I think for planning purposes, we may make that assumption as we go through the year, still kind of deciding what we think we'll get out of any price increase we take. So I think it's fair to say that we're looking at that closely.","Martin Mucci","Yes, it's kind of all in the mix of -- as Efrain said, we're in the middle of our plan for next year, so it's all in the middle of the pricing and the discounting. All are intertwined, so we're not at a point yet where I think we'd say how we see that coming out in '13.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question. I think, Efrain, you said you have about $800 million on the balance sheet. Obviously, there will be more by the end of this year and by next -- end of next fiscal year. You might even be close to $1 billion. And last time you got to that point, you did a pretty massive share buyback. And I'm wondering maybe what the philosophy will be this time around. It seems like acquisitions, if you do, do them, they're very small. So I'm just wondering maybe what your thoughts are as the balance sheet continues to get stronger and stronger.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Kartik, this is sort of an answer to your question and also a partial answer to Julio's question. Marty has made the point in the past that we do think in this environment, it's important to keep powder dry. There are opportunities out there that we are looking at, and that's not to flag any individual opportunity but the pipeline, there are -- has provided us with some opportunity. Now we are pretty selective as to what we go for and probably turn down many more than most companies. So we are attempting to balance one, leaving ourselves with enough ready cash to move quickly because that's an advantage we perceive in the market, with returning -- not leaving too much cash on the balance sheet because the asset returns, obviously, are not great. We have -- I would say, we have a very robust dialogue with the board on that issue. They are the ultimate arbiters as to how cash will be deployed. But as you -- as we've said, as we get closer to $1 billion and we don't have a ready use for the cash, then we have to entertain a number of ways to return cash back to shareholders. And I think our history has indicated we'll do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just the first question. I want to go back to sort of the sales growth, the mid-single digits. Just to sort of clarify, I want to make sure that's sort of a growth sales figure. And if that's the right assumption, I just want to get -- just want to think about that sort of in the context of sort of net customer growth. I know you sort of talked about client losses improving 5%. But maybe it would be helpful to sort of understand where attrition still falls with this still sort of low 20%. And with that mid-single-digit sort of growth sales number, are you contemplating net customer growth for the year at this point?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, let me just aggregate that, Glenn, because there's a number of pieces there. So when I say mid-single digits, I'm talking about revenue growth. I want to make that clear, sales growth, and I'm focusing particularly on the core payroll portion of the business. Obviously, other parts of the business have been growing very nicely. We had a particular focus this quarter on core payroll results. So that's part -- what Marty alluded to was a continuation in the trend of fewer client losses. We also saw that in the quarter. So in order to get to a revenue number, obviously, you have to take the sales units that you have less the losses. I think what we've been saying through the year is that after 3 years, where we were down both 3%, 3% and 1%, down in the last 3 years. We think that this year is going to be flattish in terms of client base.","Martin Mucci","So the increase that we're talking mid-single digits is gross sales kind of third quarter over third quarter, and then the losses are about 5% better third quarter over third quarter. And as Efrain said, as we've been saying pretty much all year, we feel good that we're turning on the client growth. We're going to get back around flat pretty close and -- but it -- which is much better than where we've been in the last 3 years.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so the attrition likely with that 5% improvement in losses, you're probably hovering around 20%. Is that fair?","Martin Mucci","On losses, yes.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify on the revenue per check comment and maybe just going back to the discounting, you were sort of asked the question on '13. But what are you sort of seeing in terms of the discounting going through the sort of this sales cycle this period relative to a year ago?","Efrain Rivera","We saw moderate discounting.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","But was it sort of better than a year ago or pretty comparable?","Efrain Rivera","I think it was probably comparable to last year.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, the decelerating checks per payroll expectation. Is it more just tougher comps? And what I'm kind of thinking is, does it get counter-balanced by the improved employment trends or shouldn't that be offsetting? Because really, that's kind of my question.","Efrain Rivera","Glenn, as you know, we've had this question now for probably 3 quarters. We know if we step back and look over several quarters, the trend has been down. We, frankly, thought that the checks per client -- the checks per payroll, I should say, would be down a little bit more than it was in the quarter. So it's decelerating more slowly than we thought. So we just -- we think that a combination of comps and the fact that at our average payroll size, you can't keep adding clients forever, that at some point that trend runs its course.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess my first question is, as you look at the need for investing in product, investing in growth, could you comment on what your longer-term margin expansion target is, sort of try to break that down for us, maybe?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, look, we traditionally go into every planning cycle looking for a leverage of about 100 basis points at least and some years higher than that. In years where we did even higher than that, we had the tailwind of higher interest expense which -- I should say, interest income, which we don't have. So it will be more year-by-year in terms of what we target, and it will be balanced out by a need to continue to invest in technology and any other initiatives that we think will foster growth.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But in terms of a specific target that you might want to get to, is that something -- are you comfortable discussing that or is that something you'd rather leave for the Analyst Day, which, by the way, I think, is a great idea.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I think we'll talk more about it then, Ashwin. But I would say this, locking yourself into one margin target, we'll talk about it, what we think it will be on a more normalized basis. Locking in here before we've gone through a planning cycle is a little bit difficult. And longer term, we prefer to lay that out in the context of what we think makes sense in terms of investment for growth in the future.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. And then given what the yield curve is indicating about interest rates for the next couple of years, any comments on what your go-forward approach is? Would it be different than the traditional treasury muni approach? I saw you're yielding a little bit more variable rate than this year.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, well my view is the following, that our approach has always been to preserve liquidity and safety first. So we have a challenge in terms of doing that and increasing the yield on the portfolio. Having said all of that, we will look at any opportunities that we think improve that yield commensurate with very high levels of safety and liquidity.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Last question, you commented a lot on the price discounting here. But is there anything different about the source of the price discounting? Is it your large national competitor? Is it Intuit? Is it more of local peers? Anything different there?","Martin Mucci","No. I think the environment is pretty much the same. I think most of that comes from the largest -- the national competitor but not always. Sometimes there's regional players as well. But I think the environment has not changed much at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess the first question, the better new sales is obviously a positive number. But given that you tend to have pretty high client retention, how should we think about that? And even if you get into a trend of that continuing to happen here, the timing it takes to flow through into your total revenue growth, is this the kind of thing we should notice some benefit pretty quickly or should we think of this being a couple year process to flow in better sales growth?","Efrain Rivera","Gary, that's a good question. Look, Paychex is a battleship and not a speedboat. And so the turn occurs very, very slowly. And the ramp occurs slowly, both on the upside and frankly, on the downside. It takes a while for those revenue numbers to make it through the client base. You have to increase the client base, increase the client revenue and then hold it over a period of time for it to start to see -- make its way into revenue. And so it's slower rather than faster.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And you did specifically say earlier in the call that there would be some impact on growth from your expectation for some moderation in checks per clients or checks per payroll. How should be think about the interplay between the 2? Is the stronger sales enough to offset that or would it be positive or would it be more likely to be slightly negative or maybe just not -- they offset each other?","Efrain Rivera","Well, that's an interesting modeling exercise. I think we're going through that in our planning process now, and there will be some level of offset. How much, I can't say at this point.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one, on the checks per client -- I'm sorry, I'll get used to this, checks per payroll decelerating. Can you give us a sense of the historical relationship between that number and the growth in either nonfarm payroll there or maybe private payroll is better? It's just I'm still -- I asked the question last quarter, and I'm still having a hard time understanding how we're seeing moderate acceleration in the growth of jobs or in the growth of the small business segment of jobs at the same time this is decelerating. I realize you were growing this metric much faster than payrolls were growing over the last year, so maybe that's part of it but...","Efrain Rivera","Well, Gary, we haven't done the correlation. We know from some modeling work that we've done that, that metric tracks to some extent what's going on in the broader economy. The problem is it's just a slice, not the entirety of it. And I can't cite a correlation number. We haven't done that level of modeling.","Martin Mucci","It depends on the mix of clients as well that are coming in and out of the base. So if you start selling smaller clients, not that we've changed really our selling. But sometimes as jobs come back, sometimes they come back in the smaller clients, sometimes they come back in the larger clients. So depending on who you're selling in your mix of your base, that can adjust that as well. But there's some correlation, but it also has to do with mix year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But I just wanted to ask you about your comments you made about the PEO business. Is that business still growing? And I guess maybe just elaborate a little bit more on how much of a headwind those health care costs have been for PEO.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, if we go back to Q3 of last year, you'll remember we mentioned that  high health care costs within our PEO, and it's a bit more specific to the PEO business, had impacted that business we -- and in the PEO business you get one shot. It's either gain or lose clients at the end of calendar year. Typically, people are making that decision, as many of you know. We went into that season with what we thought were pretty competitive rates. It turned out that they weren't as competitive as we thought. And PEO didn't have a good selling season in the third quarter. Having said that, 2 things, I think, are important, Tim, to remember about that. The first is that the PEO is one part of a 3-part offering. We talked about HR Essentials, and we talked about the ASO. The ASO is now doing very well and is much larger than the PEO. And the way we have chosen to go to market is to say to a client, we offer you a variety of options in terms of how you want to handle your HR outsourcing. And if an ASO offering is a better option for you, we'll go there. We're not steering you to the PEO option. Others in the market do something slightly different. What we found is that people are tending to go with the ASO option. Even though fully loaded, the ASO and the PEO don't differ all that much in terms of costs. But for us at least, the PEO's performance has been very sluggish.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then one more, if I could slip in the Icon acquisition. Is it right to think about that as not being very much incremental revenue, given that you sold the product before but I guess some costs would be down. But can you just -- the financial impact of that?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, we think there's an opportunity there, but it's not going to be a significant revenue driver.","Martin Mucci","Yes, we're really just getting started with that over the last year or so, and we saw that as a chance to bring the development in-house. They have a small team. We can add to that. We can make changes faster to the clocks that we want to make that integrate faster with our products, and we've also found it to be a very good product. So we wanted to be sure we had full control over it. So -- but it won't have a material impact right off the bat, but it is selling pretty well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Kissane with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just want to -- not to beat a dead horse here, but just want to confirm that pricing was net positive in the quarter. Because in the release, and I think in your comments, you said that price increases were offset by discounting. So I just want to make sure that is was net positive.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, it was net positive. The better term was partially offset.","Martin Mucci","Yes, we're just trying to be -- on that one, we're trying to be clear that you have obviously both price increases and discounting. But it wasn't that it got offset, it was definitely net positive.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Because last quarter, you also said that discounting had moderated. And it sounds like just kind of reading between the lines, that maybe it got a little bit worse this quarter. Is that fair to say?","Efrain Rivera","No, I don't think sequentially it was that different.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think it always gets a little bit -- if you look third quarter to third quarter, it gets always a little bit more aggressive because it's a big selling season for all payroll providers. So -- but we didn't see anything different, I'd say, selling season to selling season.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's right. You said it was in line with last year. And Efrain, you said there's no change in the definition of checks per client or checks per payroll. Why did the numbers change? I guess it was an estimating process change.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, it was estimation. When I came in with the finance team, I asked a number of questions with respect to the computation of it. We took a look at it and saw that there was some refinements we could make on the methodology. It boosted it slightly.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then one just last question. Marty, the sales force turnover, where did it peak about in the last year? And maybe when was the last time it was below 30%?","Martin Mucci","I don't remember the last time it was under 30%, but it was -- it peaked over 40%, just slightly over 40% last year. So now we're back down into that, let's say, 31% to 33%, so we're in that. And historically, it's always been, at least in the last 10 years, between 30% and 33% for core payroll.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you give us a sense where your targets are over the next couple years?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think in the short term, I think it will probably right in that historical range. I think in the longer term, certainly, hoping to see that closer to 25% to 30%. I don't think you can go -- with the driving force that we have in that sales team and the effort of farming for new business all the time, I think probably 25% to 30% is the best you're going to do. But we feel good about the recruiting and the training initiatives we put in place and certainly the leadership team and that, that will drive it closer to 30% and a little bit below.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's great. And if I can get one last one, sorry. The strength in sales, was it more larger clients relative to your average or more smaller clients relative to your average?","Martin Mucci","I'd say about the same or maybe slightly smaller but pretty close to the same. There was not a big change in type -- in size of client.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Efrain, I wonder if I could just start with the investment portfolio, and I'm not sure you've undertaken this exercise. But if rates stay at relatively flat with where they are and you see trend line growth in balances, can you give us a sense of when we would start seeing positive year-over-year growth in interest on client funds?","Efrain Rivera","So -- okay, just so I know my hypothetical here. So you're saying interest rates at current levels?","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right, that the current rate environment stays flat.","Efrain Rivera","You're probably 2 to 3 years out.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, and that assumes just normalized investment balance grade?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, just to roll off of the portfolio.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly -- and I think several people have asked this in different ways, but you guys have given great insight into the bookings and some of the other moving pieces in terms of retention and pricing. But if you assume -- it seems like things have really stabilized to a certain extent. So if you see the bookings that you've seen in the third quarter, is it reasonable to think that the payroll business would kind of maintain its current growth trajectory?","Efrain Rivera","So you're saying -- I want to confirm, David, that by growth trajectory, you mean what we've seen in Q3?","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Well, I'm just saying, what you'll probably see for the fiscal year.","Efrain Rivera","For the fiscal year?","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right, right. So if you're assuming...","Efrain Rivera","I think the way we think about it, David is that -- and Marty, I think, was careful to point this out, third quarter was certainly better than it's been in previous years. We need a couple of quarters of comparable growth to basically say, \"Yes, it looks like the ship has turned.\" I think, our going-in assumption for looking out 6 to 12 months is that, that period is going to look fairly comparable to the past 6 to 12 months.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right, so I guess...","Martin Mucci","That was a slow turn, a very slow turn.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. But I guess the question is that -- is the new bookings in the third quarter, since this is your sales season, you got 9 months behind you, is that enough given the current pricing environment and where you are in retention enough to maintain comparable levels of growth to what you've been seeing over the last 3 quarters or so?","Efrain Rivera","David, I guess the best answer I can give you without having gone through the planning course finalizing, we're in that range.","Martin Mucci","We don't see any surprises with it. I think the big piece over there, the checks and as we've talked about that will moderate as an increase year-over-year. And so we've got new clients that we had a good quarter, kind of a nice turnaround, I think, on improving. We don't know if that's going to continue the next 2 quarters or not. We want to be conservative and see what's happening there and -- but we certainly think we still have pricing power. We think we have -- obviously, I think the macro environment is slightly better, but it's still slow. So I think we're going to be in the range of where we've been year-to-date.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right, very good. And just one final question, and I think, again, this was asked in a different context before. But in terms of the higher investment spending, is your view that the spending that you're undertaking and the increases are really just to kind of maintain your competitive position? Or should we kind of look forward and start seeing a manifestation of that in terms of retention or revenue per client? And if so, what's the time frame that you would start expecting to see some positive impact on those metrics?","Martin Mucci","Well, that's a great question. I definitely think it's making us more competitive. That's the spend now. Competitors always -- obviously, good competitors that we have try to stay up and above and past us. But with the way we've laid this out, we feel that will make ourself very competitive, and that's what the spend is all about is really being sure that we're ahead of the competition in what we're offering of value to our clients. So when does that start to pay off? I think hopefully very soon because we're making good investments that I -- and what I'm really proud of is the technology is coming out, so it's not like waiting 3 years to get something. Every -- about every 6 months or so, we're producing something that we said we were going to produce on time and of high quality. So I think, obviously, you got to wait to see it, but I think that it will start to show up obviously in the next year or so.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. And David, I guess I would not characterize our current spending as catch-up spending for what we needed to do to catch up to where competition is. And I think that we're working on things, frankly, that will put us ahead of competition. Now whether we will see that in the next -- the time frame for doing that, we'll talk a little bit more about that probably in the summer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Macdonald with First Analysis.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Going back to the HR business, you had a sequential decline, I think, in employee -- in work site employees. Could you talk about that? Was that mostly the PEO?","Efrain Rivera","That's -- yes, as we talked about in the Q, a chunk of that's the PEO. But Jim, I'd just caution, if you look at last year and you included the ASO employees of Q3, you would have seen a slight decline in the Q2 to Q3 comparison. And the reason for that is that you just tend to lose more clients in Q3. Normalized last year, you would have lost about 3,000 work site employees. This year, it was about 6,000, mostly driven by the PEO.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And the reason we didn't see it last year was HR Essentials or...","Efrain Rivera","That's right. So that wasn't initially in the press release in Q3 last year. We didn't adjust for HRE then until Q3 -- until the Q3 press release. But when you were looking at it from Q2 to Q3 -- and I forgot which one of you pointed that out, that this was the first year of sequential decline in work site employees. That, frankly, was our bad because we revised it, but you'd have to look at a number of sources to figure that out.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And you mentioned, I think, in your initial remarks that you have made some changes to the PEO business. Could you talk about what you've done there to make it more competitive?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think the focus was on -- that we ran, particularly last year, was the health insurance rates. And so we've been working with the carrier to get more effective rates by market. Also, we've worked on truing up our underwriting process. It's been a good process but probably have been very tight, and so that makes it difficult sometimes for the sales process and so forth. And so we're working together with the carrier on the underwriting, as well as our sales teams. A lot of these things we've put in place. It's just been a little bit more challenging environment. And then as Efrain mentioned earlier, the important thing is that, that sales force has options to them to sell to the client, particularly they have an ASO model or the PEO model. And there's really nothing wrong with the ASO model being sold to them. And so I think that, that's been something that they've been more aggressive on is selling the ASO model, and that's done very well of this year. So I think one of the things we're looking at is how do we make sure that the incentives are correct for sales team as well to be sure that the client -- that everything, all is equal there for them selling each product. If one is easier than the other to get through the process and have the successful sale, that's the way they'll go. And right now, I think that was the ASO model.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I jumped on a little bit late. But I wanted to ask, the 5% sales growth, how was that versus internal plans?","Efrain Rivera","We don't disclose that. We also didn't say 5%, Bryan. We said mid-single digits.","Martin Mucci","But it was -- the main thing there, Brian, that I think we wanted to demonstrate to give you some sense of it was that it's the first time that, that's increased in over 2 years in that selling season in that third quarter, and we are very pleased with that. We don't really disclose versus plan, but we certainly felt good that it was an increase over the previous 2 third quarters.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I was just trying to get a sense balancing that with client growth being flattish, if that was kind of a number you expected or -- because I guess you take those 2 components, and that will get us closer to actual what the core payroll growth will probably look like.","Efrain Rivera","It's one way to figure it. But I think we were satisfied with the progress we saw in the quarter.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just along those lines, were you guys satisfied also with the client growth or were you hoping to get a little bit higher? Or is that just out of your guys' hands to business formations where that's going to be?","Martin Mucci","No, I always want -- we always want more client growth. And so -- but I think that we were pretty pleased with the turn and the fact that it improved over the last couple years, the macro environment as we see it hasn't changed all that much. It's just been this steady kind of better, but new business formations still have not improved much. And so to be able to sell more without that, I think that, that's been our focus and so we were pleased with it.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. And the other thing, Bryan, as you know, it's not just what you sell but also what you retain. We had","[Audio Gap]","comes with market share.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins with Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you talk about how you profit from the asset value of retirement funds? Is this mostly fees on a per client basis or does it some vary by total assets in the plan?","Efrain Rivera","Both. So we charge an administrative fee for the setup of and the record keeping for the 401(k) plans. A smaller but still reasonable amount of that revenue stream comes from asset fees. Let me tell you just one other thing, Sara, just to clarify, those will decline over time.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then separately, the -- you maintain the guidance on the interest on client funds down 12% to 14% for the full year. It looks like we're well below that so far this year, so I'm just wondering what you're expecting for the end of the year.","Efrain Rivera","Really, no real changes in terms of the trends you've seen in the first 3 quarters. I think that we disclosed the interest rates and size of the portfolio average client. But then also, you can pretty much guesstimate where we're going to end up.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So maybe that 12% to 14% is somewhat conservative?","Efrain Rivera","I won't go into a lot of detail. But on a gross basis, yes. It could be a little bit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with RW Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm just wondering, you've had a lot of different initiatives in place with the sales force for this fall selling season. What were the elements that you'd say worked really well? What still needs to be fine tuned from your perspective?","Martin Mucci","That's a good question. I think they're all having a piece of it in improving things. I think the comp plan was good. I think that's been positive since the beginning of the year. I think it's made it much cleaner and clearer for the sales reps to sell and know what they're going to make, so that's been very positive. I think the training has been good. I think that picks up more on the new reps that are coming in, and I think the leadership development has been very important. And I think the leadership team, including Mark Bottini and his team, have done very well on leadership development. So I think it's all of those, I can't point to one thing, and it's fine-tuning. I think it's just continual work on those things for better execution. But I think that I don't see any one of those I guess I'd say is not hitting the mark. I think it's just the degree that they've hit the mark, so we'll continue to work on all those. I'd say the primary one has continued to be leadership development. I think the best thing to execute better is to have great leaders, managers out there who are supporting the reps. And that keeps the -- that definitely has driven the turnover back down because when you've got a good leader, you stay plugged in and you execute. And that's really important to us. So I'd say the leadership development is what we continue to really focus on. The rest of things, I think, are going pretty well, and they may have tweaks for next year, but I don't see anything major.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then what about the price bundling and that strategy, how do you feel that went?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think okay. I think there's some adjustments we can make. And as Efrain said, we're working through the fiscal '13 plan now, and that's all encompassed in there. So we're finalizing our thinking on that and probably could give you more a quarter or so from now, but there'll be some tweaking there but again, nothing major. The good news is I don't see major, major changes being made but I think we could -- there's always pricing adjustments and packaging and discounting and so forth that you look at. So I don't think it's hurt us dramatically, but I think we could do a little better there, and you'll see some change there.","Efrain Rivera","And Mark, one other thing I'd add on that is that here on a quarterly basis, we look at where our packages are. We look at where our discounting is. And we tweak, and we pile it and we look at different options in terms of what seems to work in a given situation. We especially do that going into the selling season so that we're in the best competitive position. And we obviously keep one eye out on what the competition is doing. It's really important, and I think we've learned this, to not stay too stagnant in your offering and not stay too stagnant in your pricing approach because our competition's pretty sophisticated in terms of what they do, and we keep an eye on that.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then this has been asked in multiple occasions, just trying to get it, reasonable assumptions for at least our models as we look out to next year. And so this isn't a guidance question. But if I think about the number of clients that you lost declined, you actually ended up having your best fall selling season, early year of selling season in 3 years. You're going to have a moderate increase in terms of the number of clients that you have in place. With all of those factors being in place, why wouldn't your core payroll revenue growth stay at least at the level of the organic growth? And I know -- I recognize that in the fourth quarter we annualized the SurePayroll acquisition, which has been adding between 100 to 200 basis points per quarter. But if we strip that out, is there any reason why the core payroll shouldn't increase at least at the rate of the organic?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, it's a good way to get at next year's guidance, so here's what we're looking at, Mark. So what we look at is we look at the environment coming out of the year. We've had a good -- a reasonably good quarter. We're cautious about where we end the year at. That will determine whether we're flat, slightly down or slightly positive to end of the year. So that's one element. Second, is we make a call on what we think the discounting environment is going to be in going forward and decide what we think of whatever price increase, which we had not decided, by the way, at the moment yet, will stick and won't. And then third, we have to make a decision with respect to what we bake in on checks, and that's a bit of a wild card at the moment in our crystal ball. Your crystal ball is probably just as good as ours, although we probably wouldn't use it. We'll develop our own scenario. You put all those together and we see an environment that's not too dissimilar from the one we've seen this year. That's our going-in assumption. That's about as far as I can go.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of what SurePayroll has been adding, has it been closer to 100 basis points or 200 basis points relative to the organic growth rate?","Efrain Rivera","To the organic growth rate? It hasn't been 100 basis points. You mean for the year, Mark? You mean year-over-year?","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, as it relates to just the core payroll.","Efrain Rivera","X acquisition, so first quarter was 4, second quarter was 2.8, this quarter was 4. So call it mid to high 3. And then when all is said, we're going to be about 1.5 to 2 points from SurePayroll.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the HR services, it looks like you're making really good progress, particularly with regards to health and benefits applicants. Could you talk a little bit more about that in terms of what the trajectory is there and where we are in terms of generating profits from that initiative?","Efrain Rivera","What I'd say about insurance -- I'll let Marty fill out my comments, is that while we highlight health and benefits, there's actually other parts of that business that include workers' comp, they are having a tremendous year so far. They've done very, very well. And we had excellent leadership in place driving that -- the insurance business. There is some uncertainty, obviously, depending on what happens with health care reform. We assume that we'll continue to do well in that business. We've been growing 20%-plus, that's what we assume going forward. Obviously a little of that is subject to a heavy caveat based on what comes out of the current court proceedings.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think exactly what Efrain said, it's 20%-plus growth. We see that continuing. I think there's been a little pressure on the commission side of it, in the health side because of health care reform. That's -- we'll know by next quarter a pretty good sense of at least what the Supreme Court is going to do and whether that has changes to it. We are developing backup plans to say, \"Okay, if that changes the environment, how do we react to it?\" Because I think we've got a very successful product there in business. As far as margins, we don't really talk about that as a separate business, so we've never really gotten into that one as specific.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I meant more from the perspective of for a long time we were investing and it was a bit of a drag on margins just when we hit the inflection point in terms of going from losses to profits.","Efrain Rivera","In insurance, Mark?","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes.","Efrain Rivera","No, no. We turned that corner at least a couple of years ago.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the health insurance?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, on health insurance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I'll be quick.","[Audio Gap]","Efrain Rivera","To deal with calendar year processing. And then third, there was higher IT spending in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Williams with UBS.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, I'm probably keeping everybody from lunch now, so I'll keep it quick. Really 2 quick questions. Number one was on margins and the balance between the need to invest and expand margins over time. Just wanted to get your 2 cents. Do you feel that you've made the appropriate investments and that you're pretty much done with those in terms of through the cycle over the last few years to be positioned for the inflection point or you think there's still some more that you might need to do?","Efrain Rivera","Well, I would say, if you look at where we -- how we've been spending over the past year or 2, I don't anticipate dramatic increases in spending. I think we're positioned to take advantage of an upturn if it comes. Now having said all of that, I do think that the price of being in this business demands that your technology get better and better, and that's not a surprise. And that's one reason why we continue to take business from local and regional competitors that just can't keep up. So I don't anticipate dramatic increases in spending. I think we are continuing to make the right and the appropriate investments to grow the company, but you do have to spend to keep up with technology.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I know we've talked a bunch about pricing. I'm just curious about the competitive environment. Obviously, you've been able to catch some pricing here. But competitively, one of the questions that always comes up when we talk to investors is, what are you seeing and I guess, what are you seeing?","Martin Mucci","I would say not much change. As we've mentioned, even during the selling season, we're always a little bit more aggressive competitively but not much change in the overall environment for pricing or discounting.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And from the perspective of new folks coming in with potentially disruptive products, have you seen anything different? Is there anything that you're getting in terms of feedback from the sales force that perhaps something is maybe rocking the boat a little bit more than, say, a year ago?","Martin Mucci","No, not really. Nothing that we hadn't anticipated and are working on.","Efrain Rivera","And the other thing I want to mention, that I think is important to remember for us compared perhaps to other companies is we have a very, very sophisticated operation in SurePayroll that does its business over the web, and it gives us an insight into the companies that are operating in exclusively a SaaS mode, what they're seeing and what their opportunities are. So we haven't seen any dramatic shifts.","Operator","I do have one more question from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Rod Bourgeois here. Two quick questions. First, what needs to happen -- so with one quarter left in the fiscal year, what needs to happen to achieve the upper half of your fiscal '12 revenue guidance? It would be nice to do that given the setup to fiscal '13. But would things need to be more positive to get to the upper half of the fiscal '12 revenue range?","Efrain Rivera","You're going to have to see a sharp acceleration in Q4.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's what I thought. That makes sense. And then on the -- one last shot at the pricing question. Can you specify your actual year-to-year growth in pricing, net of discounting? And I guess the reason I'm asking is, if net pricing growth was only moderate with discounting flat year-to-year, then that may imply less pricing growth than what would have been expected in fiscal '12.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I understand the question. I -- we can't specify that in part because some of it is competitive and proprietary, so we're going to take a pass on that one. By the way, Rod, not to be too dismissive with the question, it's fair. I think that you can get to certainly an approximation. We'll put out the data at year end. And you know we've been pretty open about what kind of price increase we have. So I think you'll be able to look at that price increase checks per client database, and I think you should get a pretty good feel for what that looks like.","Martin Mucci","And I think, as we've continued to say, that the environment really has not changed very much so -- from a pricing and competitive standpoint. So there's not -- there hasn't been any big surprises there that would change much.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. And just one comment on that. With retention at almost record levels, it seems like the setup for putting a meaningful price increase in fiscal '13 in place, it seems like the setup is reasonably good. Is that the way to think about it?","Efrain Rivera","We haven't gone through the pricing discussion and plans, so we'll update you on our thinking. I will caution one thing, Rod. We will not give a specific price increase amount, just simply won't, and we have our competitive reasons for doing that. We'll simply indicate what we think what a general range will be, but we will not get into that anymore because it's too sensitive.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions.","Martin Mucci","Great. Well, at this point, we'll close the conference call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this call, it will be archived until April 30.

[Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Martin Mucci. Please go ahead.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2019. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. On today\u2019s call, I will review business highlights for the second quarter, Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020, and then we will open it up for your questions.","Financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflect good progress on our key initiatives. Total revenue growth was 15% for the quarter, Management Solutions revenue grew 6% and PEO and Insurance Services revenues grew 57%, including the results from the Oasis acquisition.","We have been investing significantly in the area of sales, marketing, service and technology. These investments are paying dividends as we've seen continued momentum in new sales efficiencies and operations and the introduction of new and enhanced products. Paychex has been known much more as a provider of innovative HR technology solutions than ever before.","Our investments in demand generation and sales are contributing to solid growth in new sales revenue and in particular we are pleased with the strong performance of the mid market space aided by greater attachment of our broad suite of HCM, SaaS-based software solutions, such as our time and attendance and HR administration products. We are now in the main selling season. We believe we are well-positioned for continued momentum.","We're also continuing to experience improved efficiencies in our operations through the use of self service functionalities and our robotic process automation efforts. By automating more routine processes, we are reducing operating costs and providing more time for more high value client service interactions with our team. The evidence of high quality service by our teams is demonstrated by our client retention and satisfaction scores which remain consistent with record high levels. We have seen continued increases in net promoter scores, most notably in the mid market space.","Let me touch briefly on what we are seeing in the small business environment. The Paychex | IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch sowed hourly earnings growth at its highest level since 2011 while job growth has been holding steady. Wage increases are beginning to reflect the tight labor market for small businesses. The constant battle for talent highlights the importance of having a partner like Paychex, who can provide solutions to simplify HR recruiting and on-boarding and a competitive benefits package to attract and retain top talent.","We are currently operating in an unpredictable regulatory environment. Compliance with a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape is one of the many reasons employers choose Paychex for their HR needs. We're proud of our leadership role within the industry, partnering with regulatory agencies, keeping our clients informed and quickly updating our systems to be in compliance and support changes as they become effective. Just this month, the IRS released the final version of the new form W-4 to be used by all new employees and for all adjustments effective January 1, 2020. By remaining actively engaged with the IRS and providing feedback throughout their process, we were able to have the new forms and related calculations integrated into our systems within minutes of the issuance by the IRS.","The workplace continues to evolve both in technology and the way people work. And we are very proud that Paychex has been included on the Fortune magazine's Future 50 list of companies that are best positioned for long-term growth. In addition to solid financial results, Paychex was recognized for its commitment to innovative technology offerings designed to meet the needs of the evolving workplace. We continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings, and the use of technology to remain a leader in this industry.","Last quarter at HR Tech, we discussed some of the newest products being introduced. This month, we launched one of those products Pay-on-Demand, which enables workers to access wages, they have already earned before payday. This pay action is a great tool for recruitment and retention of talent, as it allows employees to be paid, when they want, allowing flexibility -- more flexibility than the traditional weekly-by-weekly or monthly pay schedule. Other companies in the industry offer similar services on a smaller scale, but our solution is unique and that it provides our clients with flexible payment options including direct deposit, pay card and digital payment into Amazon or PayPal accounts, however the client employee wants it. The other exciting products we demonstrated at HR Tech are progressing on track and will be launching in the coming months. We continue to focus on investments in emerging technologies such as wearables, real time payments, product integration, data analytics and artificial intelligence.","We are proud that Paychex's commitment to tech innovation has been recognized by industry experts. We were very proud to earn Awesome New Technologies for HR award at the HR Technology Conference and Expo in October. This recognizes the enhancements and increased flexibility of our Paychex Flex service product.","We were also named to the HRExaminer 2020 Watchlist for artificial intelligence and HR. This recognized our innovation using AI tools and machine learning to strengthen existing operations, our Flex Assistant chatbot currently answers over 200 commonly asked questions, spanning the Flex suite of products and seamlessly integrates with real time live chat capability with a Paychex service agent 7x24 by 365 days a year.","In addition, we have intelligent tools within Flex architecture that deliver a more personalized user experience through learning individual user preferences over time that can be listing out how to do something or even watching now short videos to learn how to use the Flex product. Paychex Flex also won a Gold award for excellence in technology from Brandon Hall Group in the category of Best Advance in HR or Workforce Management Technology for small and mid-sized businesses. This is a fourth straight year that Paychex Flex has been honored with a technologies excellence award, which validates our tech vision, investment in that vision and the value tech brings to our clients. We're proud of the experience our Flex platform [technical difficulty] employees enhanced through automation we have built into the application based on individual patterns and preferences.","We also continue to see increased utilization of our industry leading 5 star rated mobile app. During the quarter we experience an increase of over 50% in the number of mobile sessions and a 35% increase in the number of mobile only users. This increased mobile usage by clients and their employees has led to efficiencies internally and higher net promoter scores. We are serving clients and our employees the way they want to be served.","Shifting to our PEO business. The acquisition of Oasis was the largest acquisition in our history and doubled the number of worksite employees we serve in our PEO. As with any significant acquisition, the integration efforts can cause some initial disruption in sales cadence and some operating inefficiencies as we realize the expected synergies. As we discussed last quarter, we realized some of this in the first part of this fiscal year as we went through that process. That has led to slower than anticipated revenue growth for the year. However, we believe we are in a good position now as we progress with full sales rep headcount, and our operations teams continue to focus on what's most important, that is serving our clients and providing them the right combinations of solutions to help them succeed. We are excited about the continued strong demand for PEO services in the markets that we serve.","In summary, we continue to focus on growing our business by making things simple for our clients. Our innovative technology allows us to service our clients in a way that they want, when they want, and where they want. We're focused on continuing to introduce innovations to our technology-enabled service to improve business efficiency and drive even more value for our clients. Our whole suite of HR solutions has been the recipe for growth and positions us for continued growth going forward. The efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients are definitely making a difference.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty, and thanks to everyone on the call. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA et cetera. Again, refer to our investor presentation, press release for reconciliation of second quarter to related GAAP measures.","I'll begin by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter, and then I'll follow up with some greater detail in certain areas and wrap with the review of the fiscal 2020 outlook.","As you saw, total revenue growth was 15% for the second quarter, Oasis contributed approximately a little bit less than 9% to this growth. Expenses increased 18% for the second quarter to $649 million. Similar to last quarter, increases in compensation related costs, PEO direct insurance costs, and amortization of intangible assets contributed to total expense growth. Total expense growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of Oasis.","Operating income increased 11% to $342 million, operating margin was 34.5% for the second quarter and EBITDA increased 16%, and EBITDA margin was approximately 40% for the quarter. The EBITDA margin increased slightly compared to a year ago. Operating margin declined due to the amortization of intangibles associated with the Oasis acquisition as you all know.","Our expense net for the second quarter of $5 million includes interest expense of approximately $8 million related to long-term borrowings. As a reminder, we borrowed $800 million bonds to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price.","Effective tax rate was 23.2% for the second quarter compared to 23.8% for the same period last year. Net income increased 10% to $259 million and adjusted net income increased 8% to $254 million. Diluted earnings per share were up 11% to $0.72 for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.70. We received a little over $0.01 of benefit from stock-based comp payments during the second quarter which is included for GAAP but we excluded for our adjusted diluted EPS.","Let me provide some additional color in certain areas. Total service revenue was up as I said to $971 million, 15%. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $727 million and PEO and Insurance Services increased 57% to $244 million. Management Solutions revenue growth was 6%, which actually exceeded our expectations, included a contribution from Oasis of slightly less than 1%. The remaining growth was primarily driven by increases in our client bases across many of our services, along with growth in revenue per client. Revenue per client improved as a result of higher price realization and increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly time and attendance, retirement services and HR outsourcing, and this has been a focus of our efforts over the last several years. And if you chart our growth and revenue per client, you\u2019ve seen a pretty steady increase. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participants\u2019 funds.","PEO and Insurance Services revenue growth of 57% was largely due to the acquisition of Oasis, which contributed 47% to this growth. In addition, the increase reflects growth in clients and client worksite employees across our existing PEO business. Insurance Services revenue benefited from an increase in number of health and benefit applicants, partially offset by the impact of softness in workers\u2019 compensation premiums, as we've been discussing all year.","Interest on funds held for clients increased 9% for the second quarter to $20 million, primarily as a result of higher realized gain, average investment balances and interest rates. Funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by wage inflation and increases within our base offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances.","Turning to our investment portfolio. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield now of 2.1%, average duration of 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 2% for the second quarter, up from 1.9% last year.","Quickly looking at year-to-date results. Total revenues up 15% to $2 billion, service revenue up 15% to $1.9 billion with Management Solutions reflecting growth of 6% to $1.5 billion, PEO and Insurances reflecting growth of 57% to $491 million. Interest on funds has grown 14% to $40 million, operating income up 10% to $691 million, and net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 9% to $523 million and $1.45 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income increased 7% to $511 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.42 per share.","Let me walk through, the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash, total corporate investments of $708 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients were $3.7 billion, compared to $3.8 billion as of the end of last year, May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients, as you know vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the second quarter.","Total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $39 million as of the end of the quarter, compared with $20 million as of the end of last year, May 31, 2019. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.6 billion as of November 30, 2019, reflecting $444 million in dividends paid and $172 million of shares repurchased during the first six months. Return on equity for the past 12 months has been a stellar 42%.","Cash flows from operations were $565 million for the first six months, a robust increase of 14% from the same period last year. So, strong performance on cash flow. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments. Increase in noncash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense, largely driven by intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of Oasis.","Let me talk about 2020 guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes, though we have reflected the impact of the three interest rate cuts that have already occurred this fiscal year. I\u2019ll provide our current our outlook and some color on a couple of areas. We've provided updates to the guidance as you saw. Our Management Solutions revenues has been trending positively and now we anticipate it to grow in the range of 5% to 5.5%. This is raised from the previous guidance of approximately 5% growth. And we're doing well in almost all of the buckets that comprise that revenue stream. PEO and Insurance Services now expect it to grow on the range of 25% to 30%. As Marty previously mentioned, we\u2019ve got off to a slow start with Oasis slower than we anticipated. We still maintain a strong long-term outlook and continue to execute on our plans to integrate our PEO business.","Interest on funds held for clients is now anticipated to grow approximately 4%, modified from a range of 4% to 8% we started the year, and this simply reflects the most recent federal funds rate cuts. And diluted earnings per share growth has been increased to a range of 9% to 10% growth, raised from our guidance of approximately 9 [technical difficulty] guidance remains unchanged. This followed total revenue 10% to 11%, operating income as a percent of total revenue approximately 36%, EBITDA margin for the full year expected to be approximately 41%, effective income tax rate expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, net income adjusted -- net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are all expected to grow at approximately 9% for fiscal 2020.","Now, let me provide a little color on the back half of the year. As I indicated, PEO and Insurance revenues are now anticipated to grow in the range of 25% to 30%. While the second quarter results were within the range provided 56% to 60%, we have taken a more conservative approach for the back half of the year, given our current trends. In particular, we've continued to experience a lower compensation -- lower workers\u2019 compensation insurance rate that have moderated our insurance -- moderated our insurance services growth. We anticipate that this trend will likely ease as we enter the next fiscal year. We're also seeing modestly lower at risk insurance attachment in the PEO. In addition, this change reflects impacts from the slower start from the -- at Oasis acquisition. We now anticipate that growth for the third quarter of PEO and insurance will be approximately 10%.","Management Solutions guidance was increased to a range of 5% to 5.5% growth from our previous guidance of approximately 5% due to favorable trends that we've seen in the first half of fiscal 2020. This incorporates the higher than anticipated growth achieved in the second quarter and assumes that third quarter will come in the full-year range. I refer you to slide 16 in our investor presentation, which shows the impact of the re-class in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 of an immaterial amount of Oasis revenue. Please note that the as adjusted numbers on this slide represent the base on which we apply the growth rates we are guiding to in Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance revenues. And the reason I call that out is when I look at your models, two thirds of you do it that way and one third has split between third and fourth quarter. Please look at that number so that you can adjust your models correctly.","Operating margins, which for the full year are anticipated to be approximately 36%, do vary quarterly. Our margins for the second quarter exceeded the guidance we provided in the last call, which was a range of 33% to 34%. That indeed was impacted by delays in hiring related to the tight labor market. We still anticipate margins of approximately 38% for the back half of the year. We expect to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing in the back half of the year while still achieving our target of a full-year operating margin of approximately 36%.","And with all that, I'll turn the clock back over to Marty. ","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Efrain. We\u2019ll now open the call to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.","Ramsey El-Assal","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. I wanted to ask about the trend and the lower workers\u2019 comp insurance rates. And I just was trying to get an idea of your visibility to how those rates trend. How do you -- what gives you confidence about those rates over time going into next year? I think, you indicated sort of becoming more favorable. What type of read do you gain on that rate?","Efrain Rivera","Well, it's a couple of things. One is that because we have a insurance agency and our pricing policy is on a virtually daily basis, we get a sense of -- pretty clear sense of where that pricing is trending. That's one part. The second is it\u2019s influenced by what state workers\u2019 compensation or where they're setting up pricing. And we know we have a pretty good sense of what states are contemplating or have contemplated changes in workers\u2019 compensation insurance. So, I think the combination of those. And then, the final thing is we're looking at the mix of revenue quarter by quarter. And we know that we started the year with a strong compare and it starts to ease as we get into the back half of the year a little bit.","Ramsey El-Assal","Got it. Okay. And then, could you talk about your retention trends, and the degree to which those trends are, I would imagine moving in the right direction, giving your confidence in terms of raising the Management Solutions segment guidance for the year?","Martin Mucci","Yes. We're continuing to see pretty much near record levels on retention across both small and mid-sized clients. We're seeing very good retention numbers. And so, they've been very solid. And, you know how conservative we are. As we look forward, we still think they're going to -- we're going to maintain that going forward. So, we feel the value of the products obviously and along with the needs of the clients during this, particularly this kind of tight labor market, I think are really keeping retention. And we're not seeing out of businesses really increase either. So, all -- both from an environment and from our performance, I think are both keeping our retention numbers at record levels.","Ramsey El-Assal","That's terrific. Thanks for taking my questions.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thanks. Hey. It seems like the organic growth, particularly in managed services is settling in at higher levels, despite much tougher comps. Can you just frame out, like how much of that is retention because Marty, I know you mentioned kind of maintaining those levels. Is it possible you kind of set a new level, based on more of the SaaS offering as opposed to the traditional service? So, maybe just a sensitivity on SaaS for service and what that can do to the retention over the course of time?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think, it certainly does. I think we're appealing to the clients the way they want to be served, as I mentioned earlier, and our employees. The employees are playing a pretty strong role these days, more than I think ever in the past. As you see the mobile app, 70% of the usage of the mobile app is the employee of the client. And so, they're having a bigger impact on retention. And we started talking about that a couple of years ago. So, I think that does have an opportunity. The issue is always still, when you see improvement, particularly on the small client basis, there are so many businesses that go out of business every year. And we've been in this a long time and it hasn't changed that dramatically. So, what I think where you do have room for improvement is certainly from a service value standpoint. I think, the need for clients, small businesses, midsized businesses to have software as a service, to have mobile apps, to have self-service available to their employees, all those things are making them more valuable and stickier, I would say to a client. So, we certainly see some -- we're optimistic, but we still also know that so many businesses start up and go out of business on the small end.","Kevin McVeigh","And just to follow up on that, Marty, real quick. If it's -- if you're bumping up at that 82% level, any sense of -- how much of that is failures versus maybe other parts that are driving the attrition?","Martin Mucci","I think, if you put all together, kind of no employees out of business bought or acquired. It's typically been 50% plus a little bit. So, that accounts for about half of it, and a little bit more even sometimes. And then the other pieces are price. And it's still just as competitive as it's always been, hasn't really increased. But that number has been pretty consistent and then service value kind of stuff. So, I'd say 50% to 60% of your roles, all those things together are kind of out of control type of thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley with Wolfe Research.","James Berkley","Just quick question on PEO side. Would it be possible just to break out in more detail, just kind of that segment PEO and insurance separately, how bookings have been trending on the PEO side and maybe how much of the guidance drop was attributable to Oasis, which you expect to turn around?","Martin Mucci","Well, let me start and I\u2019ll have Efrain jump in. I think, what we've seen there is, one, we have our -- we think the market is still very strong for PEO in particular. So, the demand continues to be strong, you're still seeing a very tight labor market. So, they're looking for help in recruiting and retaining employees, they're looking for benefit packages that will retain employees and HR kind of mobile app and strength to not only recruit, but retain in that mid market -- small and mid market.","The other thing is that the integration of Oasis certainly has impacted this somewhat. We\u2019re off to a slower start. We mentioned it in the first quarter last year. We really began the active integration around June, so about six months ago. And once we started aligning underwriting procedures, sales comp models, service processes and those things, it kind of slowed our sales cadence down at Oasis. And it was definitely impacted by underwriting.","We've always been very tight on the underwriting side. We wanted the processes to be very tight. And so that gave us slower ramp up for the sales. And then, we had to wrap up the sales headcount, and that was a little slower than we expected. Now, we're at that full -- near that full ramp up of the sales headcount. And also, we got through a couple of insurance renewals. It's always important to kind of see where we're coming out for the first time with a major integration like that with insurance renewals. And we came through fine. But that and the underwriting, I think, certainly impacted some existing clients. Now that all -- that we\u2019re through that, we have a much better sense of the first year of Oasis and where we're going to come out for this first fiscal year, the remainder of the first fiscal year. We think the market is very strong, our organic PEO business, non-acquisition was very strong year-to-date. And so, we feel still very strong about it. We just got off to a slower start than we thought, and that's going to impact the full year's performance.","James Berkley","I guess, I\u2019d ask another way, if it's okay. If you didn't do the Oasis acquisition, would have organic PEO growth been in line with expectations, like would that have been unchanged?","Martin Mucci","I think, it would have been pretty much unchanged. I mean, when you look -- we feel very, we're actually performing, sales have been stronger than we expected in our organic PEO business. And so -- yes, I think it would have been stronger. I mean, this is -- we really feel like this is kind of around the first part of the integration. And although we've had the company, we purchased the company in December, we kind of let the fiscal year play out, we had a number of things we were organizing around, running some synergies. Then in -- beginning of our fiscal year, we kind of put new processes in place. And frankly, it had a little bit stronger impact than we thought in slowing things down from a sales and even retention perspective.","Now, we've kind of got that turned around and we just wanted to make sure we're conservative, kind of on the rest of the year and how that will come out. But, we feel very good about the market. And yes, it would have been stronger, if you just looked at without the integration, we certainly would have been above I think our expectations on PEO only side.","James Berkley","That's great to hear and obviously doing really well on the merchant -- I mean on the Management Solution side as well. And so, just last question on that point. Just given the tight labor market, any thoughts, incremental thoughts on kind of where we are in the economic cycle? How do you think about things like labor participation rate, how much slack there might be left in that and room for you guys to run in the small business side? ","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think, we're still feeling pretty strongly about how the market is -- how the market outlook is. The optimism still -- it bounces around a little bit, business optimism. But, what we're seeing is the wage increases are the highest, as I said, since 2011 from small businesses under 50 employees, this is what's in that watch. And the hours worked are up also for the highest and like three years. So, we're -- we look at that as demand for the employees. So, the businesses -- the toughest thing for small -- in particular small but midsized businesses right now is, I can't find the people to finish -- to get the work done for the demand I have. That to me points to a pretty strong economy still, and that's how it feels to us. When hours worked are up and the wages are up, it's because hey, I've got the demand, and from client -- from customers that want that. So, I think that's very good.","The tariffs and the trade issues, we've seen impact roughly a third, maybe 25% to a third of small businesses. Most of those are much more regional. And so, they're not going to be impacted by that. The third, 25% or third that are impacted by tariffs and so forth, have a harder time but most small businesses are not impacted by that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. ","David Togut","Thank you. Good to see the strength in bookings in the quarter. Could you perhaps dimension the rate of growth that you have seen, Marty, both in the small business, managed solutions market and also big market? And then, you called out strength from a macro standpoint. Any additional color about which solutions are getting the most traction, where you think you might be gaining market share?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think, one retirement contains to be very strong and I think the Secure Act, most of you probably know got through the house yesterday, and it\u2019s headed for the Senate. If that gets approved, that's giving tax credits for new retirement plans and I think that would continue to be a boost for small businesses, starting retirement plans. And we continue to be just very solid on retirement services, both, what we would call large market and small market, generally are doing very well. Time and attendance, when you thinking about the overtime changes that have been recently made in providing overtime to more, it\u2019s hitting employees of our clients. Time and attendance continues to be very strong double-digit growth as well. And we're -- we tried to stay -- we really stayed I think ahead of even the market from a technology standpoint. So, it\u2019s not just the old punch cards, it's finger scan which has now gone to scan, which has gone to face scan and now wearables we\u2019ll be introducing very soon that you can punch in and punch out on your watch. And these are all things that are being demanded by clients. So, I think time and attendance, retirement, certainly HR overall and the technology that goes with that, meaning I want to see data analytics that help me as a small and midsized business compared to other businesses. We have that data base that other clients or other businesses don't have. We can use data from 600,000 plus clients that say, hey, here is what your turnover looks like compared others, here\u2019s what your wages look like. So, I think data analytics and HR and all of those things, all are pretty strong.","And so, overall, we see pretty good growth. Now, we are heading in this -- we\u2019re in selling season. So, it\u2019s too early. We really need third quarter to kind of give us that look on sales. But so far year-to-date, sales have been good and particularly in the midmarket, we feel very strong about the pickup that the products have done in the marketplace.","David Togut","Thank you. I appreciate all the insights.","Martin Mucci","Okay, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley.","Steven Wald","Hey. Good morning. So, just maybe going through the pieces of the revenue guide. I know you haven't changed the overall revenue guidance. But if I look at your adjusted numbers, I believe we talked about this after last quarter, the two different adjustments you made there and sort of map out those pieces of your segment guidance, sort of getting to 9% to 11% range on the bottom and top end of pieces added together. Is that generally how we should think about it? It sort of seems like at the midpoint you\u2019d be at the low end of your prior 10% to 11% guidance that's...","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re far off, Steven. I think that's fair.","Steven Wald","Okay, cool. I just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then, because I know this caused some questions last quarter, the Oasis components, I know that you reclassified a piece of it last quarter as to how to think about it? But, I think in the press release you said it added about 1% to the Management Solutions. So, should we think about it as Oasis minus $7 million to $8 million is all in the PEO and the rest goes in the Management Solutions?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I'd have to -- I'm doing mental math really quickly. I think, it\u2019s a little bit lower, maybe $6 million to $7 million, but I'm not looking at the detail. But, I don\u2019t think that's far off.","Steven Wald","Okay. Yes. I just wanted to make sure I was clear on those things.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Steven Wald","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.","Andrew Nicholas","Hi. Good morning.","Andrew Nicholas","I just wanted to talk a little bit about technology in the PEO business. I was wondering if you could talk maybe about your plans for Oasis and maybe even HROI from a tech perspective. Are both businesses still running on a third party software or other plans to transition to internal proprietary software in the near to medium term? And then maybe relatedly I was just wondering if you could maybe speak to the tech capabilities of your PEO business relative to the competition?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think, the capabilities -- well, first of all, yes, they're both on third party and license software, and so far that seems to be going very well. So, we're watching that closely but we're not looking to necessarily move to any quick integration or client conversion to disrupt the base or anything like that. So, we think that the third party software is doing fine and in fact gets upgraded pretty consistently. And so, we feel good about that. The integration, we're tying it in as much as possible to our products as well. So, I think the technology that we're focused on with the HROI and Oasis is how to tie it into our retirement information -- our retirement integration, excuse me, into our retirement time and attendance and so forth so that they can benefit most from those products. And that's going well. And so, we\u2019ll determine over time whether it makes sense to get them to our PEO in house products or not I think, you never want to necessarily move clients through a conversion, if you don't have to. And if that's taken care of it, we're still continuing to watch that. It\u2019s not a focus right now.","Our technology and the PEOs that we feel is very competitive. We can see, as I said, the demand is good in the street, and we're selling well particularly on the organic side. If you look kind of non-acquisition and integration, we're doing very well on the organic PEO and in fact are ahead of sales. So, I think our product is performing very well competitively in the marketplace.","Efrain Rivera","Just to add a little bit more color there, Andrew. So, we run on both the Flex platform for our PEO business and we also run on a third party software, which many of you know what it is. But, it's a customized instance to that software. So, there have been a lot of upgrades and adjustments, enhancements made to that system. And I think the challenge, as Marty mentioned is with those customizations and enhancements over time we want to figure out what the right decision is in terms of bringing 411 [ph] on our internal platform and that will take a little time to sort out.","Andrew Nicholas","And then, maybe sticking with the PEO space. Just wondering if you could update us on your appetite for M&A there, and maybe more broadly how you would characterize pricing in the space. And last thing there would be, does some of the slower than expected start with Oasis tied to kind of integration issues change that appetite at all? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Let me let me start at the end and go back. I think, yes, with any integration, when you update -- and remember, Oasis has had a number of companies as well. And so, we had to go across the number of companies that they had acquired as well. We want to be sure that we felt comfortable with all the underwriting processes, the sales comp models, getting tighter process on service. When we pull all that stuff together, you have some consternation that goes on and some slower ramp-up of hiring of the sales folks, et cetera. And we really think that was tied to just getting things all aligned. And we really didn't push those things until about June into the summer. And so, that put us a little bit behind this year as far as starting out. So. I think it was really geared around that.","M&A, still very interested. Certainly always looking at what opportunities are there from a -- when you talk about pricing, if it's pricing of the M&A, the valuations are still I think pretty high, but it all depends. There are so many PEOs, it's such a fragmented environment. But, there is a lot of opportunity I think out there and we're just trying to make sure that we get the right valuations. From a pricing -- from the market standpoint, I think, we're extremely competitive. I don't think the competition in that market has changed very much. And I think we're very competitive and we're seeing that by being above sales of sales forecast in the first part of the year with our organic PEO. So, where there is no distractions or anything at the beginning of the first half of the year, we've seen very good sales results from our organic PEO.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.","Jason Kupferberg","I wanted to ask a follow-up just on Oasis, just so we have the numbers right. I think, originally, the expectation was for Oasis to generate $335 million to $375 million in revenue this year. Can you just help us get a sense of what the new range would look like, obviously just given the integration challenges that you talked about?","Efrain Rivera","I think, Jason, we're still in that range, but we're certainly towards the lower end of that range.","Jason Kupferberg","And then, just on the sales force side of Oasis, I mean, I guess, as you went through the integration process, was there any unexpected uptick in voluntary turnover among Oasis sales people?","Martin Mucci","Yes. Jason, I think, we lost a few. It was a very -- we started making changes to underwriting process and sales comp and things like that at the beginning. It was pretty minor number, but we lost a few, because at the same time, you had some PE firms buying up a couple of other small companies that were trying to attract sales reps. So, I think we lost a few. I wouldn't say it was a -- it was not a big number. And then, that put us a little behind ramping up the sales force, those numbers that we wanted, which we're back at now. So, that's a bit of what we encountered at the beginning.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And then, just a final clarification, Efrain, just on the EPS side. I know, because there's a couple of EPSs out there. So diluted EPS, you did uptick but your adjusted EPS growth expectations are unchanged, correct? And I think that's the number you focus most?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. That's correct. Yes. That's reflecting -- but we focused on both, Jason. But that's reflecting taxes. I mean, look, I get the question frequently, why do you guys call that out, I think in an effort to be transparent about what we think is underlying operating performance and what's underlying financial performance. Underlying operating performance, we exclude the impact of stock comp. Not everyone does, we do. And then, financial performance is what it is. So, that's what we're trying to be clear on.","Jason Kupferberg","Yes. Okay, very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","The ancillary services, can you give us an update on penetration for some of those services, like time and attendance and retirement services, how much more room is there to go?","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Tien-tsin. Sorry for the mispronunciation. But, for some reason, at the beginning of the question, we didn't -- you didn't come in...","Martin Mucci","You cut out. Yes.","Efrain Rivera","So, we didn't hear the full question, o to answer it. Could you repeat it, would you mind repeating it?","Tien-tsin Huang","Yes, I'm happy to. I hope this is a little better. Just the penetration rate of some of the ancillary services like time and attendance, retirement services. I think both were called out as being positive. Where are you in that?","Martin Mucci","Yes. We're definitely picking up. We don't give detailed penetration rates on those, but we definitely are picking up penetration across the base on time and attendance. Retirement continues to go up. The other thing on retirement that has been very helpful to us is in the mobile app, we've not -- we have released probably six months ago where you could sign up on the mobile app. I think I've talked about it before, as opposed to all of the paper that employees of our clients would go through. So the participation rate is up. And that's now retaining more 401(k) clients that otherwise would have dropped out because they didn't have the correct participation of their employee base. So, we're -- not only are the sales stronger, but the part -- the retention of 401(k) in retirement is stronger as well. Health and benefit insurance picking up a bit as well. Of course, we're still strong on the insurance side, and we've linked the PEO to our agency. Being a top 20 agency, we have -- if you don't qualify for underwriting in the PEO, we take you over to the insurance agency to write you, we have a very unique offering at that point by the ability to do that. So, I think all have ticked up pretty strongly. Those are certainly the best that I can think of right off hand right now.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So, Tien-tsin, we only update those at year-end. But, I think just to underscore what Marty said, we're trending above where we ended last year. And if you look at it from a revenue standpoint and break out the revenue on each of those areas that were called out time and attendance, HR and retirement services, those are trending above where Management Solutions as a whole is growing. So, we're experiencing good result. And by the way, I just want to make sure that it's clear. That is our strategy. Our strategy is to approach a client and sell them on the full bundle, which is why we present the revenue in the way we do.","Tien-tsin Huang","Right, yes. I know, it's been clear, you want to drive up revenue pair. [Ph] So, I get that. So, just as a quick follow-up then. And I know, Marty you mentioned -- I remember last call, you talked about improving enrollment on 401(k), what have you. So, sensitivity to AUM and asset value, given some of the move up here, I'm curious is there an update or any rule of thumb we can use? The equity market has been strong. It sounds like that that's helping you quite a bit here maybe.","Martin Mucci","Yes. That's a good question. So, it's really assets under administration, Tien-tsin. We'll have to come back. It's not a huge number. So, we wouldn't anticipate a significant change. But, in the back half of the year, as we get into thinking a little bit about next year, we'll talk about it. Right now, I don't think it would be significant, unless there is something dramatic in the market, it wouldn't be significant on the order of pennies in terms of EPS. But, we'll update as we go through the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Yes. Good morning, guys. To me, it sounds like the Oasis a little bit of an integration challenge is more one-time in nature. So, I'm trying to think about what the normalized organic growth rate for Oasis might be, post one-year out?","Efrain Rivera","So, when we bought them, people asked me this. They were growing kind of mid-to-upper single digits organically. That's where they were they. We expect that we will be able to bump that growth rate with additional sales people. Obviously, as Marty mentioned, we're off to a slow start there, but our expectation is we can get it growing above those rates in the future. We got to get through this year and get through the disruption of this year.","Bryan Keane","Yes, guessing that the growth rate this year will be a little bit below their historical average as a result?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, it will.","Bryan Keane","Yes. And then, one follow-up I had on the revenue per client increase. It also sounded like you're getting a little bit of higher price realization. Just trying to figure, is that normal higher prices or is that something that you're seeing a little bit different, a little bit more pricing power than usual?","Efrain Rivera","I think we had a little bit more pricing power this year than other years. I think that we do a lot of work on the analytics side to understand how to price each client. I think we've done a good job on the pricing side to do that. So, you hope every year there is opportunities to do it. Obviously, we hope to hold that kind of pricing power. But every year brings another set of challenges. Then, it also depends on competition. So, while I think the level of competitive intensity remains high, it certainly has dramatically increased. And one thing we haven't talked about Bryan, which I think is important is we're having a really good year to begin the year in our mid-market business, which also helps Management Solutions. So, a continuation of those trends in the back half of the year going into next year then has a solid, or I was going to say buoyant effect, that's a little bit too strong, but a positive effect on Management Solutions revenue.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think, the investments are really paying off that we've made in the product and the technology on the HR side of the mobile app. Those things are paying off. And as Efrain said, mid market is really coming on strong. We've had a couple of years where it was -- it wasn't as strong as we would have liked, but we're feeling this year -- certainly we're seeing this year, in the first half of the year and now we can tell you more after this quarter. But, it feels really solid about the performance there on the sales side and retention side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta","Efrain, just to maybe get a little bit more color on the pricing comments you made for the payroll business, I'm wondering from a competition standpoint, have you seen a change, or are your competitors getting less aggressive or is this a strictly Paychex issue where you are able to raise prices, and maybe the competition for new business is still the same?","Efrain Rivera","I think it's primarily internal. I think we have -- I think our algorithms internally get better and better every year and I think we understand more clients are okay with certain price increases and what clients are not. I think you have to be very -- do it with a great -- a lot of care. If you raise prices carelessly, you end up creating chopping behavior. I think, the other part is that there are -- I think, the strength of our model permits us to understand, because the level of customer intimacy we have permits us to understand what segments of the client base we can get better pricing out of. So, I think it's more internal than it is external. But, I think, it's important in that equation that the rest of the market is not acting irrationally from a price standpoint.","Kartik Mehta","And then, Marty, just on the PEO M&A question, I know, you said obviously valuations are everywhere, but just from a Paychex standpoint, you said Oasis, you want to get this integration done, maybe it didn't go as smoothly in the beginning as you wanted. Is that slowed down maybe, M&A, would you wait a little while and get Oasis running to the point you want before you acquire another PEO, or do you think you are in a position where if an asset came up, you'd be ready to acquire it?","Martin Mucci","I think, Kartik, we're very much in position. And we really feel like Oasis is in good shape now. It was really just kind of first half of the year that was -- most of the integration kind of -- just a lot of changes that we had to make that always caused some slowdown. But, I think now we're very much read. And in fact looking at a number of things today is that -- that are out there and available. And I think from a management leadership standpoint and our organization, we're very much ready. Remember how large -- Oasis was the largest private PEO in the country. So, you knew you were going to have some integration there that we had to do more, but as far as everything else from HROI, all the acquisitions we've done, we've had a very solid track record from integrating and then hitting or beating of the numbers that we expected from those acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.","Lisa Ellis","Hi. Good morning, guys. First one for me is on the rollout of the Pay-on-Demand products. You called out I think that you just launched one of them in the prepared remarks. But, if I recall correctly, I think you're launching two, right? One that's more targeted toward employers and one targeted at employees. Can you just give us a little more color on the exact timing and the monetization models for those two products? Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Yes, certainly. So, the one we rolled out this month -- a few weeks ago, was the one for employees. That was the basically Pay-on-Demand. And as I mentioned, it's an expanded -- we think, options better than most I have out there. This is -- you can not only select when you want the money and not only put it in your bank account, but you can put it on a pay card, if you want, you can put it in your Amazon account, you can put in your PayPal account. We think this has the broadest selection of options and flexibility that we've seen in the marketplace. And we get a percentage. Obviously, we're doing that with a third party and we get a third -- a percentage of that back into the business. And we think for the most part though that the monetization of that is really in the retention of the clients and their employees that we're adding another thing to get to employees that's going to want them to stay with Paychex, stay with the mobile app, stay with the pay flexibility, et cetera, which is going to be good for the clients in a very tight labor market.","In the real-time payments which is really more geared toward the clients, as you mentioned, that's geared toward the end of the first quarter of the calendar year as it consistently has. It's right on track. And we feel that we\u2019ll be one of the first to offer real-time payments. There will be a charge for that, as we've mentioned in the past, and we're still working through all of that and looking at the marketplace and so forth. But, as we get closer to rolling that out on schedule, then we can talk about the monetization of it.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. And then, second one for me. Maybe Marty, can you comment on how the new -- it looks like this -- the AB5 law impacting workers in California is going to go into effect? Can you comment just on how you see that type of law impacting Paychex and how you'd handicap your expectation that that spreads across the country? Thank you.","Martin Mucci","I think, it's funny. Two years ago the gig economy was very big and expected to kind of take over employment, and then it really has kind of quieted down to a certain degree. I think those laws and similar ones will come up. I think, it's the flexibility that we want to give employees. I think, it'll be picked up by states, like you said, like California and New York, places like that first. I think, we'll be ready to handle that and I think, frankly, having a mobile approximately, having Pay-on-Demand, having flexible retirement plans, things like that, we are very well -- we're pretty well geared for that. And we're continuing to look at our product set to see how we can do things more -- even more around an employee versus an employer, which has obviously been our model for many years. So, I'd say it's still early stages, but it's still pretty early on the gig economy too that seem to be the -- it was going to be the wherewithal, it was going to be everything a few years ago, but it's quieted down. I think we were able to handle some of that now and we're continuing to look at our product set with our head of product to see what else we can do to make that easy and to be able to comply with any new employment laws that come out.","Lisa Ellis","Okay, great. Yes. And I guess just to like completely clarify, I think, this law impacts like workers will be classified as like W-2 full time employees versus ones that are classified as contractors. But, you currently essentially cover or process payroll for both of those. Right? I mean, does this...","Martin Mucci","Yes.","Lisa Ellis","Yes. So, it was sort of mutual effect. Yes.","Martin Mucci","Correct, mutual effect right now. Yes. I was thinking more of a wider look at that issue of the whole gig economy. And there is a real opportunity there. But, you're right. Yes, we cover both of those now, whether they are contractors, 1099s or W-2s, either way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.","Bryan Bergin","Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask on margins. So, to maintain margin guide following a good first half year, is there a ramp in the investments absorbing this somewhat in the second half or is it a function of just getting Oasis back on the path you expected or is it more-broader than that? Can you just go into some of the moving pieces?","Efrain Rivera","I think, Bryan, when you look at first half versus back -- I'm sorry, second half versus first half, the key thing that occurs is that in Q4, you have your highest margin quarter. So, you have expenses that are -- that don't ramp anymore, because now you've anniversaried Oasis. And so, expense growth is more moderate, but then revenue is higher, particularly in the third quarter where margins typically are going, approaching or above 40%. So, I think that's what drives it. That quarter is unique in terms of the amount of revenue that it has. And then, the fourth quarter also has a high revenue and expenses aren't ramping along with the revenue driving margins higher.","Bryan Bergin","Okay. I wanted to follow up then also on the on-demand pay product. Can you just talk about some of the early adoption levels on the employee side? And how should we think about the funding mechanisms of these pay products and any potential impacts to the portfolio?","Martin Mucci","No, it's all done through third parties. So, there won't be any impacts on our float. We're not taking any of the risk on it or anything else. We're just getting a percentage of the fees that are paid. And it's very early, Bryan, it's very early on the adoption. I mean, we've heard certainly the demand for it, but it just we rolled it out a few weeks ago. So it's really too early to say. But, there seems to be a great demand for it. And again, I think this is the most full featured from -- full flexibility from an opportunity. So, we're anxious to see how it goes. I\u2019d be able to give you a better read after the next quarter.","Bryan Bergin","Okay. That's fair. Efrain, just the last one on Oasis. As you lap this acquisition over I guess part of the third quarter, anything to call out in the expected contribution of Oasis to 3Q, anything seasonal in that mix between the two segments to note here?","Efrain Rivera","Nothing that's not contemplated in the guidance. Yes, nothing significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.","Samad Samana","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the Company has mentioned mid market strength multiple times in the call this morning. I was curious if maybe you can give us an idea of what the average number of employees for new deals in the quarter looked like, just to see if it's -- how it's impacting the mix versus the historical average, closer to about 16 employees? And then, I have one follow-up question.","Martin Mucci","It definitely is much larger than that. So, it would pull that mix up. We don't normally give that number out, Samad, but -- I mean it's much -- I would say, look, it's somewhere between probably 50 to 150 to give you a wide range. But. the average is somewhere under 100 kind of thing on a client ID perspective.","Samad Samana","Okay, great.","Martin Mucci","It's much larger than that, the 15 or 16. That's what pulls that up.","Samad Samana","Yes. I guess, I was wondering more about what the overall average then would have been for this quarter, just to kind of get a sense of how much it's pulling up the overall average.","Martin Mucci","Right now, it's pretty consistent. So, I don't think it's moving it enough. I think we -- I don't know if we really give that out other than annual, if that. But, it had some -- I think, it would have some adjustment, but not much, pretty consistent.","Samad Samana","Okay. And then, maybe just as a follow-up as I think about the sales head count investments that you're making, is there -- the products that you guys have rolled out, as I think about the mid-market, are you also hiring reps that are more geared toward selling to that 50 to 150-employee type of customer? And should we see -- as we think about the ramping investments in the back half, should we continue to see that trend in terms of the type of sales person you're hiring as well?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we definitely are. We're promoting some from within and from a career path standpoint and we're always excited about that. And by the way, that market goes anywhere -- I don't want to get you the sense that that's only that with that market is. That market goes anywhere from 20 -- frankly 20 or 30 employees these days to a 1,000. But, I would say, it's primarily in that 20 to 500 space, but it goes pretty broad. Yes, we're hiring people with more experience, some from competitors, some from other industries and then promoting some as well from internally. And it -- we'll continue to invest in that and we're pretty much up to full hires where we are now, but we're always looking for good people. And I think success is helping us from that standpoint, recruit as well. That always helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I know the call has been going long. I just had a quick follow-up actually for Efrain. I know you don't give a fiscal \u201821 guidance, but in terms of tax rate, is the tax rate that we're using or you're guiding for this year, is that something we should use for next year as well?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Jeff. Look, I'm going to say, right now, I don't see significant things that would change it. State taxes and stock comp expense move it, but it's probably not a bad proxy right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel.","David Grossman","So, each of the PEOs reported some issue in the most recent quarter, and while each was different, there was typically some element of health insurance involved. So, can you provide some context to -- in contrast to what you're experiencing and what may or may not be happening industry-wide?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I guess, I\u2019d say, I don't think -- when we look at it, if you looked at retention in particular, and now we're through a couple of renewals, I would say it was a pretty fair -- I think, there is always a combination of underwriting and tightening up where we want our performance to be from a medical loss ratio. And we're pretty conservative and careful on that in what we're -- and our underwriting standards. And so, I think that had some impact on retention. But, I don't think we had any necessarily abnormal impact on the rates that we got themselves. I think, we got pretty fair renewals overall from the carriers and then we have our own self-insured plan. I think, we're performing pretty well there. And I don't think the carriers gave us anything that was that difficult. I think we just -- we have a little bit tighter underwriting standard that we wanted to put in place, or I guess tighter than what it -- at least what it was. And that had some impact on some clients.","On the other hand, David, the nice thing about us is, we can take some of them over then to the insurance -- to the insurance agency and write them through the carriers as opposed to taking -- or some of the risk on ourselves. So, I don't think -- I think, in contrast, I don't think we saw anything -- I don't feel like we saw really anything that abnormal from the carriers and the renewals themselves, which bodes to me and for us I think it bodes well for the future. There was no abnormality there that should continue or anything.","David Grossman","Got it. And then, just going over to the mid-market, I know that has come up several times. But, if you just had to isolate one thing that's changed most that may have impacted the momentum in that business, what do you think that is? And do you think you're gaining share or you just think you're doing a better job of retaining your clients as they migrate into that kind of mid-market category?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think the one thing is definitely the technology investment. I mean, look, we had a solid sales force and great sales leadership there and an operational and service performance, but I think the biggest change has been the technology investment over many years now. But it's really come to fruition the last few years in particular, as everything has come together, the mobile app, the HR administration, the data analytics, the artificial intelligence work, everything has come together now. We have a fully integrated solution for a mid-market that is very simple to use. And I think that is really shown in the sales performance, particularly this year, but we could start to see it the last half of last year and then the first half of this year. The sales performance is better and the retention as well. But, I really think it's the technology on top of good sales and operations leadership and performance.","And just to think of it, I think, we are taking some share, but you do know -- as you know, that is a growing market for all players. And we just haven't gotten as much of our fair share in the last few years in my opinion, as we should have. And we had to get the technology really to all pulled together. We kept introducing good products, but now we pulled it together. And we also now have moved to say, hey, if you want a product integration, if you want something, if you have the best HR time and attendance that you think is better than ours, we'll build the product integration for you as well or we have the product integration already through APIs. And so, I think all of that has really helped. I think, the technology would be the number one biggest thing.","David Grossman","Right. And just, can you help size it for us, or just give us some context, so that we can think about how impactful it can be to the overall growth rate?","Efrain Rivera","What do you mean in terms of revenue, David?","David Grossman","Yes.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So, mid-market revenue, if you look at it in terms of total payroll revenue, we give you a payroll, so I'm not giving you a number you can't figure out. It's been running about 25% or so of our overall payroll revenue. So, you can figure out Management Solutions. You know what percentage is Management Solutions. You can get a sense of that bucket within Management Solutions. So, if it accelerates, it's helpful. And I think that where it is helpful and I think there was a discussion earlier about this, if you see -- you see continued trends and over time, you see average client size go up, and that's positive, but also you have more opportunity to attach ancillaries, when you get those clients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird.","Mark Marcon","Just a few follow-ups, first, just on the PEO side. When you talked about the carriers and what you're doing in terms of your own self insurance -- on the healthcare cost, what rate of increase are you typically seeing as you go into next year, for a like-for-like type plan?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I think, Mark, I would say, no one is giving you the exact increase. I would say, it's pretty competitive with the market; in some cases, it's a little bit below. So, part of following up on what Marty was saying, because we try to manage the book very conservatively, we ensure that we manage those losses tightly so that we can go out to market with rates that are competitive in the market.","Mark Marcon","All right. I appreciate that. And then with [Technical Difficulty] not sure if you're hearing that.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Martin Mucci","A little bit there, Mark. Go ahead.","Mark Marcon","With regards to the percentage of the clients that you're selling -- what percentage of your PEO clients actually are taking your insurance where you are self insured for it?","Martin Mucci","Yes. So, I'll flip it around. We don't give the exact clients. But, if you look at PEO revenue, PEO revenue includes at-risk revenue of 35% to 40% in that revenue. And you can get to that because we give you a breakout for cost. So,, that gives you a sense. We don't break it out by specific clients.","Mark Marcon","Got it. And then, with regards to the mid-market, you're obviously doing really well there. In terms of the new sales, is there any change, Marty, in terms of the composition of who you're getting those new clients from or how we should think about that with regards to -- there is still some surprising number of companies out there with really old legacy systems versus some that have transitioned to newer systems? What does the composition look like in terms of the new sales that you're getting?","Martin Mucci","I think, it's been a combination of taking some from competitors. And I would say -- I think, it's probably this year, I would guess, it's run 50-50 on old legacy systems going to moving into a new platform, a software-as-a-service platform of ours and really moving up the technology, and then, probably the other half is more something they didn't like from a competitive standpoint.","So, I think we're taking some from market share and then some from as the market expands itself. And that's probably roughly around half and half I'd say, at least this year to-date, kind of thing. Because you know that market, it does continue to expand and it's growing across, -- the market itself is growing of those who just see the need, particularly in this tight labor market, to have something that's going to help them hire and onboard with all of that, doing it paperlessly, then retaining them with integrated benefits on a mobile app and retirement plans. And so, they're seeing a need that they have to go up that it\u2019s -- it definitely is more critical to them in a tight labor market to move on to a more modern system. And I think ours is appealing to a number of those prospects.","Mark Marcon","And then, two longer-term questions. One would basically be you started off the whole presentation basically by talking about some of the effectiveness that you're seeing in terms of your sales and marketing efforts coming through and sales -- SG&A actually ended up declining as a percentage of revenue, despite the strong sales growth. So, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the longer term implications for the increased efficacy with regards to your sales efforts and what you're seeing there. That's the first question. And then, the second question is basically, how we should think about the effective yield for next year through a float balance and through duration?","Martin Mucci","Okay. Let me take the first one and then Efrain...","Efrain Rivera","Yes. That's fine.","Martin Mucci","I think, Mark, the interesting thing is it's a sales and marketing kind of combined look and you're seeing is -- we've talked about, I think before a shift more toward marketing, many times they -- most people are buying or making their decision, they are 70% or 75% of the way through the decision before they ever talk to anyone. And they're looking for much more online approach there, being marketed to online, the way you market to them, the way you get leads, the way you nurture leads, and then the way you sell. And we're trialing a number of things that will make us even more efficient from that standpoint where you're spending marketing dollars, because a lot of the marketing is really the sales now. We certainly still have a lot of field reps that we count on that are building relationships and getting referrals in the field and talking to clients, but particularly the smallest clients who are starting up businesses are going online and looking to look demo and even buy online and we're preparing for all of that.","So, I think we're looking for efficiency, but even more so, what's the best way to market and sell to a prospect or an existing client that's in business and try to be as efficient as we can. But, it's really looking at how is that shifting from web to -- from live person to web, telephonic to e-commerce and in positioning ourselves well for the future on that. And I think, we have a pretty good handle on it and we're trialing a number of things now that seem to be successful.","Mark Marcon","Great.","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Mark, on the yield question, I'd say that the yield will go out this year, meaning this fiscal year is probably the yield that we have, we will plan for next year, given that apparently the Fed has decided that it wants to hold. We do have a little bit of play there in terms of float balances which have been increasing slowly. And we do have a little bit of play with duration. But for planning assumptions, that's what I would assume.","Mark Marcon","Just to be clear, Efrain, the yield -- the year on is basically the year is basically what we should plan on for next year, not the average for this year?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I think, it's going be slightly lower, but I'm just saying the back of the yield we have in the back half of the year is probably -- is the yield we go into next year with\u2026","Mark Marcon","Got it.","Efrain Rivera","And we have a little bit of play with duration. You saw this year -- this quarter duration was 3.1. We can extend it further, but it will depend a little bit on that or it will depend on the shape of the yield curve, how far we want to go out.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and that question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill with Autonomous Research.","Matt O\u2019Neill","Hi. Thanks guys for squeezing me. I know it's a long call. Most things have been asked and answered. I was just curious, has there been any noticeable evolution in the kind of lead-gen sources, maybe moving a little bit all way from the CPA channels and more towards the online channels? And sort of as a follow-up, if that's true, is that something that drives kind of more price-sensitive customers or not really any change on that side of it?","Martin Mucci","No, I think, Matt, it definitely has moved some. I mean, we still rely a lot on being out in the field and building those CPA relationships. They are good partners with us as well as current clients. But definitely, as I said, a lot of -- today, everybody is doing their research online, even if you're given a referral. In the old days, you just call us and today you're going online, you're searching our website. Our investments have been in the website and then being able to demo the product, whether it's -- you can demo it right on your mobile app if you download the mobile app. And so, it has been about how do you get those leads, and we put a lot of investment in that from a marketing standpoint, as well as how do you then nurture those leads, if they're not ready. That's different than it used to be. That's a whole nurturing piece that we have put in place for the last few years now, about how to get information to clients and make sure when they're ready, they come to us.","And then, we're moving to more of an -- even in e-commerce, where you can buy online particularly with SurePayroll or other options, you can buy online. That also lowers some costs. It increases marketing costs, but sales costs come down and balance a lot of that out as you're selling either online or through telephonic means. And you're giving them more tools telephonically to help demo a product to a client and then sell it to them.","So, we're definitely seeing that change and I think that will ship costs from marketing -- or from sales to marketing. They become all kind of one part of cost that you look at to be the most efficient. But, it really is about how you best sell to clients, and they are definitely searching, demoing and even thinking about or buying online, and we're into that already and we're looking -- we might -- we'll find ways to expand that as well.","Matt O\u2019Neill","Thanks for that. And again, happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Yes. Thanks, Matt. Operator, so, I think that's the last question. Correct?","Operator","Yes. That's correct.","Martin Mucci","At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it'll be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We appreciate it. We wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines."],"16915":["Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call October  2, 2018  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Martin Mucci - President and Chief Executive Officer","Efrain Rivera - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","David Grossman - Stifel","Tim McHugh - William Blair","James Fossett - Morgan Stanley","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America","Rick Eskelsen - Wells Fargo","Jeff Silber - BMO","Samad Samana - Jefferies","James Berkley - Wolfe Research","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Matt O\u2019Neill - Autonomous Research","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Paychex First Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, I will turn the conference over to your host Martin Mucci. Please go ahead.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Sorry for our slight delay there. Just a little bit of issues on conferencing, but we will get started now. Thank you for joining us for our discussion for the Paychex first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2018. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for about 1 month.","On today\u2019s call, I will review the business highlights for the first quarter. Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2019. Then we will open it up for your questions.","We have had a good start for fiscal 2019 and our financial results reflect growth across our major product lines. Our total revenue growth was a solid 9% for the first quarter. Beginning this quarter, we are changing from our traditional disclosures, as Efrain talked about last quarter, of the service revenue categories of payroll and human resource services and are now reporting service revenues as management solutions revenues or PEO and insurance services revenues. This new revenue disaggregation provides a better representation of how our business has evolved to the selling of more bundled products and Efrain will provide more information about this in his commentary.","You may recall last fiscal year we implemented certain go-to-market strategies for sales, which began to gain momentum in the back half of the year. That momentum has continued for the first quarter, especially to HR outsourcing services both in our PEO as well as our traditional ASO\/HCM service bundle. We have also continued to add to our sales force and are fully staffed as we head into our upcoming peak selling season.","With regards to the client retention in the first quarter, we are very pleased with the continued increase in this metric for retention as well as our strong client satisfaction performance. August 18 was the anniversary of our acquisition of HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc., or HROI, a national PEO. HROI continues to perform well and has integrated very well into the existing PEO sales and service organization of Paychex. We also acquired Lessor Group, a payroll and HR services provider headquartered in Denmark at the end of February 2018. Lessor is performing well and we are enthusiastic about the growth opportunities that these acquisitions provide us. At the HR Tech Conference in September, we premiered our Paychex brand refresh, which focuses on the power of simplicity. This renews our commitment to our customers to make their lives easier by alleviating the complexity of payroll, HR, benefits, and insurance.","Paychex has over four decades of experience working with businesses to solve their complex challenges. And everything we do is focused on making it simpler for our clients to run their businesses through a combination of our leading technology, our breadth of product offerings and our personalized service options. At HR Tech, we also introduced Paychex Learning Management, a web-based learning management system that provides employers with a simple and affordable learning tool. Paychex Learning Management features access to hundreds of preloaded learning modules, allows clients to create their own new materials, and upload existing training material specific to their industry or workforce. It is also integrated with our performance management solution, which recently underwent a user experience update.","In our current environment of record low unemployment and award for talent, employers need every advantage they can to get for recruiting and retaining employees and our comprehensive suite of HR products can help employers recruit with attractive benefit package and our new LMS offering helps with the retention of talent by providing ongoing engagement and professional development. We also showcased additional new enhancements and features within our HR product suite. We now offer tablet-enabled facial recognition for time and attendance and the new Paychex Flex Assistant, a chatbot for commonly asked HR related questions. These are examples of our ongoing commitment to continually introduce advancements in technology that evolves and enhances our clients\u2019 experience and makes it more valuable to them across all of our services.","We are pleased with our progress in retirement services for the eighth consecutive year. Paychex was named by PLANSPONSOR Magazine as the leader in total number of defined contribution plans as we now serve well over 80,000 plans. Paychex Retirement Services meets the needs of businesses of all sizes by delivering next level efficiency with full Paychex HCM integration, fee transparency, plan accessibility across devices, flexibility in investment options and fiduciary solutions and personalized participant support. We also ranked number 20 as the 20th largest business insurance agency in 2018 in their top list of 100 brokers in the U.S. This is up 1 spot from last year. This is our eighth time on this list as well and is a testament to our best-in-class insurance agents who continue to deliver customized solutions to meet the evolving needs of business owners and their employees. Value-rich insurance coverage plays a key role in both hiring and keeping key talent.","I would also like to note that for the sixth consecutive year, we were recognized by Selling Power Magazine as one of its 50 best companies to sell for, in fact ranking number 3. We have been making significant investments in our sales force, including new technology support tools and more sophisticated demand generation to improve the quantity and quality of the sales leads to support our sales force and their success.","We continue to also provide value to our shareholders. Our quarterly dividend is currently at $0.56 per share, with a last increase of 12% this past April.","In summary, our state of art technology full suite of integrated HCM product offerings and personalized service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth in our markets. Our employees make this combination successful with their hard work and commitment to our clients each and every day.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty and good morning. I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings release that includes a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measurements include certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to the press release and investor slide presentation for a discussion of these measures. The investor slide presentation should be up and it\u2019s got a lot of supplemental information on it.","As mentioned previously, effective for this fiscal year, we have adopted a new revenue recognition guidance in ASC Topic 606. We have adopted under the full retrospective method. So prior year results have been restated to conform with this guidance. After our previous earnings call in June, you\u2019ll recall that I held a supplemental call to introduce the impacts of this new guidance on our financial results. On our IR page, we have published an updated presentation from that call and that gives quarterly information on the financial impacts of ASC 606 and other non-GAAP adjustments for the past 2 years.","Overall, the changes from adoption of the accounting standard are not significant, but they do have a modest effect on the quarterly periods. This presentation also reflects the impact of tax reform and non-GAAP measures. In connection with the adoption of the new guidance, the categorization of our service revenues is evolving. In prior years, we disaggregated service revenue into two buckets, payroll service revenue and human resource services revenue. As our business has evolved to selling more bundled products, this disaggregation has become less meaningful. ASC 606 requires disaggregation of revenues to reflect how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are impacted by economic factors. Given how we manage our business and the risk inherent in various services, we have decided that a more meaningful presentation is the categories of management solutions revenue and PEO and insurances revenue. Management solutions revenue includes payroll and HR and employee benefits products that are better reflective of offerings in our product bundles. So, this presentation includes our previous category of payroll services together with retirement services and HR administration solutions, including our comprehensive ASO service bundle. This presentation represents our integrated HCM services.","PEO and insurance services revenues have similar operational economic characteristics. Both involve the provision of insurance benefits to clients. PEO revenues also reflect a gross up for certain of our insurance offerings to PEO clients. During this transition period, I want to emphasize this will provide information on service revenues under both our previous and new classification. So, you will have that information. You will have the ability to adjust your models as you go forward. And there is information on our Investor Relations site. It provides both as reported disaggregation of revenue, payroll and HRS and the revised disaggregation of revenue management solutions and PEO and insurance services for the past few years.","Now with that preface out of the way, I will provide some of the key highlights for the quarter and then provide greater detail in areas. And as usual, I will touch briefly on the results and wrap up with the review of fiscal \u201819 outlook. Total revenue and services grew 9% for the first quarter to $863 million and $846 million respectively. The growth was aided by the acquisitions of HROI and Lessor, more to come on those. Expenses increased 14% for the first quarter. The acquisitions of HROI and Lessor together contributed approximately 6% to the total expense growth for the first quarter. Accelerated investment in sales, marketing and product development as part of tax reform investments and PEO costs were major factors in expense growth.","Operating income increased 1% to $320 million. Operating margins were 37.1% for the first quarter. Margins were impacted by acquisition expenses, increased investment initiatives, higher growth and PEO costs and the composition of payroll processing days. Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% for the first quarter compared to 34.1% for the respective prior year quarter. The significant decline year-over-year in the effective tax rate is of course due to tax reform legislation. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be approximately 24% for the remainder of the year. Net income increased 16% to $244 million for the first quarter and adjusted net income increased 18% to $242 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $0.67 for the first quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.67.","I will provide some additional color now in selected areas and start with a discussion of service revenues and we will discuss results under our previous categories and our new service revenue categories. Under our previously reported categories of service revenue, payroll services revenue growth was 1% for the first quarter in line with our expectations. Organic growth related to pricing for the first quarter was offset by the impact of client size mix and the composition of payroll processing days within the quarter. If you recall in June, I indicted that payroll revenue growth for Q1 would be below the low end of the range of our guidance. HRS revenues grew 18%, approximately 12% excluding the HROI acquisition. This growth is due to the growth in clients across our HR products, in particular Paychex HR Services, ASO and PEO, and retirement services.","Now, let\u2019s talk about management solutions revenue. This includes as I discussed previously payroll service revenue together with other HCM products included in many of our product bundles. Management solutions revenue increased 3% to $688 million for the first quarter. This increase was driven by growth in client bases across our HCM services, including payroll, ASO, retirement services, and time and attendance solutions. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in the asset value participants\u2019 funds. The acquisition of Lessor contributed less than 1% to this growth. The growth was partially offset by the impact of unfavorable composition of payroll processing days in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter, same thing that I mentioned on payroll.","PEO and insurance services revenue increased 39% to $158 million for the first quarter. We acquired HROI near the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The incremental impact of HROI accounts for approximately one half of this growth. The remaining growth was primarily driven by continued strong demand for our combined PEO services as we continue to experience strong growth in the number of client worksite employees. In addition, our insurance services revenue benefited from growth in the number of applicants.","Interest on funds held for clients grew 25% for the first quarter to $17 million primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. And just to pause there for a second, we have assumed that there would be Fed rate increases in this fiscal \u2013 there will likely be more, but we only included two in our plan. The first occurred this or last month I should say and we anticipate there will be one more at least that\u2019s what\u2019s contemplated in our plans. As we get to midyear, we will talk a little bit more about what our expectation is based on where the Fed is at that point.","Turning to our investment portfolio, our goal as always is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. And the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipals bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government agency securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9%. Average duration is 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.8% for the first quarter, up from 1.4% last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were down modestly for the first quarter, primarily driven by the impacts of tax reform and client employee withholdings partially offset by wage inflation.","I will now walk through our thoughts on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $788 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients were $3.8 billion compared to $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018. Funds held for clients vary widely as you know on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the first quarter. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized losses of $36 million as of August 31, 2018 compared with $38 million as of May 31, 2018.","Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.4 billion as of August 31, 2018 reflecting $201 million in dividends paid and $33 million of shares repurchased during the first quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months has been a stellar 45%. Please note that our return on equity calculation was adjusted to reflect the impacts of the adoption of ASC 606. At fiscal 2018 year end, we reported 46% return on equity, which would be actually 44% on a restated basis, because of those changes made by ASC 606. Cash flows from operations were $274 million for the first quarter. It was a decline versus the prior year quarter. The change was primarily a result of timing impacts within working capital largely related to income taxes and our PEO payroll and related unbilled receivables for payrolls not yet processed as of the reporting date offset by higher net income.","Fiscal 2019 guidance. Now, I will turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 31, 2019. I will remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our guidance for fiscal 2019 is unchanged from what was provided in June, which was given reflecting adoption of ASC 606. Under our previous revenue categories, there is no change to payroll revenue guidance in the range of 2% to 3% and HRS revenue guidance in the range of 10% to 11%. Payroll services revenue was below the low end of the range in the first quarter as anticipated due to the composition of payroll processing days. Growth in payroll revenue will be at or above the high end of the range for Q2 and Q3 and Q4 is anticipated to be within the range. HRS revenue growth for the first quarter was significantly higher than the range due to the timing of the HROI acquisition. Growth for Q2 and Q3 is anticipated to be within the range. For Q4, growth is anticipated to be below the low end of the range due to a more challenging compare caused by the strong growth in the PEO in the latter part of fiscal 2018.","We will also provide you with revenue guidance under our new categories as we transition to this approach in the future. Management solutions revenue is anticipated to grow by approximately 4% for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Our Q1 results were obviously lower than this due, as I mentioned before, to the composition of payroll processing days. We anticipate that Q2 and Q3 will be above 4% and we anticipate that Q4 will be in line with the full year guidance.","PEO and insurance services revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 18% to 20%. Growth in the first quarter was obviously significantly higher due to the timing of the HROI acquisition. We anticipate that growth for Q2 and Q3 will be in the range of 15% to 17% and for Q4 in the range of 11% to 13% due to the factors that I mentioned before, i.e., a challenging comparison with strong PEO growth in the latter part of fiscal 2018. All other guidance remains unchanged.","Finally, just as a reminder, we have provided on our IR website a presentation entitled service revenue disaggregation, which reflects historical revenues as originally reported and as they would be under the new categories. We have also published an updated presentation entitled impacts of ASC 606 and other items that reflects the impacts of adoption of 606 and other non-GAAP adjustments for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. And with that, I will turn it now back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Alright. Thank you, Efrain. Operator, we will now open up the call to questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. One moment. Please go ahead, Mr. Keane.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Can you hear me now?","Martin Mucci","Yes, we can, Bryan.","Bryan Keane","Yes, solid results. Just want to ask about the margins, they came in a little bit better than expected and wondering if they had to do with some timing of investments, because I think the full year operating margins were reiterated?","Martin Mucci","Yes, Bryan, I would say that investments in Q1 were a little bit lower \u2013 they were planned that way, so this wasn\u2019t different, investments were a little bit lower in first quarter than they will be in subsequent quarters. That was one. And then revenue was a little bit better than we had originally anticipated in the quarter, so the combination of those two drove margins a bit better than we anticipated.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then just in particular on ASO and PEO strength, it looks like that those trends continue, in particular, just curious if there are any callouts? And then Efrain, when we get towards the end of the year, I know it gets a little more challenging on comps. So does that mean that 11% to 13% is a more normalized range for the PEO business and insurance business as we go forward past this fiscal year?","Efrain Rivera","Bryan, I knew when I put out that number in those ranges just so everybody could be centered I would get that question. I don\u2019t know the answer to that at this point. I think I will talk to that as we get closer to Q2 and Q3. We had an exceptionally strong back half of the year. So I will have to see we have some momentum in PEO and we have a degree of conservatism in the way we look at the information. So, I will hold out on commenting whether that\u2019s the run-rate going into next year. Your first question was any callouts on PEO I will just let Marty.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think just \u2013 Bryan just that we continue as we said \u2013 as Efrain just said we had a strong back half of last year that continued right into the first quarter. We are finding a lot of success with the PEO and ASO both from an HR outsourcing perspective and the integration with HROI has gone very well and frankly has complemented us and our teams and the leadership I think very well. So, we have really picked up, continue to have some great momentum in the first quarter. So right now, the callouts are that there is a great need for the PEO and the ASO products and we are capturing the sales for that need. So, we are very pleased with the work that those guys have been doing.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.","Martin Mucci","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please go ahead.","David Grossman","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin Mucci","Hi, David.","David Grossman","Thanks for taking my question. I am wondering if you could go back to the PEO for a minute and I don\u2019t know if you can break just focus on the PEO excluding the other insurance business, but can you help us understand the components of the growth that you are anticipating for this year broken down, how much of that is unit growth versus pass-through versus maybe pricing and other items that maybe impacting the growth rate year-over-year?","Efrain Rivera","David, here is what I\u2019d say, the \u2013 what we are experiencing is strong growth in worksite employees that continued in the first quarter. So, it\u2019s not primarily pricing-driven, it\u2019s really much more driven by volume of clients. So we\u2019re not \u2013 and we\u2019re not anticipating any significant stat up \u2013 step-up, I\u2019m sorry, in the rate of attach on healthcare. So it\u2019s not that getting a little bit more contribution from pass-throughs, it\u2019s really more volume-driven. And I got a lot of calls or we got a lot of questions about whether our worksite employee growth was real or how real it was and how sustainable more than that not how real, and we had strengthened the back half of the year and that that\u2019s continuing as we start the year.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think you can really see it in the \u2013 because when you think about it, the worksite employee growth is double digits as well, so it\u2019s continued to be very strong, not only the sales of \u2013 from new sales, but also the existing basis is continuing to grow. So, we\u2019re getting a little uptick on the economy from those slightly larger businesses, I guess I\u2019d say mid-market size PEO client.","Efrain Rivera","And David one of the thing that I\u2019d like to add because this is probably not what was true five or six years ago. We get a lot of PEO clients outside of the base. So, when you see the growth, a lot of that\u2019s coming from outside the Paychex PEO bay \u2013 sorry, Paychex payroll base. So, we\u2019re winning both inside the base and outside the base.","David Grossman","And just to confirm since you \u2013 the way you just disclosure is set up, the actual of this WSE growth that you\u2019re quoting now is actually an organic number, right, because you had HROI at the end of last \u2013 from fiscal first quarter last year as well, correct?","Efrain Rivera","WSE growth or revenue growth?","Martin Mucci","Worksite employee growth.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Martin Mucci","Yes.","David Grossman","WSE growth.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I\u2019m sorry.","Martin Mucci","The organic is double-digits.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, yes, correct.","David Grossman","Right, got it. Okay, great. And then just to \u2013 you gave us some good guidance on the growth and the cadence as the year goes by. Do processing days normalize at all as the year goes on or is that just this year or one quarter-ish with no real impact through the balance of the year?","Efrain Rivera","Well, we never recover that one heavy processing day and the impact on payroll services revenue is about $5 million from that one day. So we never recover it and then you have kind of the normal ups and downs you might have in a given quarter, which is why the other quarters looks so different from Q1.","David Grossman","Alright. So just 1Q is the $5 million and nothing else through the balance of the year?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, just to be clear since I get this question. We\u2019re not saying there is one less day, it\u2019s really just the composition of a heavier processing day in Q1 that we lost and then the rest of the year is normal, which will mean you got some a little bit more in one quarter, a little bit less in other quarters and \u2013 but it will look like a normal year.","David Grossman","Got it. And then just one last quick question on the competitive dynamic. You know one of kind of non-traditional competitor came out with a kind of revised payroll solution during the quarter, I think it\u2019s been out there, so it\u2019s really not terribly new. But, I guess the reason I bring it up is that in the past point-of-sale usually goes in the small business before payroll and I\u2019m just curious whether how you\u2019re thinking about that if in fact the point-of-sale competitor comes in with a stronger solution and how that may impact you given that typically is the \u2013 the cash register if you will goes in before the payroll system?","Martin Mucci","Yes, David, this is Marty. You\u2019re absolutely right. I mean that that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been and of course other competitors have been out there with those solutions for a while. This one is not a new one, a lot was made about it, and \u2013 but it\u2019s a mobile version of something they\u2019ve had for a number of years. It doesn\u2019t support all the states, it\u2019s not as complex obviously as close to our offering, you have to do payroll many days ahead. So, I don\u2019t at least in this instance I don\u2019t see it as any big change from a competitive standpoint. And you\u2019re right that in kind of that point-of-sale typically because we\u2019re selling \u2013 we are also selling through a partner those solutions, payment solutions. We find that, that is something that they take upfront and then payroll comes along a little bit later. So, we have experienced that ourselves. So, we can be selling it. We actually unseat more payment solutions, because they already have them before they ever talk about payroll with us. So, we don\u2019t see that as a big change at this point. Again, a number of competitors have been out there and this one really wasn\u2019t that big of a change or anything close to the competitiveness that we have. It\u2019s a mobile payroll solution. It doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t believe, even have employee access, which is what many companies are looking for now on a mobile basis.","Efrain Rivera","And if I just more concretely beyond what \u2013 adding building on what Marty said, look, I mean, we have a really competitive offering in the micro-enterprise space and we will be talking as we go through the year about some really significant enhancements of that product that we think will put us certainly at the forefront of what\u2019s happening on the low end of the DIY SaaS part of the market. We are doing really well in that part of the business. It was really, really surprising to us, what the reaction that occurred as a result of that, because we don\u2019t see any of that in our numbers. As a matter of fact, in the past 6 months, we have been building momentum in that part of the market. So, everyone is entitled to make their own opinion as to what a press release makes. Unfortunately, from the standpoint of the facts, we are not seeing any impact. And so, I just want to make that very clear.","David Grossman","Thanks for that. But I guess the follow-on related to that is does this change at all your appetite to be in the merchant acquiring business or has that really not changed?","Efrain Rivera","No. I mean, we are selling and our sales have done very well. We have an inside team that sells through a couple of partners now and has continued to do well. But as far as getting into a full-fledged \u2013 doing the processing itself of the payments, I don\u2019t think so, there is not a great interest there. As you know, the company dynamics are very different. The financials are very different. And I don\u2019t think it makes a huge difference from the payroll side on the front-end. Frankly, we have had better experience with having the payroll and then unseating an existing competitor in the payment space, because those rates constantly are changing and we can give them a little bit better product. And frankly, sometimes it offsets the cost of payroll or other products. So, we are in it, but I think we are in it at the right level right now.","David Grossman","Alright. Got it, great. Thanks very much.","Martin Mucci","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. I guess two questions on the PEO business. I guess one is just somewhat of a follow-up. I guess, the WSE growth had double-digits versus the 19% I guess organic growth. It seems double-digits doesn\u2019t sound quite as high as 19%, so what\u2019s the kind of revenue per WSE, maybe talk about that in terms of that I guess driving incremental growth? I mean, I will top there first.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So we don\u2019t disclose the revenue per WSE number, Tim. We will talk to that as we go through the year. It doesn\u2019t sound impressive, because when we said organic was 19%, remember that the base now, including HROI, increases the number of WSEs. It\u2019s still pretty strong. So, I wouldn\u2019t take that as an implication that growth is somehow decelerating, because now when we talk about organic, we are talking about the inclusion of HROI in the base, which adds more WSEs. And so we are talking about a more apples-to-apples comparison. And then as we walk through the year, we will talk more about revenue per worksite employee.","Tim McHugh","Is the implication of that last comment that I guess HROI wouldn\u2019t be growing as fast as your organic? Is that what you are saying now that it\u2019s rolled in\u2026","Efrain Rivera","No, the implication of that is that now you have got a larger base on which to calculate growth. So, the 19% was on the Paychex business itself. That was the organic comparison. And now we roll in the HROI base to our clients and so the growth rate obviously is a little bit lower, because you have a bigger base on which you are calculating the growth.","Martin Mucci","Yes. And we didn\u2019t really mean to imply that double-digits means at the low end of double-digits.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And then, I guess a broader question just you are breaking PEO and insurance out into separate segment. I get it\u2019s somewhat driven by the revenue disclosures, but also even just this call, a lot of discussion of this business and you have talked about a lot of momentum in it. So, yet it\u2019s still a smaller piece relative to your business. I know it\u2019s been clearly an area of expansion. I guess should we read anything into I guess how important this is going to be strategically to Paychex in terms of your focus and where the investment dollars are going over the next 3 years given all those factors?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think you certainly could read into it that we think that\u2019s an important part of our business going forward. The HR Outsourcing has been very important and the PEO has picked up momentum really the last 2 or 3 years in particular even from the client standpoint from accepting what a PEO is and understanding. The competition that\u2019s out there I think has also helped drive that, understanding that what a PEO is and how that can assist them. The changes in insurance have driven that. So, yes, I think you will see us continue to make investment in that business and we do think \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t break it out as a segment with insurance unless we thought it was certainly a significantly growing piece of the business. And it has different dynamics obviously to the financials that we like to call out as well.","Tim McHugh","Okay, thank you. Maybe actually one more on that, the dynamics part, sorry to raise the question, just the margins on that side of the business, can you comment at all? Is it different versus the other segment as we think about the growth of that side of it?","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Tim. So, we will talk more as this is the first quarter reporting on it. But obviously, because PEO is bundled with insurance or not bundled with insurance, but presented with insurance and PEO has pass-through costs, it\u2019s lower than the overall company margin and management solutions is higher. We will have to go through the year and kind of see where rates normalize, but it\u2019s fair to say it is lower than overall company margins.","Tim McHugh","Okay, thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of James Fossett with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Fossett","Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the question related to kind of the crossover and you have made it clear that you feel like merchant acquiring, etcetera, is a different business. But I am wondering if there is opportunity or how you think about like the selling motion to continue to make sure that Paychex has the best opportunity to win the business where you do want it, especially as the way people are setting up new businesses, etcetera, seems to be changing?","Martin Mucci","I hope I got the question. You mean specific to the payment business, payment with payroll?","James Fossett","Yes, just as people are starting to think about it as they setup new business, especially smaller businesses that maybe looking for a one stop shop. And I can understand what you are talking about in terms of where merchant acquiring maybe doesn\u2019t fit within Paychex, but I think perhaps what people are expressing some concern about is like what that selling motion looks like or needs to look like, so you can get the best opportunity to win new business?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think \u2013 one, I think we are very much at the front-end. I would just say our experience has been that, with the payment solutions that we do a payment solution through two partners. We are I think very effective at it. That sales team has grown. It\u2019s all an inside team. So, we get referrals from the field and we have of course one of the largest field base selling teams out there in payroll and HR. And so when we run into brand new clients, we can certainly refer them back to that team to sell payment now and then build a relationship to payroll. But we also more times than not have payroll first and then unseat the payment solution. On the other hand, I would tell you that a lot of the work that we are doing now on the front-end is to be able to get at those clients where they come to us on the web. So, you are seeing a lot more web-based coming in through the web and then selling them whatever they need at that point, whether that\u2019s payment, payroll or a combination of that with HR. So, I think we are well positioned very much to get those businesses at the very much the front-end of when they are searching. And more of our dollars frankly have shifted to marketing and to web development and demand generation than any time in our history, because of that, because of the way the whole sales approach is. And Efrain mentioned, SurePayroll, a component of ours out of Chicago, obviously is also we are working on some things that we will be releasing and talking about the next quarter or two that I think will help that even more.","Efrain Rivera","The other thing, as you know we have been involved with merchant services over the past 5 years and I think we have got a pretty good understanding of the dynamics of how that sale occurs and how it occurs with payroll. So, I think between SurePayroll and what we do on the merchant side, we are in a position to see if that starts to tilt or to tip and take the appropriate action. Right now though I just want to emphasize that we are not seeing that and a lot of the dynamics that we saw 5 years ago still remain and what happens in the future where we will monitor and see what\u2019s going on.","James Fossett","Great. That\u2019s really reassuring. And I guess on your kind of online customer acquisition and referral efforts and what you are putting in there, any even qualitative color you can share with us about the effectiveness of that versus traditional sales force and maybe how that has been changing and what kind of further improvements you maybe able to make at least on what those metrics look like? Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, sure. I think it\u2019s been a very significant change over particularly over the last year. We have moved more leads to a virtual team inside for the smallest of clients. Those were starting up 1 to 4. We use more of the virtual teams or telephonic sales, because that\u2019s the way the client in those small areas in particular, their leads come in, they want to be addressed very quickly. We have really become much more sophisticated in our lead generation in the way we are scoring leads and then communicating with prospects, who aren\u2019t ready to buy yet. Those used to all be kind of in the bucket with all the leads being the same that is not the way it\u2019s done anymore. We know when someone just comes in. We know where they start and stop looking at our product. They know if we have been compared to somewhere else. We know if they looked at pricing or not. And we can respond telephonically much faster with much better data targeted right at that client and we are setup to demo and sell over the phone or through chat very quickly. So the dynamics have changed quite dramatically, particularly for the inbound web search and low end client. And I think we have really \u2013 last year we kind of started this towards the beginning of the year actually in the fourth quarter of the year before and we really have picked up momentum in the last 6 months and I think we have really fine tuned the store, it\u2019s working very well.","James Fossett","That\u2019s great color. Thanks guys.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jim Schneider","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Marty, if you could talk through, I think you have touched on some of them, but maybe talk through the remaining product and service initiatives you have got underway for the fiscal year? And maybe share what goals you might have in terms of retention rates exiting this fiscal year, if you could give us any color to that? That will be great.","Martin Mucci","I will start with the latter. Certainly, our goal is always to be at the best we have ever been. I think we are approaching that from a client retention level. First quarter doesn\u2019t make the year, but we certainly have seen continuous improvement in our net promoter scores and our satisfaction surveys, which have been translated into even better retention and we went through a pretty big service kind of realignment 2 years ago that really settled out through last year and we really feel like all of that is behind us now and has worked very effectively and how we are servicing clients in different ways with different teams. We have also added a lot of technology for the retention. So, we have put in a whole new unified communications system across all of our branches and locations. We collect a lot more data. I know lot more about the clients, what they are looking at, what their history has been before I ever talk to them when they are calling in. And of course, we have continued to use a lot of data analytic models to anticipate if a client is possibly going to leave us or not and then do proactive calling to them. So, our goal is certainly to have the best retention ever in our history and we hit that peak about 2 years ago, 2.5 years and we are slightly below that and aiming for more. From a product standpoint, Jim, we are very proud that HR Tech, just a few weeks ago we released as I mentioned the learning management, Paychex Learning Management that type training into development. So now we have kind of a fully bundled development. So we are helping, you can think about it all the way from acquiring new employees for our clients, we can do all of that paperless in a paperless fashion right from the recruiting to the on-boarding of the client so nothing, there is no paper necessary. Once they are in the system, now we\u2019ve been much more full-featured as far as training them, developing them, giving turnover data analytics of what\u2019s going on in the environment. I think the data and the enhancements have never come faster. And then adding more self-service, so where the other thing we\u2019re seeing is a lot of clients wanting self-service, so meaning that if they have questions or their employees have questions or their employees want to make changes that we allow them to do that in the app whether mobile or on the desktop. They can make changes, they can ask questions, we\u2019ll be introducing a chatbot that we showed at HR Tech that will basically service up 50 or 60 answers the questions, all you have to do is where is my W-2 or where do I find this or how do I do that and that will pop up and you will see that continue to evolve throughout the year.","Jim Schneider","That\u2019s helpful. And maybe a corollary question to that is, are you seeing those initiatives now starting to translate to higher bookings at this point, and I know you don\u2019t give the precise bookings figures, but is there a way to quantify how much higher bookings were this quarter than say a year ago quarter?","Martin Mucci","Now without giving it to you, but a good try anyway. But \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 I would just say we had some momentum going into the last half of last year, we feel like that has continued. So, hey selling season is the peak and we\u2019re fully staffed up on our sales team. We did that very quickly. Well we added some additional sales. We have added more to virtual, to telephonic as well, both field and telephonic. And I think we\u2019re well positioned for a peak selling season, product wise and sales wise. And they have a lot \u2013 by the way I didn\u2019t even mention the sales team has a lot more tools as well. So when you think about the use of sales force and how sophisticated sales force has now become for them, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s amazing the tools that are at their disposal and the ability to train and get them to use it is coming much better too because they\u2019re seeing that when they give us data on a prospect that maybe didn\u2019t close this time, they\u2019re getting a lot more information back the next time they got out and talk to CPAs, current clients et cetera. So, it\u2019s starting to translate. We didn\u2019t quite call it the year yet but because we got to get through that peak selling season, but we\u2019re feeling really good about where we are now.","Jim Schneider","Well, I had this right. Thanks very much though.","Martin Mucci","Okay, alright.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Tien-tsin Huang","Good morning. Thanks for the slides. It\u2019s all very helpful. Just a couple of quick clarification questions and I have a strategic question. Just within the PEO side, I heard you mention it\u2019s more new rather than existing, but I\u2019m curious, are you taking pre-existing PEO clients and converting to your own or these first time PEO clients? Just trying to understand the end-market dynamics?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I don\u2019t have a good split between previous \u2013 obviously the \u2013 that the \u2013 you get a lot outside the PEO who have \u2013 who know PEO. So, we\u2019re doing well there and the split as to new to PEO, I don\u2019t know, my suspicion is it\u2019s more people who know about the PEO model to start with.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","But I do want to say just reiterate Tien-tsin what you said which is as we looked at the data we always had a certain amount of PEO clients outside the base, but that trend has certainly been accelerating.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it. Now it seems that way. Within \u2013 then within core payroll I know the segmenting is changing, but just as we go into 2Q, 3Q, you mentioned it will be at the high-end or above the range. Is that just a function of the processing days or are there any other drivers pricing, units, retention that you might see?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. It is a function of the days, but our assumption is that through the year we build in terms of sales units and sales volume as we progress through the next three quarters. And as Marty said we\u2019re off to a decent start this year.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay, got it. So, backlog conversion, okay, great. And then last one just for you Marty just if you don\u2019t mind, just a high-level question on freelancers and that whole market. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s an area of focus for you to potentially go after that freelance market?","Martin Mucci","Maybe I\u2019m not sure.","Efrain Rivera","1099 gig.","Martin Mucci","Oh, I\u2019m sorry, like the gig economy.","Tien-tsin Huang","The gig economy, sorry.","Martin Mucci","That\u2019s alright.","Tien-tsin Huang","It\u2019s a trendier word to use.","Martin Mucci","It\u2019s I think we are well prepared for that. We have been building out a number of the products I am looking at it from a strategy standpoint of how do we look at from an insurance, retirement, savings and payroll, but even more so from the benefit side, how do you look at ways to let that follow the employee as opposed to being so client focused, the employer focused. And I think we will have some things to talk about in future quarters as we are rolling that out. We are not seeing a big impact from that right now. I think it was a little bit overstated last year, but we are certainly preparing for that. And I think already with the mobile app and the way we are building out the data by employee, you are going to see much more of a shift toward the employee and how they can carry information with them. And we will be prepared to react to that as it continues to grow.","Tien-tsin Huang","Very good. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Great. Alright.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Please go ahead. Mr. Silber, maybe of your mute button on. We will move on to the next question. It comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks. Good morning, guys. How are you?","Martin Mucci","Good morning, Jason.","Jason Kupferberg","Good. So, I just had a question to follow-up on Core Payroll. Thanks for continuing to give the disclosure there. I just wanted to try and break down the pieces, because it seems like there is a few moving parts. So, I guess it seems like the tailwind from Lessor was more or less offset by the one less processing day. So if that\u2019s right, you have got about this 1% underlying revenue growth. And it does sound like pricing is still a tailwind. I know it had been running around 2%. So, I was just trying to figure out the implications for organic client count, because qualitatively it doesn\u2019t sound based on what you are saying that, that metric would be down year-over-year, but what are the other pieces here? Is this a average client size issue or is organic client comp down?","Efrain Rivera","No, no, no. No, it isn\u2019t.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","And I don\u2019t typically give quarterly, but I can say no. No, it\u2019s really client size and that abates as we go through the year. We anticipate that it will abate in addition to all of the other factors changing as we go through the year. We have another day. We assume better unit and volume growth, all of those and mix abates a bit. So, it\u2019s those factors.","Jason Kupferberg","Are you running at about 16 on the average client size now?","Efrain Rivera","We are between I think 15 and 16 is where we ended up the client base last year.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, okay. Can you just talk a little bit about what the differences maybe in the pricing trends between renewals of existing clients versus pricing for new clients that you are bidding on? And just I guess at a high level, are you still running at around a 2% pricing uplift?","Martin Mucci","Yes. You want to take that?","Efrain Rivera","No, go ahead.","Martin Mucci","I think yes, that would be \u2013 our anticipation is still 2 to 3, we have always said kind of 2 to 4, but tend to recognize a little on the lower end of that. I think on new clients what you are seeing is some discounting there upfront, but we are able to get to roll that off very effectively and pretty quickly through using a lot of data analytics. We started this a number of years ago, but instead of leaving it to kind of individual branches to decide how to roll off discounts, we do it on a much more automated basis and it\u2019s done with data analytics. So we know based on the history of the client whether we can roll off more of a discount or less of a discount and that has been very effective for us at bringing the price, the discount back off. So, you are still seeing pretty much the same level of competition upfront, which drives a little bit more of the discounting or the same level of discounting, but we are able to roll that off. And I think between the service levels, the additional products we offer, all of that allows you to bring \u2013 getting drive more revenue per client kind of after you have the client. And once you have the client, the price increase seems to stick pretty well. So, the more of that discounting is more upfront to get the client in a competitive environment, but not as much once you are going forward.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Thanks for the commentary, guys.","Martin Mucci","Sure.","Efrain Rivera","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Rick Eskelsen","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.","Martin Mucci","Sure.","Rick Eskelsen","Just one for me. I am just wondering if you can talk about the Talent Acquisition, you did mention Marty in your script about how you are fully stepped up on the sales headcount increases you were looking for, but just in general across your organization how has it been finding talent and maybe if you could spend a little time on finding sales talent as you upped your investments? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Yes. Interesting question, I think it\u2019s still been pretty good as far as finding. I know there is shortages that are difficult to find based on the work that we do in the overall market as well as Paychex itself. It\u2019s more in the IT side and we have actually have been very successful there too. That\u2019s where when you get into certain disciplines of IT, security and so forth, that\u2019s been difficult. Sales has not been too difficult. I think one there \u2013 we are attracting good solid sales folks who are \u2013 who typically we still look for that some sales experience already and they are seeing the level of products and success that we are having. They are seeing growth opportunities that when they come into the company they could start and frankly in virtual telephonic they can grow to the field payroll, they can advance the mid-market, they can grow into HRS. In fact we just came back from our sales conference two weeks ago and just tremendous enthusiasm and a lot of good employee referrals. So we are really not having an issue of getting fully stepped. In fact we got fully stepped faster than we expected in the first quarter because of the success in the recruiting and the retention is improving across virtually every sales organization. So the retention is getting back in line where we were historically as well. I think that\u2019s all about them feeling like they have got the right tools, sales force, the enhancements we have made to that, the lead generation that they are getting, the leads and that they can be successful. All of that equates well to acquiring and retaining the talent.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Please go ahead.","Jeff Silber","Can you hear me?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Good Jeff, we were worried about you.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. This is going to be really quick. I know you are not directly impacted by all the noise regarding tariff wars etcetera. Are you seeing though any hesitation from your clients that might be impacted that could indirectly impact you?","Martin Mucci","Not at this point. We are not seeing much. There are specific small and mid-size businesses that are impacted whether they are supplying the automobile industry and so forth, but we have not seen much of an impact on our client base at all. And when you think about also when we saw the storm impacting awful lot of businesses in South Carolina and North Carolina we didn\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen too much of an impact there yet either. So, so far retention is in very good shape as I mentioned earlier and we are not seeing an impact either from regulation and tariff changes or the hurricane.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Martin Mucci","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Samad Samana","Hi. Thanks for taking my question this morning. A couple of follow-ups to some of the answers, you mentioned a lot of new tools for the sales organization, I was wondering maybe dig deeper into what those are and how much you are factoring in productivity increases from these tools into the forecast for this year and then I have one follow-up?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think when you think about like sales force, we have had sales force for some time but we have really added a team that has really worked with the sales team to say what to encourage them to find it to be much more useful. And so we have gotten a lot more into the analytics of sales force and we have also profiled the clients and the leads that they are getting much better. So let me start with the leads, when the leads come in, in the past as I mentioned they were in kind of one big bucket. So all the leads that came in that had interest kind of went out to the sales force and they may have been of different quality. We started with a new leader in marketing and with a lot of experience in demand generation started making these much more sophisticated. We are scoring the leads now. At the front end we have a team that has been talking to leads for some time taking them through the web, etcetera and now scoring them and if they don\u2019t score high enough they were put kind of back into system to get \u2013 to really get worked and continue to provide information and details to prospective clients before we send a sales person out to them. ","And so we are seeing that the quality of the leads to the sales team is much better. But as the sales team continues to use sales force and gives us more data on their prospects that goes back into data analytics that is then helps us profile the clients, also profile the CPAs and give you more data on the CPAs and what\u2019s the last time that they referred us, who referred us, how they referred us, what they referred us, all of giving the sales rep much more data to go out and approach either a prospective client or current client for referral, a CPA or other lead referral source. And you\u2019re also evolving into giving them a lot more data on their mobile phone as to where their next appointments are, how they make the best use of their time and how they can then get data off of social media on those prospects, so then when I walk into a prospect I know a lot about them already from our internal resources and combining that with external resources. So the level of sophistication and the tools that we give them has increased dramatically just even in the last six to 12 months. And we are starting to see some benefits from that one I think better retention of the sales force and certainly we\u2019re looking for an improved productivity as well and it\u2019s a little early in the year to talk about that, but so far as we have said number of times we think we\u2019re off to a good start.","Samad Samana","That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe if I could just ask a follow-up with that in mind and then some of the commentary about non-traditional competitors and customer acquisition, I am curious if you\u2019ve seen a change in your customer acquisition cost as you move more to virtual and\/or your non-traditional competitors try to spend aggressively and building their merchant base? I am just curious what you\u2019ve seen in your customer acquisition cost trends?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I would say first of all not in the merchant base, I mean I think again it seems like they\u2019ve got an awful lot of play and we just haven\u2019t seen that there and I think it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s not really much of an impact at least at this time. What we have seen is that the shift of dollars have definitely gone toward marketing. So, where you would necessarily shift \u2013 put dollars more into sales, we continue to put dollars into sales, but I have to say some of it has shifted earlier in the process. So redesigning our web, redesigning the whole lead-flow that I just talked about, data analytics and the work in building those support systems, more money goes into and investment goes into the marketing side. And overall that probably does raise the cost of acquiring a client to some degree certainly, but you\u2019re also getting more productive on the sales side or that\u2019s your hope. So, you are getting more revenue and more success and higher close rate as a result of that, but you\u2019re definitely doing more upfront in the spend as much more upfront to get that. This is the way they\u2019re searching. Most clients\u2019 prospects today are 60% of the way through the sales process before we even get contacted, that\u2019s very different than in our past and we think we\u2019re very much ready for that.","Samad Samana","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again for taking my questions.","Martin Mucci","Sure.","Efrain Rivera","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Berkley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","James Berkley","Thanks guys. Appreciate the time. On the service revenue disaggregation slide, I think you put out earlier this week, the last week rather, I was just wondering if you could speak to the drop off in growth for the restated HR Management Solutions revenue from fiscal \u201817 and \u201818 end, goes from what 6.1 to 2.9?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I just make that really quick. So, what happens there is that because we bundle into that revenue the impacts from modules related to Affordable Care Act, you didn\u2019t see that growth in that number, so that number started to tail off just \u2013 we penetrated the base and that part of the module which a couple of years earlier started at basically zero didn\u2019t grow very much, so that dropped off in growth. And then the second thing was the impact to payroll services revenue growing more slowly as seen in that number. You will see if you look at the numbers that we\u2019re projecting in terms of growth for the remainder of the year that we bounced back off that number that we had last year and we start to see better growth in the back half of this year, but those are the reasons, growth and payroll growth in that one category was muted.","James Berkley","Okay, thanks. And just a quick follow-up, I know last quarter you guys talked about organic growth guidance being like 1.5% for payroll and then 9% to 10% for HRS. Are you able to provide those numbers for the new segmentation?","Efrain Rivera","We repeated it. It should be on the website. So, we breakout management solutions and PEO and insurance and then we just reaffirmed the guidance that we provided for the full year, so\u2026","James Berkley","On an organic basis?","Efrain Rivera","On an organic basis. Yes, I think what we said, James, was that Lessor would be about 1% of payroll growth.","James Berkley","Okay. Alright, thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Kartik Mehta","Hey, good morning, Efrain and Marty.","Martin Mucci","Good morning.","Kartik Mehta","I wanted to go back to I think, Efrain, you were talking about client growth. And I am just wondering if you can talk about maybe is there a difference in the client growth you are seeing between your traditional payroll and SurePayroll? And so in essence, are you seeing client growth in both and is one greater than the other?","Martin Mucci","We don\u2019t breakout the client base between them anymore, Kartik. But I think both are growing. You certainly see, as Efrain said, on the low end of both companies you are seeing a stronger growth. We really feel like that has picked up a lot of momentum, particularly on the low end. And I think that\u2019s a lot of the things that we have been talking about, the demand generation, the virtual sales team, the faster response to leads, doing it with chat and selling over the phone much more. So, I think both of them are doing well. Certainly, Sure has continued to see good growth as well, really pleased with the team there.","Kartik Mehta","And just lastly, on the PEO side, any thoughts on maybe price competition, it seems like that business is really growing well. So I am assuming it\u2019s attracting all of the competitors into that space. So, any worries on that becoming a little bit more price competitive as we go through this fiscal year?","Martin Mucci","Always some concern with that. But I think right now, what you see in those kind of clients that are taking a PEO solution is they are much more interested in the service that they are getting and the support for the insurance in particular. And they are looking at those costs and do you have the right insurance plans and do you have the right service with the HR generalist and we have 500 of those out there that are supporting PEO and ASO. Do they have the right experience? It\u2019s really much more of a value play. So frankly I worry less about that price competition than I would small business payroll, which is much more competitive. And so the more that we grow toward the PEO side from a price standpoint, I think that the value is much stronger to say, hey, we hear plenty of clients that say to us this was having a strong HR person and this insurance plan was very valuable to my business and they probably pay more.","Kartik Mehta","Thanks, Marty. I appreciate it.","Martin Mucci","Okay, Kartik.","Operator","And the last question that we have in queue comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Neill with Autonomous Research.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now I'd like to turn your conference over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir.","Martin Mucci","All right, thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our discussion of Paychex's second quarter fiscal 2014 results. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday afternoon, after the market closed, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2013. We will file our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter tomorrow, on Friday.","This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month.","On today's call, I will share some thoughts on results and update you on how we're doing in operations, sales and product development, and Efrain will review our second quarter financial highlights and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for your questions or comments.","Let me start by saying we're pleased with second quarter results. We have made good progress toward our growth goals with continued positive momentum in sales, new product enhancements and geographic expansion. Client satisfaction and retention remain at record high levels for Paychex, and Efrain will go into more detail on the financial results and comparisons. However, I'd like to provide you with some highlights from my perspective.","Total service revenue, and specifically, payroll service revenue, showed good growth of 7% and 5%, respectively. Payroll service growth at 5% as compared to 2.5% or 2.4% growth in the first quarter. HRS revenue continued to grow at double-digit rates in the second quarter as we continue to experience good success in selling and retaining 401(k), as well as HRS -- HR outsourcing services under both the PEO and ASO models.","Our checks per payroll have improved for 15 consecutive quarters, and in the second quarter, experienced similar growth with the first quarter.","Our execution in service operations has continued to be excellent, demonstrated by our exceptionally strong client satisfaction results. We believe that this industry-leading client service that we provide, combined with the innovative technology, sets us apart from our competition.","From a sales perspective, we saw continued positive momentum during the second quarter, particularly in core payroll, SurePayroll and HR service areas, and we are well positioned for our important selling season that we're in now. We continue to grow revenue per unit as well.","From a technology perspective, continued investment in our software-as-a-service solutions and mobility offerings position us well for the long-term growth. We have market-leading SaaS solutions, leveraging the latest technologies and continue to invest significantly in online capabilities, as well as our mobile applications.","Whether you are a client or client employee, our mobile app provides a clean and efficient access to all of your information with 1 to 2 clicks, as well as the ability for clients to start, edit and submit their payroll with the best mobility app, we believe, in the marketplace.","We have further broadened our SaaS solutions portfolio with the launch of Paychex Accounting Online. This cloud-based accounting service is being delivered through a strategic partnership and investment we made in Kashoo, a leading provider of cloud accounting services. Our entry into the cloud accounting market reflects our commitment to provide small businesses with the products they need to succeed. This complements our industry-leading payroll and HR Solutions by expanding our suite of services designed for small businesses and midsized businesses and entrepreneurs. This product will also further enhance the strong partnership we have with the CPA communities.","In the past few quarters, I've talked about it -- our new products designed to help clients -- our clients manage the compliance requirements of the Affordable Care Act, more importantly known as health care reform. We continue to execute the rollout of our new product offerings in this area including our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility Service, a more robust monitoring service, and our Paychex Benefit Account.","We continue to see health care reform as an opportunity and have worked to get a great deal of information out in front of our clients as they work through all of the requirements of the Act. This selling season, our sales force is able to present options to clients and help them determine what will be beneficial for their businesses.","During the second quarter, we completed an acquisition of a payroll service provider in Germany, which we mentioned during our first quarter call. While our operations in Germany are immaterial to the overall company results right now, we continue to expand our global footprint with this acquisition and our start-up operation in Brazil and drive for more presence and growth in the markets that we serve.","We are pleased with the progress that we have made in product development and expansion as well, and we continue to execute on what we have brought to market.","We have also continued with the shareholder-friendly actions. Our quarterly dividend is now at $0.35 per share, increased from $0.33 back in July. We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock opportunistically. And we have repurchased approximately 4 million shares of common stock for a total of $159 million in the first 6 months of fiscal 2014.","Recent results released from the Department of Labor are encouraging. These results indicate, we believe, a continued addition of new jobs and a moderation in the unemployment rate. This is indicative of the U.S. economy as it continues its broad and steady job growth. We have seen positive impacts in our checks per payroll growth and this bodes well for continued positive trends in our business.","In summary, I am pleased with what I see as solid results for our second quarter and continued momentum for the first half of fiscal 2014. I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee teams across the country and in Germany and Brazil. And I appreciate the great work of our -- and I appreciate all the work that they're doing in service and sales operations.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that will refer to future events, and as such, involve risks. Refer to our press release on a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors.","As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2014 represented sequential improvement from the solid start we had for the year. Here are some of the key highlights of the second quarter and the 6 months. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of the full -- 2014 full year outlook.","Total service revenue grew 7% in the second quarter to $601 million and 6% to $1.2 billion for the first 6 months. Interest on funds held for clients increased about 1% for the second quarter and was flat for the 6 months to $10 million and $20 million, respectively.","Fluctuations were driven by an increase in average investment balances offset by the impact of continued lower average interest rates. As you saw on our interest on funds, though, this was the first quarter in a long while we're actually up slightly.","Expenses increased 7% for the second quarter and 5% for the first 6 months. We continue to invest at a high rate in product development and supporting technology, and we experienced higher sales-related costs attributable to solid sales execution during the first 6 months in both core and -- core payroll and HRS products.","Operating margin was 39.7% for the quarter and 40.4% for the first 6 months. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 8% for both the second quarter and the 6 months. We expect operating margin for the full year to be approximately 38% as we continue planned investments during the balance of the fiscal year.","Net income increased 7% for both the second quarter and the 6 months to $159 million and $322 million, respectively.","Diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $0.43 per share for the second quarter and 6% to $0.88 per share for the 6 months.","Now turning to payroll service revenue. It increased 5% for the second quarter and 4% for the 6 months. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check. As Marty already mentioned, our checks per payroll increased during the second quarter, consistent with the 1.6% we experienced for the first quarter of fiscal 2014.","Revenue per check grew as a result of price increase -- increases, net of discount, together with the impact of increased product penetration.","Our second quarter growth benefited from the absence of the disruptive effects of Hurricane Sandy a year ago. During the second quarter last year, Sandy impacted our payroll revenue growth by approximately 0.5%.","As a reminder, the growth rate for the last -- for last quarter was impacted by timing of processing as there was 1 additional processing day in the comparative quarter for fiscal 2013. And what I mean to say there is that, that was a reference to what happened in Q1.","On HRS revenue, it increased 12% for both the second quarter and the 6 months. Both ASO and PEO revenues grew at double-digit rates. HRS revenue increased -- the HRS revenue increase reflects client growth, primarily in retirement services, HR solutions and eServices products. eServices continues to grow due to the success in the sales of SaaS solutions.","Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in average asset value of participants' funds.","Insurance services revenue growth reflected higher premium in workers' comp insurance services and an increase in the number of health and benefits applicants.","HRS revenue growth was tempered modestly by higher direct costs in our PEO. Note that HRS revenue quarterly growth can vary due to volume of clients; PEO worker's compensation and basis points earned on retirement services client employee funds; basis point changes due to fluctuations in the financial market and the asset value of funds invested.","PEO net service revenue also exhibits greater variability between quarters due to a number of factors, including changes of workers' comp claims experience.","Now turning to our investment portfolio. Our priority has been and will continue to be to ensure that we can meet all of our cash commitments to the clients. On the short-term side, our primary vehicle is high-quality variable rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit-quality municipal bonds.","Our long-term portfolio currently has an average yield of about 1.6% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the second quarter and the 6 months compared to 1.2% for the same periods last year.","Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during both the second quarter and the 6 months, driven by the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on December 31, 2012, which resulted in higher Social Security withholdings growth in checks per payroll and client growth.","Our investment income increased due to -- decreased for the first 6 months due to lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by an increase in average investment balances, resulting from the investment of cash generated from operations.","I'll now review the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $839 million as of November 30, and we have no debt. Funds held for clients as of November 30, 2013, were $3.9 billion compared to $4.1 billion as of May 31, 2013.","Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.5 billion for the 6 months, a year-over-year increase of 6%.","Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $22 million as of November 30, 2013, compared with net unrealized gains of $35 million as of May 31, 2013.","Total stockholders' equity was $1.8 billion as of November 30, reflecting $256 million in dividends paid during the first months -- first 6 months. Our return on equity over the past 12 months was 34%.","Cash flow from operations were $400 million for the first 6 months, a 23% increase compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net income and our noncash adjustments from net income, mostly depreciation and amortization, and premiums [ph] of available-for-sale securities and changes in our operating assets and liabilities relating to timing.","I'd like to remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes with the exception of HRS revenue guidance is unchanged from the previous quarter. So payroll revenue growth, we expect it to be 3% to 4% for the year, that remains unchanged. HRS, given its strong performance in the first half of the year, we bumped that up 1 point to 10% to 11%. We think that total service revenue will still be in the range of 5% to 6%, albeit on the high end of that range.","Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. This growth rate is impacted or affected because the fourth quarter of last year we recognized additional tax provision for the settlement of a state tax issue, which impacted our diluted earnings per share, another way of saying that we ended the year at $1.56 and that's the way at which we're computing that growth rate.","Our operating margin for the year is anticipated to be approximately 38%. This is lower than the margin experienced in the first half of fiscal 2014, but as I previously mentioned, margins are historically lower in the second half of the fiscal year. We don't expect the expense leveraging realized in the first half of the fiscal year to continue throughout the remainder of fiscal 2014 as we continue our planned spending.","We didn't disclose the anticipated range for interest on funds held for clients and investment income net. These ranges were provided in June and we don't anticipate a material change from those ranges.","I'll turn it back over to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Great. Thank you, Efrain. We will now open the meeting to questions, please. Teresa?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason, your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Jason Kupferberg. Just a question on the core payroll. So it was interesting to us to see that on a quarter-over-quarter bases, core payroll was actually up a hair. I think, usually for seasonal reasons, it tends to be down quarter-over-quarter. So was this an issue in terms of number of processing days quarter-over-quarter? I know there was no change year-over-year, but if you could just comment on that and then maybe just remind us as we think about the back half of the year in terms of quarter-over-quarter changes in processing days, we should be considering for Q3 and Q4 because I think, year-over-year, Q3 has 1 more day, again, year-over-year while Q4 has one less, if I'm not mistaken?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, you're right. So yes, good memory, Jason. So the answer is Q2 did not have any additional days so we had 65 processing days in Q2 of 2013. We had 65 processing days in Q2 of 2014. You are correct in both statements that you made. So in Q3, we will have 1 additional day of processing. We'll still have 65, but it turns out that last year in Q3 in 2013, we had 64. And we will have 1 less day in the final quarter of the year than we had the year before. When you total all of this up for the year, we have 1 less day overall. I am happy to report that next year, we have the exact same days in the exact same quarters, so I won't have to -- we won't have to keep discussing days. But you're right. So we'll have -- this quarter was, even with the prior quarter in terms of days, plus 1 in Q3, minus 1 in Q4. So we'll have 1 less processing day overall than we had last year.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","But just to clarify...","Efrain Rivera","So no issues from a compare standpoint.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. What about even just quarter-over-quarter? I mean, fiscal Q1 '14 versus fiscal Q2 '14, was that also flat processing days?","Efrain Rivera","No. In fiscal '14 versus 2013, I mentioned that in the call, we had 1 less day this year than we had last year.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right. No, I was just asking Q2 this year versus Q1 this year.","Efrain Rivera","Oh I'm sorry, Q2 versus Q1.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, I'm just trying to -- because I'm just trying to get to how you guys saw a little bit of an increase in revenue sequentially here in...","Efrain Rivera","Sorry, Jason, I didn't catch the question. No, we're comparable in terms of number of days in this quarter versus last year. So to answer your question, it really is 3 pieces. So the first, we mentioned checks per payroll, about 1.6 comparable to Q2. We keep saying that checks per payroll will moderate. They have moderated, but very slowly. The second is we see better pricing environment. And the third is we've had some client growth. So those are the 3 components of why we did better.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Was there as much as a couple of million or so from the acquisitions in the Brazil JV in this quarter [ph]?","Efrain Rivera","No, no, no. The acquisition, which Marty mentioned on data, that was less than 0.2%. So it's really -- it's timing, I guess we should call it out specifically. And the JV isn't generating any revenue.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, the organic client growth, I think, you're targeting for this current fiscal year is 1% to 3%. So wanted to understand kind of where you're running at the midpoint of the fiscal year-to-date here. And any better sense of where you might fall within that range, obviously understanding that the key selling season is upon us and that may be a key swing factor. But any color there would be great.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, good question. So we still feel good about the range. We certainly, through the first 2 quarters, feel comfortable where we're at. Having said all of that, I'd just caveat what we say all the time, which is that the third quarter is a critical quarter for us not just from a sales standpoint, but also from a loss standpoint. So good trends. We feel pretty good. We're in the middle of selling season. We'll update you on where we're at.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Thomas, Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marty and Efrain, just following up on that last question. I guess could you talk a little bit more specifically about the price increases? How much of a benefit that was in the quarter? And Marty, I think you also mentioned that some of that was a product benefit as well. So if you could talk a little bit about the benefit of both of those in the quarter?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think just generally, we talked about price increases. We don't give specifically what we increase, but it was a consistent range. But I think what we're finding is the price increase was holding very well. We're not having to discount more. And in fact, we're getting a little bit more revenue per unit that we're selling as well. So we're feeling good. I would say the competitive market is about the same, but we're actually doing well from a price on a revenue-per-unit perspective. And then we're continuing to get more product per client as well, so more revenue per client in what we're selling. We've obviously offered some additional products, and so we're able to not only get good payroll pricing but also sell some additional products as well.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then could you talk a little more about the partnership with Kashoo? Should we think about that as more of an attachment to SurePayroll clients? Or are there opportunities for that in the 50-plus market as well?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think it's primarily targeted to, certainly, under 20, I would say. And I think it's, for a start-up, it's a simple cloud accounting software package. We just saw it as another way to get into small businesses, help them get started, offer a broad range of products and a suite of products that tie to payroll. It will tie to SurePayroll. It could also certainly tie to core payroll, our small business payroll at Paychex, because a lot of clients -- obviously, 80% of our clients are under 20. So I think it's a good fit for both of them. We're kind of just getting started, but it's getting some nice attention already just as we've rolled out the Paychex Accounting Online private-labeled version of it.","Operator","The next comes from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to inquire about the PEO business and to what extent there will be impact from Obamacare. Can you just summarize? I'm assuming there are some significant positives, but there also could be some negative implications of Obamacare. Can you just outline that for us? What are the major positives and the potential negatives that could stem from Obamacare as you look at the PEO business going forward?","Martin Mucci","Yes. From the PEO business, I think, for the most part, it's been a positive that we've experienced so far, which is the fact that in that PEO co-employer status, it's making the -- it's a great sales opportunity to get in front of people and say that we're going to be able to help them by bringing them into the PEO being a co-employer and working them through the requirements and that we have the expertise to be able to handle their needs. So I think it's been certainly a positive for those clients who are concerned about the requirements. Everything keeps changing when things are due, when it's going to take effect. And so the PEO business is seeing, I think, a nice uptick from that. Not huge, but it's certainly seeing some positive momentum for it. From a negative perspective, I think, it's -- I don't know. Overall, I think, the negative perspective is just the disruption that it causes new business start-ups in general as to whether to add an additional business, whether to start up your business, whether to invest in health care at all because you're just not sure what it's going to cost you and what the requirements and possible tax implications are going to be for your employees. So I'm not so sure, Rod. I think the negatives are frankly across-the-board more than they are specifically for the PEO. And right now, at least in the short term, it's a positive for the PEO. Efrain, anything you want to add to that?","Efrain Rivera","No. Rod, the other thing I'd add to what Marty is saying is that in the short term, the pluses are dwarfing any negatives. And one of the things that was implicit in what Marty said was that you have an ability to underwrite pretty successfully within the PEO in a time when most insurance companies are struggling to figure out what their requirements are. And so in this window of time, PEOs have an advantage because they understand their cost structure, self-insured to some extent, and are able to go to market with a pretty clear offering. Over time, that could change. I would say that's a potential negative as the exchanges get up and running and then become, perhaps, pricing changes. But in the short term, we're certainly seeing -- reaping the benefits of that trend.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's helpful. And then one other question. When we spoke 3 months ago, we were inquiring about whether you think your payroll client base can show positive growth for the fiscal year. And you expressed confidence that, that could be achieved. How do you stand on that now? Do you feel more confident at this point that you can have growth in the number of payroll clients for fiscal '14?","Efrain Rivera","I think we feel reasonably confident. But again, I caveat all of that by saying we have to win our share in the third quarter and not lose more than our share in the third quarter and we're in the middle of that so...","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Any early signs on how that's going that you can comment on?","Martin Mucci","I guess I would just say that we're feeling continued positive -- real positive momentum on the sales forces kind of across-the-board, whether it's core payroll, SurePayroll, 401(k), HR outsourcing, all feeling a good momentum there that has continued from the first quarter right into the second.","Operator","The next comes from Sara Gubins, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You mentioned seeing some more client growth in this past quarter. Is there a sense that this is coming from any improvement on the new business formation front? Or is it better sales in existing small businesses?","Martin Mucci","I would say it's not very much from the new business. I would say that the negatives seem to be flattening out a little bit there where we were -- that was when we were down year-over-year on new business growth. So that seems to be flattening out. I'm not saying we're getting any wind behind us on new business growth yet, so I think that's still -- very slowly improving. It's more from, I think, some of the focus we've put on banking channels and -- for referrals and franchises and the CPA community. So that's where we're seeing more positive momentum from a sales perspective.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then separately, I was hoping to learn a bit more about the relationship with Kashoo. And could you give us any color of your ownership of it and whether or not you see a pathway to total ownership? And then also you mentioned that you thought it could help strengthen the relationship with CPAs. I was trying to understand that a bit better because it looks like maybe it could be a competing product with them?","Martin Mucci","Yes, we see it as an alternative -- let me take the last part first. That from a CPA perspective, I think what we got from research we had that they're constantly looking for alternatives to what they have today. And that if a client -- this is a simple accounting -- cloud accounting package that can help a business, a brand-new business, maybe get started. But as they build and get larger, they would move toward a CPA, and the CPAs can very easily work on the same Kashoo work on their accounting package with the client, which, of course, they like. So we're trying to do it, always encouraging the client who gets on the product to use their CPA, do the work in conjunction with their CPA because that's still an important relationship for us. So we think that the CPA, one, is looking for other choices and accounting packages, and especially for a brand-new business that's starting up, this might be a way to start them then they realize that they could go to an accountant and help them either with Kashoo's package, our package, or move to something else. I would say from the relation-- the investment standpoint, we made an investment into the company, a minority investment. And there's -- I think there's always an opportunity for future increase in investment. But right now, we're pleased with having an investment in them, having a white label product under Paychex Accounting Online that we offer, and see how it goes from here.","Operator","The next comes from Jim MacDonald, First Analysis.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Back to the ACA impact. What about the impact on your health brokered business, given the taxes that the ACA puts into place. Is that going to slow that growth?","Martin Mucci","Well, we're thinking, generally -- first of all, the opportunity is for us to get in front of clients and explain what all the requirements are and that we have some products that will help them. Second, I think we're always impact -- we're always thinking that if small businesses move more to the shops, to the exchanges, that could hurt us a little bit, that would be a negative for us because some of the small business would move to the exchanges. But again, right now, we're not seeing much of that because the exchanges are not really in very good shape and they're not necessarily set up, and the rates aren't necessarily that much better than what we can offer through various carriers and so forth. So I think in the longer term, if they get up and running and get efficient and have competitive rates, it could hurt us a little on the small end. However, we had started to focus already on a little bit more of our mid-market or larger-market clients with insurance. We have covered the gamut, but we have focused the expansion teams, the increase in salespeople, on the 50-plus market and that won't impact. If anything, that will drive more sales, I think, to us because we can give a very competitive offering. And remember that our offering helps integrate with payroll, it provides additional information. We help with the billing and we help you set up a client -- I'm sorry, a new employee and we also help you with COBRA. So I think there could be some -- there's some negative piece to it that we've talked about on the small end, but there's some positive piece I think on the mid-market in which we're also selling insurance in.","Efrain Rivera","And Jim, I think that everyone's feeling the fact that the ACA's tacking on some additional fees that clients have. So I don't think anyone's disadvantaged or advantaged in that process. We -- as Marty said, we knew the lower end of the market eventually will gravitate into an exchange that probably at the margin makes that a little bit more quick to happen. But they're -- but we've pivoted our sales force to address that, to position ourselves for that anyway.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. And the G&A this quarter seemed to be up a bit more than I would have expected. Any issues there?","Efrain Rivera","No. There's no issues whatsoever other than good ones. So -- the first is our IT spending was about where we expected it. We expected it to be a little bit higher in the first half of the year. It was up. And then the other part was we're just having a very strong selling season. We typically wouldn't call that out unless it was a bit above where we expected it to be and we just have to make provisions on the assumption that, that will continue throughout the year. So if we don't call it out, it's because it's about where we expected it. And as Marty's been saying now for 2 quarters, sales execution's been really strong. So those are the 2 buckets where it increased.","Operator","The next comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Calling in for Smitti. I was hoping you guys could just help us quantify the Hurricane Sandy impact. I think last year you mentioned maybe a negative 50 bp impact to payroll revenue. So would you say that the benefit this quarter has been approximately the opposite of 50 bp benefit positive impact?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I'd say it's 50 bps. That's our best estimate.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then heading into the year, you guys gave guidance around expecting EPS to being evenly split from the first half to the second half.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I guess now that you've had this strong first half, are you guys still expecting that same distribution?","Efrain Rivera","No, not quite. I think we're obviously a little bit ahead in the first half and we reiterated where we are in our EPS guidance for the year as I read it out. So we're still in the 8% to 9% range.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then maybe if we could just revisit buyback. So you guys had that authorization last year and then share count was ticking up. And now it's the second quarter in a row where you've done the buybacks. I'm wondering if there's anything in your thinking that's changed and whether you expect to continue this going forward?","Efrain Rivera","Look, I think that what we have done through the first 2 quarters is buy back opportunistically, primarily to offset dilution. Some quarters, we're a little bit more successful than others. And we'll do that through the balance of the year. Got no specific program purchases per se, but we'll look at opportunities to offset some of the dilution. We've had a pretty significant dilution over the last -- by our standards, over the last year or so, 18 months, and we're just trying to offset a bit of that.","Operator","The next comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citibank.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess I wanted to go back to the product road map, the comments on IT spending. If you could give us an update on key initiatives that you have coming up? And also remind us how much of the spend on all these multichannels in the recent past, how do you think of it in terms of onetime spend versus something you had to keep doing on an ongoing basis, what's the split there?","Martin Mucci","I think there's always going to be a consistent -- some level of consistent spend there. I think we had been on a higher end of some of the spend now. But as you capitalize it and amortize that, obviously, that takes over for some of the expense you had. So you end up with more expense on depreciation and the amortization of capitalized software and so forth. I think we're at a pretty steady rate. I think we had reached our peak kind of over the last year or so. And I think it will stay steady. I don't think it's going to go down a lot, but I don't -- you won't see it going up as much as it had. It was the only expense that has grown double digits over the last 4 or 5 years. And I think it'll stay relative low double digit or below kind of growth in the future. And so I don't know. There's some onetime, but I think there's a constant level of spend and it's just a matter of setting your priorities on where you spend most. The focus will continue to be on integration of all the products. You have a wide suite of products and so it'll be on integration, certainly continue to be on mobility. Although we feel very good where we are now with the mobility product being able to get it basically any of your information as an employer or an employee and being able to submit or edit payroll as well. So I think it's mobility. It's integration. And certainly, it's always about making it easy, so from a user interface standpoint, how do you continue to keep up with the trends of making things very easy and client-friendly to get at their information, when they want it and how they want it and do what they want.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's useful. So just to clarify, though, steady in -- you said steady in the low double digit. Were you referring to growth, in which case it would keep growing faster than revenues? Or are you saying steady as...","Efrain Rivera","Yes, yes, Ashwin. So the answer is we expect it to grow faster than revenue, but we expect other areas, obviously, ops -- operation expenses and G&A to offset part of that increase. The price of being in this game is to constantly spend in technology. And the game we're in increasingly is creating a suite of services that becomes the point that gets sticky for the customer. So payroll alone is not the only thing that many customer want. They want an integrated solution. So what you've got to do is invest in creating the technology, which Marty was just mentioning, to deliver that information in mobile fashion and give them access across all platforms to that information. So we anticipate that spending on IT will tend to grow at a faster rate than sales whereas spending on ops will grow at a slower rate.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think it'll be a continuation of what you've seen, even as when IT spend, we've mentioned this was probably more mid- to high single-digit increases -- growth increases, we always offset that. And so when we look at total expenses, we're always looking for some leverage in most everything we're doing, but that's in total. So where you drive productivity in one side, the technology spend will tend to be the higher end of the expenses.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Marty was saying mid- to higher teens. So yes, 15% to 20%, which was our peak.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. That detail is quite useful. The -- I guess, one other question I had was more of a clarification again. The payroll client count, that's the overall number, does include SurePayroll, right?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, it does.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And that part is increasing nicely and you're saying it's really the core is still sluggish.","Efrain Rivera","I didn't say any of that, but Sure is increasing nicely and overall we're increasing. We've increased in the first half of the year. But a caveat, for the third time, we need to get through the sales season to see where we end up.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right, right. Is there any early intel in terms of competitive dynamics with regards to the selling season [indiscernible]","Martin Mucci","No, I think it's a little too early for that, but we don't see, at least at this point, we don't see the environment any different, any more or any less competitive, than we have in the past. So it's a little bit early but we don't really -- haven't really seen much change in the competitive environment. If anything, I think we're feeling good about the progress we're making at this stage.","Operator","The next question comes from Joseph Foresi, Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So my first question here is just on -- I'm just trying to frame the demand environment. I know we've had a couple of years here where we're kind of slogging it out. But is this still currently a -- sort of a market share game? In other words, is it displacement and cross-selling just for the fact that the small business growth has been kind of mediocre?","Efrain Rivera","I think -- let me characterize it this way. So 2 answers to that, Joe. The first is I think there's a couple of glimmers that indicate that the market itself is growing a little bit. It's still early but we've got some data points that suggest it's getting better. So I don't think it's purely a market share game, but I think it's still primarily one. So that's the first part of it. But I think the second part of it, the second way to answer that is that, increasingly, what we have seen over the last year is that when you go in to talk to a client, they want an integrated solution and they want integrated access to the data. So over time, what we believe is that the person -- or I should say the company that can provide that suite of services the best will win in the marketplace. And not just payroll, payroll is important, but it's also payroll and integrated data also. And that's where we had really gotten much, much better in our sales execution efforts, both on HRS, core and mid-market. And so I guess that's the way I'd frame the market and the opportunity.","Martin Mucci","But I'd say -- just as Efrain said, there's some glimmer. I'd still say it's -- you could call it -- we could -- we would call it sluggish, but it's still -- there is some glimmer of some formation. And housing, I think, is still the one, as we've mentioned a few times, that looks like it's coming back in certain areas, and the housing gives us jobs all around that. So you're start -- as the inventories come down, new homes are going up. Prices are going up a little bit. Interest rates will be interest -- will be interesting on that. But it doesn't look like they're going to go up quickly or anything that would cause that to stall out, so.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. I mean, just to be clear, so we're not trying to extrapolate because I think people have asked you for data points on the selling season throughout the call. The glimmers you're talking about are more what you see on the macro side, not necessarily anything you're picking up on the selling season?","Martin Mucci","That's correct.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I figured I help you guys on that one. One last one for me. It -- and it's a very kind of tough one. But if you had to kind of break up your selling into displacement versus cross-selling versus kind of new business or selling into existing accounts, I'm not asking for percentages, but where does that scale weigh right now? I mean, how much of this new business is displacement? How much of it is cross-selling? How much is new business? And you can just rank them. You don't have to give any kind of particular percentage.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So I guess you really have to look at it by segments, Joe. Primarily what we're doing on the HRS, not exclusively, but HRS is selling into the base. So you can say it's cross-selling or up-selling or whatever you want to call it, right? On the core payroll side, traditionally, 50% of our sales are in new businesses. So that's the new. And then the remainder are -- we're in a competition with everyone else in the market. So if you weigh all of that, a lot of it's cross-selling and up-selling for which we have a large opportunity within the base. And then in core, it breaks out kind of half and half.","Operator","The next comes from David Togut, Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Marty, a couple of times, you've mentioned improved sales execution over the last couple of quarters. Can you bracket for us what bookings growth has been over the last couple quarters and compare it to what you saw in the previous fiscal year?","Martin Mucci","Well, think I would just -- I guess I wouldn't -- we don't necessarily give a percentage. But I would just say that it is certainly positive across-the-board over last year. It was in first quarter, and it is in second quarter. And so across-the-board, what they're doing is, and Efrain kind of just went through this in a sense of we're selling better into the base for the HRS products, 401(k), ASO and PEO. We're selling, I think, better in the additional products that we've brought on, and certainly, the ancillaries of time and attendance and HR administration into the mid market. So I would just say that it's -- I don't want to be overly enthusiastic, but we're feeling really good progress on how sales is performing kind of across-the-board. SurePayroll is very strong. And so when you look at kind of payroll, HRS, SurePayroll across-the-board, all of them are doing better. So -- and I think that's better execution. I think we've focused a lot better in things that we've gone after, and we've executed well on that. And I think that's probably the best I can give you. We don't necessarily go into percentages, but I think it's been positive and it's been consistent.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Without going into exact percentages, can you bracket for us whether growth is in the single digits or the double digits?","Efrain Rivera","It's good, David. We won't go any farther than that.","Martin Mucci","Yes, especially before selling season. I would wait.","Efrain Rivera","And it's been strong. So I'll just say that.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up. You highlighted the launch of Paychex Accounting Online. What was the date of the launch of that product? And can you quantify for us some of the sales you've seen from that product, client traction?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it's been very early. We just launched it within the last -- about 30 days ago. And so it's been a lot of interest. It's -- you sign up over the web. And we do have a team to support those sales and so forth, but it's basically sold right now over the web. And we're getting a lot of good interest in it. It's done by search more than anything and then some advertising, and we're just getting started. But I think what you're finding is it's a very competitive space right now, very interesting space, that you'll see a lot of players in that. And it's something we thought, as we've researched it the last couple of years, that it was a good thing to get into, and we thought Kashoo had a very strong product in a simple cloud accounting app basis. So we're just getting started, but we're getting a lot of good interest in it. And we think it'll help also lead, obviously, to payroll sales and integration in payroll sales, both the SurePayroll and core Paychex payroll as well.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Final question for me. As we look out to the next fiscal year, how are you thinking about your dividend payout ratio versus share repurchase in terms of overall capital allocation priorities?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I think, David, our position is that we'll first look at dividend increases before we look at share repurchases. But we'll have some element in the mix of share repurchase, at least to offset dilution. That's our thinking going forward.","Martin Mucci","But you -- and you could see that we're -- we've been pretty consistent on where we are from a dividend payout ratio. And I would expect -- it's a board decision, but I would expect that, that would remain pretty consistent.","Operator","The next comes from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I want to just ask on HRS services. Obviously, you increased the guidance there for that range. What's causing the surprise or where's the strength actually coming from better than your expectations?","Martin Mucci","I think it's across-the-board. 401(k) has been very strong. We went after expanding -- about 1.5 years ago, expanding our kind what we call large market, going after a little bit larger 401(k)s than we had in the past and in our base, and that's been very successful. And I think -- so 401(k) across-the-board has done very well in their growth. And then on the ASO and PEO side, we talked a little bit earlier why the PEO, I think, is certainly getting a bump from health care reform, and that's helping. But I think we also are executing a lot better in our PEO business. We put some new -- there's some new folks in there, some new plans and leadership and over the last couple of years, and that's really starting to pick back up and do well. And so I think with all the insurance confusion that's out there, I think people have been much more open to go toward the PEO, and that's helped us. And the ASO, I just think there's more and more regulations. I think as the economy gets slightly better, businesses are willing to spend a little bit more and also see the value of that product and how much you can -- it can help you with all the compliance and so forth that we offer. And we've been in it a long time. So I think it's just kind of -- it's all kind of coming together to hit our stride between execution and the environment.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on payroll services. Obviously, the growth rate was a little faster than, I think, our and Street expectations. Thinking about that longer-term, what's the right growth rate? Is 3% to 4% the right growth rate on a longer-term basis, or due to a little bit of client growth, little bit of pricing, we can actually see that more -- a higher number than that as we go forward?","Efrain Rivera","I think, Bryan, we need to kind of work through the remainder of the year. But I would just say, our internal expectation is that 3% to 4% is not a number we want to be at, and we think that there are probably a number of ways to get that above that. That's our guidance for the year. We'll walk through it and get a better sense. We've been feeling our way through this, coming off a year where we had just barely 2% for a number of reasons. We're really pleased with the acceleration, and we think -- we want to get it above 3% to 4%, put it that way.","Operator","The next comes from Kartik Mehta, Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And so, Marty and Efrain, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the SurePayroll business. And if you are seeing any more competition or more pricing competition? It seems like lots of cloud players out there, or people who want to be cloud players, wanting to get into the payroll business. And has that resulted in any more pricing competition?","Martin Mucci","I think you're -- specifically, Kartik, I missed that first part. It was on SurePayrolls, right?","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Yes.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I -- there have been some more players that you hear of, that start up I -- but right now, they're doing very well. They've continued to have great sales growth, and we're not seeing a lot of change in the -- from a pricing per unit standpoint at all. I -- they've been very effective in selling a lot of their -- it's web search and then they complete the sale over the phone, and they've done a good job. So we really haven't seen an impact on the pricing there.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then Marty, on the Kashoo business. Any thoughts about changing the price you charge for customers for that business model to try to gain some market share? And then is there a need for more investment in that business, to add any modules or other services that you think would give you a competitive advantage?","Martin Mucci","Well, on the pricing, I think it's pretty competitive right now. We're -- it's in that $25 to $30 range per month, and there are certain various promotions that go on. I -- so I think that's pretty competitive, very competitive with what's out there. And I think you're right. On the long term, we do see this as a growth opportunity for us. We've done everything around payroll. We've hooked almost every service around payroll and, I think, have down well and continuing to drive up the penetration of those products, 401(k), workers' comp, insurance, et cetera. When you kind of back up in that whole system of offerings and you look at accounting, now you've got a lot of other offerings that you could come off of that and begin to offer and expand, increased that penetration. Right now, we're just trying to build this base. We're at the stage of just getting started and saying, one, can we help clients get started with this; can we link them to payroll; can we build that client base? And then once the base is building at a good rate, then look to what you can add to it. But there's certainly some opportunities that we are continuing to look at to do that.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","So, Marty, will this just be sold over the Internet or will your payroll salespeople also sell it to accountants and you'll use that distribution channel as well?","Martin Mucci","Well, right now, it's going to be over the Internet, given the cost of the service and so forth. Plus, I think that, that seems to be the most effective way to get it, because you're getting brand-new businesses just as they're getting started. And so I think selling over the Internet, we're going to try that first. We're going to trial probably some telesales type of effort as well on that and direct call-in and so forth, and we'll try various ways. But right now, it's going to be mostly web-based search and then sell it all over the phone.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question, Efrain. Any thoughts on changing strategies for the float to maybe increase the yield on the portfolio, or do you stay where you are? It seems like we're going to have short -- pretty low rates for a while -- for some time now.","Efrain Rivera","I'd characterize it as a tweak. The -- yes, so I read what Bernanke said. And the notes I saw, post-call, were that they thought that short-term interest rates might increase by 25 bps by next summer. That's -- that wasn't sort of our thinking going into the call, but that's where he's -- what he's signaling. If you're in that environment, I would say there's a tweak to say go longer. So we'll look at that as we go through the year.","Operator","Next is Jeff Silber, BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just to continue the discussion on your interest on funds line. If I remember, at the beginning of the year, you talked about that line item being down. I think it was about 7% to 9%. Year-to-date, it's running roughly flat. You didn't change your guidance for the back half of the year. Is there something going on in the back half of the year that we need to be aware of, or do you think you're just being conservative?","Efrain Rivera","I think we're being a little bit conservative, Jeff. I will say this that the recent Fed pronouncements are literally a day old, so it's a little bit tough to incorporate all of that thinking into our back half. We don't expect material improvement because our -- we only replaced about 15% to 20% of the portfolio, so we've made a lot of those decisions already, so may not see a lot of the upside or, I should say, sounds like a lot of upside, but any modest upside during the remainder of the year. We'll look at the portfolio. And if there's any changes, we'll update next quarter. I think it really is more kind of what next year looks like. That's what the recent decisions will cause us to revisit.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And on the fund balances side, I know at the beginning of calendar year 2013, you had mentioned you had an influx of funds because of an increasing withholding. Is there anything going on at the beginning of calendar year '14?","Efrain Rivera","No, don't anticipate anything. So we're up 6% year-to-date. It's really just going to depend on client balances and number of clients in funds, so no structural changes. I'll call it expected.","Operator","Next comes from David Grossman, Stifel.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if we could go back to the HRS business. And could you just maybe help us better understand, at least in your own view, what the relative maturity of each of these different segments are that reside in that disclosure and, perhaps, the relative scale of each of those businesses.","Martin Mucci","Well, I think there's still a lot of room. The highest penetrated product would be 401(k), and that still has a lot of room. And we don't actually give out the product penetration anymore, but that would be the highest penetrated. And yet, still, we have a number of clients in our payroll base that do not have our 401(k) and give us a great opportunity there, but have a 401(k) but not with us. And so I think that's probably the highest penetrated. All of them, I think we've said, are certainly well under 20% penetrated into the payroll base, and the newer products, when I would say \"newer\" like insurance, health insurance are way down into single digits and offer us an awful lot of opportunity. So we spent an awful lot of time as an executive team, David, just looking and saying, there's a lot of room here for -- there's a lot of opportunity here for product penetration, and we try to find ways to continue to grow that. 401(k) was a great example. We went after larger market conversions early. And for 401(k), for many, many years actually, we just took brand-new plans. And so there's just a lot of opportunity in all of it. It's -- I think gives us a lot of runway for years ahead.","Efrain Rivera","Look -- and the fact that we don't specifically call it out, Marty saying, doesn't mean that we don't understand what the opportunity is. It's just that the opportunity is really large. And every quarter we go, we discover that there's other opportunities that we should be directing our attention to. And I think the 401(k) upmarket is a great example of an opportunity that -- an organic opportunity in the last year to 18 months that doesn't depend at all on our client base. Those are not current Paychex clients for payroll. They simply are new clients that we are adding because we have acquired a core competency that was adjacent to our -- that are adjacent to our initial core competency, which was doing payroll and 401(k) plans. So when we look at the opportunities in each of those segments, be it ASO, PEO, be it 401(k) or insurance, we just see a lot of runway before we ever would get to a point where there're -- where we saw we were saturating the client base. And I think the other thing, David, I would add is, that we've said this several times, that we really have a big advantage because of our client base and the fact that we see the market gradually moving towards a suite of services sale. And it's the best suite of services with the best integrated data that, over time, integrated access to the data that's going to win, especially in small and medium-sized businesses.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. So with that said, it probably takes 2 things, right? One is having a product set that is kind of truly integrated and meets those criteria. And then secondly, a sales force that can sell a bundle, which I think is a slightly different sale. So can you help us perhaps -- you can leave the technology piece out. I know you've talked a lot about that in the past. But on the go-to-market sales side, what have you done to tweak that sales organization to sell that bundle since it is really a different approach?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think, one, we've -- it's still -- to start with, most of the time, it's still going after the base and coming in behind it. And what we've done there is get much more specific on what each group is selling. So again, the 401(k) market was -- we had a lot of folks in 401(k) sales very good at selling brand-new plans, first time I ever had a 401(k), et cetera. Then we went more to kind of smaller but still conversions. Now we go to larger market conversions, it requires a different tenure, I think -- I guess I'd say of talent in the sales organization to sell a large market plan. And we also sell much more into financial advisors. So we'll go to a financial advisor who we would normally sell a plan to the client and then say you need a financial advisor and here's one you could talk to. Now we're building more relationships with the financial advisors, and there's an opportunity there to pick up even more business from the advisor, not just per client but maybe by advisor. So it's to us, for the most, it's changing some strategies to get much more specific on what you're trying to sell, and then look for the -- a different skill also, to some degree and experience. And we've been very successful on that, I think, is the biggest part. Then you'll see probably more of a shift of as we look at a client that comes in that might have more employees, that you go at that client with a full bundle. We're doing a little bit more of that now as opposed to just our traditional model of sell payroll and then sell everything else after on a kind of 30-day, 60-day, 90-day type of thing. So I think we're trialing a lot of different ways to sell it, to increase that opportunity.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And do you have any data points on the bundled sale?","Martin Mucci","No. I'd say it's still fairly early on that to say it. But I think the data point is when you're seeing the growth in HRS continue at double digits and 12% and numbers like that, it's showing continued great momentum. Because the client base isn't growing as quickly, obviously, over the last few years because of the economy, yet that HRS continues to drive into that product, into that base. I think that's the best data point I'd give you is that we're still seeing really solid growth there and bringing guidance up a little bit because of the execution.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay. And then just secondly, just going back to the rates. I mean, Efrain, when you look at the forward yield curves, any sense of when the rate comparison actually should go positive? I mean, should we see that? I assume -- you're obviously taking out the total return with the balance growth. But just the yield itself, should we see that turn positive then -- next year?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. You should see it turn positive next year. I can't give you numbers yet. We'll have to analyze what rolls off the portfolio, but we should go positive next year.","Operator","The next comes from Tim McHugh, William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, just on the PEO business. I guess how's the competition as you're growing that? Is there anything -- is it, I guess, significant, or do you feel like you've pulled ahead and that's part of the growth you're seeing? I guess just a little more color on what you're seeing there, given the growth you reported.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think -- no, I think that the competition, the competitive environment is probably as strong as it's ever been because there's been some consolidations over the last few years, and I think they've -- therefore, I think the competition is pretty strong. I do think that we've executed much better, as I said earlier. I think we've got a better focus. I think we've got a great product. We've also -- we improved the technology and the product there with probably 18 months ago or so and got a stronger product set. And so between the product set, the leadership and the execution and the last thing I was -- and the market, this -- the whole health care reform environment, I think all of those have led to us doing better in the market overall. So I think the market -- I think the whole PEO market is positive to begin with. But I also think between product technology and execution on sales and operations, we've done a lot better.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Is the bulk of the sales and -- the reason people are buying in the PEO, is it because the health care uncertainty and, I guess, the cost of health care? Or is it out to the kind of a holistic outsourced solution? I guess where -- I think of those as the 2 main reasons people might buy some of those. Where does it sit right now?","Martin Mucci","I think it's a little bit of both. I think, obviously, we sell it as -- there's a total outsourced solution, that we're giving you support from an HR perspective. And I think that the insurance side adds a strong additive to that. You start with the HR. But I think the fact that, right now, in particular, with so much concern and confusion over health care, I think that's kind of throwing -- it's kind of throwing people on the value set overboard to make the decision to go with it. So I think it's a combination. But I think, certainly, the health care confusion is helping a lot, drive you to the PEO versus an ASO.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then on the topic of exchanges got brought up on kind of on an ancillary basis a little bit on the call. I guess what's your outlook there? I believe you've launched your own kind of exchange solution for small businesses. What type of interest from clients? And is that an opportunity to grow the insurance brokerage business more quickly, or is that a threat as you look forward, I guess?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think it's -- on one side, it's going to be -- it's a little bit of both. On one side, it's the threat as we talked about on the small business side. I think at the exchanges, you assume, over the next year, they'll get in better shape and they'll offer competitive rates. I think that they will draw some small businesses to them. And I think that -- but I think, on our side, the partnership we did was actually more toward -- around the benefit card that we offer that allows you to combine flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts and reimbursements accounts altogether, because that's a big confusion point for our clients and their employees, and tying that then to a private exchange partner of ours. Right now, there's some confusion out there now because there's -- but with some changes in the flexible spending account rules as to whether you could do tax deferred or tax -- yes, I guess I'd say tax deductible, really, kind of payments into these plans. And that's -- so those rules are kind of changing right now, and we're trying to work through that. But generally, I'd say the exchanges are going to be a little bit of a negative for us. But overall, because of the way we'll partner, I think it'll be positive or a nonevent in the long run.","Operator","The next comes from Mark Marcon, R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just wondering, with regards to the strength that you're seeing on the core, could you talk a little bit about where you're seeing that specifically in terms of really small end? I'm talking about sub-7s versus your traditional core versus MMS.","Efrain Rivera","Mark, there really isn't a significant change from prior quarters. We were -- we've seen strength basically across all of the segments that we competed in payroll.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Any regional differences?","Martin Mucci","Not -- I would say a little bit. We're -- I think southeast and west, I think where the housing, that's helping a little bit, give us a little strength there as the housing is coming back a little bit there, the new home construction and so forth. But that's helping on the new business side. But other than that, not a big difference.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then as it relates to the integrated and bundled solutions, can you talk about the new clients that you're getting? Like is there a greater percentage that are utilizing or buying upfront a bundled solution, or is it pretty much the same?","Martin Mucci","I'd say it's pretty much the same at this point. I don't think you're -- I think with the economy the way it is, even though our selling is moving more toward that, you're still seeing people be a little bit cautious and maybe buying in over time additional products. It's still been -- it's still we're seeing, generally, you buy something, you build some confidence with them and then you can sell on to the next -- the value of the next product and so forth. Now with some clients you can go in right upfront and say, \"Look, I can sell you an ASO offering because you're a client that has a lot of turnover.\" You're a restaurant or a service organization that has a lot of turnover. You have a lot of issues with whether employees are exempt or non-exempt. It depends on the client. But generally, I don't think it's changed too much yet, overall.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then with regards to the pickup are -- how much of it -- of that would you attribute to the improved product relative to improvements in sales, both in terms of leadership and training?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think it's a little bit of both, I think, certainly, we've had great execution and leadership. I think there's a lot of new leadership in the team. I think they're doing very well, and they're continuing to drive, I think, a real accountability and commitment. We've always had that, but I think it drives it even more. And they're giving them a lot of support in the field. But I also think, certainly, the product having service satisfaction numbers at an all-time high and continue to be there, our operation teams, that really gives them a value to sell and then you get more referrals that way. And certainly, the technology, the mobility platform, we're just seeing an increasingly number of clients that are using the mobility platform, their employees and the clients, whether they're gaining -- getting information, getting their pay stubs. And all of that starts to give you not only better value for referral to sell, but also it improves the retention as well.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And you said that the client satisfaction is at all-time high, and you also mentioned that -- earlier that retention is near record levels. Could you give us a specific number in terms of the retention?","Martin Mucci","I think we said on the retention, it was -- at our highest levels, it was over 81. It was over 81, which would be our highest -- I think that's the last number we gave out.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then are you also benefiting from a reduced number of companies going out of business just because...","Martin Mucci","Absolutely, but that's flattening out now. That was a big improvement over the last couple of years. And now, that's not as much the issue anymore, that -- we're not gaining as much on that.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So relative to a year ago, that's probably about the same?","Martin Mucci","Yes. Well, even a little less. Like improvement from those going out of business is certainly less improvement, I guess I'd say, than last year.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then with regards to -- just to wrap up on one thing I wasn't certain on. The -- just sequentially, going from Q1 to Q2, you had the exact same number of processing days in Q1 as Q2?","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then finally, as we think about the tech spend, what are the areas that you think you need to improve further? How should we think about that and kind of the roadmap going forward? Like where do you think the biggest opportunities are?","Martin Mucci","I think it's always -- to me, it's always integration of all your products, making it easier to integrate. It's -- we've introduced, in the mid-market space, some kind of the integrated solution of people, for example, a place where it's just easier from any -- whether you're in time and attendance, HR administration or payroll, that you can easily pull an icon down for people and make all your changes very quickly, kind of in a pop-up screen, and then it'll fill in all 3 of those services. It's always going to be about making though -- whatever the client needs easier and more integrated across the multitude of products that we have. So integration of products, ease of use, user interface and mobility will be our continued focus. And then, of course, as we acquire or do things like Kashoo, it'll be how do we integrate those more and more into our product set, so anything we buy and expand, how do we integrate those more into our product set as well. We'd like any client to take full product suite, obviously, and make it very easy for them to move between products and look at the experience as one total product.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","What percentage of the clients are on the platforms that would enable that easy integration?","Efrain Rivera","The vast majority.","Martin Mucci","Yes.","Efrain Rivera","The vast majority, Mark.","Martin Mucci","Yes.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, just with regards to the new sales on the core. Of the 50% of the clients that aren't brand-new businesses, they're obviously doing something from a payroll perspective. Has there been any shift in terms of who you're taking clients from? It would seem that just as the technology investment goes up, it makes it more and more difficult for some of the locals to keep up.","Martin Mucci","Yes. We've seen that pretty consistently that more local players -- but -- and I think we've done about the same as we always have with the other national competitor, maybe a little better lately, but that's pretty close. They take some and -- from us, and we take some from them. And -- but the regional players, it's more difficult for them to have the product suite, the breadth of products, as well as the technology and the mobility platform, which is becoming so much more popular now.","Operator","Then the last question today comes from Tien-tsin Huang, JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a few quick questions, I hope, just the acquisition side. I heard the dollar questions. But how's the performance of some of these acquisitions going? Are they like myStaffingPro? Are they performing above, below plan? Any kind of anecdotes there?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I would say they're performing at or above where we expected. It's still fairly early, but we're -- not only from their organic standpoint, themselves, but also tying them into us. We're feeling pretty good. We're pretty careful. We look at a lot and acquire a few, and then we are very tight on the integration and the work and the execution work. We follow it very closely. So all of them are doing as well or better than the business cases that we put forth.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. Just a quick question, just around data, following up of the last question. Just -- have you seen any change in the way your clients are inputting their payroll data into the systems? Any shift there or interesting trends to call out?","Martin Mucci","I would just say that I think -- the -- they're probably more online. But the interesting thing with us is we offer that dedicated payroll specialist to you. And this week, you may -- and we really encourage the fact that this week, we may call you -- the payroll specialist who's dedicated and knows your business will call you and get your information and work with you. The next week, you may want to do your own payroll online and then you may want call them with a question. The next week, you could do it on your mobile phone. So we are seeing more interest in online and -- but still with that dedicated specialist. So they don't -- they can do it but they have help whenever they need it, if they want to do it. But we're really at work to give them their freedom to do what they want, when they want, kind of where they want. And so we offer them that dedicated person, and yet, they have all the opportunity. So we've seen online usage and input increase a little bit.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good to know. Last one, just the -- on just back to float. I caught the conservatism comments. But as we step into the next quarter or the following quarter, float balances, I guess, should come in a little bit, given some of that tax changes? Just trying to make sure -- or I guess, next quarter, any reason why it should step down sequentially?","Efrain Rivera","No, it shouldn't.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It shouldn't, right?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. But a caution, Tien-tsin, part of the mental calculation that I'm doing when I get asked that question, is how much of the 15% to 20% of the portfolio is rolling off in a given quarter. So that affects what my answer is going to be with respect to the -- with respect to where we see interest rates. So we've invested a lot of the funds that we expected to roll off at this point. We have a tranche coming in spring. And then the question is whether it really makes a dime's worth of difference for the projection for the remainder of the year.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. So the roll-off is the key. The float balance change shouldn't be that volatile.","Efrain Rivera","No, no. That's right.","Operator","There are no other questions, sir.","Martin Mucci","Okay. At this point, we'll close the meeting. If you're interested in replaying the webcast, it will be available till approximately January 20.","I thank you for the -- taking the time to participate in our second quarter press conference call and for your interest in Paychex, and we wish you all a very happy holiday season.

Sir you may begin.","Martin Mucci ","Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release call and webcast. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2015. Our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussions and analysis for the results of the quarter will be available in the next few days, our earnings release and 10-Q will be available on our investor relations page at Paychex.com.","This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our web site for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review highlights for the second quarter related to sales operations and product development. Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. And then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions or discussion.","We made good progress across all major product lines during the second quarter. Compared to second quarter of last year, payroll revenue advanced 4% as a result of growth in client base and revenue per check. HRS revenue grew at double-digit rates in the second quarter once again led by our success in selling HR outsourcing solutions to our clients, and total service revenue grew 7%.","We continued to experience solid results and momentum across our sales organization with double-digit growth in revenue sold compared to last year. Our team\u2019s selling approach continues to produce results by introducing the full suite of products that Paychex can offer our clients upfront.","We are encouraged by this momentum as we enter our main selling season right now. Our execution and service operations also continues to be excellent as demonstrated by client satisfaction results and retention level that remain consistent with recent highs. The employees in our service organization have done a great job as we move to more flexible service options with Paychex Flex including the 7\/24 service.","We expanded our human capital management product suite again with the recent launch of our integrated Paychex Flex Time and Paychex Flex benefits administration modules, these are two of the newest modules for cloud based HCM platform. Paychex Flex Time is a market leading time and attendance cloud-based solution, provides real-time data access and is designed to be exceptionally easy and intuitive to use for our clients, it gives employers unprecedented visibility and control over labor scheduling, tracking, and reporting.","Paychex Flex benefits administration provides employers with a robust customizable system built to improve employee productivity, communication, and decision-making and allowing complete oversight and control of employee information effectively to manage our company's benefit plans.","We also have best-in-market mobility offerings in our opinion for both administrative users and employee self-service that allow access to our HCM suite from a single mobile application. We continue to receive positive reviews for our Flex platform that we\u2019re very proud of as evidenced by our recognition from the Brandon Hall Group excellence awards for an advancement in workforce management technology for small and midsize businesses and PC Magazine's recent review referring to Paychex Flex as excellent and calling it more robust and scalable than many of the competitors\u2019 platforms they reviewed.","Turning to the Affordable Care Act, last fiscal year, we launched our Paychex employer shared responsibility service to assist clients navigating the healthcare reform. Our ESR product includes monthly monitoring with automatic alerts as well as year-end reporting, and we are pleased with the continued level of client acceptance that we have experienced.","We have increased our implementation and support spending to address the increased demand that we\u2019ve received for ESR. I appreciate the great hard work and dedication of this ESR team helping our clients through this first year of complex ACA requirements. Our Paychex insurance agency was named as the business insurance magazine\u2019s list of best places, the work and insurance for the very first time. This is a notable recognition, and I am very proud of the agency employees and the growth we've seen in the insurance business.","On December 2, we announced our planned acquisition of Advanced Partners based just outside of Cleveland Ohio. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity Advanced Partners present and the experience and successful leadership team that will be joining Paychex. They offer customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services that include payroll processing, administration, and invoicing.","The staffing outsourcing business is a growing industry that serves many small and midsize staffing firms, which is an ideal fit for us at Paychex. Also given Paychex's extensive product suite, financial strength, and access to capital, we can help expand advanced partner\u2019s product offering and accelerate its growth. This acquisition will close shortly. We remain committed to adding additional value for our shareholders with our dividend at $0.42 per share. ","We maintain a strong dividend yield, one of the highest in the industry. The Paychex stock repurchase program remains in place and we have acquired over a million shares of common stock in the first six months of fiscal 2016. And in summary, I am very pleased with the continued strong execution of our sales and service teams, our product strength, and financial performance, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team. ","I will now turn on the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Marty and good morning to you all. I just want to remind everyone that during today\u2019s conference call we will make some forward looking statements that refer to future events and thus involve risk referred to the usual disclosures. As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2016 represented a continuation of the solid start we had to the year. ","I\u2019ll cover the highlights and provide greater detail in certain areas and then wrap with the review of our 2016 outlook. I\u2019ll add some comments on second half guidance, so as I get mid way through my comments you will start to hear those. Total revenue grew 7% for the second quarter, 8% for the six months to $722 million and $1.4 billion respectively. ","Total service revenue also grew 7% for the second quarter and 8% for the six months to $711 million and $1.4 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% for the second quarter and 7% for the six months to $11 million and $22 million respectively. These changes were driven by higher average in best interest rates I should say, and higher average investment balances.","Expenses increased 5% for the second quarter and 6% for the six months, primarily in compensation related costs and strong growth in the PEO. The increase in compensation related costs was driven by higher wages and performance based compensation costs. Operating income net of certain items increased 9% for the second quarter and 10% for the six months at $283 million and $568 million respectively.","We maintained strong operating margins of 40%, but anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance of approximately 38%. The second half of the fiscal year consistent with prior years is expected to result in lower margins, primarily due to higher selling and operations costs, which are variable and more detail on that later. Net income increased 9% to $189 million for the second quarter and 16% to $398 million for the six months. Diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.52 per share for the second quarter and 17% to $1.10 per share for the six months.","The six-month period was positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to prior year revenues that was recognized in the first quarter. When we exclude this impact, net income and diluted earnings per share would have risen 10% and 12% respectively. Let us turn to payroll revenue. Payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the second quarter and six months to $427 million and $860 million respectively. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check.","Revenue per check grew as a result of price increase net of discounting. Checks per client really didn't benefit payroll revenue. HRS revenue increased 11% to $284 million for the second quarter and 13% to $564 million for the six months. This increase reflects strong growth in both clients and worksite employees at Paychex HR services, which includes our ASO and PEO products. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our ESR product that assists clients with healthcare reform and an increase in health and benefits applicants together with higher average premiums and clients in our workers comp insurance product.","Our HR administration and time and attendance products contributed to the growth through robust sales with these solutions. Retirement services revenue benefited from growth in a number of plans and an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds, retirement services revenue growth was all set by pricing impacts in the respective prior year period. Let\u2019s look at investments and income.","Our goal as you know is to protect principle and optimize liquidity. On the short term side, primary short-term investment vehicles were bank demanded positive accounts, high-quality commercial paper and variable rate demand notes. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality in municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. Government Securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of approximately 3.3 years.","Our combined portfolios have earned an average return of 1.1% for both the second quarter and the six months. On December 6, 2016 as you all are aware the Fed raised federal funds range by 25 basis points. The first interest rate hike in nearly a decade. We expect the impact for the balance of the fiscal year will be modest.","Let\u2019s take a look at our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $930 million. Funds held for clients as of November 30, 2015 were $3.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they average $3.7 billion for the quarter and $3.8 billion for the six months. Out total available for sale INVESTMENTS including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $34 million as of November 30, compared with net unrealized gains of $14 million as of May.","Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $1.9 billion, reflecting $304 million in dividends paid during the six months and $63 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 39%. Cash flows from operations were $420 million for the first six months or 4% increase from the prior year. This change was a result of higher net income on cash flow from operations offset by fluctuations in working capital. The fluctuations in our working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, and income taxes.","Now I\u2019d like to turn to fiscal 2016 guidance. Let me remind you first that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions and net guidance for the full-year is unchanged from the previous quarter. I will reiterate our full year ranges and then give some color on the back half of the year.","Payroll service revenue anticipated to remain in the range of 4% to 5%, HRS in the range of 10% to 13%, total service revenue in the range of 7% to 8%, and net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Please note that the range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year, excluding the impact of the net tax benefit discussed above will be approximately 36%.","Our interest on funds held for client and operating margin are expected to be consistent with prior guidance. Now, current guidance doesn't include the announcement by the fed of about 25 basis point change in rates. This is going to equate to approximately $1 million after tax for the remainder of this fiscal year.","On the call, I will talk a little bit about why it may be more modest than you assume, but I would just say to preface that conversation that much of that impact won't be start to be felt until January and then it will be modest. Our guidance also does not include any expectation of future increases. We don\u2019t look at forward rates to determine what guidance should be, we simply make an assumption once the fed is active. There obviously is a chance that the fed will continue to raise. We will update guidance when that happens.","Full year guidance, currently excludes the impact of the advanced partners acquisition that Marty referenced earlier and which we expect to close shortly. It is not expected to impact earnings in the current fiscal year, meaning it will not be dilutive in this year, neither will it be accretive in the balance of the fiscal year. I\u2019ll describe separately the impact of advance shortly.","So, while it isn\u2019t our typical practice to provide specific guidance on quarters, we do want to be as transparent as possible and provide you with some color on third and fourth quarter this year. Payroll revenue growth for the third quarter is anticipated to be at the lower end of the guidance range. While payroll revenue growth in the fourth quarter, we anticipate to be at the higher end of the range. As we stated in previous calls, the fourth quarter will benefit from one additional processing day this year. This was the case in the first quarter, as you all remember.","HRS revenue growth for the third quarter is anticipated to fall below the low end of the full year guidance range as we indicated in previous calls. I call that out and when we started the year. This is a result of strong third quarter and the prior year resulting from very strong PEO performance and we had benefited from pricing in our retirement services businesses, while both are doing fine. They just simply don\u2019t - are not as strong as they were in the prior year.","For the fourth quarter, we expect HRS revenue growth will be within the full year range. In addition, we anticipate, as is typically the case, higher selling expenses in the second half of the year, but this year given the strength of our sales performance in the first six months of the year, we believe that selling expense will be higher than we had planned. We also anticipate higher operations expense due to stronger sales that I just mentioned and also very, very strong demand for our ACA compliance solutions.","So, you will feel much of that in the third quarter. Again, current year guidance is not changed. So, as I just mentioned the guidance that I discussed doesn\u2019t include any impact from advanced partners. So, when we close this is what we anticipate. For the balance of the year, we believe that the acquisition will contribute approximately 1% to payroll revenue growth and approximately 1.5% to HRS revenue growth. That\u2019s in the balance of the year, second half.","That impact will be, primarily will be split more towards the fourth quarter then the third quarter because we anticipate that will only recognize two months of revenue in Q3. So, the waiting will be a little bit more towards the fourth quarter. And we anticipate that additional expenses, operating expense from the acquisition will offset revenue in the balance of this year, won\u2019t be dilutive, won\u2019t be accretive, will essentially be neutral.","So, I hope that was clear and with that I\u2019m going to turn it back to Marty for questions.","Martin Mucci","Thanks Efrain. At this point, we will now open the call to your questions or comments. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies, your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg","Hi good morning guys, happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Same to you.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks. Thanks. I wanted to start with a question on share buyback, I don\u2019t think you guys repurchased any shares in the quarter and I believe you\u2019ve got about 100 million left on the authorization. So, wanted to just get a sense of whether that was because you see some additional M&A opportunities at size in the pipeline beyond advanced partners or did you just find the price of the stock not attractive enough or any other factors at work there? ","Efrain Rivera","Hey Jason that\u2019s a good question, I think I would get it bad upside the head if I said the stock price wasn\u2019t attractive. ","Jason Kupferberg","[You are] very, very honest with us Efrain. ","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I try to. We purchase opportunistically, so that\u2019s part of what our plan is. You know on the M&A front, I think there is an element of that advance was a nice acquisition, but I would say as I had been saying now for a number of months and finally we have some evidence of this, the pipeline is robust. So, we see a lot of opportunities for M&A in spaces we like at prices we like. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of all those factors.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And so just as a follow-up, I guess as a two part question, as we go into that key year end selling season, how do you feel you are set up with the product set, sales force capability, should we expect a double digit sales growth that you\u2019ve been seeing to continue, and then just along with that any macro comments about new business creation and general hiring trends that you would like to share?","Martin Mucci","Yes, this is Marty Jason. I think we\u2019re feeling very good. We\u2019ve got great sales momentum. It has continued Q1 and Q2 double-digit par growth, and we would expect that to continue. This is a really important quarter obviously for us from a sales perspective, but we\u2019re going in with great momentum, and in particular in the mid market, very strong in the mid market and this is something that the product development work and the technology has been so important for Flex, and we\u2019re really seeing that payoff now. We\u2019re really seeing very strong results on the mid market, even as competition is out there pretty consistently and we\u2019ve talked about that, we\u2019re really seeing very positive results from a growth perspective in what\u2019s sold. So, we\u2019re going and feeling good about it. We feel like the product work that we\u2019ve done and some of it here this last quarter is when we introduced really the fully integrated time and attendance and a benefitted administration into Flex, positions us extremely well for this selling season and frankly ongoing future quarters.","Jason Kupferberg","And just the new business creation and small business hiring? ","Martin Mucci","New business - yes, I am sorry, yes in fact our sales from new businesses is up, quite a bit stronger than last year, so while the small business index would say that it is pretty consistent from an employment growth, I would say sales to new businesses are up a bit. So, we are feeling pretty good about that. I wouldn\u2019t say it is a huge surge, but it is certainly consistent and up a few points from last year at this time. So, I think that\u2019s very positive. ","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, I appreciate it. Have a good holiday.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Danyal Hussain","Hi good morning Marty and Efrain. Thanks for taking my questions.","Efrain Rivera ","Hi, Dan.","Danyal Hussain","Just high level one about Advance Partners and understanding it hasn\u2019t closed yet, but when we are looking out to fiscal 2017 and beyond, can you just give us a sense for what is the sort of margin profile looks like whether it is, if it tucks right in whether we can expect it to be further in line with the company average?","Efrain Rivera ","Well this is a good question, as you know it was interesting about advance, now I\u2019m going to exclude purchase accounting because that will obviously impact it, but if you look at it from an EBITDA margin, what was really unusual about the business was it was pretty comparable to where Paychex was which is saying something. I mean we look at lot of acquisitions, we run into very few that have very solid growth, very solid margins. They\u2019ve built a great business, not a flash in the pant, they\u2019ve been at it for almost 20 years with the strong track record of growth. ","Martin Mucci","Yes. We feel, obviously very good about the opportunity as well. So, not only is it a good margin business, but as Efrain said, the leadership team there is staying with us and being part of Paychex and they\u2019ve built it over time I think very carefully and very strategically and certainly very profitably. So, we think it\u2019s going to fit in extremely well, and we think that with our access to capital and product, we\u2019ll be able to accelerate in distribution. We\u2019re going to be able to accelerate their growth even more.","Danyal Hussain","Got it thanks, and then just a question on Flex, so I think Efrain you mentioned in the past that Flex constitutes the majority of new sales, but you\u2019re not mandating client migration over the Flex, is there a point where you can eventually stop offering some of the core products and really push the Flex product more to new sales, and then looking a couple of years from now, is there a reasonable timetable for when you expect majority of clients will have ruled over and then what impact you might see from a retention of margins?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think - at this point, we are not forcing it. I think we are doing it the way we had hoped, which is, this is attracting new clients and accelerating those sales by the way to new clients and it\u2019s attracting current clients to come over. So, we\u2019re presenting that if you want -- you have certain needs from the product that if you want to migrate over you can, we\u2019re not pushing that too hard yet and we\u2019re not necessarily putting it kind of a drop dead date on migrations. It\u2019s always better to be on the newest platform, but frankly the existing platform is satisfying a lot of needs for existing clients and many of them don\u2019t like to move. So, I think that\u2019s - we don\u2019t have a certain date, but we are going to handle it kind of carefully and we are going let the clients at this point do probably most of the moment and we\u2019re feeling good about that. Certainly the new sales, the majority, particularly in the mid-market are all on Flex and that\u2019s going extremely well.","Efrain Rivera","The other thing I would add Daniel is just to put it in context, if I exclude sure and frankly if I include it doesn\u2019t really change what I\u2019m about to say 90+ percent of our clients are on either Flex or on Sure\u2019s platform, which frankly is the hybrid of core Advance and their own platform. So it\u2019s not a huge part of the base, obviously we are selling primarily midmarket clients on the new platform, yes.","Danyal Hussain","Got it, and then maybe a quick modeling question if I could, you mentioned retirement services impacted the growth rate I guess over the trailing four quarters. Could you just quantify that?","Martin Mucci","I didn\u2019t catch the first part, if I was \u2026","Danyal Hussain ","The retirement services, you I think change pricing, [indiscernible]\u2026","Martin Mucci","Yes, yes, it\u2019s just, that\u2019s basically what's causing the growth rate to drop a bit in addition to PEO, I won\u2019t quantify it any more than that, but we periodically take pricing in different segments of the business. HRS is a little different than Payroll where, Payroll it\u2019s pretty typical every year, HRS we look at different products and try to gauge where market has decided to take some of those actions last year and didn\u2019t repeat this year.","Danyal Hussain","Perfect. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","You\u2019re welcome. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from S.K. Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","S.K. Prasad Borra","Thanks for taking my questions, Marty if you could just [indiscernible] as you are heading to the selling season this quarter. How is the balance in comparison to last year? Can you share any insights on the [indiscernible]","Martin Mucci","So, S.K if I heard your question, sorry I know you\u2019re traveling, the question was set up for the selling season, compared to last year how we feel about that was that what you asked?","S.K. Prasad Borra ","Exactly that.","Martin Mucci","Okay yes, sorry just couldn\u2019t make it out. The - I feel very good about. I mean when you\u2019re carrying the kind of momentum, the good thing about selling season when you're heading into it is, how did you kind of start the year and particularly Q2 for that\u2019s kind of the beginning of it as you get into October and November is very good. So when you\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in par we had an increase in sales reps, but it was pretty small single-digit kind of increase that we normally have. To see double-digit and what we\u2019re selling in the par revenue that we\u2019re selling consistently in Q1 and Q2 we feel good about Q3. And about the selling season now you never know till you are kind of through January, but we feel very good about it, we got full product suite. We got full onboard of reps of sales reps, we got very consistent driving leadership that\u2019s there. So, everything is very favorable for what we feel will be a very good selling season, great momentum going in.","S.K. Prasad Borra ","Thanks Martin and next one probably on capital allocation, you talked about the pricing and pipeline [indiscernible] now more it looks like you do more M&A compared to say terms like special dividend?","Efrain Rivera","I don\u2019t know if more M&A it was always difficult to talk about a pipeline that no one saw except me, or Marty and I, but I think I would say the margin I wouldn\u2019t say will be on an accretive or in acquisition tier here. But I said the margin we have more things lined up closer to being executed than we have in the past. So, you\u2019ll see it, now just before that gets misinterpreted they\u2019re primarily tuck-in, I would say that that advance is a good example of the kinds of things that we\u2019re looking at we\u2019re not looking at large scale transformative M&A. But there are better opportunities out there and we\u2019re looking at opportunities to fill out what products set and tuck-in to existing businesses.","S.K. Prasad Borra ","Okay, the last one was obviously large debate on topic around the fee and what kind of margin [indiscernible] larger solutions. Can you just from your view point what are the margins such if you are producing is it actually margin in the long-term, do you have to take a hit on the near-term?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, this is the perennial question. I think S.K. look we try to balance it, obviously if we can get much faster growth and sacrifice a little bit of margin, we\u2019d look at that. But the life doesn\u2019t present those need dichotomies, a lot of what we look at is are acquisitions that we think at least won\u2019t be dilutive to our margins when we run across businesses that that we think have good growth prospects and I point to Payroll as an example of that where when we initially bought it was dilutive to margins and now it\u2019s catching up to our margins.","If we have a chance to improve the margins then we\u2019ll take a bit onto to get something that will improve growth and help us to improve and we could improve the margins over time.","S.K. Prasad Borra ","And then I just I was asking question on [indiscernible] and the margins you\u2019re getting from those solutions?","Efrain Rivera","We\u2019re just getting from mid-cap partners. Yes I\u2019d just say if I heard your question correctly that they\u2019re on an EBITDA basis pretty close to Paychex corporate margins.","S.K. Prasad Borra ","Thanks Marty. Thanks Efrain. Happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Okay, thanks.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, same to you. ","Operator","Our next question comes David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, this is [Rina Kumar] for David Togut.","A - Martin Mucci","Hi Rina[ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, could you just walk us through the largest drivers to your 80 basis points operating margin expansion this quarter?","Martin Mucci","This quarter, I would say lot of that was just primarily driven by a lower operating expense in the quarter. So we went into the quarter with a certain expectation around what we needed in terms of operating expenses came out a bit a little bit later than we anticipated that\u2019s really the primary driver.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, could you quantify net price increases are you realizing in both Payroll and HR services this year?","Martin Mucci","I won't go any further than calling out what we typically say that on payroll we\u2019re getting 2% to 4% price increase where you can assume that\u2019s in that range. We don\u2019t typically call out HRS, because it varies year-to-year. So, we\u2019re getting some price increase it\u2019s not certainly as good as I mentioned on a call as what we got last year. The other thing I would say to Rina is, one of the things that\u2019s occurring, particularly on the Payroll side is with the sales force able to sell more full-featured packages, especially under 50 you get some mix benefit too. So all of those things help our revenue per client picture.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. Thank you and happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Kartik Mehta","Hey Marty. Hey Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Hi Karthik.","Kartik Mehta","Hey Efrain you talk a little bit about Advanced Partners, is this an acquisition or an industry that you think you have to build scale to really benefit from this, or is this, you would like to see what you have and then determine if you want to take the next step. But further consolidating?","Martin Mucci","I think if you mean by consolidating acquiring more I think, I mean we feel good this was a really good fit for us. As Efrain mentioned we had a big pipeline that we look at and that we look at this company here they are outsourcing support Payroll fund and funding support to small and midsize staffing companies like 7,500 staffing companies placing 200,000 times a year. This is a nice business that there's a number of - there's a few businesses that do this, but nobody as much I think to this scale and have done it very thoughtfully over the years. I think as we look at the business we've got clients with staffing companies that I think are great opportunities for the funding side of the business for them and I think we've got a lot of products that we could offer to their clients I think this is a good fit we\u2019re going to see how this goes, but we\u2019re always looking to say hey if it make sense both from our standpoint and from theirs as well from their leadership. I think there maybe some count consolidation efforts that are available out there.","Kartik Mehta","Marty, I know this is a fairly small acquisition, compared to the overall Paychex, does this change the risk profile is this acquisition change or risk profile of the acquisitions you\u2019ve looked at and - compared to the acquisitions you\u2019ve looked at in the past?","Martin Mucci","I don\u2019t think so, I think we\u2019re always looking for, as Efrain said this has got a good strong margin to it that's close to ours it's got a nice solid growth. I don't think it really changes the risk profile much, I think one of the great things that they did frankly was had very good risk policies and procedures to be sure. This is a bit of a trickier business to be sure you're handling the right risk and you\u2019re taking on the right risk and they just done a done a remarkable job. And I think with our risk team, our risk management team working with them I think we can help that even more with more tools and more information. So I don\u2019t think it really changes the risk profile at all.","Kartik Mehta","And then Efrain, on the flow portfolio, one, any changes you\u2019re going to make as it seems though the Fed is probably going to continue increasing rates, and two is that, 25 basis points about $2 million to net income, is that the right way to look at it on an annual basis or is there something different this time around that might mute the increase you would get in net income from rate increases?","Efrain Rivera","Okay, two good questions. So Kartik the simple answer is that it depends on the shape of the yield curve and if the yield curve steepens then you have one portfolio strategy approach and if the yield curve stays relatively flat you have another. So we look at that in the spring so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t say definitively, hey, this is what it look like in 2017. In addition I would like to see if the Fed does do something in the spring. It will certainly aid the portfolio, just the question is how much and how we configure the portfolio.","On the $2 million, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s far off Kartik. The only trick and the reason why I call out $1 million is that, number one, we don\u2019t really expect to see too much benefit except through, I\u2019m sorry until sometime in January. It\u2019s not the best timing because our balances increase significantly in December and beginning of January by that time we\u2019ll be passed the peak of our balance. So we don\u2019t get quite as much by the time you\u2019re talking February before we start to see a lot of the - some of the benefits you don\u2019t have that many months left in the year. So that\u2019s part of what\u2019s guiding.","And the final thing I would say is that if you\u2019re looking at for example money market rates and what banks are doing, the effects of the interest rate increase are really slow rolling. They will eventually get there but it\u2019s kind of a slow role at this point.","Kartik Mehta","Yes, thanks, Efrain, I really appreciate it.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, you\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Martin Mucci","Hi, Gary.","Efrain Rivera","Good morning.","Gary Bisbee","Just following up on that last one on rates, so did I hear you right you are not including in the guidance the $1 million benefit you think you will get from the Fed hike and if I did hear that right why not?","Efrain Rivera","No, I guess what I was trying to say was that, it doesn\u2019t alter the guidance significantly. I am calling it out, it\u2019s about $1 million. It just doesn\u2019t change significantly where we are at in terms of the guidance on interest rates.","Gary Bisbee","Gotcha. Okay. And I know you don\u2019t assume any future increases.","Efrain Rivera","Right.","Gary Bisbee","But if - in the guidance, but if the Fed did view what the Fed folks say which is in next calendar year at 1.375%, I understand that it depends on the shape of the yield curve but you do have about half the float in overnight stuff that we value pretty quickly. So we can start to see that really benefit if they do go through with that.","Efrain Rivera","Hey, look, you\u2019re right Gary, that\u2019s absolutely right. I\u2019m not trying to be excessively conservative. I obviously I\u2019m somewhat gun sighted and tell people we think that that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to happen. And I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019ll be the happiest person around if that\u2019s where we end up. I\u2019m extremely hopeful but you\u2019re right that\u2019s exactly what would happen that would ripple through those short term portfolio and have a pretty significant impact on stock.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, good. I think the way you do it makes sense. And then just one question on ACA driven demand, I know in the last few years, HRS has been real strong as you\u2019ve had a broad halo effect, more customers are interesting in considering their options in Europe trusted source they turn to. But is - should we think of the ACA compliance offering as having been a significant part of bookings and something that could drive some real acceleration in calendar 2016 or should we think because I know ADP\u2019s talk that way [indiscernible] even with their ACA compliance have seen just massive bookings growth or should we think that within the broader HRS portfolio it\u2019s certainly a positive factor but just one of many and more steady as she goes continued strong growth.","Martin Mucci","I think I would say steady if she goes on HRS growth. I think it certainly is helping. It still remains to be seen after the first filing day where clients fall out and are they going to stay with it, are more clients going to come in. I think some will fall out that probably we\u2019ll say, hey, I didn\u2019t need it and I think others will say I should have had it and we will add. So I think we\u2019ll still have good sales with ESR, the ACA product through 2016 kind of calendar year because I think some things will fall out, I think some clients will fall out and realize they should have had the product and then didn\u2019t file because we\u2019re already getting calls like that now like, hey what do I do and it\u2019s a little bit late to gather all that information. So I think it\u2019s a little bit early but it\u2019s very positive. We\u2019ve seen great acceptance of the product and frankly as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we\u2019ve had to ramp up some cost in the quarter just to kind of handle all of the inflow of data and everything the clients are giving us. So I think it will still be a positive right through the calendar year.","Gary Bisbee","Great. And then just one quick one, as you add on these incremental components to the Flex offering, should we think of it as an material revenue opportunity to have existing customers turn those on or is there more of a sales effort that will take some time to drive that incremental revenue as you add these important components. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Sure. I think it will take a little bit of time. I think we kind of make sure that we\u2019re bringing the clients along carefully. We are paying close attention now. The operations team and the client retention teams talking to those clients realize a net benefit than we make the sale of the additional products and turn on those additional modules. The biggest benefit is when you\u2019re selling the entire product combined to the new clients but we\u2019re certainly going back and marketing to the base that you now have available more modules that you can turn on. So I think there is certainly an opportunity there but we\u2019re not going to rush it and blitz the base. We are letting the clients, did comfortable with Flex and then show them that there is additional modules which will help not only sales but retention, more importantly as well.","Gary Bisbee","Great. Thank you. Happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thank you too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your line is now open.","Jim MacDonald","Yes, good morning, guys.","Martin Mucci","Morning.","Jim MacDonald","A couple of follow-ups. Advance partners you talked about 1.5% increase in the HRS side from that eventually, what categories is that and are those categories new to you like the financing?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. That\u2019s primarily the financing part of the business. So it would be HRS then we\u2019ll have to figure out longer term kind of where it goes. The other part just to anticipate a question someone will ask, the other part is payroll services. The business is split pretty evenly between the two.","Jim MacDonald","Okay. And Martin mentioned that MMS is growing strongly now. Besides the obvious competitors is that coming from any other sources, expansion of the market or just where you think that\u2019s coming from?","Martin Mucci","I think there is some expansion and the fact that as we\u2019ve talked about the need for the total product set has come down. So I think there is more clients in that 50 plus, maybe 50 to 150 employees that are needing more product and more services and they are out. They may have been on an in-house solution and that was much more simple and they needed more, they needed time and attendance, they needed HR administration, they needed benefits administration. So I think that I do think the market is expanding a bit in the fact that who needs the complete suite of services which has been positive, but also think obviously we are taking share from some competitors as well. Even though there is more competitors out there and talking about things, I think we\u2019ve seen little bit more share we are taking now as we have a complete product at HCM suite of cloud based SaaS services.","Jim MacDonald","Great. Happy holidays guys.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Jim. Take care.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair Company. Your line is now open.","Tim McHugh","Yes, thanks guys. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things. I guess the comments on advanced - that revenue contribution of 1 point to payroll 1.5 point to HRS, that\u2019s for the six months left in the fiscal year, is that the right way to think about it?","Efrain Rivera","That\u2019s correct, Tim.","Tim McHugh","But you will only have it for five. So if we are thinking about the quarterly run rate it\u2019s quarterly contribution, I guess full quarter it\u2019s higher than that. So\u2026","Martin Mucci","Yes, it would be, so yes assuming we close this month, which we in or like we would we\u2019ll do we expect to close shortly, yes you would have two months in Q3 and then three months in Q4.","Tim McHugh","Okay did you quantify the size of the purchase price, I guess we\u2019ll see it in essentially\u2026","Martin Mucci","No you\u2019ll see it, you\u2019ll see it.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And the comment about retirement about pricing I guess I was - I wasn\u2019t clear exactly is the comment just you\u2019re taking last price than you did a year ago so the growth rate is lower or is it?","Martin Mucci","Yes that\u2019s a\u2026","Tim McHugh","Okay there wasn\u2019t a onetime bump last year that was a onetime revenue source I guess?","Martin Mucci","No, we review pricing along all of our businesses and periodically in HRS in particular don\u2019t necessarily in a given year increased the price, but may increase it so\u2026","Tim McHugh","Did you see some sort of client pushback that\u2019s why you took didn\u2019t take price again this year?","Martin Mucci","No we just, we try to figure out what, we do a lot of work on pricing to figure out what makes sense, so we don't end up having an attrition or retention problem.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Rick Eskelsen","Hi good morning. Thank you for taking.","Martin Mucci","Hi Rick.","Rick Eskelsen","Hey how are you?","Martin Mucci","Good.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you for taking my question happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Yes. Thanks.","Rick Eskelsen","The first one just on the a minimum premium plan and the PEO, you\u2019ve had it in the place now for over year just wonder if you could sort of talk about the success that you\u2019ve seen there if you only to plan to extend it further and then any impact on the risk in the PEO book?","Martin Mucci","I think, now we\u2019ve done a good job on the risk is we handle it very carefully and I think the sales and the risk management team there that worked very well together, which is what we expect and they\u2019ve done a good job. Things went very successful, I think it\u2019s fairly limited to the area, but it's done well and I think we\u2019re always looking at ways to expand it if that opportunity presents itself and so we\u2019re very open to doing that.","Rick Eskelsen","Thanks and then just pulling up, wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the margins again, can you just remind us sort of what your investment plans are for areas like IT, I think you had talked about in the past, now it's sort of growing in line with revenue, is that the right?","Martin Mucci","It took on a little faster than revenue, it probably will continue to grow a little bit faster than revenue, it just was growing at significantly higher than revenue growth. So, I think it's moderated a bit. But I think if you lead technology enabled services business tech spending is going to outpace revenue growth at least over the intermediate term that will do that for us and that\u2019s just the price of being in the business. And we have to we look at other ways to leverage the business to ensure that we deliver the bottom line.","Rick Eskelsen","Okay and then just the last question just sort of philosophically here with the Advanced Partner\u2019s acquisition just wondering how much of it was interest in adding more capabilities and then the staffing market more in-line with the stuff that you already do and how much of it was getting some of the funding stuff so it sort of expanding your services. And in future acquisitions how much to either those two bulking up the existing verse expanding into new plan to it. Thanks.","Martin Mucci","It\u2019s an interesting - I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. I mean always we\u2019re looking for to drive top line growth and continue to leverage and being a very profitable company it makes the M&A very tight the selection very tight and give it at a very valuable good value. So, I think it's a little bit of both I think we can expand what we saw was a great opportunity just as you said to take what their products are and expanded to a number of clients that we have that are staffing firm small to midsize staffing firms. And we think that's an immediate benefit and then also adding more, not only product to what they're offering, but the access to capital. This business needs capital, access to capital to be able to continue to grow the funding business and we certainly have that not only in cash, but in access to more capital besides. So, we think between the two of them we can accelerate their growth and therefore our growth and do it at a very profitable, a very profitable way to do it. So this was a perfect fit for us. And it\u2019s very much focused on that small to midsize staffing from which there's thousands 10,000 of them, and I think they had a very decent market share, but still a lot of room to grow. So very good and we think that temporary staffing business frankly is going to continue to grow we\u2019re seeing part-time employment is growing almost 3 percentage points in the last two years. So we think that with overtime rules ACA and a number of other requirements the staffing business and temporary employee business is going to continue to grow and we want to be part of it.","Efrain Rivera","The gig economy is here to stay.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. Last week when Congress signed the year end budget build there were number of so called tax extenders that were extended over longer time periods than they usually are, I know one of your competitors went out trumpeting one of them specifically they want to see the work opportunity tax credit. Is that something you think would be an advantage to you or are there any other items that were in there that might be something to help us for business going forward. Thanks.","Martin Mucci","I think just generally all those, they all encourage or they tend to encourage most of them investment new business startups and existing businesses to invest more in their business and to give some tax benefit for that. I think that's all positive all makes the economy stronger, I think the fact that those had expired I think would have dampen investment in particularly in small to midsize businesses. So, I think they\u2019re all positive. I don\u2019t think it was any one that would stand out to us to be that big of a benefit. But they certainly are all positive for the overall business environment.","Jeff Silber ","Okay that\u2019s helpful and Efrain I\u2019m apologizing in advanced, I\u2019ve got another interest rate question for you.","Efrain Rivera","Well go ahead.","Jeff Silber ","You mentioned, I think you were going to be look at the strategy in the spring?","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Jeff Silber ","Is that because you\u2019re just doing planning for next year or you are anticipating interest rate increases coming in the spring?","Efrain Rivera","I think it\u2019s both so Jeff, so how you can figure the portfolio not going to long digression here for you. But what ADP does is different than what we do. They borrow short-term, they invest long-term, we don't do that to a significant extent, we just haven't seen the value add in recent years to do that, but the shape of a yield curve really has a big impact on why do you do that or you don't do that. And so we\u2019re little bit and wait and see. We think our internal betting is that Fed will probably raise again in the spring and then it'll start to become a little bit more clear to us what the shape of that yield curve is going to be, so we can plan into 2017. So, it\u2019s a little bit above.","Jeff Silber ","Okay great. Thanks so much.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you guys, good morning.","Martin Mucci","Good morning.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","So, I just want to start off with a clarification question with the guidance being what it is, it does include a few months of advance, it does include the modest impact of higher interest rates. What you're really saying is that neither of those factors taken together is enough to do to change your guidance profile, but they're still included in there?","Efrain Rivera","That\u2019s correct Ashwin that\u2019s the point, so we could characterize it in a number of different ways. But the guidance ranges that we give even with all those changes at this point we don't anticipate significant change from what we said at the beginning of the year.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And then conceptually as your sales force sells a wider range of products and include Advanced and there for example it\u2019s more complex offering that that makes sense in terms of revenue per client. But as you try to manage that what specifically is the forward risk profile associated with federal funding, which frankly is not a end market that I fully understand yet. And does that mean a need for more sales force training, more expense in that area?","Efrain Rivera","Yes I think that one, Ashwin I think that it will be sold by a specific sales force, it may be referred and it very much will be referred by the broader sales force but that sale is very specific to and something that Advanced has done a very good job on is having highly trained sales reps who bring a proper risk client risk profile client to them then it goes through underwriting as well. So that's why I think they've done a very good job on a risk. So it won't have to - we won\u2019t have to train our entire sales force, we\u2019ll look for them, we\u2019ll train them on the opportunity and the product. But just to get the referral to the other - to a specific sales force that will evaluate the risk profile of the opportunity and then bring it to underwriting.","Martin Mucci","The other thing Ashwin that that we liked about the business was that as I said, approximately half of what they sell are services that were very, very, very familiar with. So they are selling Payroll and Outsourcing services, but in a particular vertical, which happens to be these staffing firm. So, the profile really is not significantly different, other than the funding piece of that that we think they do exceptionally well.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it and I apologize if this was asked, but I had to hop off for just a brief bit, the pushout of certain elements of ACA and Cadillac tax specifically is that, I mean how are you thinking about that for your specific client base does it have an impact?","Martin Mucci","I don't think that one has an impact very much on our small to midsize businesses, I don't think you usually, they won't normally run into that that issue. So, I don't think, it will it\u2019s, I do think it's going to be a very interesting still a year calendar year ahead of us in 2016 for the Affordable Care Act products right now, because I said, I did mention certainly that the demand has been very strong and in fact we've added some expense to support all that inflow of data from clients. And I think that the sales will kind of some clients may say hey after the filing date I don't always need this I don't need this product others will realize that they did need it and there will be another, kind of surge in sales I think in 2016. So I think the sales are still continue to be pretty strong in a calendar year 2016.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it, my last question really is and this is potentially a few months too early, but do worry about the interest rate sensitivity obviously higher interest rates good for you, but interest rate sensitivity of your client base I mean do they care as just looking at one of your share Payroll surveys, which applies to a piece of your - of your client base that 45% of clients don't care, but that means that 55% do care any thoughts there?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think first of all where new businesses small businesses and those who are starting up typically don't go through a bank for their credit anyway. So, I don't think they will be too impacted by a number of increases that until it gets much higher. So, I don't think we\u2019re going to see a big impact on small business to start. They usually use other funding sources and so forth. So, I don\u2019t think a big impact there. I think midsize businesses that are more capital intensive that need to borrow, we\u2019ll see some impact as the rates start to go up. But in the near future it's hard to anticipate that they\u2019re going to up enough to drive that much impact to them, Efrain.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I\u2019d agree.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay got it, happy holidays guys.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Yes, bye.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Hi guys, just a couple follow-up question have you guys started on using your balance sheet more to do small business lending?","Martin Mucci","We\u2019ve thought about it. It\u2019s a pretty crowded space out there with a number of companies out there doing it and we have we continue to look at that as an opportunity we are - we have some partnership with this to credit and to do some referrals with them but we\u2019ve continue to look at the business as well. But it is a pretty crowded space these days.","Bryan Keane","Hey, yes you guys just have pretty good access to financials, so you would have a pretty good idea of good and bad loan potential, so I thought it would be an interesting option?","Martin Mucci","Yes, we have launched it.","Bryan Keane","I just want to ask you about retention going into the big selling season. How do you guys feel of retention going forward coming into the selling season here?","Martin Mucci","Yes pretty good so far at this point. We\u2019re feeling good when we talked earlier about a price increase and we held our price increase, we\u2019ve held the increase well and our retention has been near it\u2019s historic best. And so it\u2019s early, because you really get that best sense at the end of December and into January, but at this point we feel good about it, our retention is continuing to hold.","Bryan Keane","Okay and then can you quantify you talked about sales growth be in double-digits and ahead a plan. Can you quantify how much ahead a plan that is?","Martin Mucci","No, but it\u2019s strong. I would just say this Bryan, so I called out higher sales expense, because I typically don\u2019t do, because it\u2019s - we\u2019ve got a range and frankly the street can figure out what that range is. But I would say through the first six months when we where preparing for the call we had a discussion about whether to call it out, because some quarters you have better sales growth and you have than others. But given the strength of what we\u2019ve seen in the back six months and in our planning process we thought we had to add to selling expense, because they are up to a very strong start, so it's strong by our standards. Yes.","Bryan Keane","Okay and then the common question we\u2019re going to get on that is how does that translate that strong sales, the double-digits into revenue growth, maybe you can just remind us Efrain best way to\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yes, typically you\u2019re not seeing that sales growth probably for another 4 to 6 months going forward. So there is a bit of a lag some of it you see as soon as two to three months some of it a little bit longer cycle, because you have to set clients up. So you start to see that translating into 2017 sales.","Bryan Keane","Okay great. That\u2019s all I had. Happy holidays.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Martin Mucci","You too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Sara Gubins","Hi, thank you.","Martin Mucci","Hi Sara.","Sara Gubins ","Question first on ACA how the adoption of the compliance product trend during the second quarter, I guess I\u2019m wondering if you talk about being at about 50% adoption last quarter and that have been up from 25% to 33% in the prior quarter. So, I\u2019m wondering kind of what the penetration is looking like?","Efrain Rivera","I think it\u2019s a little bit higher than that Sara, but not dramatically higher. We never thought that we\u2019d get a 100% adoption in the base, because there are other solutions out there. So, I think we\u2019re trending above certainly about 50%, but it's not a 100%. And we don't anticipate that it will be.","Sara Gubins ","Okay and then quick question on Advanced Partners, how cyclical has their business been in the past given the end market?","Martin Mucci","Yes, not very, I mean obviously I guess this is counter currency, I haven\u2019t looked at where they were in 2008 or 2009, but they\u2019ve had a pretty steady track record of growth. You can argue that one thing take a downturn you actually have slightly increased demand for temporary versus full-time employees. So, but their growth patterns been a pretty steady that was one of the thing that we looked at.","Sara Gubins ","Okay maybe they\u2019re getting picture and maybe [indiscernible]?","Efrain Rivera","It, I think yes it could.","Sara Gubins ","Okay and then can you talk about sales expense being higher, did you change the plan for sales headcount growth did you talked about 3% this fiscal year versus the 5% last year?","Efrain Rivera","No, no. Yes no we didn\u2019t I mean whatever we said at the beginning of the year is still holding we\u2019re above in sales that\u2019s particularly on the Payroll side. So that's true, when we call out higher sales expense is not headcount, it\u2019s because our sales are variable and so if we anticipate that sales is going to have a good selling season, which is what we believe will happen and we rarely talk about it that way. We\u2019re little bit more cautious than we just bump expenses and so right now in this street models that I have seen in third quarter we\u2019re not taking into account that selling expense so.","Sara Gubins ","Okay great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of Baird. Your line is now open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning Marty and Efrain. Happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks. You too.","Mark Marcon ","So just a follow-up on that the sales expenses up not because of headcount, but because of better performance it takes about four to six months if it\u2019s up double-digit then what sort of incremental bump does that do to revenue relative to a steady state?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I guess Mark, I will go through the arithmetic, but I think the thing always to remember is that our retention averages about 86%. So, yield a little bit of it of effect this year and then you get the rest of it next year in order for you - when people ask this question, in order for you to start accelerating up to double-digit you\u2019d have to really have appeared a multi-year period of very strong sales performance. Now we hope we\u2019re somewhat on that trend, but you need more than one to make it occur. That's part A. Part B of the explanation, which is going to lead me to part C, part B is simply to say that sales is one component of the equation, obviously retention is the other component of the equation and how the pieces of that fit together we put together a plan tells me where sales growth is going to go. You have seen that in the last three years certainly even excluding the impacts of the minimum premium plan, we've seen revenue bump up because sales the leading indicator has been growing, so I see it as simply that I will have to get to 17 when I give you guidance, but I think we feel good. If we see this sales growth continuing through the year that's going to be a positive for next year.","Mark Marcon ","All other things being equal we should end up seeing total services revenue accelerate slightly at least?","Efrain Rivera","I would say, if we continue with the strong performance, yes.","Mark Marcon ","Great and then how much - can you just remind us what the ACA ERS is adding in terms of revenue?","Efrain Rivera","We don't disclose it. What's tricky about that is, if I were to give you a number I'd have to say also then that ESR cuts both ways in that it represents an opportunity for additional sales but it's also other sales we might not get because people are focused on selling it and there's tremendous amount of demand so it's buried in the HRS number and that's about as far as we will go.","Mark Marcon ","Okay, is all of Advanced on HRS?","Efrain Rivera","No that's Mark, so I called out very carefully the balance of the year and I think Tim asked earlier, so I called out a 1% increase for the balance of the year on service revenue and 1.5% for HRS for the balance of the year as Tim mentioned earlier is about five months or so that we expect so no actually the business is evenly split between payroll services, what we would consider payroll services revenue and funding, which we're going to lump into HRS for now until we figure out where a better category is for it.","Mark Marcon ","Right and Advanced is growing double-digits?","Efrain Rivera","Yes they\u2019re and strong profitable.","Mark Marcon ","And so the pipeline that you mentioned I mean how rare is it to see something that\u2019s reasonably priced growing at a decent rate and as profitable you are?","Efrain Rivera","Well what we disclosed the cash flow you guys can determine how reasonable price is, but we thought it was a reasonable price for the prospects of the business. It is fairly rare, I would say that.","Martin Mucci","Yes.","Mark Marcon ","Okay. Any thoughts with regards to sales headcount going next year how you\u2019re thinking about trending that?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I would think party it would be consistent depending on which area and so forth we're getting into studying that now and we will actually after selling season, but I think we would continue to probably increase a little bit more. You may see a little bit more virtual because that's where we've seen the growth in last few years, but there's still field resources would continue to go up as well.","Mark Marcon ","Okay and then one last question just on the international front whether we're thinking about Germany or Brazil any updates there?","Martin Mucci","Germany has continued to I think do well the client base is really getting up their performances so sales performance is good and retention is very good. So, I think we\u2019re doing well there and Brazil has just been slower than we expected a number of things have changed the economy is not as strong there\u2019s some political stuff going on in the legislation that we expected that would be more of a disruptor, which was requiring more electronic filing for small businesses, it\u2019s been delayed now for a couple years. We expect it still get done, but it\u2019s taking longer so that disruption to drive more Payroll from accounts into a third party has been slower much slower to happen than we expected.","Efrain Rivera","As to the other thing Mark just to build on what Marty said we remained interested in building out the international portion of the business and M&A is also focused on looking at those opportunities too. Yes.","Mark Marcon ","Great, thank you. Happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thanks you too Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi good morning guys. A question, you've talked for a couple quarters now about the transition to this bundled selling approach out in the field. Can you give an idea within HRS pars a little bit the relative growth rates of the ancillary services and how they've been impacted by that bundled selling approach versus the ASO\/PEO piece of HRS?","Efrain Rivera","We don't really break it down to that level but it definitely has helped our attachment rate at the beginning of the sale. Our old approach was, we will sell payroll. This particularly the small businesses we will sell you payroll and then come back with different sales forces and this team selling now with the 20 employee or so size has really gone much better. It's still early in the process, but we're seeing nice results where the clients not only is it we're selling more of a complete bundle, but also the clients have a, they're happier because they weren't looking for just payroll. They were looking for more and we're being able to satisfy them the right way I think up front, but we don't really break it down much more than that. Anything you want to? Okay.","Lisa Ellis","Okay second one is Flex related. I think you mentioned that that is appealing to more of a mid market client. Can you give an idea of what size of client you're seeing a new uptick in in terms of demand and I guess any other changes or differences you're noticing about Flex?","Martin Mucci","First of all as Efrain said the majority of the clients are on Flex. What I should say is the mid market that 50 plus it's more interested the full bundle of the suite of complete suite of products, so Flex can be payroll only, it can be a complete bundle of services and we're seeing bigger uptake in the bundle for those probably even 20 and above because that need has come down, so I think it's just Time and Attendance for example. In the past, you'd be pretty good size necessarily in employee before you'd be interested Time and Attendance now with overtime rules Affordable Care Act, and also by the way the technology of Time and Attendance, there's just a much greater need for it. Clients want it. It's easier, you can do it on your mobile Approximately, now client employees can punch in and out on their phone. So, I think the need has driven down in size and the technology and our breadth of products and mobility has made it a lot easier for clients to incorporate it into their businesses. So, I think the impact there is that the majority of clients are on Flex and the 20 plus, 30 plus employee clients are taking much more of a full suite or some portion of that suite of products.","Lisa Ellis","Okay terrific. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.","David Grossman","Hi thank you. I had a throughout four minute so if this should been answered we can take you to offline. But just had a couple of very quick follow-up\u2026","Martin Mucci","Yes.","David Grossman ","So the first is I think here commentary implies that your checks for client were relatively flat and can you remind us is that a function of where we are in the cycle, or is there something else driving that metric?","Martin Mucci","Yes, so David if you'll look at our average client size, we're balancing around 17 or so and it's really nothing more than the fact that under 50, we were having a lot of more growth than we were in previous years and you have a tendency there that has a tendency to depress the number of checks per client. If I same-store it you're at somewhere between 0-1%, so because checks per client are not really a significant contributor, we really just don't call it out so that's basically the dynamic of what's occurring. As you grow that you tend to see that impact.","David Grossman ","Right, I guess I was just trying to reconcile that with your commentary about some of the growth momentum in your new bookings it\u2019s being driven by MMS and\u2026","Martin Mucci","Good point and I think that\u2019s a fair point. It\u2019s early in the cycle so it\u2019s in the end we were start skewing higher than you would see that pop up. But it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time before you start to see that.","David Grossman ","Right and then the second question I had was on HRS, I think I understand the impact of the retirement services pricing action. However, what if anything maybe going on in the underlying PEO business, just curious what the trends are in that business relative to where they\u2019ve been because they have been relatively strong, I think we can agree it so.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, they are still very, very strong. So, just to remind you what is varied, or not varied, what\u2019s included in nature as, so you got insurance services, you got HR outsourcing, you have retirement services and you have actually online services and I will just remind everyone that when we had the Investor Day I said, we really need to kind of think about how we represent Payroll services going forward because it really doesn\u2019t capture the activity that\u2019s going on in that segment of revenue. Having said all of that PEO still is relatively small as a percentage of revenue for the company as a whole and even within HRS it\u2019s still certainly well south of 50%, but it is growing very, very rapidly, faster, much faster than HRS is growing as a whole. ","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think it is a very strong market for the product particularly with the Affordable Care Act and the need for HR, more HR because of the regulations and so forth. So, yes it continues to be very strong demand. ","David Grossman ","Alright, so no. The takeaway there is no change in trajectory of that business despite the growth rate at category?","Efrain Rivera","No, we feel pretty optimistic about that.","David Grossman ","Okay and then just one final question, I guess there have been several questions about the booking moment that you are reporting, can you help us, I mean you called out MMS as being a component of that moment, but is there anything else in there in terms of the mix whether it be a fully outsourced solution versus not, you said it was revenue per client going us with more modules being purchased but just curious if there is any kind of new trend emerging that maybe driving that network?","Efrain Rivera","I think obviously employee share responsibility helps too. So that is part of the equation there, but if I look at all of the different sales forces and the products that they sell, the combined effect is really strong we don\u2019t have sales forces that - we don\u2019t have any that are performing under where we expect. So, we got a lot of cylinders hitting all at once. ","Martin Mucci","I think the mid market is the strongest if you look at that that\u2019s been the biggest strong and the PEO and the HR outsourcing have been particularly as Efrain has mentioned. So, I think overall though as we\u2019ve seen nice growth in all of the sales forces, nice par growth, but the leaders have been at this stage the mid market and they have - remember they have a much fuller product suite now and two components were just added, fully integrated and so they are selling much of higher revenue per client and their - its success is up.","David Grossman ","Great. Well congratulations and have a great holiday.","Martin Mucci","Thanks David, you too.","David Grossman ","Very good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tian Jing Wang of JPMorgan, your line is now open.","Tian Jing Wang","Hi thanks. Just wanted to ask on PEO demand as we cross into the new calendar year, any change in your thinking around level of demand in general for PEO?","Martin Mucci","No, just continue to be strong and selling season will kind of tell the tale, but it continues to be very strong and frankly has picked up in some parts of the country where we\u2019ve added more reps where we were not selling as much PEO. So, I think the demand there is still good and looks sustainable. ","Tian Jing Wang","Okay good. Just one more. Just on the HRS side, I know you always sweat rounding and one number, I think you mentioned it was in the far below the 10% to 13% range, I mean are we talking about rounding to 9% kind of issue or is it going to be bit different from there?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Tian Jing for asking the question. Everyone is figuring out. So, yes we are going to anticipate somewhere in that 9% range.","Tian Jing Wang","Okay, like I said I know. ","Efrain Rivera","No, sure question.","Tian Jing Wang","Just wanted to make sure, have a safe end of the year guys, thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Tian Jing.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer, your line is now open.","Glenn Greene","Thank you and thanks for fitting me in. Just two questions and clarifications, the first one is on sort of the booking momentum commentary, you know if I recall the kind of the last couple of quarters have been strong as well, so is it, did we accelerate in terms of booking momentum is this more just sort of sustainable trends we have seen over the last few quarters, just sort of how you would characterise it?","Martin Mucci","I think it is sustained, I think it is up a little stronger, particularly in the mid-market, but it sustained double digit for at least the last few quarters. So, I would say it is up a little bit, but it is certainly, you know and that is good thing it is not like it popped up one quarter and then it slowed down. We have seen some nice momentum going into the selling season here.","Glenn Greene","Okay and then just to clarify Efrain on Advanced Partners, and you sort of in your prepared comments you said it was excluded from the guidance and I think in our response to questions that are included in guidance and maybe just a nuance, but maybe the answer is just that it doesn\u2019t move the needle enough, but I kind of just want to check my math that it is like 60 basis points to growth and a 120 basis points to the back half.","Efrain Rivera","Yes Glenn. So, what I was trying to do was carefully parse two things, first tell you what growth looked like before I added in Advanced Partners right, so I talked about that and then after I did that, I said okay, after you have gotten that right because you got to get your models right than what will Advance include when it is closed? So that is when I said in the balance of the year whatever your models say based on what I guided you to you are going to get about 1% in the balance of the year for payroll service revenue growth and 1.5% for HRS growth in the balance of the year and was clarified that that\u2019s probably going to be about five months or so. So, I just was trying to say the overlay of Advance looks like that. When you put all that together with guidance we\u2019ve given for the year, we\u2019re still overall within the range of guidance that we provided for the year. ","Glenn Greene","Okay, and just a quick math on a full year run rate, is it something like $35 million of revenue, is that reasonable?","Efrain Rivera","I see where your math works and I can\u2019t disagree with it.","Glenn Greene","Okay great. Thanks a lot.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Martin Mucci","Okay, I think that\u2019s all the questions. At this point we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be achieved until approximately January 22. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We very much appreciate that. We wish you all very happy holiday season. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Take care.","Operator","Thank you. And that concluded today\u2019s conference.

Welcome and thank you for standing by and welcome to today\u2019s conference call. At this time all lines are on listen-only for today's conference until the question-and-answer portion of our call. [Operator Instructions]. Our conference is being recorded and if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn our conference over to our host, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir you may proceed. ","Martin Mucci ","Thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's Fiscal 2015 Year End Performance. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. We expect to file our Form 10-K by the end of July. The earnings press release is available by accessing our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. ","On today's call I will review the highlights of the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015, and our operations, sales and product development areas. Efrain will review our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2016 guidance and then we'll open it up for your questions. ","We are pleased, very pleased with our solid financial performance during 2015. Our results met the guidance that we have been providing throughout the year. We also achieved two key milestones this year. Both our human resource services revenue and our operating income exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our Paychex\u2019s history. Efrain will talk about our financial results in more detail. However, I'd like to provide you with some highlights. Payroll service revenue continued to experience steady growth of 4%, driven by increases in revenue per check and client base. HRS revenue for fiscal 2015 benefited from strong demand for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing solutions, both PEO and ASO, which drove double digit growth. ","Our payroll client base finished the year at approximately 590,000 clients, an increase of about 2% from the prior year. We achieved good sales and retention results for our 401(k) product, and once again, we were recognized by Plansponsor magazine as the largest 401(k) record keeper by number of plans for the fifth consecutive year. ","Sales execution during \u201815 was strong, with significant growth in our new annualized revenue sold. We did a great job with our team\u2019s selling approach, which sells the full value of all products to the client upfront. In addition, our referral pipeline is strong. We have had success in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements and increasing our web leads in addition to our strong CPA referral channel. Client service is imperative for our success and we again excelled in fiscal 2015. This service is delivered through a combination of innovative technology, driven by SaaS solutions, accessed online through our mobile app and through the support of our dedicated service specialists that sets us apart from our competitors. The value of our solutions and service team, including our 7\/24 support resulted in consistently high satisfaction scores and our best year ever in client retention, in excess of 82% of our beginning client base. ","We continue to invest in our SaaS solutions and mobility offerings that position us for long-term growth. We are experiencing increased demand for our SaaS solutions across our client base. This includes Paychex Flex, which offers powerful workforce management capabilities in a simple and streamlined user experience. Paychex Flex couples this with the flexibility of choice for our client service needs, and this approach gives our clients access to a variety of customer service options based on their size and complexity. ","Our mobility app also continues to see a fast growing number of users, both clients and client employees. On Monday, we announced our Paychex Flex hiring offering which gives clients a simplified recruiting process with automated job opening, positing, and administration as well as an ability to onboard new clients in a paperless electronic environment, collecting all new information electronically and populating the data into the employee record fully integrated with our Flex offering. This continues to enhance the powerful human capital management solution that Flex brings to our clients. ","We are also pleased with the market acceptance we are seeing for our new full service product that helps clients in navigating the complexities of healthcare reform. We have the ability to leverage our payroll data and our relationships with nationally recognized insurance agencies to offer our clients assistance and value in understanding the complexities of the Affordable Care Act, and how it impacts them and their employees. ","We have continued our shareholder friendly actions, maintaining a very competitive dividend yield with our current quarterly dividend at $0.38 per share. We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired approximately 4 million shares of common stock in fiscal \u201815. ","In summary, I am proud of our employees\u2019 efforts on behalf of our clients and our shareholders. They have continued to sell and deliver great solutions, drive high client satisfaction and record levels of client retention. We have a solid leadership team that is clearly focused on growth through sales and service execution, technology innovation, and product expansion in fiscal 2016 and beyond. They have delivered solid consistent top line growth and strong operating margins. ","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera ","Thanks Marty. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve risks. Refer to our press release that includes a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. ","As Marty indicated, Paychex delivered solid results in fiscal 2015 coupled with improving metrics. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter and for the fiscal year. I'll then provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of the 2016 outlook. Total service revenue, up 8% for the quarter and 9% for the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 5% for the fourth quarter and 3% for the fiscal year to $11 million and $42 million respectively. The fourth quarter increase was primarily the result of average interest rates, higher average interest rates and the increase for the fiscal year was driven more by higher average investment balances. ","Expenses increased by 7% for the fourth quarter and 10% for the fiscal year. The increase was mainly in compensation-related costs with higher sales headcount and higher comp due to strong sales execution. Costs relating to the PEO minimum premium plan health insurance offering contributed 3 percentage points of the increase in total expenses for the fiscal year. ","Operating margin was 35% for the fourth quarter. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 11% to $241 million for the fourth quarter and 7% as Martin mentioned earlier to $1 billion for fiscal 2015. Our operating margin, as many of you know, is typically lower in the second half of the year. ","Net income growth increased 10% to $161 million for the fourth quarter and 8% to $675 million for the fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.44 per share for the fourth quarter, and they increased 8% to $1.85 per share for fiscal 2015. ","Let's look a little closer at payroll revenue. It increased 4% for both the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and higher clients. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounting, coupled with the impact of increased product penetration. ","Checks per payroll, which had been trending up in prior years, was relatively flat for fiscal 2015. Checks per payroll growth rates have returned to more historic norms, which were typically below 1%. HRS revenue increased 16% to $272 million for the fourth quarter and 18% to $1 billion for the fiscal year. The MPP [ph] plan health insurance offering, which was added in the second half of fiscal 2014 contributed 6 percentage points of growth in HRS for the fiscal year. ","Paychex's HR Solutions experienced solid growth in clients and planned employees served; in particular, our PEO experienced strong demand during fiscal 2015. Retirement Services revenue benefited from pricing, together with growth in the number of plans and an increase in the average asset value over time and services, client employee funds. Insurance Services had a strong year, where revenue growth benefited from the ramp up of our new full service offering to comply with healthcare reform requirements and increase in the number of health and benefits applicants and higher average premiums and workers comp insurance services. Online HR administration products continued to grow due to success in the sales of SaaS Solutions, in particular of our time and attendance products. ","Let's look at our investment and income; our primarily goal is to protect principal, but optimize our liquidity; long-term portfolio, which is primarily made up of high credit quality municipal bonds with an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 0.9% for the fourth quarter and 1% for fiscal 2015, which is consistent with 2014 fourth quarter and up slightly from last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were flat for the fourth quarter, as increases attributable to our client base were offset by lower state unemployment insurance collections. For the fiscal year, average balances on funds held for clients increased due to growth in client base and wage inflation.","Let's look at our financial position, remains strong with cash and corporate investment of $936 million as of the end of the year and no debt. Funds held for clients were $4.3 million compared to $4.2 billion as of May 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely as you know on a day-to-day basis and they averaged $4.1 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of 3%. ","Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $14 million as of May 31, 2015 compared to $35 million as of the same period last year. Total stockholders\u2019 equity, $1.8 billion, reflecting $552 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Dividends paid represented 82% of net income, our return on equity for the past 12 months was 36%. ","Cash flows from operations were $895 million for the fiscal year, 2% higher than last year. Higher net income and non-cash adjustments were partially offset by the impact of timing and working capital which was greater last year than it was this year. ","Let's turn to fiscal 2016 guidance. And I will mention a few things that color both the yearly and the annual guidance and also the quarter, so we\u2019re clear on what we're expecting for the year. Our outlook is based on the fiscal year ending May 31, 2016 and it includes our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing without significant changes. I'll explain what we mean with by that in a second. Our guidance for 2016 is as follows: Payroll service revenue projected to increase in the range of 4% to 5%, compared to fiscal 2015. We don't expect much, if any, contribution from checks for payroll in 2015, although that number has bounced around a bit at this point. We think it will be largely flat, could be up a few tenths, it won't matter. The projected growth rate is based on anticipated client base growth and increases in revenue per check. ","In addition, I want to call out some things specifically. In fiscal 2006 we have two additional payroll processing days. These will occur in the first and in the fourth quarter. So let me just say that again we're going to have two additional payroll processing days. We are punctilious about the stuff because we know you will ask us. They occur in the first and in the fourth quarters. HRS revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 10% to 13%. Both HRS revenue and total service revenue reflect the minimum premium plan offering within the PEO, will now have anniversaried and it's going to be a compare year-over-year, so 10% to 13% on HRS. ","Total service revenue, expected to increase in the range of 7% to 8%. Net income is expected to increase in the range of 8% to 9%. We anticipate EPS to be comparable during each of the fourth quarters of the year. But timing of expenses during the year can change the pattern as it sometimes does. Let me just repeat that. We're anticipating net EPS will be comparable during each of the fourth quarters but timing of expenses during the year can change the pattern. ","Operating income, net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to be approximately 38%. So before I get the question let me answer it. If you look at where we are and for operating income net of flow where we ended the year at about 37.5, we expect improvement and we think it will be approximately 38%. What does 38% mean? It could be 37.9, it could be 38.1, all of those are 38%. We don't anticipate that it will be 37.5. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be consistent with the rate we experienced for this year, fiscal 2015. ","Interest on funds is anticipated to be relatively flat compared to fiscal 2015. What this means, as I mentioned earlier, is that we are not anticipating at this point any change in that behavior. If it occurs we think it will be a second half event, second half of fiscal year '16 and we'll call it out when it happens. We haven't included anything in our guidance at this point. ","So let me finish with this; while we don't provide guidance on specific quarters, I think it's important to indicate at this point of the year that we anticipate that all of the quarters will fall within the range of total service revenue provided with one exception, which is the third quarter where we believe that HRS revenue will be -- is projected currently to be below the low end of the full year range. There is a number of factors influencing that, we can talk about them more in the Q&A, but third quarter we expect on HRS revenue not on payroll, and HRS revenue to fall below the low end of the full year range, has no impact, as I said, on full year guidance. So as you're adjusting your models take that into account. ","Now before I turn things over to Marty I want to remind you that Paychex will be hosting an investor day on Wednesday July 15th. We will webcast it. The event will be a great opportunity to learn more about Paychex's technology and services and you'll see demos if you're here live, unfortunately can't webcast those easily. And you're going to see the power of our technology and why we're excited about what the future holds for the company. We'll also provide a longer term outlook at the event and we hope to see many of you in a few weeks. Please sign up so we get a sense of who is coming.","So with that I will conclude and I turn it back over to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Thanks, Efrain. Operator, we will now open the meeting to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Smitti Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley. Sir your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, Efrain. This is Daniel calling in for Smitti. You sort of invited the question, but I guess I will just go ahead and ask it anyway. Could you provide just a little more color on what\u2019s driving the third quarter, I guess movement in HRS?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so the answer to that is that in the back half of this year, we had three vectors aligned. The first was real strong growth in the PEO, the start of our ACA compliance or ESR product and also strong performance in 401(k); all of those are more back half events and in particular impacted the third quarter. And so, when we get to that quarter the comparison will become a bit more complicated, and by the end of the year it will normalize. So that\u2019s basically what\u2019s going on.","Unidentified Analyst ","Got it, thanks. And then just thinking about Paychex Flex, it\u2019s been a few quarters now, so perhaps Marty you could talk a little bit about the rollout so far. And is the goal to transition as many clients as possible and perhaps you raised pricing a bit, and maybe you can just talk about the client reception you have seen so far?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, we\u2019ve seen good reception on it. It\u2019s been a -- the effort is to go through so much feature functionality in it, and so it\u2019s been a big effort on the training of our sales reps and the clients, but it\u2019s going very well. I had an increasing level of penetration of sales folks selling Flex. We ended the year very strong, and we really have put all the incentives in place to continue to sell it in fiscal \u201916. So, I think we\u2019re going to be off to a really strong start. Not to mention, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve continued to add and enhance it. So you are going to see - like we added the recruiting and onboarding functionality totally integrated on Monday and released that. So I think these additional, these adds to the Flex platform are going to help a lot. So the goal is that\u2019s what we are selling, and I think so far the sales and the clients are very receptive to it.","Unidentified Analyst ","Got it. And then is the goal basically to have SurePayroll and Flex and Flex Enterprise as the three foundations to your core offering, or will it continue to be more nuanced than that going forward?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, basically, I think that\u2019s right. SurePayroll will kind of remain on its platform. That\u2019s really for that micro sized Flex and then Flex Enterprise will really be kind of -- has already kind of replaced what was kind of core in MMS. We have our Preview product, and we do sell that on the high end as well, and it\u2019s still a good product with a lot of feature and functionality for the high end, but we are finding that Flex is a great fit, Flex and Flex Enterprise are a great fit for the majority of our market, and that really will be the product set that we are selling, and in fact most clients have already kind of moved to it. It\u2019s not like there is a big migration. Certainly for the under 20, the core client base, there is no migration, that is Flex that really is our base.","Unidentified Analyst ","Perfect, thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Sir your line is open.","Timothy McHugh","Yes, thanks. Just want to ask about client growth here, I guess 2% growth, it\u2019s consistent I guess with what you have seen, I think the last year or two. But given the kind of new bookings growth you have talked about seeing in the last couple of quarters, I guess, I guess I was a little surprised it wasn\u2019t a little higher. I guess how is that compared to what I guess what you expected and how maybe you are thinking about next year, and I guess is just contrast that with the kind of overall new bookings or kind of \u2013 I think there was a new revenue sold, you characterized it as last quarter?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, Tim so I think what we discovered, I think over the last 18 months is that there is a balance between revenue generated in new bookings and units generated in new bookings, and we're trying to strike a balance. When we've gone pure units, we don't get revenue in the way we want, when we go the pure revenue, we don't get the units we want, and what I think that represents is what you see there -- what that represents is the fact that we're striking a balance between the two, and from a plan perspective, a revenue generated, new bookings revenue, it was pretty much spot on what we expected. ","And mix is playing a bigger impact in terms of what we sell. So, we have a number of different products, and frankly we would prefer a $2,200 client to a $1,100 client, and that's going to be reflected going forward in our thinking about how we look at units. Some units are better than other units. We want a mixture of both, but at the end of the day, we want revenue that's sustainable over the long term. ","Timothy McHugh","Okay. I think you had talked about new revenue sold last quarter kind of growing at a double digit pace. Can you give a sense of where Q4 and kind of the year ended up with regard to that metric?","Martin Mucci","Yeah we stayed very consistent, I think overall on that. We ended up certainly for the year at double digit growth. In fact we're at the highest. For the year, we're at the highest growth in par we've had probably in eight years. So as Efrain said there is that balance, but we've given the sales folks a lot more product to sell, the team\u2019s selling approach that Mark Bottini and the team have done and we were selling much more multi-product upfront to the client instead of our older model of hey, sell them Payroll and comeback in with, do they need 401(k) and HR outsourcing. We're finding clients are really benefiting and we're benefiting from the fact that we're team selling upfront and giving the full value of the product. ","So we're very bullish on how the -- par is -- our annualized revenue sold has done and exactly what Efrain said, it's that balance now, but in the end its revenue growth that we want and that's what we're getting. ","Timothy McHugh","And just a numbers clarification, I guess the growth in the outsourcing or HR outsourcing client, is that included in the payroll client growth rate that you quote or is that kind of a separate number? ","Efrain Rivera","So I\u2019ll give you the simple answer than the complicated one. So clients are clients. So if we tell you we are having 590,000, that's -- those are clients who are running payroll, are clients that are served by Paychex, actually who don't take payroll, include actually additional clients for the 590. So that's the number that we don't typically disclose, but if we did disclose, it would be well over 600,000 clients. So some clients do take HR services, but don't take payroll. And as that number becomes bigger, we'll start splitting it out. ","Timothy McHugh","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. ","Joseph Foresi ","Hi, I was wondering in next year's guidance, the revenue per check, what's the expectation there? And maybe you can quantify that and how are you're getting that increased revenue per check. ","Efrain Rivera","We're not giving specific guidance on revenue per check, Joe. If you look over the last three years and simply do the math you'll see over that period of time, our revenue per client, not revenue per check has grown about $1,000 over that period of time. In terms of revenue per check, how we're getting it, it's -- so we didn't give specific guidance on that, won't do that but it's a function of price. It's a function of additional products and features sold to clients I guess those are two big components. ","Joseph Foresi ","Okay. I figured I'd try. ","Efrain Rivera","That's okay. ","Joseph Foresi ","On the free cash flow side, it was basically flat sort of year-over-year. Could you just give us some idea of what your trajectory is if you're planning on growing it and if not what has changed on the CapEx side as we head forward?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so Joe I would just say that to really understand that, you need to look at the delta between the two years of working capital adjustments. Working capital adjustments last year were about $54 million and this year working capital adjustments were $9 million. That really accounts for the big difference. Our free cash flow number is a little perhaps different than others do but because we also include uses of cash for acquisitions. So we had a bigger acquisition last year than we did this year or more. ","So it's a little bit funky. I just point you to the operating cash flows and that you can see that our operating cash flows were almost $900 million this year and then normalize the working capital adjustments, I think we were low this year, high last year. I think you're going to get to a number that\u2019s certainly in excess to $900 million on operating cash flow. And then of course there is all of the usage that we have for cash. But I don't anticipate by the way purchases for CapEx and property is really going to change all that much in the year. ","Joseph Foresi ","Got it. So theoretically it goes up obviously based on\u2026 ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, that's our expectation. ","Joseph Foresi ","Got it okay. And then last one from me. HR\u2019s been a -- HRO has been a fairly strong driver here over the last, I don't know two years. Now anything that you're seeing internally that would spark maybe a derivative or second derivative catalyst as you had into FY '16 or should we expect kind most -- much more of the same just with maybe tougher comps. ","Efrain Rivera","I think that's our planning assumption, Joe. What we don't know, what we don't know is what market reaction will be to the -- what appears to be the beginning of the imposition of penalties for the 100 plus employer set at the beginning of 2016, and then the increased requirements on the 50 to 99 [ph] clients under ACA. Why am I pointing all that out, simply because that regulatory overhang is going to probably create some changes in behaviors for clients that may drive them to be more interested in looking at a PEO solution or looking at our the Affordable Care Act solution. ","That's one -- the pace of regulation also, be the recent regulations on overtime also are going to drive more regulatory overhang. So I would say that our planning assumption is, as you said, but there is a number of factors in the environment that could impact that direction. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah, as Efrain said, I would say the recent overtime, something that\u2019s come out just the night before the last, I mean really, we think that could push our HR outsourcing because you're now going to need smaller businesses, are going to need to help with, not exempt and exempt rulings in the next year trying to figure out who is exempt and not exempt and time and attendance could be pushed as well. Because you're going to have to be more careful about tracking the hours and keeping a record of those from a compliance standpoint with all the overtime rules changing as well as, as Efrain said, I think enforcement\u2019s going to continue to pick up on things like ACA and overtime. ","Joseph Foresi ","Thank you. ","Martin Mucci","Thanks Joe. ","Operator","Our next question\u2019s from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning, Martin and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Hey David. ","David Togut","Could you quantify your growth in net price increases expected for 2016?","Efrain Rivera","I'd love to give you the exact number David, but I'll just say it's in the range of 2% to 4%. ","David Togut","2% to 4% is gross or net?","Efrain Rivera","That's going to be net. ","David Togut","Got it. And then you've highlighted above 50 basis points of operating margin expansion targeted for 2016. Could you talk about the drivers of that margin expansion and then more broadly how do you think about operating leverage beyond 2016?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so I'd say it's a continuation, David of what we've done since Marty\u2019s been here, which is to say we want to deliver world class service, but we want to do it in a world class efficient way. And so we're balancing the investment in IT that drives better service with greater efficiency from service providers being very, very careful not to upset the balance on the service side, so that they continue to drive the right kind of service. So it's really -- that's a very circuitous way of saying we balance operating and IT expense to drive that result. I would say we target, we go and do a plan typically targeting at least 15 basis point of leverage. We come out a little bit higher, a little bit lower sometimes there. So I think that's certainly in the intermediate term kind of what we're expecting. ","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think you'll see us continue to drive it. It's just part of our DNA, as Efrain said. The technology spend is more leveled off now. We've got into a very good place there, about the level of spend. And so it's continued to be a significant investment, but it won't have the double digit increases that we saw for years. ","And so and then on the operation side we've continued to find other ways of reducing space and cost and really do it more from a service perspective, but also from a leveraging perspective. So that will continue. It gets harder all the time but that\u2019s certainly part of the DNA that we take going forward every year. ","David Togut","Closing question on capital allocation, how do you think about dividend growth in the next year or two, and then for the cash that isn't allocated to dividend, how will you allocate that? ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah so we'd expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings. That ultimately will be a discussion we have in July, that certainly would be the direction we'd go in that. It doesn't mean it's going to be point for point, but it will grow as earnings grow. And then we have some allocation for share buyback. You can see we brought back about 4 million shares and actually share count went down slightly this year. So we'll continue to do, to prevent too much dilution from occurring and with a modest bias downward. ","And then finally M&A is important. Our pipeline is as robust as it has ever been. And we're very, very interested in a number of properties that are available, but we're only interested at the right price and will pass if we don't like what we see. ","David Togut","Got it. Thank you very much. ","Efrain Rivera","Okay thanks. ","Operator","Our next question is from Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","Rick Eskelsen","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the first one, just wanted to drill in on the payroll revenue growth that you guys are expecting. It sounds like a lot of it's driven by mix and also the price increases. Just maybe a little more detail on what you're expecting for the acceleration at the top end in the guidance for payroll. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think there always three things, Rick. One is, price obviously is important. That price also has an element, as you mentioned of mix that can impact the price also. We kind of lump that together with price. And then we expect unit growth. We had 2% unit growth this year. We would expect something comparable, perhaps even a little better next year. But that's -- those are the components of the payroll revenue growth.","Rick Eskelsen","And then just switching to the technology, you guys have signaled that it's flattening out in terms of the increase in spending. Just -- now that you had several years of increased tax spending behind you, can you talk about what parts of the portfolio and offerings that you think are now more competitive, and what you still need to maybe do more on? ","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I feel very good about and very competitive in all sides, to be honest with you, and that was our goal really when we started increasing the spending about six years ago. One, on the core platform I think you will see changes in the user interface that are happening right now that will be expanding over the next few months. So I think you're going to get a much cleaner HTML5 interface and -- all of that work has been done to really drive clients, to all come by the way with a mobile first kind of view of things. ","So making things very simple for clients, so they can get at everything, whether they're on a mobile, mobility app, whether they are on their mobile phone, whether on tablet, or whether they're online. And I feel very good about where we are on those fronts. The mobility app I think is the best in the business. And that -- and we continue to enhance everything that we have. ","When you look at the mid-market space, kind of even the 20 and above 20 to 500 or so in particular, I think we're very well positioned now with Flex and everything that we're adding just like we added, Monday I mentioned, to have, to be able to add a new employee all electronically send everything out to them. They can be updated and then seamlessly one time put in from the time you are recruited right through to the time you may retire from that business has made us extremely competitive. And I think, just at the right time it's a competitive market out there. We\u2019re still seeing very good sales. So I feel very good about the investments we\u2019ve made in mobile, in the core base, SurePayroll, as well as the mid-market, all of those I feel very good. ","And when you get to the ancillary products we\u2019ve done the same thing; 401(k) we continue to be the leader and in the PEO space they have been upgraded at the same time as we\u2019ve made these investments. So it\u2019s made us very competitive in the PEO space as well from a product functionality standpoint.","Rick Eskelsen","Thanks. And then just the last one here, you talked about this a little bit earlier but on the healthcare reform, now that the Supreme Court ruling happened. What are your expectations for how that\u2019s going to drive clients moving forward? Do you think that there is any of your clients are kind of waiting and seeing and just sort of what, what does that do to your business? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, we had a nice bump in that the last six months, I think as clients started to really pay attention to it and I do think now we\u2019ll probably see another resurgence of interest in it. And then as Efrain, I think mentioned earlier, I think when you get to the end of the year and those first filings have to be done and the penalty start to come into the 100 plus employee clients, I think they are really going to get a lot of attention at that point. And so the 50 or up, below a 100 will have to file, or the 50 to 100 will have to file. So that will be an awakening, I think for them that well this is a lot more difficult. And I think this is going to be another good year for the ESR product that we have, that helps them with Affordable Care Act. ","We can help them both monitor and judge kind of what they are doing on a day-to-day basis as well as the filing, and I think that puts us in a very strong position, particularly when you are a payroll and insurance client of ours.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question\u2019s from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys. Good morning. So I guess the first question, just can you give us an update on penetration and I realize probably in the 10-K you will give us a couple of customer counts to think about on some of the big product categories. But it seems like most of the areas you are still very low penetration, payroll customer base and maybe just also how big is that opportunity? I mean could half of the payroll customers eventually buy some of these products and does that mean several years more growth and up sale of those? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, Gary I think it obviously depends on the product, but I think each one of these we\u2019ve progressed in our penetration. So we feel very good about that. I think all of them you are right we still continue to have low penetration and big opportunity in front of us, when you look at even health insurance. We had a good year in health insurance, increase in sales and they are still at only probably 2% or 3% of the population. And so I think as Affordable Care Act, adds more pressure on health insurance and having health insurance for your employees comes up, that\u2019s a great opportunity for us. ","When you look at 401(k) we\u2019ve been in it a long time. It\u2019s probably one of our best between that and workers comp our best penetrated product, still a lot of opportunity there, and we are kind of driving a 5%, 6% kind of growth in that all the time and have more plans than anybody else. And then PEO really we are perfectly positioned over the last year or so with our PEO functionality and the product and the strength of the sales team and that has just taken off. PEO has had very strong growth. So I think there is absolutely a lot of opportunity there. We have continued to move ahead in our penetration but still lots of great opportunity in front of us.","Gary Bisbee","It sounds like the Affordable Care Act compliance has done really well in the last six months or so, since you have launched it. If we looked at your customer base, 50 plus employees, I mean is there a material amount who have signed up, or is that also just very, very early days at this point?","Martin Mucci","What we would say -- I don\u2019t think we have given out the numbers exactly of who is -- but we have done probably about almost 25% to a third of those who we think could take it, have taken it, at this point. So we\u2019ve still got some opportunity there and again I think it\u2019s we are going to wait to see what the kind of the surge is after the end of the year, like into the calendar year and people start to see how much work is involved in filing and monitoring what they are doing with that.","Gary Bisbee","Great, and then the retention, that\u2019s very positive, obviously - -do you have a sense how much of that is just better economy and small business health, due to the economy and what not versus just customers being much more satisfied and happy with the products, probably more of the second than the first but any commentary there, right now.","Efrain Rivera","So Gary, so here\u2019s a comparison. So if you go back to the when we published this information we were at a 21% loss rate in \u201911, now since 2011. Yeah, Marty can talk to some of the specific things that we\u2019ve would been on the upside. I think we've just gotten much, much better. But I think it's partially economy, but partially the result of the lot of things that we\u2019ve done. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think in '11 to '12 and a little bit to '13, it was much more the economy. What we're seeing now is much more about the service and the satisfaction levels. We've also gotten much better at getting into the -- very deeply into our service numbers and with what we call voice of the customer and you're getting immediate online kind of feedback. We also have set up national retention team that when we think a client is thinking about leaving, they go to a team that is focused nationally on retention and on preventing the loss and seeing what we can do to improve the situation. And that's been very helpful as well. ","So I think we've done a number -- and we've added 7\/24 service, we've added multi-product centers for the larger, the more mid-market clients. So overall I think a lot of this, the last year, particularly year and half has been much more about service and product strength. ","The other thing, there\u2019s service, customer service and then there is service from a functionality and feature set. I think both of those have been the bigger impact, the last year, year and half. ","Gary Bisbee","Great and then just one cleanup one. It looks like from the press release you have restated the average investment balances for funds from clients and corporate investment the year ago relative to what was in your press release a year ago. Why is that and is that sort of a one-time thing or you changed it going forward, thanks. ","Efrain Rivera","It\u2019s probably average, Gary. And I'm not entirely sure. My guess is since it's an average, the number could have bounced around a little bit. But I don't think it should have changed dramatically. I think it probably had something to do with the averages in that quarter. ","Gary Bisbee","Yes, okay. It looked like -- and it looked like the last quarter the same thing happened. The reason I ask is just the fund balance, if you use what was reported a year ago, looks like it grew 2.5, and I guess really today it\u2019s really saying no growth. Maybe let me ask a different way. On the pseudo [ph] rate\u2026 ","Efrain Rivera","We did call that out, I think, in the press release, that it didn't grow in Q4. But let me just say one thing Gary, before we go down a lengthy conversation on this; timing of when a quarter ends and begin can really kind of throw that number. So I just caution to look at what we say for year and six months as opposed to a given quarter. ","Gary Bisbee","Yeah and I guess just the last thing then just the pseudo rate drag which presumably continues for a while, and maybe a couple of years, that\u2019s getting to unemployment [ph], is that -- and I think you hold on to the pseudo money longer than a lot of the other buckets of withholding. So is that something we should think about being potentially a drag for the next two years or something on the growth of the [indiscernible] or is that something specifically\u2026 ","Efrain Rivera","I think it's going to have an impact at the margin. We do call that out in the press release that, that rates did impact the average client balances, probably not enough to make much of a difference. If you see, despite that Gary, our interest on funds held for clients were up 5% in the quarter. So it really shouldn't -- if it does become an issue what we'll call it out. Not anticipating that it will be one though. ","Gary Bisbee","Great, thank you. ","Efrain Rivera","Okay. ","Operator","Our next question is from Sara Gubbins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Sara Gubbins","Hi, thanks, good morning. You were talking about focusing on which units are growing. And I am wondering do you think we will see a shift towards larger clients overtime on average?","Efrain Rivera","I think you'll see a shift overtime on higher value clients on average. So not necessarily larger but just understanding. I think we've gotten much, much better at understanding what a particular client's needs are and putting as Marty said, the right team selling approach in front of that client, and trying to balance out the revenue opportunity of that client with the resources we put against that client. So we need both, you need to fill the funnel, because some of the smaller clients become bigger clients, but we also have recognized that focusing solely on smaller clients, who don't have necessary the same life time value as a larger client, you need to have certain balance between the two. So we're trying to strike it, sometimes very well, sometimes not so well. So that's what we're doing. ","Sara Gubbins","And from a margin perspective, would that client that is buying a larger bundle be higher margin?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, typically would be Sara. ","Sara Gubbins","Okay. Could you also give us an update on your planned sales headcount growth next year? ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so we're going to be growing sales headcount about 3%, this in next year's plan. ","Sara Gubbins","Okay, and then last question, is it fair to say that the impact of the two additional payroll days next year is a little less than 1% incremental to your payroll service revenue? ","Efrain Rivera","It is fair to say, it\u2019s precisely half a point. ","Sara Gubbins","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Green with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. ","Glenn Greene","Thanks, good morning. Just actually following up on the last question, maybe you could give us the sales bookings growth expectations you're thinking about for fiscal '16. Can you sort of continue with this sort of double digit base? And you did allude to headcount growth of 3%. So it implied with that would be sort of the headcount productivity. ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, I think directionally, we certainly are looking for double digit growth. I think we had a big year this year and some of that was included, obviously the Affordable Care Act products and PEO growth. So, but we're looking for the same kind of directional way to grow, which is about low double digit growth. ","Glenn Greene","Okay, and then Efrain, you alluded to the M&A pipeline being robust, but want to be sensitive on valuation, but maybe strategically where you're looking, where are you seeing the opportunities or what would you like to fill out?","Efrain Rivera","I'll let Marty handle that. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think really across the board, we look for client acquisition, so client base where we can grow our existing client base, as we look for some product tuck-ins. But we're in pretty good shape now. We had focused a lot on that over the last few years. But we look at expanding any of the areas, so anywhere from Payroll to 401(k), to PEO, across the board, and maybe a few new markets, we look international as well. We did an international acquisition in Germany about two years ago, now I guess. And so we continue to look in other countries and for ways to get in and get started. But growth in a lot of different ways, it's never been as robust. The problem, as Efrain said is getting it at the right valuation. ","Glenn Greene","Are there decent assets of sort of core meaningful, sort of core payroll clients, is that of interest and are there meaningful assets out there for sell? ","Martin Mucci","It's of interest, but I wouldn't say that there is anything out there right now, that's meaningful on the payroll side specifically. Everyone seems to be more interested in kind of staying the course and growing, and so at this point I don't -- we don't see as much there. There is certainly always a lot of small ones and we're very active with the sales team on that. But as far as the significant one I wouldn't say there is payroll one [ph] right there in front of this at this point. ","Glenn Greene","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. ","Martin Mucci","Okay. ","Operator","Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.","David Grossman","Thank you. Good morning. ","Martin Mucci","Hey, Dave. ","David Grossman","I was wondering if you can just go back to the HRS business and the bundle. So if you remove the PEO from those numbers, can you give us, I guess first fundamentally, if you think about when you just selling that bundle without the PEO as part of that, there is no insurance element that's an important part of the sale. Who are you really displacing there? Is there anybody or anything that you're displacing, or is this just an average [indiscernible] if you will or what's really being done internally? And can you give us a sense of just how big that bundled solution is when you again back out the PEO and what creative growth you're seeing in that business?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so if you don\u2019t consider the PEO, David and I'll come back to PEO because you have to consider it. But if you don't consider, for a second most of those clients are internal Paychex clients, who have grown to a size where they would like to have, in particular HR outsourcing as part of the bundle. So I would say, if you are looking solely at that portion of the client base, it's mostly internal clients. ","When you go to the PEO, that becomes a different animal because half -- almost half of the clients that we saw on the PEO are not clients of Paychex. So I can't tell you who we\u2019re taking share from, I can tell you that we had a very big year in PEO, worksite employees grew between 20% and 30% in the year. That's been -- that was our biggest year in many, many years in terms of PEO driven by ACA, better execution, great job by the HR sales force and also a great job by the ops people. ","So it's a little bit of a tale of two cities. Inside everything else is really more of an inside game. When you get to PEO specific, it's a combination of both inside and outside. ","David Grossman","And if you back it out, the PEO what is the bundled solution represented as a percentage of revenue? ","Efrain Rivera","Percentage of revenue\u2026 ","David Grossman","Yeah. ","Efrain Rivera","We don\u2019t disclose it. PEO still is not even -- it doesn't come close to half of the HR Services growth. So most of it is everything else meaning Retirement Services plus Insurance plus what we call our ASO offering. Those things are growing nicely. So in the absence of PEO, we'd still have a pretty nice growth rate on those businesses. ","David Grossman","Right. And then I guess if we could back to the concept of higher revenue per client, because it came up in a couple different comments, one, in the context of how you're driving the sales force and how to think about unit growth and our thinking of pricing, not just pricing in Payroll but pricing per client. So I think you said and maybe I just misunderstood this comment that it\u2019s -- the revenue per client is up $1,000 in the past few years and that sounds pretty high. So maybe you could explain a little bit about what that shift has been in terms of revenue per client today versus maybe what it was a couple of years ago and how we should think about where that's going to trend, particularly in the context of again this comment about bundled solution and trying to sell more into the existing business. ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, David I'm looking at the data from \u201911. So in \u201811 our revenue per client was about $3,700 -- I'm sorry service revenue was about $3,600 and by 2015 it had grown to about $4,600. So that's really a function of what Marty has been saying, what\u2019s said at the beginning of the call which is, if you went back to where we were four or five years ago, and I think this is not well understood about the company, I think we were a hooks and ladder approach. So let's hook him with Payroll and then let's ladder on everything else. We recognized post-recession that and this, to be fair, the credit goes to the sales force, and to our sales leader, he said, look certain clients need certain solutions very predictably. Let's do the data analytics and understand by size who needs what. So we did it and we said you know what lo and behold, if you're -- I won't say the number but a client of a certain size you typically, in our base are going to take x, y and z. ","If we know that, then let's put the right sales people in front of that client and we have one doing that. So that's what you're seeing there. Obviously there is pricing too. So I don't want to completely oversell the point, but I do think we have simply gotten better at understanding when we have a client, and by the way, we had well over a 100,000 of them that we sold, we have a lot of opportunities to go in and say, hey here's what you really need, if you're a client of a certain size. And because of the breadth of what we offer, we have a lot more opportunities than most people to do that. So I think that's what's occurring there. ","David Grossman","So then, what's the right way to think that about the pricing units equation, because right now you're trending, as you mentioned about 2% client growth. So and that's everybody, right, I mean I guess that\u2019s Payroll but I know you said you got others, but how do you want us to think that about the pricing element, because it's really not that 3%. I mean it's really more driven by what the change in revenue per client\u2019s going to be rather than the change in payroll price?","Efrain Rivera","Hey, I'm not ready to give a guidance on that, that's a good point. I think you can do the math. If you look at revenue -- basically we give you enough by giving all of the clients and the breakouts of service revenue and you can see what the growth in revenue per client has been, you can see this isn\u2019t a mystery, do the math and it's certainly mid-single digits or above. So we're playing two games here, and I think it's important to understand that we've evolved the way we think about approaching the market, not just get more units and then put pricing on the units, but get more units, get pricing and get the right mix of clients, so that we can sell more feature rich bundles. ","Just one final point I would make, David. Right now, if you compare what our sales force sells today to 10 years ago, very different animal in the Payroll space. We've got three bundles that basically take you from a basic payroll bundle to what is a pretty integrated HCM suite, that you can sell under 50. So we are -- we allow the Payroll sales force to sell any one of those three bundles and we want them to capture the right set of revenue and we want to get the right mix of units, but we want to get as much share of wallet too as we can, when we have a sale. So you can model it out. I think we given enough info there to kind of come to some conclusions on that. ","David Grossman","Okay, great, thanks for that. And then just last, a little bit it\u2019s just repeated [ph] question here. You mentioned that we anniversary the minimum employment -- the change in the PEO in the second half of the last year. So was there any impact on the fourth quarter growth rate of 16%?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, this is the last time we'll call out. In the fourth quarter there was probably a pickup of about 1% in the quarter for minimum premium. So that brought it down to 15 or so, or probably a little bit under that, maybe between 14% and 15%. There were just a lot of, as I said before, vectors that lined up to drive -- deliver that quarter. By the way we have called it a year ago. So we were expecting that by the end of the year we were going to have a pretty strong fourth quarter and I think that when we have this discussion a year ago I think there were some concerns about the fact that we were back ended or ahead more of a backend bias to our guidance. ","But we thought we've ended up -- end up in the fourth quarter with a strong quarter and we ended up in the fourth quarter with a strong quarter. So we expect obviously based on the guidance for growth rates to moderate somewhat but that will see how the year progresses. ","David Grossman","Right, but is there -- I guess that's what I was getting at, is there anything in the business that you're seeing that would support that deceleration or are you just saying you know what\u2026? ","Efrain Rivera","No, no, there are really kind of three specific things that support our thesis that it will decelerate. The first thing, as I said, the PEO worksite employee growth was tremendous in the year. So we started from a lower base and by the end of the year we had hit an all-time high in terms of work-site employees. So now I start at a higher base and it\u2019s -- I'd love to think I'll have exactly the same year. 30 years of experience tells me that it\u2019s probably not going to occur. That's the first thing. ","The second thing is the back half of the year we had strong sales of Affordable Care Act compliance products. We again think that that's going to moderate as we go through the year. And then the third thing is we had a very strong year in 401(k) and we expect that to moderate. That's a planning assumption. I would just say that's we said similar things last year and we were trying to project even more, even more a complex set of revenue and we came within several million dollars of what we expected to hit. So I think that's where we called it, we could end up being conservative. ","David Grossman","Hey, great. Thank you and good luck. ","Efrain Rivera","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Silber","Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick numbers questions. Efrain, in the quarter, operating expenses rolling up a little less than 3% relative to the rest of the year, that [indiscernible] decelerated. Anything going on there specifically? ","Efrain Rivera","Basically it was just, Jeff the anniversaring of the minimum premium plan which was adopted in Q4. And so in our operating expenses you saw a low single digit that just because we're getting the more normalized compare on operating expenses in the quarter, that really kind of drove most of that difference. ","Jeffrey Silber","So that really shouldn't impact next year at all?","Efrain Rivera","No.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, great and then your guidance for on interest on funds held for clients relatively flat. I understand you're not expecting any increase in interest expense, but shouldn't we see an increase in funds held for clients, that should drive that a little bit higher. ","Efrain Rivera","I think it should be higher, Jeff. I think there is an element of conservatism in that number but what I'd say is this when the Fed raises rates will help a better sense of what the shape of yield curve is. And right now I\u2019m duration neutral ","Better sense of what the shape of the yield curve is and right now I'm duration neutral. If we like the yield curve then we may extend a bit. And so right now my thinking is duration relatively neutral, I know where the intermediate portion of the bond yield curve is. And all of that equates to flattish. It's probably going to be a bit up from where we're at, but not enough to really materially change things until I have a sense of what the Fed\u2019s doing and what it signals more importantly, when it does its first increase, whether it going to signal rapid future increases or not. ","I would just say we've been faked out so much than I'm a little bit gun shy in terms of making any calls on what's going to happen. So that's our book process. ","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, great, I understand, thanks so much. ","Operator","Our next question is from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is open.","Jim MacDonald ","Yeah, good morning guys. Could you give us some of your thoughts on the middle market area? How it's doing and what your expectations are for next year? ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, I think this year is -- right now as we're heading into '16. I think we feel good about the product and feature set that's out there for our sales folks to sell. I think we're feeling we've had some kick offs to the fiscal year already for the sales team. And there is a lot of excitement there. Obviously some competition has cropped up over the last couple of years but we don't see that having a big impact so far. So I think the market has somewhat expanded. I do think the need for HR and time and attendance and so forth has come down market. So that mid-market is anything from frankly from 20, 25 plus. And we're seeing a lot more need there. ","So I feel pretty good that the mid-market in '16 will be a strong year for us and that's what we're planning on. And then we're well positioned for both from a sales experience and sales team, very fully trained and full staffed. And then from a product and feature set and service perspective we're in good shape. ","Jim MacDonald ","Great, and then you talked a lot about the ACA but at the risk of adding one more. So any impact in January of a 1095 form, do you think that will have any kind of material impact? And do you think the charge will be similar or more than say W2. ","Efrain Rivera","Well, I think for the whole service we're charging kind of a monthly charge that gives you both monitoring and recording. And so I don't think you'll see any big blip or big change there. The big change would be if we sale a lot more of it because in that timeframe, they start to realize that there is a penalties that the filing is more difficult than they think and so forth. And so I don't think you'll see any big blip in Q3 because of that. What you'll hopefully see is more sales all through the year and we'll continue to update Jim that as we go through the quarters. ","Jim MacDonald ","Okay, thanks a lot. ","Efrain Rivera","Okay. ","Operator","Our next question is from Chenjin Wong [ph] with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Just on the client side, I know I heard a lot about shifting towards higher value clients. That all make sense but I'm curious, how -- from a unit perspective how is SurePayroll performing because I guess we could infer that there is a mix shift away from that. ","Efrain Rivera","So I don't think that's a fair assumption. I think that they -- SurePayroll is doing fine, relatively a small part of our revenue base, as said in the past. Sure really doesn't influence the revenue picture very much a little bit. Certainly revenues influences the unit picture but no significant change from that perspective. I want to be careful it could be misunderstood that we don't think that microenterprise space is important. We think it is important and it's important for a number of different reasons, not just because it represents a source of revenue, but a lot of those clients, we now see, have an opportunity to become full service outsourced clients. And if they build the right relationships with Paychex their lifetime value will be significant. ","So we're not pivoting away from that, just thinking through how best to maximize the revenue opportunity we have with each sale. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Yeah I know you pretty much have sort of talked about the sort of this the pendulum between do yourself and outsourcing for a while. Just feel like it shifting towards outsourcing on my side. But I'm curious are you seeing any new trends there and just lastly the clarification on retention, can you -- did you give revenue retention as well as unit retention?","Efrain Rivera","I didn\u2019t give revenue retention, revenue retention this last year was about 86%.","Martin Mucci","And I don\u2019t think we are seeing a big shift or anything, but as Efrain said SurePayroll\u2019s still doing well in that micro market. We are certainly still feeling good about the under 20 here and what we are seeing in selling on that side. I don\u2019t think there has been a big shift, although I do think that it -- everything is kind of coming down, as I said. So there is more need for even the under 20, more of getting -- we\u2019ve had good success in selling time clocks and now the online time and attendance, even to smaller clients that we didn\u2019t think would need it. I think that may drive more to outsource because it\u2019s not just simple payroll calculations where they are doing it themselves. I think they will look more for a well-rounded offering that integrates everything and that like time and attendance you can punch in and punch out on the mobile phone now. ","So as those things keep getting easier and better integrated and coming down market I think more small will outsource.","Unidentified Analyst ","Yeah, okay good, thanks guys appreciate the update. See you in a couple of weeks.","Martin Mucci","All right.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Good morning.","Mark Marcon","With regards to your MMS clients, what percentage are on the latest version, the most up-to-date version of your solution?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve really given that out yet. We\u2019re going through -- the clients we are getting good satisfaction on the existing product. I would say the new sales are definitely leaning 70%-80% toward the new product, and featured functionality set, that that\u2019s fitting those. And I think you will see that shipped close to that, 90% to 100% in this upcoming fiscal year and then other clients will move over. There is not a big forced migration or any need for that, necessarily at all because they are still happy with the former product. But I would say it\u2019s from a sales perspective it\u2019s 80% and we\u2019ll be growing and existing base and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really given that out. ","So but it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve given that Flex Enterprise has been growing here. It\u2019s a pretty small -- it\u2019s a fairly small percentage and but we\u2019ll continue to grow obviously over the next two years.","Mark Marcon","I am assuming the satisfaction level with Flex is higher than the base, is that correct?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, although the base is pretty comfortable with the product we haven\u2019t -- it\u2019s not like there is a major issue there. I think it\u2019s more but Flex is little bit higher, but it\u2019s not -- the base is not like totally unsatisfied or leaving or anything like that. We would step up the migration but we\u2019re not seeing that. I think it\u2019s, Flex is driving a lot more to the clients. Our goal there is to pull them over by saying hey, look at the additional feature, functionality integration and online opportunities you have there from this offering than what you have but there is not any general dissatisfaction with the existing product at this point.","Mark Marcon","Okay, and then with regards to the retention rate, I mean it\u2019s improved nicely over the years. Where do you think that can ultimately go to, do you think you have hit a peak level or do you think there is still room for improvement with regards to that retention rate assuming the economic environment doesn\u2019t change?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question, I think we always struggle with it. I think we\u2019re feeling very strong that it\u2019s over 82%. It\u2019s obviously the best we\u2019ve ever had. I think we\u2019ll continue to try that. We\u2019re always trying to drive it a little bit higher. Can you get it pass 83% or 84%, given that small client and the rate of turnover? I think you might be able to get it up another 50 to 100 basis points, maybe a little bit more overtime but it\u2019s a struggle, but it is really what we are driving now and John Gibson leading the service team is really driving a lot of service options in trying to with this voice of the customer we are getting great feedback. ","We are responding to the customers even faster and we\u2019re learning how much effort. We now have systems that are learning how much effort they have to put into to either mobile online or talking to the payroll specialist and then we can kind of build their service around it, so it\u2019s much more sophisticated. Who knows maybe we could drive it to 83% to 83.5% or something. I don\u2019t think too much further than that.","Mark Marcon","Okay, and then with regards to the delta between the bookings growth relative to the total service revenue growth, can you just go through the -- why those wouldn't be closer?","Efrain Rivera","Well, I'm not sure why you have assumed that Mark. Remember that each year in order to grow [indiscernible], replace the 18% [ph] clients plus get an incremental growth. So even if you had a real strong year in terms of sales you wouldn't see that reflected unless you had a series of those years in a row reflected in the base. So I think we are comfortable that we're seeing revenue growth in the base, but you just don't see it from one year to the other. ","Mark Marcon","Got it. And what percentage of the client base currently is getting the 1095 or has signed up for the 1095 program?","Efrain Rivera","We're not discussing that number. But Marty indicated that of the people that we thought -- early in the call, the people that we thought might be clients it was 25% plus. ","Mark Marcon","Great, thank you. ","Efrain Rivera","Okay thanks Mark. ","Operator","Your next question is from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis","Hey guys. To what extent are you or the PEO and HR outsourcing markets more broadly, do you think impacted, if we see this big wave of consolidation across HMOs as well as other HR service providers?","Efrain Rivera","I think there is going to still be plenty of choice out there and opportunity to offer. You got to remember if they're combining and we are still going to have, I think very competitive products to compete. I don't think it's everyone are going to combine so much that you don't have enough choice and competition there. So I don't think it will impact us too much at this point. I think actually to some degree it might make it easier from an operational perspective. We -- when we got into the health insurance business, selling health insurance years ago we have to go out and connect with the top three carriers in every city and the number were -- it gets to be very large and complicated, to the degree that, that begins to consolidate it might make operationally things even easier, and you might actually have a little bit more clout with getting connection issues resolved and actually make the business more efficient. ","So I think we have to wait and see how it is but I think the choice was -- enough choice will still be there. And I think actually it might even improve some of the customer service by the connections we have with them. ","Lisa Ellis","Got it, and then it looks like SG&A for the full year was up 9% this past year, with a little bit of I guess lumpy uptick in this last quarter. You mention that headcount growth you're targeting about 3% next year. Does that mean that we would expect SG&A growth to moderate relative to this year? ","Efrain Rivera","It should moderate a bit. We just had a really a very, very strong sales growth this year. We expect it to be good next year but probably moderate a bit from the growth rate that we saw this year. ","Lisa Ellis","Terrific, thanks. ","Operator","Our next question\u2019s from Phil Stiller with Citi. Your line is open.","Phil Stiller","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I've just couple of quick follow-ups. Efrain you said the two extra payroll days this year will add about 50 basis points to the growth rates. Just wondering what the impact on fiscal '17 will be if you have that analysis. Are we going to lose all of that 50 basis points or can\u2026? ","Efrain Rivera","Good question, Phil. I haven\u2019t and I will tell you this, I have buried in trying to figure out this call plus the Board meeting. So I haven\u2019t looked at '17. It will have an impact. It's hard to say without understanding what -- where we end up from a client perspective and some of the other revenue issues we discussed. So it will have some modest impact on '17, too early to call. ","Phil Stiller","Okay, and then lastly on M&A, I guess you talked about it earlier but on the valuation commentary without being sensitive. I guess what metrics are you looking at? Are you willing to buy things that have higher multiples than your own stock? ","Efrain Rivera","We -- when asked this question Marty and I -- we look at technology and we understand that if someone\u2019s got a nice mousetrap we are going to have to pay for it. But that's why we think, being in a position of financial strength is important. So we look at it differently if it's a pure technology buy or it's primarily technology, or if it's more of a client based play or a mixture of both. So our metrics adjust based on what it is we are buying. You pay for innovation, we understand that. So we\u2019re willing to look at businesses that we think have good technology but we are not willing to excessively overpay for that technology.","Phil Stiller","Okay, thanks.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Our last question is from Matt O\u2019Neill with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Matthew O\u2019Neill","Hey guys, thanks for sneaking me in at the end here. I just had a quick clarification, the 590 in clients, is that inclusive of SurePayroll?","Efrain Rivera","Correct, yes, it would be.","Matthew O\u2019Neill","Got it. And then just noticing some recent announcements from some new entrants\/potential competitors, most recently yesterday Square kind of formulized their payroll offering at least in California anyway. Is there any kind of anecdotal evidence you guys are hearing reported back from your sales force as far as dynamics or shifts or anything kind of going on the competitive front or is it still the usual players that we are all used to, that you guys see day in day out?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, it\u2019s still pretty much the usual players. I know that obviously there has been a lot of announcements but it really hasn\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t seen a big impact there, some for price but I think when they look at the feature functionality, the size of the company, whether it\u2019s public or not, meaning that you are trusting your payroll taxes, a very significant cost as a small business with someone and that limited functionality and the limited compliance resources, when you think about Paychex we have 200 people that focus on compliance and been able to deal with all the agencies federal, state and local, it has not been a big impact at this point. We certainly take all competitors very seriously but we haven\u2019t seen a big impact at this point at all.","Matthew O\u2019Neill","Got it, and so based on the sort of sales strategy of going kind of all-in, would you actually quantify it as potentially being harder for a new entrant to compete against somebody like you, with that backdrop, I guess of product offerings?","Efrain Rivera","So Matt we\u2019ll talk about this at our Investor Day and I think that what, the people who pitched the segregation pieces are selling is the notion that integrated solutions are less important than getting the best deal in every disaggregated portion of the bundle. We can tell you that when you tie that together with technology and you have very good offerings in each of the service areas that a small medium size enterprise wants, that\u2019s a wining preposition. That\u2019s what they are looking for and then put world class service on top of that with a great mobile platform, you got a pretty powerful combination. ","So if you are going to compete against that with one cheap payroll offering I think you are going to be challenged.","Matthew O\u2019Neill","Got it, thanks very much. I won\u2019t take any more time.","Efrain Rivera","Good, thanks.","Operator","That is all the questions we have gentlemen.","Martin Mucci","All right, thank you. At this point we\u2019ll close the meeting and if you are interesting in replaying the webcast of this conference call it will be archived until August 3rd. Thank you for your interest in Paychex. We very much appreciate your participation in our call and we look forward hopefully to see many of you at our Investor Day in just a few weeks in Rochester, New York. Thank you and take care.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference call we thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. And have a great rest of your day."],"17384":["Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) Q3 2013 Earnings Call March 28, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Martin Mucci - Chief Executive Officer, President, Director and Chairman of Executive Committee","Efrain Rivera - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Treasurer","Analysts","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Paul B.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would like to introduce your host for the call today, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Sherry. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of Paychex's third quarter fiscal 2013 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday afternoon, after the market closed, we released our financial results for the third quarter ending February 28, 2013, and filed our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter. These documents are available by accessing our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.","On today's call, I will review the highlights for the third quarter in our operations, sales and product development areas, and Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for your questions.","Our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 reflect continued solid progress. We are focused on driving growth in revenue and profits, with industry-leading service and technology solutions given to our clients and their employees. Our client base, checks per payroll and client retention demonstrate continued positive growth. Efrain will go into more detail on the financial results and the comparisons. However, I'd like to provide you a few highlights from the quarter.","Payroll revenue grew by 2% due to the increases in both checks per payroll and revenue per check. This growth rate is up from the first half of the fiscal year. HRS revenue grew double-digit for the third quarter as we continue to experience success in selling 401(k) and HR outsourcing and other value-added solutions to our clients. Total service revenue grew 4%.","Checks per payroll has improved for 12 consecutive quarters and was stronger than anticipated. Third quarter growth was about 2.3% compared to 1.8% for the prior year third quarter. Checks per payroll was positively impacted by a higher calendar year-end bonus payment activity. Execution in operations remained solid, as evidenced by the exceptionally strong client satisfaction results. It is our exceptional client service, along with our technology, that sets us apart. The dedication of our employees has resulted in client retention that remains at record levels and through the first 9 months, have us on track for another strong year of retention and possibly our best ever. In addition, the operations team did a great job for our clients with year-end processing and the distribution of our W-2s and year-end reporting that ended ahead of schedule.","Our third quarter is our peak selling season, and we put a lot of focus throughout the year on sales execution. We added new territories, focused on market segmentation in both payroll, as well as 401(k) and other areas and got involved in more franchise and banking opportunities. We had a good momentum going into our selling season, and we are pleased with our selling results. We are particularly pleased with the increase in new sales revenue generated from our core payroll sales team and SurePayroll and the strong sales in our retirement services and HR solutions, including our PEO business.","In addition, we have seen core sales force turnover remain at lower, more historic levels. We expect to continue to see additional penetration of our products and services within our client base, with the goal of increasing our share of revenue from our clients.","From a technology perspective, progress continues on integrating our leading technology and mobility platform with our world-class customer service through the Paychex next-generation suite of products. From a mobility platform, we have continued to add more capabilities, including flexible spending account information and including employer and employee health and benefit insurance information, being just released tomorrow, that keeps our product as the most thorough and client-friendly mobility app for information in the marketplace.","We have been positioning Paychex to capture the opportunity from the shift to online and SaaS solutions. We have market-leading SaaS solutions leveraging the latest technologies and continue to invest heavily in our SaaS and online capabilities and mobile applications. Our recent acquisitions have all been SaaS-oriented business models, and all of our core clients are on SaaS platform. And we are continuing to build out our platform to accommodate even more functionality for our mid-market clients. Our SurePayroll product, which is also a SaaS solution, continues to do well with strong sales and revenue growth.","In summary, year-to-date fiscal 2013 reflects continued progress in growth metrics, and we are very appreciative of the efforts and results of our leadership team and the employees at Paychex across the country and in Germany.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty. Let me start out with our standard legal disclosure. Certain written and oral statements made by us constitute forward-looking statements, and I'd just say that you refer to our press release for the discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors.","As Marty indicated, third quarter results for fiscal 2013 represented good progress. Here's some of the key highlights for the quarter and 9 months. I will provide greater detail in certain areas and then wrap with a review of our 2013 outlook.","Total service revenue grew 4% for both the third quarter and for the 9 months. Interest on funds held for clients was flat for the third quarter and decreased 6% for the 9 months to $11 million and $31 million, respectively. This result was a byproduct of the low interest rate environment, offset by an increase in average investment balances. Expenses increased moderately, 3% for both the third quarter and for the 9 months.","We continue to invest at a higher rate in product development and supporting technology, but this was partially offset by increased productivity within operations, which allowed us to maintain our solid operating margins. Note that recent business acquisitions had immaterial impact on quarterly revenue growth and expense growth.","Operating margin was 36.8% for the third quarter and 40.5% for the 9 months. Operating income net of certain items increased 7% to $214 million for the third quarter and 6% to $662 million for the 9 months. We expect operating margin for the full year to be in the range of 37% to 38%.","Net income increased 7% to $145 million for the third quarter and 5% to $446 million for the 9 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.40 per share for the third quarter and $0.04 (sic) [4%] to $1.22 per share for the 9 months.","Let me talk a little bit more about payroll revenue. It increased 2% for the third quarter and 1% for the 9 months. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check. As Marty already mentioned, our checks per payroll metric continued to improve and was stronger than anticipated, increasing 2.3% compared to the same period last year. This result was partially due to higher calendar year-end bonus payment activity during the quarter. Revenue per check grew modestly as a result of price increases, partially offset by discounting. Payroll growth was tempered by 1 less payroll processing day in the quarter due to the leap year in the prior year. The impact of this 1 processing day on payroll revenue growth is approximately 0.5%. As we've said on past calls, payroll revenue is expected to be stronger in the fourth quarter.","HRS. HRS revenue increased 10% to $189 million for the third quarter and 10% to $553 million for the 9 months. HRS revenue growth reflects favorable trends in client growth and price increase. Some highlights of contributions to HRS revenue growth include the following: Retirement services revenue benefited from client growth, price increases and an increase in the average asset value of retirement services client employees' funds. This was partially offset by the impact from a shift in the mix of assets within these funds to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers.","Paychex HR Solutions was positively impacted by growth in both clients and client employees and price increases. The rate of growth was tempered by fewer client employees on average within our PEO compared to the quarter ago. However, we've seen an improvement in both new sales and client retention in the PEO during our peak selling season, and both PEO clients and client employees were higher at the end of the third quarter compared to a year ago.","Insurance services revenue benefited from growth in the number of applicants, though at moderating levels, while workers' comp insurance delivered increases in both clients and premiums. We expect that health care reform will impact our insurance revenue -- services revenue moderately going forward.","Our eServices revenues were positively impacted by client growth and price increases, particularly as we continue to focus on adding SaaS-based solutions.","HRS service revenue quarterly growth can vary due to the volume of clients and basis points earned on Retirement Services client employees' funds. Basis points fee revenue changes are due to fluctuations in the financial market and the asset value of funds invested. PEO net service revenue, as we mentioned previously, also exhibits greater variability between quarters due to a number of factors, including changes in workers' comp claims experienced.","Turning to our investment portfolio. We maintain a fairly conservative investment policy, as you all know. Our goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. Our priority has been and will continue to be, as we continually say, to ensure that we can meet all of our cash commitments to clients. On the short-term side, the primary investment vehicle is high-quality variable rate demand notes and FDIC-insured deposit accounts.","In our longer-term portfolio, we continue to invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds. The interest rate environment remains constrained. Our combined portfolios have earned in average a rate of return of about 1% for the third quarter compared to 1.1% for the same period last year and 1.1% for the 9 months compared to 1.2% for the same period last year.","Interest on funds held for clients was flat for the third quarter and decreased 6% for the 9 months to $11 million and $31 million, respectively. The decrease was driven by the decline in the average rate of return, which was offset by increases in average balances of 6% and 4% for the quarter and 9 months, respectively.","The average rate of return was also impacted by our allocation of investments to a greater percentage in tax-exempt securities within our short-term portfolio. As our interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income are reported before taxes, the return appears lower on average with a greater mix of tax-exempt investments.","The increase in average investment balances was primarily driven by the expiration of the payroll tax cut holiday, which resulted in higher Social Security withholdings, favorable trends in checks per payroll and wage inflation.","Our investment income decreased 11% to $1 million for the third quarter and increased 13% to $5 million for the 9 months. The decrease for the quarter was due to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances as a result of the accelerated dividend payment to shareholders in December 2012. The increase for the 9 months was mainly due to higher average investment balances resulting from investing the cash generated from operations.","I'll now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $798 million as of February 28, and we continue to have no debt. Funds held for clients as of February 28 were $5.6 billion compared to $4.5 billion as of May 31, 2012. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.6 billion for the 9 months, a year-over-year increase of 4%. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $52 million as of February 28 compared with the net unrealized gains of $60 million as of May 31, 2012. Total stockholders' equity was $1.6 billion as of the end of the quarter, reflecting $477 million in dividends paid during the first 9 months. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 35%.","Cash flows from operations were $606 million for the first 9 months, an 8% increase compared to the prior. The increase was driven by higher net income and timing related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities.","Now turning to guidance. We reaffirmed our guidance for fiscal 2013. I'd like to remind you that our outlook is based on current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Payroll revenue growth, 2% to 3% based on anticipated client base growth and modest increases in revenue per check. We anticipate stronger revenue growth in our fourth quarter, consistent with our guidance provided in June 2012.","Our HRS revenue growth is expected to be in line with our historical experience, and total service revenue is anticipated to be at the low end of the range of 5% to 6%. We anticipate minimal impact from prior acquisitions, and our operating margin for the year is anticipated to be approximately 37% to 38%. This is slightly lower than the margin experienced in the first 9 months of fiscal 2013, as our margins are historically lower in the second half of the fiscal year due to more spending. We do anticipate a continued increase in the percentage of tax-exempt investments in our short-term portfolio. And investment income net of -- net growth is in a range of 0% to 5%, reflects the impact of anticipated lower investment rates and average cash balances.","And now I'll turn it back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Efrain. We will now open the meeting to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question in queue comes from David Togut of Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Marty, you referred to strong bookings trends year-over-year in the third quarter. Can you quantify what the year-over-year bookings growth was in Q3, both for the payroll services business and the HR services business?","Martin Mucci","No. We don't -- David, we don't get that specific. But I will tell you that it's certainly the best new revenue we've seen in a number of years, new sales revenue on the core payroll side in particular and where we've put a lot of effort. So while we don't give the actual detailed number, we certainly were pleased with the new -- the level of the new business revenue that came in. And in comparison to the last 3 or 4 years, it certainly was very positive.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. I believe for Q2, you indicated bookings were sort of flattish or down a little year-over-year. Did you actually see bookings growth year-over-year in Q3?","Martin Mucci","We certainly have seen growth, and I'd say they were fairly flat. We did see some improvement in Q2, but we certainly saw positive growth in the third quarter during our peak selling season, and we were pleased with it.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, Efrain, OpEx was down year-over-year. It looks like you did have a restatement in the year-over-year operating expenses. But is declining operating expenses sustainable with revenue growing at about a 4% clip?","Efrain Rivera","I noticed in some of the notes, people were asking the same question, David. So here's our view. We think that the investments in technology should lead to increases in productivity. And Marty made the decision 4 or 5 years ago to start the acceleration of IT expense, and what you're seeing there is a result of a strategy, not a result of something opportunistic that we did in the quarter. So I can't guarantee it will be flat. Marty and I won't do that. But what we can guarantee is that we're committed to leveraging expenses, and that's what you saw in the quarter.","Martin Mucci","Yes, that's exactly right.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. And just finally, can you bracket for us what the net price increase is year-to-date in payroll services once you've offset the discounting against the gross price increase?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. And what I've said, David, consistent is we were at the lower end of what we've talked about at the -- at our Investor Day in the summer, and that range was 2% to 4%. We're at the lower end of that range.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just finally, what would be your expected price increase for payroll services in fiscal 2014?","Efrain Rivera","We're going to be in that range, and we'll talk to you more about it on the next call.","Operator","And our next question in queue will come from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I just wanted to build a little bit on the last question here. So with pricing kind of running at the lower end of the range, as you guys said, and when you roll that into revenue growth, you're running, I guess, 1% to 2% so far this fiscal year. I understand Q4 will accelerate to maybe 3% or so. You guys had talked about kind of a mid-single-digit guidance for the 3-year period, 2013 to 2015, last summer. I mean, is that something you still are very comfortable you can attain? And how much improvement do you need in terms of new business creation to actually get there?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I think, Jason, to your point, yes, we talked about that as a target. I don't think we committed to saying we'd do that every year. What we need is unit growth and we need good price attainment, and you can never say you're comfortable about something. But we certainly think that within this period, that's something that we're targeting.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I guess to your point, I mean that's kind of a CAGR target over that period, is that right?","Efrain Rivera","No. I don't view it, and I think it's going to be a little bit difficult given kind of we're starting at 2%. I think that's what we think is possible in this environment. And again, as I said, we need some unit growth, we need price to get there. So that's what we're executing against.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, so it sounds more like mid-single digits is kind of aspirational at some point during that period, but not in aggregate over that period. Is that fair?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. It will be tough to do that in aggregate over that period.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. What percent of new businesses created that you guys have won, fiscal year-to-date, are choosing the SurePayroll product versus the full service offering? And has there been any material change in that mix over the past couple of years?","Efrain Rivera","There hasn't been a significant change in that mix. And what I'd say is that we have consciously been devising strategies, working on our strategies from a sales standpoint so that those lines get a little bit blurred. And SurePayroll's growing rapidly. And as Marty said, we also had growth in revenue in our core payroll business. So this was a quarter where we saw growth in both segments of the business.","Martin Mucci","Yes, remember that -- Jason, we still see that as they're getting their share of new business growth that are still wanting to do it themselves or be online only. And we're getting our share of new business growth that is coming to those who want to totally outsource. So it's not like we're seeing a shift between the 2. We're seeing there's opportunity for both, and I think we don't really see it as a kind of a total pie for us, that is now shifting to them or anything. Both -- SurePayroll is obviously doing well. There are smaller numbers to grow on, but they're seeing nice growth in their sales and revenue, and we're seeing nice growth in our revenue as well on the sales.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So in other words, not cannibalizing the core at this point?","Martin Mucci","Not really, we're not. No.","Efrain Rivera","No. One thing I should clarify, we just finished a marketing study on payroll services, pretty extensive study. There's no evidence whatsoever that an outsourcer goes back to a DIY solution. It just doesn't exist. So the issue's really kind of capture at the front end, not erosion of existing clients. So people select a solution and then tend to stay with it.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And just lastly on that point, can you just remind us what the average annual difference is in annual revenue between a SurePayroll customer and a client on the traditional full service platform?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So SurePayroll is going to be around 1,800 and traditional core -- I'm sorry, 800. And a traditional payroll, I should say, traditional is a long way, our fully outsourced solution is going to start around 1,800.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Thomas with Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just continuing on the new sales for the quarter, any way to size or think about the incremental benefit from new market segmentation or the focus on franchise and banking channels?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think this was -- this growth was more execution than those 2 channels. I think what we've done is we've put a lot of effort into that, and we're starting to see that pay off and getting some new bank agreements, referral agreements and picking up on some key franchises. But I think that's going to build over time. This has been -- in the selling season here that we're most pleased about, I think it's been execution. One, the turnover is back to the low 30% range, which we've been historically. The leadership team's in place, a lot of good things going on that Mark Bottini and the team have done. And so I think this has mostly been about execution, so we've had upside on the other things that we're doing.","Efrain Rivera","We're also seeing, Paul, some incremental productivity from the salespeople that we added. So that will start to become more annualized next year, but we've seen some good results there.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, it makes sense. And what's the sense at this point if the Affordable Care Act had any net positive or net negative impact on sales for the upcoming year? And was there any sense of increased caution on hiring or more demand for services to sort through the new rules?","Martin Mucci","I think it's been light right now, but I think it's going to pick up this year. We've done a lot of work. We're getting information out to not only the current client base but social media in what we can provide for our clients. Being a company that not only obviously longstanding in payroll but has health insurance and has been doing this now for 4 or 5 years, we can really provide, I think, some unique benefit to them. And we're getting that message out, and it's starting to, I think, get through to clients that they've got to do it. But I think there wasn't a lot of that in that first -- in this third quarter and peak selling season. I think you'll see more of that this year and because that's when it's really starting to hit them, is right now that they're going to have to do something. So we're expecting some -- certainly some support from that, that clients will just find this just too confusing and will look for outsourcer help.","Operator","And our next question will come from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Marty, I just wanted to understand, it seems like you're having success with new sales. It seems like some of the results you're seeing now are better than they have been in the last 3 or 4 years. Are you equating this to -- is this the economy getting better or is this that Paychex is just doing things a little bit differently and, as a result, you're seeing better results?","Martin Mucci","It's a great question. I think the economy is kind of slowly picking up. If you look at the checks per client continuing to be up. I think that's positive. The NFIB Indexes and things like that, the external measures are showing that it's slightly positive. I don't think there's -- we haven't seen a big surge in certainly in new business start-ups and growth that we still think there'll be. I think this has been a little bit more about execution, about getting turnover back down to historic levels, about training, about leadership. And so I think the market side of it will still be upside to us as that comes back. It's slowly coming back like you're seeing housing come back a little bit, prices going up, some construction being done in new homes. That will drive more new businesses, but that's still a slow tick. I think what we've seen is better execution and leadership.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then there's a lot of discussion about using mobile technology and having applications, mobile applications for customers. Is there an opportunity to monetize on that? Or is it right now you just need to have those so that you can be competitive in the market?","Martin Mucci","I think to start, you have to have them to be -- to compete in the market. They're kind of table stakes. And so we got into that a few years ago, as Efrain mentioned, the investment. And now that's really paying off. I think we have the best mobile app out there. We're introducing tomorrow, updating the iPhone app for health and benefit insurance information for employees and employers, really giving them a lot of information. I think it's a place where they can go for information and make it easy for them. It's not so much about doing their payroll as it is about gaining the information that they need when they need it. And so I think you need that to compete. I'm not sure that a client just goes to it just for that. And as we're seeing, it's more of a hybrid type of thing. It's going to a full-service outsourcer who knows what they're doing and will take care of things for them like the Affordable Care Act. But if I need information on my phone, on my tablet, I can get that as well. I can do it the way I want to do it, when I want to do it.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And just one last question, Efrain, you're up to $800 million on the balance sheet, no debt. How do you use that cash? Are there acquisition opportunities potentially that you see for the business that can help accelerate the growth rate or is it about thinking about returning that capital back to shareholders?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. That's a good question. So we have the authorization. We said we'd buy opportunistically. The last quarter hasn't presented the opportunistic opportunities to do so, but we'll look to do that going forward. There's a lot of attractive opportunities out there, and we are very committed to not overpaying for opportunities simply for the sake of growth. We just are not going to do that. And so we evaluate almost every important opportunity that comes on the market, are competitive on most of them and pass where we don't think the numbers are right. We think one of those will land where we want to at some point, and we'll make the acquisition. In the meantime, what we've been doing is buying smaller acquisitions, smaller businesses that we think have both organic growth capability and can be easily integrated into our platform. So we did an acquisition in the expense management area and also in talent management. We think that, that in the short term is a good way to do it. But if a good opportunity comes up, we want to have the powder dry to be able to do that. So we're at $800 million, as I mentioned. And if we don't see opportunities for some period of time, then we'll look at ways to returning that to shareholders as we've mentioned in previous calls.","Operator","Our next question in queue comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just going back to the new core payroll sales for one last time. It looked like you said that the revenues from those sales was strong. How about the client numbers from those sales or maybe you could talk about those 2?","Martin Mucci","Yes, we don't talk as much about units except kind of once a year and talk about the client base, and we didn't really want to get into that kind of detail. I will -- I think I will say more has been driven by revenue per unit. We've seen a nice revenue per unit, which is a nice execution thing on the sales side where they're selling more product in the higher end, more complete bundles. And we think that's a maturity of the sales force and the lower turnover. And there's been some unit activity, but we'll get into that more at the end of the year. So we talk about it once.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. And Jim, when we disclose, our anticipation is that we're going to see units up for the year.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And last quarter, you mentioned -- obviously there was Sandy, tropical storm Sandy impact last quarter, and you said there was going to be maybe some impact this quarter. Could you just talk about that, if there was any impact?","Efrain Rivera","It was pretty modest if we saw any at all. I would say that given where you saw the sequence of improvement on checks per payroll, you can see that the impact of Sandy was probably a bit higher than we had anticipated. So we had a nice rebound. I should say just for -- to provide a more -- a complete explanation of that number on checks per payroll, we think that if you take out the impact of more bonus checks at the end of the year, you're probably around that 2% growth rate, which we've been seeing for a number of quarters. And although we have said in the past that we expect that to moderate and we continue to do it, it simply hasn't moderated to the degree we expected.","Martin Mucci","So if you kind of adjusted Q2 for Sandy and adjusted the checks per client -- per payroll up and then in the third quarter, kind of drop the bonuses down, as Efrain said, I think you'd see continued pretty strong growth consistent now for 12 quarters in checks per payroll.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And just following up on that, is there any major economic difference between bonus checks and regular checks?","Martin Mucci","No.","Efrain Rivera","No. There's no -- just no. I mean from our standpoint, it's revenue. Of course, it only occurs once a year at bonus time.","Martin Mucci","But no, I don't think it was that big of a pickup in revenue.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. Just a final one from me. You were talking about your progress in the SaaS area. Any more specifics you could talk about areas where you're really making progress?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think, one, we don't talk about it a lot, but our clients are on a SaaS platform now. We moved our clients a couple of years ago over to -- for core payroll, this is -- over to core payroll. And so -- and then, of course, our mid-market product is hosted and more of that -- more of that platform, Paychex, what we call Paychex Next Generation platform, that the core clients are on, more of that functionality is rolling out basically every few months as we continue to build. And more of that functionality for the mid-market clients will come out this year, in fact, a significant amount. So we feel like we're very well positioned from a SaaS perspective. And even though a lot of our clients are still coming into us from a service model or outsourced service model, they can reach the SaaS platform to do their online reporting or even do their payroll if they want to do it this week or next week in addition to having their dedicated payroll specialist. In addition to that, the point is when we're doing acquisitions, all the acquisitions that we've done for product tuck-ins and so forth have all been SaaS-based models so that they can integrate into the platform, particularly for the mid-market space, which will become all focused on integration, on the integrated SaaS product that has not only the feature functionality but the integration and single sign-in, of which we have and will be adding to that functionality this year, this calendar year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to make sure that I understand. When I look at your payroll service revenue year-to-date, it's up 1.4%, but checks per payroll is up 1.8%. But you have been getting some pricing, so I'm just hoping to understand the difference between those 2.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, how do you get there. I think, Sara, the third piece of the leg, and I'm not going to reconcile it to the tenth because I can't do it on the call is that you have timing changes in between there. So in the first quarter, we talked about the frequency of payroll processing as impacting that quarter's growth. And then in this quarter, we have the extra processing day that impacted that growth. The other thing I would say is that checks per payroll don't -- so if we're up 1.8%, for example, or 2%, that doesn't equate to 1.8% or 2% of revenue. It equates to a fraction of that.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then separately on the investment balances, can you give us an update of the weighted average duration? I think it was at about 3 years last time...","Efrain Rivera","Yes, we're in the 3 to 3.1 time, I guess, duration.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And do you expect that to continue to lengthen or is this about the right range?","Efrain Rivera","We're -- that's a tough question. And the reason is that what we're doing is 2 things: We're looking at -- we're trying to optimize for the right credit quality and the right value along the yield curve. And so I think we're not going to see it significantly increase from that. It could lengthen a little bit, that maybe, but then it will roll down as investments roll off. So I would say plus or minus 0.2%, that's probably where we want to be.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just one last question. For SurePayroll, when you are winning, who is it that you're winning against? Is it another SaaS provider? Is it -- I'm just wondering kind of what the source of the win is.","Martin Mucci","Yes. On SurePayroll, a lot of it would be search -- this is new businesses, searching on the Web for a provider. I would say the most -- the closest alternative to them that they'd look at would be Intuit payroll, probably the biggest one they went from. But a lot -- they're coming in -- we don't always know because they're coming in through a search engine and coming directly to us. It's not as much like a Paychex where there might be a head-to-head sales person in there knowing they're competing with somebody. This is all search engine. We're not calling out to the clients. They're searching for SurePayroll and coming in. And -- but we're very pleased with the work that they're doing to gather the clients in, to get the interest on the Web and then close those sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Just on the fourth quarter, you mentioned that the fourth quarter is going to be strong. But if my math is correct, the fourth quarter revenues would have to be up at least -- the services revenues would have to be up at least 7% to get to the low end of the guidance. And I was just wondering if you could provide some color on what would drive that acceleration in revenue growth.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. First, I think what we said previously, we just have easier compares compared to prior quarters. We had the elimination of a number of unusual things that happened in both first and third quarter, actually first, second and third quarter, and then you start to see more of the underlying revenue growth generated by the sales that we've had. The other thing is that although our payroll revenue tends to be fairly steady quarter-over-quarter, HRS bounces around a bit for some of the reasons that I mentioned earlier on the call. And it can be stronger in 1 quarter than another. We expect that it will be a bit stronger than it was in this quarter.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. One quick question. You mentioned the insurance growth was moderating slightly. And so I just wanted to get some color there. Is the moderation just related to tougher comps? Or is there anything else going on there?","Efrain Rivera","No. No, I think the moderation there is really related to the fact that there have been some adjustments in terms of premiums paid under the Affordable Care Act on some segments of the business, coupled with the fact that we made a decision probably 18 months or so ago that our focus was going to be more on the higher end of the market rather than the lower end of the market. We think that, that transition has gone well, but it's going to impact growth in the short term.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And one final question on the competitive environment. Just how is the competitive environment during the key selling season from your large competitors, as well as the regional players, if you could just provide any color on the pricing environment, the competition?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think the good news is we haven't seen much change in the competitive environment from a pricing standpoint or really activity. I think we've been very competitive with our large national competitor from a pricing standpoint in promotions, and we saw that did not change very much during the peak selling season. So we feel good about that. From a regional, the smaller players, I think that we've actually continued to do very well, not just in third quarter but through the year, because the technology strength is not there as much. So they don't have as many products or technology, and that may be starting to catch up. So we're winning a little bit more from regional competitors and I'd say winning about the same or maybe slightly better from the national competitor.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Actually one more real quick question. This is about the client growth coming from the selling season. You said that you expect it to be up for the year. I was just wondering if you can provide some color on when you look at the client growth and talk about outsourcing versus SaaS clients and how should we think about those for the year based on the selling season.","Martin Mucci","No, we don't -- well, we don't really give that much color on how we're doing exactly from each -- from which products and so forth. But I would say, as Efrain said, by the end of the year -- we give client growth once a year -- we'll see positive growth and we're pleased with that. It continues to grow even given still kind of a stodgy kind of economic environment where there are not as many new businesses starting. But we'll see positive client growth by the end of the year in total.","Efrain Rivera","And I'd say one other thing because I think there is a perception that there are sharp divisions on both of those. In our model of servicing clients, we can service clients across a broad spectrum of service needs, and that distinction is starting to become a little less important than it was 3 or 4 years ago.","Operator","And our next question in queue comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask just on client growth, can you give us the assumption that you're using for why that it becomes positive through the back half of the year. And is it fair to say, I mean, just backing into it mathematically, that growth -- client growth has been sort of flat to down over the last couple of quarters?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, we're not going to go into each of the quarterly growth numbers. That's why we do it on a year-to-year basis. And let me just say one time again, Joe, why we don't do that, because it is the case in many years that we've been up in the first half and then down in the back half. So really, we focus on it on an annual basis. And I think it's fair to say that the back half will be stronger than the first half.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And in the assumption for the back half being stronger than the first half, maybe you could just walk us through sort of why you've -- is it macro-related? Is it the productivity in the sales force? Is it...","Efrain Rivera","I think, as Marty said, it's really more execution-driven and -- but many of the initiatives that the sales force -- the market has put in place and sales force really were geared around the selling season and reach their peak there, and we're seeing that result.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. Do you feel like that productivity is sustainable over the long term? Have we kind of stepped up to a higher level then on the productivity side?","Martin Mucci","Well, I certainly don't see any reason why it shouldn't. We're continuing to add product that is giving -- putting more in their bag to sell. I think that the -- with the turnover back down to the historic levels, you just add as you add more experience month-by-month to the team. They're selling and more productive. So I think the average tenure of our sales force, as that continues to increase now, will continue to help us out there. I don't think the economy is giving us a lot of wind behind us, but I think the execution certainly is in the leadership team and the sales force itself. So we expect it to continue to go up not by huge jumps, but continue to progressively improve.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And would you characterize that as a split between market share gains versus sort of economic improvement? I mean, I'm just trying to get a full sense of -- I've given you 2 other questions\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So Joe, if you look at what's happening in the new business starts area, so we've got a big announcement in June of last year. And you compare the same period through June of last year to the prior period, you had 2% growth in business starts. So it's pretty modest. There's some uptick going on, so there's an element of that. I think a lot of this is really about better execution and the job that Mark's done.","Martin Mucci","And which would be a little bit stronger winning rate, I think. Yes.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Perfect. And then the last one. How are you measuring the productivity? I mean, maybe you could just walk us through sort of what you've put in place. I know that there's been some sales force adjustments and adjustments to comps and you've got -- you're obviously adding a new head there. But how are you measuring that productivity? And what has sort of, I guess, reenergized the sales force going out there and making these gains...","Martin Mucci","Yes, the biggest focus this year on the comp plan and on the direction in training and so forth and the efforts we put forth was on revenue per client. Really wanted to be sure that we were selling the full product set, we were getting the most revenue per client, sell the value of the products that we offer and less about just price. And I think that's really started to pay off. And so we certainly measure it on both a revenue -- it's primarily based on when you look at a sales rep, they're comped on revenue, the revenue that they're bringing in and that's net of all discounts and so forth. So it's the revenue they're bringing in and obviously, we also are looking for the unit productivity that they're bringing in. So -- but the biggest focus this year has been on revenue, and then you always find there's some sort of balance as we look at comp plans for the next year that we'll try to make.","Operator","Our next question in queue comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So my first question is really about net pricing. And you guys have said in the past, I guess, closer to 2%. I wanted to see if you can maybe disaggregate the impact of maybe competition versus the impact of bundling as you are successfully moving clients to bigger bundles. How do those factors sort of come in into the picture because 2%, up close to that, is sort of a historical low, isn't it?","Efrain Rivera","Well, so Ashwin, let me take a stab at this and then Marty can talk about it. Not really, because if you go back probably I want to say 5 years ago, we put a price increase and then didn't get it. So we've had years where we put in a price increase, didn't realize any of it, 0. So I would certainly say that 2% is at the low, low end. And again, just to make clear, we didn't say it was precisely 2%, but at the low end of the range. So what we did this year was we consciously priced at a level that we thought would yield net price at the lower end of the range and we wanted to see also impact on -- what impact that would have also on units. We wanted -- we thought the pricing environment was such that taking a higher price increase was not advisable. So as the year's gone on, maybe we will take a slightly different tack next year, but it's not reflective of our perception that we couldn't take a prior -- a larger increase. It was part of a strategy to see what the impact of pricing at different levels within that range would produce.","Martin Mucci","Yes. It's looking at the -- we're not going to obviously get into too detail on pricing from a competitive standpoint on a call like this. I think that it's -- I think that it's at the lower end, obviously, that is at the lower end but, as Efrain said, if you go back since the recession, it's been a lot more difficult on the net side, but we're still able to get a price increase and hold it and hold much of it. And then also, we've gotten a little more sophisticated I think in the way we price different clients for different packages and so forth. So that's probably the most detail I can give you.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, no. This is quite useful. Just to move on, one of the areas where you get -- you guys have obviously done a much better job than certainly we expected has been on the margin front. And as I look at the elements of cost, facilities expense and compensation and so on, so forth, should I sort of look at that facilities expense year-over-year being sort of negative 1% growth? That obviously I think has to do with some of the real estate actions you took, opportunistically, in the Rochester area maybe. At what point does that sort of taper off in terms of benefit? And how long can you keep compensation sort of flattish? Clearly, there's productivity here, but I just want to get an idea.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, fair enough, Ashwin. So I started the call by saying that the leverage on operating expense is a result of a strategy that says -- that Marty put in place 4 or 5 years ago that said we will redirect expenses into IT and find savings in operation in order to fund that. It is a bit inartfully described in our documents as facilities. But that basically encompasses all of the operating expenses with the exception of wages within a branch location. And so what we have done and what we have been doing over a period of years and now you're starting to see it a little bit more clearly is that, where possible, we continue to leverage that expense as our technology gets better and better. And what we are deliberately trying to do is to balance that service component with technology and manage the P&L in that process. That's what you're seeing. It is not opportunistic. We can't guarantee, again, as I said before, that we will be able to do that every quarter. But that is the direction that the entire organization is moving toward.","Martin Mucci","Yes, it's exactly what Efrain said. It's part of our DNA to continue to try to leverage our cost and especially as we drove more into the technology, we have to leverage our cost. And it's not just facilities. So I don't want to mislead you, it's operating cost. It's the entire operation and how do we drive more productivity, whether it be facilities, which is really a fairly small part of the overall cost of the labor, et cetera. How do we drive that through better technology that we give people to work with, just really try to drive that productivity a number of ways.","Efrain Rivera","And our operations people do a phenomenal job of this. Just is really, really great work.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Now this is quite useful. I guess, would you then take a shot at what peak margins can look like for you guys based on all these actions?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So Ashwin, we reached 41%, and that was probably our high point when we had $135 million worth of float income 5 years ago. Certainly, if float income improves, our margins will get up in the 40% range. Absent that, all I can say is I won't commit to a specific number but just say that every year, we're committed to leveraging in some form or another in ways that make sense for the business.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I was wondering perhaps if we could go back to just the equation of revenue growth. Historically, it's been units or clients and pricing to get -- and retention to get some kind of growth rate. And now the pricing equation has become a little bit more complex because there are 3 dimensions to that, it sounds like: pricing, obviously checks, and then the bundling of incremental services to drive revenue per client. So with those changes in mind, can you perhaps give us some high-level thoughts of how to think about that going forward?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Again, let me take a stab and then Marty can add. We need to drive unit growth, so I don't want any of the conversation that we've had to indicate that's not important. It is. But obviously, in an environment where in 2009, there were 728,000 business starts down from 851,000, the peak, the mid-decade and right now, we've only recovered to 784,000, you have to figure out how to get the growth. So we recognize that unit growth is going to be a bit more challenged. And so what we have focused on is a combination of both driving units and also driving revenue growth, as you mentioned, through bundling and also small things that we don't spend a lot of time talking about but other value-added services, particularly for core clients, like clocks, like other related services. So I would say, David, the way to think about it is, is a combination of more revenue per client and also unit growth, plus right now, it looks like we've got a little bit more staying power on checks per payroll than probably we thought 12 to 18 months ago. Now we still think it'll moderate, but it's simply been better than we anticipated.","Martin Mucci","Yes. It hasn't -- as Efrain had said, it hasn't changed all that much from the old days of looking at client growth price and ancillary growth. I think the ancillary growth is not just HRS products though. The point Efrain's making is even to the core clients, there's time clocks now that we sell, there's background checks, there's a number of other products, but you could kind of lump them all into probably that ancillary growth if you wanted to. And the client growth is the most difficult one right now, but driving up price and meeting price in the standpoint of not just a price increase, but more price for what you get, I guess, what you get out of the price increase is certainly one goal and the ancillary growth is the other when we don't have as much client growth as we liked from the old days, the 3% or so. So it's still pretty much the same pieces. It's just driving -- right now, the focus is on driving as much revenue you can per client that we sell. Obviously, selling more clients, but always driving as much revenue per client as we can sell with ancillaries and additional products and services we have, and then retaining those clients, which we're doing a really good job. We haven't talked that much about, but I think we're really on a path for an historic best in client retention, which certainly helps too. Because the longer you have the client, typically the more revenue you're getting out of them as discounts roll off and you sell them more products and services.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. So as we look at that payroll line then and we think about unit growth and whatever the revenue [ph] per client [indiscernible] and accustomed to this pricing, the straight pricing metric. Is it realistic to kind of think of the bundle of pricing and incremental services and some number that we could think of a target in terms of how the business is going to grow when you factor in whatever it is, 2% unit growth and then the rest comes from this bundle of pricing checks and other products?","Efrain Rivera","Look, I think we'll give more color on that when we get to Q4. I understand what you're saying. I think that price component is probably going to be a bundle of all of those -- of that additional revenue that we sell to clients in addition to the unit growth we assume. But we're -- it increasingly, will be more of a bundle of those services plus the price increase to create a revenue per unit lift.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Right. And just back to your comments, I think you mentioned that you were experimenting a little bit of pricing this year. And I understand the reluctance to give too much detail on what you did and what you're going to be doing going forward. But anything you can share with us on what you learn from that endeavor over the course of the year?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. What I'd say is that we have pretty sophisticated models around the price elasticity of demand, and we understand the price elasticity of demand better this year than we did last year. So we've just gone increasingly sophisticated with the algorithms we use and understand what the pricing in the base -- how the pricing in the base works. But the one other thing I don't want to leave a misimpression on that, we're on record to have-- we're on a pace to have greater than 81% client retention. So it's not just plugging something into a model, which is part of the -- part of the work we do and I think we do a very good job of it. It's also that we have tremendous service at the frontline that's driving that kind of retention because if you just -- if you don't have that part of the model solved, you can price anywhere you want. You won't retain the clients. So it's really important to realize that, we don't trumpet this nearly enough, but we have thousands of payroll specialists who are out there on the front lines meeting client needs every way in a very, very high way. And the stories that we get sometimes are just amazing, and that's part of the secret of our success.","Martin Mucci","Yes. So I think the bottom line on that when you think about what we're saying, we've seen good new business revenue sales. We've seen some best client retention and we're headed I think to an historic best, as Efrain said. I think that says that the sophistication, the pricing model, is working pretty well. We feel good about it. It's holding [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question in queue comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, just want to ask about the PEO area. You talked about better client growth this year than certainly you saw last year. Can you give us any sort of sense for exactly I guess how much of an improvement -- I mean, is it back in line with historical levels or the rest of the HRS business and I guess trying to get a sense how much of an impact that could have on the HRS growth going forward for the next year or so?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it's still a fairly small component of the overall HRS revenue. But what we're pleased about, as you know, as we knew we had some bumpy times there with health insurance premiums in the business a few years ago now. And this time around, during an important selling season in benefit enrollment time, we think that a lot of nice work has been done there over the last year, really, 1.5 years to make us much more competitive. And not only -- and it proved itself not only in new sales that were up in the PEO significantly, but retention. Retention in the last 2 years have been a struggle because of the premiums. I think we've gotten that all calmed down and did really well, much better in retention than we expected. So I'd say, Tim, it's still a small part of HRS, but we're seeing it start to come back. And I do think that the Affordable Care Act and all that around health insurance will help drive those sales as well. So this is kind of, just to us, just the start of a positive momentum in the PEO that is finally kind of turned around and we feel it sustaining and actually will increase now with the Affordable Care Act.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And Efrain, can you help us think through, you talked about impact of moving more into some municipal tax-exempt type of securities on the interest income. But the tax rate really, at least year-to-date, hasn't moved all that much. Can that start to have an impact where we can see the tax rate start to move down over the next couple of quarters or a year or 2?","Efrain Rivera","No. I don't think it's going to make a dramatic impact, and a part of that really, Tim, is just a mix effect. I'm not expecting to see a material increase in the amount of float income over the next year or so. And so as our -- where we're driving higher tax rates is from the mix of our operating income. So the proportion of float to operating is going to be at current levels or below, and so that tends to drive the tax rate up a little bit over time, not down. If I had a different interest rate environment, I'd give you a different answer. I don't -- unfortunately, we don't.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of things. One, just looking at the commentary from the sale season and your success, it seems like, bundling solutions together. Should we be interpreting that you guys feel somewhat better about pricing as you're going to be heading into fiscal year '14?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I'd say so. I mean, we're very cautious about it, and I think the models which show it's not an economy that you're going to go necessarily to the high end of a range, but I think we feel pretty good about where we're going. Now we don't want to, again, I don't want to go too much farther on that, but I think we feel pretty good about continuing to give a price increase and hold it.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that's great. That's very helpful. And then just 2 other very, very quick questions. Can you just kind of ballpark for us or give us a sense of the growth rates for SurePayroll on a year-over-year basis? And then also you mentioned continuing your investment in IT and new solutions. Can you also give us a sense of the percentage increase in investment spend?","Efrain Rivera","Okay. In sequential order, double-digit, double-digit. [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMC.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, same -- follow-up to George's question around the investment spend. Double-digit, that's good to hear. Your expense growth obviously staying very good at 2% to 3%. How much more room is there to benefit incrementally from productivity and operations? I get that it's not opportunistic for sure, but I'm just curious how much more can you do to cover the big spending in product development?","Efrain Rivera","Look, I can't give a precise range. When we do our Q4 talk about guidance, we'll get a sense of that. The best I can say is that we will just continue to incrementally improve. There are always ways to find better productivity. That's something that is drummed into the DNA of the entire organization. We understand that. We're currently in the planning season, so I can say that, that mantra continues to be repeated. So we still think we have some opportunity. I can't commit to specifics about how much we'll do, but certainly it's our intent is to continue to do it going forward.","Martin Mucci","Yes, the focus is always continue to leverage the expenses, but to not sacrifice the initiatives we're doing for growth. So the technology spend, the spend to drive more sales, more referrals and things like that, we're still investing in those things. And it's a balance of, hey, we've got to come out of this with invest technology spend for our future growth, sales spend for our future growth and -- but still leveraging the expenses. That's exactly how we work through it.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Just a couple more quickly, I know it's getting close to lunch. The revenue per client maybe I'm thinking here could be a more important metric. So directionally, I mean there's a lot of moving pieces, right? You got the SurePayroll mix and then you've got higher attach rates on ancillary. What's the directional trend? And is there a lot more room to drive up core payroll revenue per client with all the ancillaries that you've added through the years?","Efrain Rivera","We have some opportunity to do that. I think, Tien-Tsin, I think one of the important things to remember here is that there are a lot of people in the market who appreciate good customer service and are willing to pay for it. And we think we deliver world-class service, and we think our clients appreciate that and are willing to pay for it. We also think there are other tuck-in products that over time aren't currently in the portfolio that we will add. And finally, the other thing I'd add is that there is a underestimation of the complexity of the ACA requirement that is going to cause people, even people who are probably in a SaaS-based environment, to think maybe outsourcing is the better option for $1,000 more because of the penalties for noncompliance. So we think all 3 of those are factors that probably could tend to push that higher. What the specific number is, I know we can't commit or say what that is at this point, but we think that it pushes towards a higher number.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we're in a very good place of balancing that world-class service with the technology now. A few years ago, 4 years ago, we were, I think, a little behind the curve on the technology, but the investments have paid off. And now with the rollout of product that we're doing all the time and the improvement in the SaaS model and the SaaS investments are really paying off, in that it's a very valuable balance of technology and a very competitive service and technology model together.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, no, that makes sense. And it jibes with your high CSAT and retention metrics as well. I'll let you go on just one more question, and I think I ask every quarter and I apologize, but just on the acquisition pipeline, just I heard a little bit about talent management, things like that. But just any color on just the pipeline itself, is there more on the SaaS or the tangential markets or maybe the regional payrolls, is that something you're considering? I'm curious.","Martin Mucci","Well, it's definitely SaaS, I think, because we're looking to bring more in. I think it's not only the product tuck-ins, but it's also new product, new product and expanding, I think, our product set a little bit, not really want to go too far into that at this point until we do something, but and it's investments, also looking out in geography as well. We're really trying to increase the speed at which Germany grows, and I think we've put a renewed focus on that as well. So it's product, it's product tuck-ins, it's additional products, it's payroll certainly as well and it's geography. And we'll be able to tell you more about those as it happens. As Efrain mentioned earlier, we're very careful not to just put it on the top line and then impact the bottom line. So it takes us I think a little bit longer to balance and find the right opportunities. We don't just spend it just to stick it up there on top and not have an impact on the bottom. We look at very good value-based acquisitions.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'll just ask you 2 quick ones. I think you said that you thought the health insurance business could be impacted somewhat by the Affordable Care Act next year. Could you give any more color on how much that would be and what impact?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Not precisely. What we'll talk a little bit about, we've been growing upper teens to 20%. We expect that to slow down a little bit. And what the impact there really is in the 10 and below market where we think those people eventually were going to migrate into exchanges. There's also a little bit of pressure that's occurring with respect to brokerage fees that we expect to continue. And so the combination of those will cause growth rates. In the short term, they're moderate. We still think there's an important opportunity longer term, and we've transitioned, pivoted the sales force to look at more about market opportunities where we think there's still a lot of opportunity.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You still think you'd grow the business but just a slower rate or is it possible...","Efrain Rivera","Yes. That's...","Martin Mucci","Definitely, yes. There's a lot of opportunity here I think. And Efrain mentioned earlier, even in the payroll side, there's opportunity because I think it will drive more to outsource. But on the health insurance side, I think we're doing some things product-wise that I think are really positioning us well to capture that from a client perspective on the payroll side and the health insurance side. So on the short term, you have a little bit of pressure from commissions, from the carriers. In the longer term, I think more clients are going to come to someone looking for an expert to help them. And the combination of health insurance being done by us, by Paychex, and the payroll will make it much easier for clients than those who do it separately.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then the second question, the float being flattish with the growth offsetting the lower yield, is that a reasonable proxy? Or do you think it likely could start falling again as we move forward? I think the expectation is that...","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Look, we had some gains in the quarter, and we kept the guidance for the year, so I think we're at 8% to 6% -- that's down 6% to 8% I think I should put it that way. That's still good guidance, and then we'll talk more about where we think we'll end up next year. But we certainly don't face the headwinds that others do in this, unless rates continue to be -- to drop from where we are and get worse.","Operator","And our next question will come from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","With regards to the profile of the clients, you were talking about this with regards to health insurance. But I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about it with regards to on the core. What are the differences in terms of the profile of the new clients that you're signing now relative to maybe a few years ago, what percentage on new businesses? And how should we think about that going forward, particularly with the complexity of the Affordable Care Act impacting companies that are a little bit larger to a greater extent than the really small ones?","Martin Mucci","I think, Mark, I think generally, we're not seeing a big -- any significant differences in the new clients we're selling versus the clients that we have in the base. They're still very much in our sweet spot. I think on health insurance in particular, we have focused that we think there's a better opportunity for us to expand and do more selling in the 50 and above. Obviously, our mid-market payroll business is up there, and I think there's a lot of opportunity. What we found was we are selling a lot to the under 50 in the health insurance and that the even better retention and bigger opportunity might be in that over 50. So we focused some of the health insurance folks on that and have been going through a little bit of a transition on that. But as far as really payroll and core payroll in particular, we're not seeing much difference in new clients versus existing base.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And what percentage of the health insurance clients are typically in that smaller range out of the existing base?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I don't think we get to that level of granularity. I think what we've said is that currently, our health care clients as a percentage of the base are under 5%. It's fairly, fairly small.","Martin Mucci","Yes, one thing, I don't want to mislead anybody to think that we're not going after that small market for health insurance as well, we are. It's just, obviously, if you look at under let's say 20 employees, probably 50% provide health care, somewhere in the 40% to 50% provide health care. So that's an opportunity there. If you look at over 50, it's more like 90%. So all we're saying is we're kind of adding a focus not -- we didn't take away from the low end though at the same time.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right. And then you mentioned that the bonuses helped a little bit this quarter. Is there any quantification around that?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, what we saw, Mark, was that bonus dollars compared to, as well as we can quantify, were up about 20% this year, a little bit over 20%, over last year. So there was clearly a lot of bonus activity. And as Marty said, before we said, a more normalized rate of growth in checks per client would have been about 2%. So we saw roughly 0.3% or so in terms of checks. That's an estimate, so I don't want to -- don't want you to think that's anything more than that in our part because it's tough to say what's a check and what's a bonus check. But based on our analysis, it looks like a lot of people made some year-end bonus payments that didn't occur in prior years for obvious reasons.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Obviously, a positive sign with regards to the economy in terms of...","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Yes.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And in terms of the float yield, do you think we're basing at this point?","Efrain Rivera","We're what, I'm sorry?","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Do you -- in terms of the effective yield on the float, do you think we're pretty close to basing in terms of that we've reached...","Efrain Rivera","I'm sorry, Mark, I didn't understand what you meant by basing. I get it now. We're pretty close, we're pretty close. We're getting close.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And we should start seeing continued improvements in terms of the overall float balances, no?","Efrain Rivera","Float balances or float income?","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Float balances.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, float balances should over time go up. Yes, absolutely. So -- yes, I know where you're going. Look, I hope that, that increases. I think we'll still see down next year just because of the rolloff to some older investments, but we're getting close to the end of this cycle.","Operator","And our last question will come from Paul Condra with BMO.","Paul Condra","Just on the bonuses, I think you mentioned those have been up for obvious reasons. But to me, that means people trying to front-run the payroll tax increase. I'm wondering if you were thinking about it the same way.","Efrain Rivera","No. I think what they were trying to front-run was a perception that dividends were going to go up in all likelihood and capital gains. It seems like 6 years ago, but there was a lot of nervousness in December about cap gains and dividend rates going up, and so I think people got nervous about that and rates in general going up.","Martin Mucci","I think we did see some -- I think the overall bonus activity was more about an improved economy, and so more checks and so forth. I think to your point only, we saw more bonuses paid in December than January this year. And so it moved up a little bit. But I'm not sure the overall amount was trying to -- I think the overall amount is up though, which was a positive on the economy. But we did see it shift some to December versus January, obviously all still in the third quarter.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I guess on the timing, the front-running comment was what I was referring to.","Paul Condra","Sure. Okay, great. And then just I don't know if you can kind of remind us just on the HR services the mix of those kind of main 4 business lines there and then maybe some comments on the mobile adoption or mobile usage and then I'll just end it there.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So we don't disclose the exact percentages for each, but within the 3 lines of businesses that we have in HRS, the biggest is HR outsourcing, which is our ASO PEO solutions, and what we call HR Essentials; and for our second is our 401(k) recordkeeping and related business; and then third is insurance. And I'll let Marty talk about the...","Martin Mucci","Yes. And by the way, feeling good about all of them, particularly 401(k). And we didn't talk much about it on the call, but we shifted and expanded frankly our sales force in 401(k) toward the larger market, larger 401(k)s and that's done -- off to a great start. I think Efrain and I have mentioned it on previous calls, but just started that this fiscal year. So we see expansion on larger 401(k)s as well. And on the mobility question, yes, we're seeing a nice fast pickup in use of the mobility platform. And as we add more feature and functionality to it and more clients are -- we're pushing that more so clients are aware of it, that it's available and out there. And the feature functionality to the application just continues to expand. So we're seeing a nice pickup in that. And again, it's not really replacing. For us, it's this hybrid of balancing the service model that we have of the dedicated specialist who's all knowledgeable and can take care of everything for you with your ability to go in and do your payroll if you want online or just get information off your phone or tablet.","Operator","And we show no further questions.","Martin Mucci","Great. Well, thank you. Thanks, everyone, for hanging in. And we appreciate the interest in Paychex, and we're very excited about our future. At this point, we'll close the meeting. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until the end of April, April 29.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to go ahead and turn the call over to your host for today, to President and CEO, Marty Mucci. Sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our fiscal 2012 year-end earnings release call. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. Efrain and I will review our financial results for the fiscal year and our guidance for fiscal 2013 after my opening comments, and then we'll open it up for your questions.","We continue to focus at Paychex on driving growth in revenue and profits while providing industry-leading service and products to our clients and their employees as the leading provider of payroll, human resource and benefit outsourcing to America's businesses. We had a solid financial performance for fiscal 2012. Efrain will go into more detail. However, I would like to provide you some highlights.","First, we achieved the highest service revenue in the company history as we ended fiscal 2012. Our checks per payroll have improved for 9 consecutive quarters. Growth in checks per payroll has been consistently positive this year. Our client retention was at 80% of our beginning client base, very near record levels.","Our execution in operations has been excellent, demonstrated by achievement of our highest client satisfaction scores in our history, and we find this a very important metric as the payroll and human resource rules and regulations affecting our clients have continued to grow increasingly complex. And our payroll client base finished the year at 567,000 clients, including SurePayroll, up slightly from the previous year. When you exclude SurePayroll, we're basically flat. This marks a change from the past 3 years when our client base posted declines. Our insurance services business continues its growth, now with over 100,000 clients, as one of the 30 largest U.S. insurance brokers.","During fiscal '12, health and benefits services revenue increased 24% to $52 million, with a 23% increase in the number of applicants. We believe the economic environment improved modestly as the year progressed, but the environment for new business formation remains challenged. We focused our efforts on improving leads, experiencing favorable results from our emphasis on our CPA referral channel and search engine marketing. We also saw an increase in the win rate of selling to clients of our competitors.","Our sales force is doing an excellent job communicating the strength of the Paychex brand and the breadth and quality of our products and services. With a solid sales leadership team and this year's new compensation plans and sales support tools in place, we improved sales representative turnover during the year.","We also continue to invest in our Paychex next-generation platform and its suite of innovative products. We believe that this is a key building block to our future success. In fiscal 2012, we introduced technology enhancements to our software-as-a-service product offerings with our Paychex online mobile applications. Mobility apps were previously released for the iPad and Android tablets, allowing clients and their employees to have full access to our products and do anything they do now over the Web on their PC or laptop. This month, we released smartphone applications offering diverse capabilities for both employer and the employee on the go.","In our third quarter, we unveiled our Business Insurance Payment Service and our Paychex Advisor Select 401(k) offering. In December, we acquired Icon Time Systems, Inc. a provider of time and attendance solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. We had a successful relationship with Icon, and there was an opportunity to incorporate them into our company.","Our 2 acquisitions from 2011 have created excellent opportunities in both of their markets. SurePayroll continues on track in the do-it-yourself software-as-a-service market. And we continue to make inroads in the financial advisor marketplace with ePlan Services, which further expands our successful 401(k) services, where we continue to sell and service more plans than anyone in the industry.","I am very proud of the efforts of our employees on behalf of our clients and shareholders. We have a solid leadership team that is clearly focused on sales and service execution, technology innovation and product expansion that drive our plans in fiscal 2013 and beyond.","I would now like to turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financials in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty. Yesterday afternoon after the market closed, we released our financial results for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2012. We also filed an 8-K filing, which includes a preliminary discussion and analysis of our results of operations and our financial position. This preliminary discussion and analysis is not a complete MD&A. A complete MD&A will be included in our Form 10-K, which we expect to be filed by the end of July. Our release and filings are available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for one month.","As Marty indicated, Paychex delivered solid results in fiscal 2012 together with improving metrics. Some of the key highlights are as follows: Checks per payroll increased 2% for fiscal 2012. This growth moderated from prior year as we expected, and we anticipate a lower growth rate in checks per payroll in fiscal 2013, which will impact quarterly comparisons in our service revenue. Checks per payroll, I would remind you, is an estimate of the average number of checks issued per client payroll run. We don't include SurePayroll in our checks per payroll statistic.","Total service revenue grew 7% to $2.2 billion, the highest level in our history. Acquisitions contributed 2% to growth. Operating margin, operating income net of certain items as a percent of total service revenue, came in strong at 37.1% for fiscal 2012. More on this later. The interest rate environment remains challenging. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for fiscal 2012, down from 1.3% last year.","Now I'll walk you through our results as presented in the consolidated income statement, with some additional highlights for the fiscal year and fourth quarter. Payroll service revenue increased 4% for the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year fiscal 2012. Organic growth in payroll service revenue was 3% and 4% for the respective periods. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll and modest increases in revenue per check. Revenue per check was impacted by price increases offset by discounting.","HRS revenue increased 12% for the quarter and 13% for the fiscal year. HRS revenue growth was 9% and 11%, respectively. This growth in HRS revenue reflects growth in clients and price increases. In addition, our insurance services continue to benefit from growth in health and benefits revenue of 22% for the quarter and 24% for the full year as the number of health insurance applicants continues to increase.","Our HR Solutions revenue growth rate was impacted by continued softness in our PEO and lower revenue per employee in our HR Essentials products. Our PEO business tends to fluctuate with changes in health care rates and workers' compensation clients experience. Health care insurance rates impact renewal rates for the business.","Retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in the average asset value retirement services client employees' funds. This excludes ePlan. This was partially offset by the impact from a shift in the mix of assets within these funds to invest in turning lower fees from external managers. The impact of market performance assisted growth in 2012 and is not anticipated to continue in fiscal 2013.","Combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income increased 8% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year. Yields available on high-quality securities continue to remain low but are somewhat offset by increases in average investment balances. Expenses increased 5% for the quarter and 6% for the year, partially due to expenses related at acquired businesses. Excluding acquisitions, our total expenses grew 3% for both the quarter and full year periods.","We continue to invest in product innovation and supporting technology. Expenses related to information technology increased at a faster pace than overall expenses for fiscal 2012. We anticipate that growth for these expenses will moderate for fiscal 2013.","Our operating income, net of certain items, which excludes interest on funds held for clients, increased 9% for the fourth quarter and 10% for the fiscal year. Operating margins were at 34.2% for the fourth quarter and 37.1% for fiscal 2012. We expect that operating margin to drop in the second half of the year with timing of expense for support of calendar year end operations and sales activity and planned spending on our innovation activities.","Our financial position remains strong. Cash and total corporate investments are at $790 million as of May 31, 2012, with no debt. This compares to $671 million a year ago. Our cash flows from operations were $707 million for fiscal 2012, a slight decrease compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven by timing related to changes in our current assets. Looking at our free cash flow, the improvement for fiscal 2012 was largely due to the impact of business acquisitions in 2011.","Funds held for clients as of May 31, 2012, were $4.5 billion compared to $3.6 billion as of May 31, 2011. Funds held for clients vary widely day to day and averaged $4.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.6 billion for fiscal 2012. This amount represents a year-over-year increase of 4% and 7%, respectively. Higher average invested balances resulted from several factors: SurePayroll, client funds, wage inflation, increases in state unemployment insurance rates and the increase in checks per payroll. Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $60 million as of May 31, 2012, comparable with unrealized gains of $59 million as of May 31, 2011.","Our investment strategy is conservative. We don't recognize or we have not recognized or realized any impairment losses on our investments. A substantial portion of the investments are high credit quality, rated AA or better or A-1\/P-1. Our priority has been and will continue to be to ensure that we can meet all of our cash commitments to our clients. We anticipate our average duration on our available-for-sale securities to increase to approximately 3 years, a slight increase in portfolio duration.","Total stockholders equity was $1.6 billion as of May 31, 2012, up from $1.5 billion as of May 31, 2011, resulting from earnings and reflecting $460 million of dividends paid during the fiscal year or 84% of our net income. As you know, in October, we increased our quarterly shareholder dividend 3% to $0.32 per share. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 34%.","Now let me turn to fiscal 2013 guidance. And before I do that, you should be aware that certain written and oral statements made by management constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements should be evaluated in light of certain risk factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. Please review our cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements in the press release for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the related risk factors. I'd also like to remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant change.","Our guidance for 2013 is as follows: Payroll service revenue is projected to increase in the range of 3% to 4% compared to fiscal 2012. The projected growth rate is based on anticipated client base growth, modest increases in revenue per check, offset by moderation in the growth of checks per payroll. HRS revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 9% to 11%. This is in line with historic organic experience.","Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 5% to 6%. Prior acquisitions will have minimal impact to revenue growth rates. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to decrease in the range of 6% to 8% due to longer-term investments maturing and being invested at lower rates.","Operating income, net of certain items as a percent of service revenue, is expected to approximate 37% for fiscal 2013. Investment income net is projected to grow in the range of 25% to 35%. Net income is expected to increase in the range of 5% to 7%, and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately 36%.","A few additional comments on guidance. Fiscal 2013 plan includes a 3% to 4% increase in the core payroll sales force and a full year impact of an additional 401(k) match that we put in place towards the end of fiscal 2012. The impact of these actions on earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.01.","As you know, we do not provide guidance on a quarterly basis. However, as contrasted with 2012, we anticipate that first half and second half earnings in 2013 will be more similar than in 2012. And due to a difficult comparison with very strong results in Q1 2012, we anticipate growth rates in the first quarter for payroll and HRS will be below the low end of the range of our 2013 full year guidance.","In Q1 of 2012, we benefited from stronger checks, higher asset fees from investments, higher work site employees in the PEO business, the ramp and introduction of our HR Essentials product and some timing in terms of the end of the quarter. The absence or moderation of each of these factors is expected to impact first quarter results.","Finally, beginning with our next fiscal quarter, certain client accounts and statistics, primarily in our HRS revenue area, will be updated on an annual basis consistent with our payroll client base disclosure.","And finally, a reminder that Paychex will be holding an Investor Day on July 18, 2012, in Rochester. Registration information for the Investor Day is posted on our website, and we're looking forward to seeing you and having a great day. Thank you.","Now I'll turn it over to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. And operator, we will now open for the meeting and the call for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question does come from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to start with a question on the operating margins x float income. We're looking at 37% for the fiscal '13 guidance, which I think is pretty flat year-over-year. And I wanted to get your thoughts just in terms of what's underpinning that because I think most investors have traditionally thought of the processing nature of the model driving continued margin expansion over time. I mean, is this any sort of sign that margins are close to maxing out here? Is there room for ample margin expansion in a better macro environment? Because I know you mentioned that the IT OpEx growth is going to actually slow in fiscal '13. So I suspect there's some multiple moving parts here but would just love your bigger picture thoughts on what this means in terms of margin potential of the business model.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, thanks, Jason. The answer to that is when we put the plan together, we have leverage in it from sales to expenses of approximately 100 basis points so -- or approximately 37% will result in some leverage in the P&L. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, we did make some investments that increased expenses, primarily in terms of sales force expansion and also on our -- restoring some benefits that we had not restored previously.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So going forward, it sounds like you think there is a path to some continued margin expansion albeit at kind of a modest rate?","Efrain Rivera","There is a path to do that, and that's the way we build our plan. We look typically to grow expenses below sales and typically by 100 basis points, and that's what we baked into our plan.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just based on where the laddering and the duration of your float portfolio stands right now and the forward yield curves, I mean, do you think fiscal '13 will be the bottom in terms of interest on client funds?","Efrain Rivera","It's real hard to tell. If I freeze the rates right now, Jason, I would anticipate -- and I also hold average flow at the same level, I'd anticipate some contraction in the portfolio probably in the 3% to 5% range, where interest rates stand at the moment, but they could change. Let me just say one thing on that, that I think is critical. There is a tremendous amount of volatility on interest rates. And even within the last 90 to 120 days, we've seen a 10-year treasury, which we benchmark our intermediate municipal bonds to go from 241 to under 150. So we'll update on a quarterly basis, but that's what we're seeing. So no, we haven't completely anniversaried it, but it will moderate from here on out.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And just lastly for me in terms of balance sheet deployment, I think you've got total cash and securities now $800-ish million-plus, getting closer to that $1 billion level that I think you guys have talked about in the past. Anything we should be aware of in that regard? Does share buyback seem appealing here or what's the M&A pipeline like?","Martin Mucci","Well, Jason, this is Marty. I think we always continue to look at that and the board does. Obviously, it's a board decision. But we're always discussing it at each board meeting that as we get closer particularly to that $1 billion mark, we want to have the flexibility for acquisitions because we're looking aggressively at what's out there and want to keep the flexibility. But at the same time, we certainly understand that as we're aggressive in the dividend, that there's other options for that cash as well. So something we continue to look at every quarter with the board, nothing to report at this point.","Operator","The next question comes from Rayna Kumar with Evercore Partners.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm calling in for David Togut. Could you please update us on initiatives implemented by your new head of sales, Mark Bottini?","Martin Mucci","Yes, on the sales side -- and some of these things started right before Mark, but I think Mark has done a great job in moving these and executing on these. One was a new compensation plan. Some of the changes we made last year and some additional ones this year. The focus is very much on revenue and revenue growth. We also simplified the compensation plans dramatically last year to make them more direct and easier for the sales representatives to understand how they get paid on the next sale. We think that, that's gone over very positively in the last fiscal year and continues to do so this year. We've also focused on technology. And so new tablets were given to all the sales reps last year, which allowed them to have everything on their tablet at a faster speed, including sales force tools for tracking new leads, et cetera. So they got more technology. We have also a proprietary program that allows them to load or initiate a client during a sale all on their laptop to avoid paper, and that helps both sales and the operations team as well. And I think between the comp plan, the tablets, a lot of training changes were made last year that went over well and also some recruiting. Since Mark has come in a little over 8 months ago, he has been extremely visible out in the sales force and really assessing the leadership team, and I feel we're going to be off to a good start this year as we kicked off the fiscal year this month.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. And can you quantify fiscal 2013 price increases?","Efrain Rivera","No, we're not going to disclose the level. We mentioned that they were modest. I think they're not out of the range of what we had done historically, but we won't specifically quantify that. We just think it's proprietary information.","Operator","The next question comes from Sara Gubins, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to quickly follow up on that last question. Could you talk about your expectations around discounting next year? Is that incorporated into the guidance?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I don't think we expect a lot of changes there. I think from a competitive environment, things are about the same. I think we felt good that we've done -- we actually got more sales last year from competitors, from clients who are with competitors, particularly regional players. And I think the competitive environment with our national provider is about the same, so I wouldn't expect much change on the discounting front. Efrain, anything you want to add?","Efrain Rivera","That's it, yes.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then within the -- also on the guidance for next year, you're expecting lower growth in checks per payroll, and it looks like that came in probably a bit better than expected in the fourth quarter. And I know this is something of a scene from the second half of this past year. But could you talk about what's driving the expectation that it will be weaker going forward in terms of the growth rate?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So look, just a little bit more color on checks per payroll. Again, it's not completely same-store sales, but we do take a subset of our client base and then compare it against the average for checks per payroll, and typically is pretty close. I think, Sara, what we're seeing is moderation in that number. I think that it's come down. It moderated more slowly than we expected, frankly, at this stage. And it really is a function of what happens with hiring of employees within our client base, which is tough to gauge. It's been better than we expected. We're very cautious about assuming that it will continue to be better than we expected.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just last quick question. Could you tell us about your plans for CapEx next year?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I think it should be in the disclosure. But I think we're at $95 million to $100 million in the notes on the disclosure.","Operator","The next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wonder if you guys --  I wonder if you could talk about what assumptions you've made, if any, from the macro into your FY '13 guidance and any indications you've heard with any spillover from what's going on in Europe into the United States.","Efrain Rivera","Well, first off, we're fortunate, there really isn't any spillover in our results from Europe. We have a very tiny business in Europe and happy to say it's profitable, but it really is fairly insignificant to our operations as a whole. I think, Joe, if you collect all of the information that we looked at, everything from new business starts to what's happening with unemployment and including some internal indexing that we do, a model that we've developed, it all looked very similar to this year. And so our macro overlook was that this year was going to look -- I should say, fiscal 2013 was going to look pretty similar to 2012. There was a little bit of a hiccup when BLS showed its real week results, I believe it was in April. We didn't see it quite that dire. But at this point, we just see things just steadily inching up, I'd describe the environment as.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I guess, I'd say, the only thing I'd add to that, we -- it's been a continuation each quarter as we've talked about it, existing businesses with the checks per payroll, as well as the retention, we certainly have seen a little gradual pickup as Efrain mentioned. So the hiring to us looks like it's up, and it's not moderated as much as we thought. We thought it would be flattening out and it hasn't, so that's a good sign. Also, our losses are down about 6% from earning client losses, so our retention is near historic levels. So we felt fiscal '12, frankly, pretty good from an existing client perspective. And we would expect that the losses, as we get toward near historic levels, start to flatten out so we're not going to continue to see big improvement in retention, but we're still looking to inch up a bit. And then the new business formation still looks pretty challenging. As Efrain said, the stats lag 6 to 9 months, but we're not seeing sales up much from new businesses. They're fairly flat year-over-year. However, a couple of -- in the last 2 years, they were down. So in fiscal '12, they were fairly flat. So I would say that the most challenging macro thing is still new business formation.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just maybe you can spend a second talking about SurePay and the progress you've made there, the integration and how you're thinking about the balance between I guess human capital and technology as you head into the next fiscal year?","Martin Mucci","Sure. I think we've made good progress there. The company -- we kept it kind of stand-alone from a name standpoint and is run by the same management team when we acquired them almost really 1.5 years ago, and we're pleased with the results. They're in double-digit growth, and they continue to serve that market, that SaaS market, and they're continuing to grow right along. So we're pleased with that. We continue to look at the integration of the back end, and we've brought some of the backroom functions into Paychex to make them, I think, even more efficient than they were. And they're continued on driving the growth on the top line. The one thing we haven't seen and the nice part about having kind of bulk businesses, that do-it-yourself SaaS model and our more full-service model, is that there's been not a lot of change there in the dynamics, which we haven't seen in years. So that if you were kind of a person who wants to control it and do it yourself, you're still doing that and there really hasn't been a shift in the market that we can see, frankly, in 10 years. So we continue to watch that pretty close, but we feel good about the product that they have and continued improvements that we make together now. And certainly, the backroom has been integrated well, I think.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one for me. I think in your initial remarks, you said that the win rate has gone up. Maybe you could give us some color as to why you think the win rates increased and anything you could provide on just the level of competition out there and on the pricing front?","Martin Mucci","Sure. I think the win rate is one -- particularly in regional competitors but probably even on the national one, I think we've always been known for great service and personal service with our dedicated professionals with clients and that those service levels are at an all-time high. So we're very proud of that. I think on top of that is you've seen the investments pay off that we've made in technology over the last few years. This year, we introduced more innovation than we have in the previous probably 3 years or 4 years. We did a single sign-on last summer, where you could reach all of your information online for all of your services, 401(k), payroll, et cetera, in one place in a new enhanced Web look. And then we introduced iPad and Android tablet apps. And they were kind of state-of-the-art, optimized for the piece of equipment that you're using. And then we just introduced a few weeks ago, our smartphone app. So I feel that we're really hitting our stride and mixing both great service with very strong technology from both a mobility standpoint and, certainly, just overall product standpoint. And I think it's harder and harder for regional players, smaller payroll companies to stay on top of the technology and all of probably the changes that are being made from a regulatory standpoint. And I think that's where we're winning.","Operator","The next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Marty, I wanted to go back to a comment you made on acquisitions. And just get a better idea, when you talk about acquisitions, would they be outside of the payroll sphere or are you talking about just acquiring companies that would allow you to have just better services or different services than you have now?","Martin Mucci","I think it's across the gamut. I think we're always looking at whatever we can do to drive top line growth and improve the client experience for us so there's tuck-in product, and that's where you've seen -- most of what we've done has been able to add product. When you look at SurePayroll just 1.5 years ago, it expanded really our product set and suite into the do-it-yourself SaaS market. When you look at ePlan, it kind of did the same thing. And 401(k) would expand us to where we can go after financial advisors more directly and on a Web-based SaaS program versus just going after it from our direct client view that we've always sold to. And in Icon Time Systems we found a great clock that we were selling to the low end, the 20 and less employee side, and we decided to buy them. And so -- but just adding payroll clients, we would certainly looking at doing that and always product tuck-ins. So I think it's across the board. I think valuations are always challenging, but we look at an awful lot of opportunity out there. The good news is there's lots of opportunity. The tough news is the valuations aren't always as reasonable as we think they should be.","Efrain Rivera","And we're really disciplined in our look at valuation.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just your thoughts on maybe the positive or any impact you would expect from the health care regulations. Obviously, now the Supreme Court's upheld it, so that takes a little bit of the guess out of it. And I was really just wondering, what you think the impact could be for Paychex.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think -- well, I definitely think it's going to be positive. And I think either way it went, we felt positive. But as there's a need now, a mandate to have health care for many small businesses, I think they're going to be looking for more and more of an expert to help them with all of the requirements, the reporting, et cetera, how to apply for the small business tax credit. One of the great things, I think, that Paychex brings to this is the fact that having the payroll data and selling the insurance, we can seamlessly interface with our insurance business to be able to track all of the information, move it from insurance to the W-2, move it from the insurance agency to help them do all the reporting for tax credits. I think that there's a nice opportunity here in a business that's already growing over 20% a year. So we feel pretty good about it. I can't tell you exactly until you see how it all works out exactly how that will help, but I think it's a positive for sure.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question. Marty, you guys have a fantastic balance sheet. You have a ton of cash on the balance sheet. At the end of this fiscal year, you'll have even more. And I'm wondering, is the board waiting for that $1 billion mark before stating a different strategy of maybe increasing the dividend or buying back shares or is it just that they haven't come to a conclusion as to what they want to do or is it something else?","Martin Mucci","I don't think there's any magic to the $1 billion. I think that we've talked about it that, that does hit some sort of threshold. But I will tell you that Efrain and I talk to the board actively every meeting about it. It's always important to us that we're making sure that shareholders are taken care of. So whether it's dividend, share buyback or any of the other options, we discuss them every meeting. So I don't think there's any magic about the $1 billion. I think it's just a matter of discussing it every time and getting comfortable with what the next steps are.","Operator","The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, my first question is to ask you about the specific nature of your ongoing IT investment. Are there any details on the upcoming product road map that you can offer? And also, you've introduced a lot of new technologies here in the last several months. Any update on what the uptake of that new technology has been like?","Martin Mucci","I think it's early on the smartphone apps, but I think it's been very positively received. We've gotten good reviews on the technology itself, Ashwin, and I think that we'll continue to move toward more integration and more online capabilities so that clients are mixing that high level of service and technology. I think what you'll see toward the late summer and fall time frame, will be more focus on reporting and the fact that we'll make it easier for our clients to get their information and set it up the way they want to. So you'll see some new advantages there. And I think at the Investor Conference, we'll have a chance to show you and describe some more of that with the head of technology, who will be presenting as well.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I wanted to go back to one of your comments on expecting a slower start to the year in fiscal '13. What gives you the confidence of a rebound later in the year?","Efrain Rivera","Because we know we look at the underlying trends in the business and can isolate the things that were positives in the quarter that don't recur and feel pretty confident that the rebound will occur after that. And some of it is timing, some of it's a number of factors that were just unique to that quarter. So it's not as though we're just starting slow and then we're expecting to ramp. There are certain factors that we could identify in Q1. We just had a great Q1. We won't apologize for that. It was a terrific Q1 and the compare is just difficult.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So it's primarily that the quarter last year was a good strong one?","Efrain Rivera","It was a very -- you can see, it was our strongest by far and, frankly, strongest in a number of years. And there were a number of real positives there. I mentioned one of them was the launch of our HR Essentials product in that we had introduced it the prior year. That was a big contributor to the quarter and simply the growth after you've launched a product, obviously, slows down, but there were a number of other positives in that quarter.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. A couple of other questions, just quick ones. One is what are your plans for overall headcount this year, as well as for sales force increase?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think the sales force increase, Efrain mentioned, particularly in the payroll side, was 3% to 4%. And it's one of the first times, by the way, we've grown that sales force in a few years. So we're feeling good with Mark's leadership and the leadership in general of the sales team. The overall sales force is fairly flat. I think up maybe 1% or something like that would be our expectation.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the 3% to 4% is a gross number and 1% is net or?","Martin Mucci","No, no, no. 1% is total -- I thought you were asking about total employee team, of the 12,000, and then there is 3% or 4% in the sales team.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Last question is, will your free cash flow continue to exceed the net income in the coming 1 to 2 years?","Efrain Rivera","Well, it's interesting, Ashwin. The answer is it typically does. We anticipate that it would. And if you just do -- if you look through the items on the statement of cash flows that are recurring and you look at what we're spending on CapEx and then our DNA, so our DNA basically is similar to our CapEx. And then we have a number of non-cash adjustments. So typically, it's going to exceed it by a little bit, and then the swing factor obviously is what's happening with respect to assets. I'd just caution that what happens with respect to assets and liabilities is also a function of what day of the calendar year or quarter we close. So directionally, yes, we would expect it to be up. One thing I would add to what Marty said is, in my comments, I said 3% to 4% on the core payroll sales force overall. The rest of the sales force is probably going to be about the same or in that range.","Operator","The next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I guess, I was wondering if we could somehow get a composition of the 567,000 customers kind of thinking about sort of the SurePayroll impact? And I know you sort of suggested it grew double digits but wondering if we could get a little bit more granular there or are they sort of running closer to 35,000 now?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, they're a little bit north of that but in that range.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. So they had kind of healthy maybe mid-teens growth, it sounds like?","Efrain Rivera","In that range.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then at a high level, how should we think about customer growth expectations that you're assuming for fiscal '13?","Efrain Rivera","At a high level, you should think about them as modest.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Modest. So kind of low-single digits?","Efrain Rivera","Modest, yes.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, just maybe an update where you ended the year in terms of sales force turnover and your expectations for '13.","Martin Mucci","Yes, we definitely improved year-over-year. So we had kind of picked up, and we're near historic levels. I think just slightly higher than that but a nice decrease from the previous year, and so I think we've done a nice job with some of the things we've put in place to get the turnover back down. Expectations for this year would be frankly even lower than this -- than how we ended fiscal '12, which would get it solidly down to historic levels, if not slightly lower.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So kind of like targeting low 30s or are you thinking you could get something with a 2?","Martin Mucci","I would say targeting low 30s.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Macdonald with First Analysis.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Following up on the client growth. Is there anything -- I mean, any thoughts on what you can do to get that restarted again or in maybe longer term?","Efrain Rivera","Well, I think we do -- we mentioned this. We need an assist from -- we need an assist in business formation just to give a little bit more color. That's been inching up kind of 3% to 4% every year, so we would expect that we'll be doing better on the new sales front. But I think the other part then is to really focus on all of the other areas that we gain clients from. So we're up in CPA referrals. We're up in search engine marketing. We're up in regional takeaways. We're doing good battle with the national competitors so we're doing -- I think we had a good year from that perspective. We just need a little bit of a uplift on the other part to get the engine going. The other part that I'd mention is that, of course, net client is a function also of what's been happening on the retention side. And we really did a great job, can't emphasize that enough, a great job on the retention side this year. And we continue to put a lot of emphasis in that area so that we can boost net client growth.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think Efrain's exactly right. We've put a lot of focus on the CPA channel that we've always done very well in, and that continued to show an increase. And the SEM is really -- bringing in someone to lead marketing and really tackle that has gone very well for us over the last year or so -- and the regional competitors. And I think also current clients is one that is difficult because of the economy. They're not opening up as many of the new shops, the second location or third location. And so we're working new programs to go back on the current clients though and see if we can get that to tick up as well. So I think there's a lot of activity going on. Some has paid off last year. We don't really rest on waiting for the economy. That would certainly give us some wind behind us. But we're very actively going at each place where we get our referrals.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And when do you think your increase in sales force might pay off, start to pay off and how...","Efrain Rivera","Well, we don't get a big bang in the following year. We're going to add people as the year progresses so it won't be all at once. So you really will see more of a benefit in the following fiscal year.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up, a technical thing. It looks like on the investment income may have shifted some of your assets longer term and may have had an impact in increasing investment income. Is that correct?","Efrain Rivera","That's fair. I mentioned before, we extended duration a little bit on the portfolio to get a little bit better yield. It's frankly not a huge change, but it did give us a little bit of benefit.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, just want to ask on the decision to expand the sales force more aggressively. Can you talk how much of that is a reflection of you feeling more comfortable about the macro environment versus some of the changes you've made to the sales force and you're just more comfortable with the leadership and execution there? I guess kind of what drove you to start to grow that again?","Martin Mucci","That's a good question, Tim. I think it's both. I think that there are certain areas of the country that we're feeling a little bit stronger in. I certainly feel strong about the leadership team. I think they're right on track, and that gives us a little more confidence to add more people to the group and how we're handling all the changes we made between compensation, training, recruiting and the technology that we've given them. So there's some expansion areas in here. I wouldn't go into where -- on the call as to where those are, but we're expanding in some areas where we already have offices, and we're expanding in some new areas as well.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And can you comment, the HR Essentials. You made the comment that lower revenue per employee in that business. Can you describe what's going on there and why that is happening?","Efrain Rivera","Well, if you think about our HR role or HR outsourcing portfolio of products, we've got the PEO. We've got an ASO. And then the year before last, we introduced HRE. So it's a more basic service that provides telephonic support for HR. And due to the complexity of the environment in which businesses are operating, there's a need for that service. It is -- it occupies a lower rung in terms of price compared to the other 2, but we think it has more widespread opportunity just because of the price point at which it operates. So as we sold more of that product, because it had a lower cost associated with it, when you compare that to the amount of work site employees covered, you ended up with a lower number. That's fine from our perspective. That's what we expected because we thought there was a space in the market for that kind of product. It has done very well. And it obviously, from a mix perspective, has an impact on our revenue per work site employee.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. So it's not a lower revenue amount for the kind of the same-store HR Essentials but it's a mix shift out of the ASO ...","Efrain Rivera","No, not at all.","Martin Mucci","Yes, it's a different product. As Efrain said, we found this niche of really telephonic support where our ASO, HR outsourcing or the PEO is really a hands-on, dedicated person to your business, whether it's in the PEO or not. But the HR Essentials was basically, it kind of breaks clients into that with telephonic HR support before they're ready to step up and so the revenue was less, and it breaks clients kind of into HR outsourcing. And so then we're also -- we always continue to look at those clients and say whether we could get them to up-sell into the full ASO or PEO products as well. But it found a good niche, I think, particularly in the economy right now, to help clients break into HR outsourcing without paying the full amount or having a full dedicated person to them.","Operator","The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just really quickly, just to go back to the spending on technology. I think you said it would probably be down this year versus last given the concentration in new product development last year. First of all, can you help us understand how we should think about product cycles and the evolution of the products given that you went through a period of probably some underinvestment and now you've caught up a little bit? How should we think about that going forward?","Efrain Rivera","David, just so I can clarify a little bit what you said. What I said was that our rate of growth in IT spending will moderate, not that it will go down. So I think that part of the answer, and I'll let Marty complete the question, part of the answer to your question is that we needed to step up spending at a base level rate from where we were. And so that's what was happening over the past 3- to 5-year period. As we've said in calls before, we also at the same time, were taking cost out of ops so it wasn't completely transparent. If you look -- go back 2 years ago and you look at our op income before float, our percentage of op income before float, you're going to see roughly about a 200 basis point improvement that we have been doing while we've been investing in IT. So the part of the answer to your question is that we expect the rate to moderate, but we've already built in a higher level of go-forward IT spending. That's even being done with what is now our highest op income percentage that we've achieved. So we've already accomplished a lot of that transition. I'll let Marty talk a little bit more about that.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think -- and that's a very good point to make. Only the increase, the growth piece of it is moderating but the level of spend is very strong, and we were able to drive productivity out of the operations side in the last couple of years and put those dollars into IT. And now we're seeing the payoff from that and will continue to see it. I think -- David, I think that it's always going to be important and has become increasingly important to be sure from a technology standpoint that you're very Web-based, that it's a SaaS model even in full service, which we focus so much on the full service aspect of the dedicated person to our client. They do want availability of their reports the way they want them, how they want to customize the reporting of the information, how they want their employees to access W-2s and pay stubs online or on their smartphones. And so I would guess that, that will continue. I mean, frankly, I think technology spends are going to continue, and it's balancing that with the dedicated service. We're not -- we will never walk away from the service level. That's very, very important to us as a differentiator, but you got to have the technology as well. So I think the evolution of those products will continue. And frankly, we're just getting started. We're very excited about the head of technology that I've had in place now for a few years in the development side, who came with a lot of experience from SAP, PeopleSoft, et cetera, who, again, you'll meet at the Investor Conference. And he's got great plans for us, and we're real excited about them.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful, Marty. And just as a follow then to that, is should we think about new products as being catalysts for incremental -- what do you call it, Marty, share gains or penetration, however you want to look at it or does it -- do you not really view it quite the same way?","Martin Mucci","Well, that's a -- it's an interesting point. I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, you always want to gain incremental, but I do think there's some that you just have to do to maintain position. And I think that's where we start to win over some of the smaller particularly low-end payroll companies, the smaller -- we handle smaller clients. They can't keep up with that technology change. And so the larger players are able to invest and keep up with that. So I think some -- to be very straightforward, some is to keep you in the game and some is incremental. We're certainly always pushing to be incremental. I don't want to just match any competitor. Our goal is to leapfrog the competition. And that's thinking out 2 or 3 years that where you're getting to, you're going to be beyond the competition knowing that they're investing as well.","Efrain Rivera","And we're very focused on that technology enabling us to do what we call product expansion or introduction of new products, absolutely part of the strategy that we'll walk you through at the Investor Day.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Very helpful. So just one last question, Efrain, for you. Just looking at the guidance for float income for next year, which is probably a little better than I would have thought. Can you maybe help us understand what kind of balance growth is assumed in that guidance for the year?","Efrain Rivera","It's modest, probably in the 4%, 5% range on balance. But frankly what's going on there, David, is that we extended duration a little bit and looked at the portfolio so that we didn't take as big a hit as we would have if we had not really done that.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The HR services business seems like it's been losing a little bit of momentum or at least this past quarter. I realized you lapped, you pointed out, part ways through the quarter and that's probably part of it. But is there anything else that you would cite for that or any other trends that maybe you're driving?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Gary, it's really -- if you look at what's happening with HRS, it's really the softness of the PEO business. And just to step back a second and explain that a little bit. When we go to a client, unlike some of our competitors, we don't say to the sales force, \"sell them a PEO or sell them an ASO or sell them an HRE.\" We've got a product set that basically, depending on the size of the client, HRE typically smaller, to PEO, typically a little bit larger, a salesperson can sell. And what we saw this year was that the ASO just seemed to be the preferred model and that PEO just didn't do as well. Now part of that has to do with renewal rates and part of it just is the environment in which you're selling, and PEO was not the favored choice among clients this year. As a consequence, we saw softness in that business but we had a lot of strength on the ASO business, and that's impacted work site employees and it's impacted growth rates overall. There's a little bit of a changeover going on there that we expect will normalize.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I know the PEO has got a higher revenue but a lot of that's the pass-through of the insurance cost. So if you thought like in profit dollars per work site employee, how does PEO...","Efrain Rivera","PEO is slight -- it's higher than the ASO, not by much but it is higher. And certainly, HRE is much lower than both of them. So you get a little bit of a mix effect if you're mixing a little bit down the ASO versus PEO.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just despite a little bit of slowing there, clearly, the penetration of the HRS offering into the payroll customer base continues to march higher. Do you see any potential to accelerate that or do you have any -- can you give us any updated thoughts on penetration, maybe how large some of that could go? I mean is this still...","Efrain Rivera","Well, we're still at the early stages on most of our HRS products. I'd say retirement services is one exception to that. But with respect to the HRO or HR outsourcing products, we still have a long runway to go. And I don't think we're anywhere near seeing a point of maturity in those businesses, especially as it relates to penetration rates, Gary.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is there anything you can do to accelerate that? It sounds like the client growth is going to remain pretty modest for a while until we get a big increase in the economy. Are you trying to do anything to accelerate that or is it more \"steady as she goes,\" keep marching the penetration up?","Martin Mucci","I think one thing was as we talked a few minutes earlier about HRE, we're trying to find other ways to kind of get clients to try it. So when you look at HR outsourcing, it's really one of the fastest-growing products we have. As we saw that start to slow, where clients weren't ready to step up to an ASO or a PEO, we introduce HR Essentials, which gives you telephonic support and your handbook and gets you started in HR outsourcing. And so I think there's ways to break into markets with a lower price offering that gives a little bit less service kind of model -- breadth of the model. And so we're continuing to try things like that and then even be able to go back and say now that you have this, boy, you really could use, given your employee base or your growth in employees or complexity, you could use a full-service outsource person who's dedicated to you.","Operator","Next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Hey, Efrain, one quick point of clarification on the first half versus second half commentaries that you made. Can you just clarify the sales comments for the first part of the year versus the margin comments so I make sure I have those straight?","Efrain Rivera","Well, okay. No, what I said was that if you look at earnings for the first half or should say, the results for the first half versus the second half, specifically with respect to earnings, they're going to be more comparable in 2013 than they were in 2012. That's as much as I can say on the guidance. And then, as you said, the first quarter will present a difficult compare.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","For sales, correct?","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And I guess maybe, Marty, on the business front, you guys have invested in technology. You've invested in new sales. We're turning the corner into fiscal 2013. We're not getting much in the way of acceleration in terms of revenue growth. I know a lot of that obviously has to do with kind of the backdrop in terms of the end markets that you guys are selling into. Is that just kind of the reality of the business as it stands because of your SMB [ph] sort of client base or is there an expectation that these investments and the technologies and the platforms can actually yield a faster growth rate at some point? And I guess, over what period should we actually expect to see that?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think as we've talked about, Julio, I think long term, we're seeing ourselves back into the high-single digits for top line growth. I think that all of the things, the sales and service execution not only from a sales perspective but from the service and all the things that we're doing from a product invasion standpoint with the mobile apps and single sign-on and improved integration of multiple products for a client in the reporting, I think all those things are looking to how do we drive that revenue up. Whether the macro is in our favor or not, that looks like it's going to be -- continue to be a gradual improvement, which I think will give us some win but we're not counting on that. We're looking at really the execution, the innovation and the expansion of products to drive us there and that certainly is our goal to get ourselves back into that higher single-digit revenue and gain some leverage on top of that to get the earnings up. I mean, we're proud of the fact that even in this economy, we've grown. We're kind of at a point where the service revenue is at the highest point it's ever been in our history. And that from a client base standpoint, although there wasn't a lot of growth there, it's like an inflection point for us where we've been down in net clients for 3 years, and now we've reached the plateau, really, with SurePayroll up 3,000 clients, we really feel like, hey, we're not looking for the economy to certainly bail us out. We're doing everything we can to get the growth growing.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just as an incremental, it sounded like you said that you felt like some of the health care reform stuff could be a positive. Any way to put some parameters around how fast or in what areas we should expect to see that actually benefit the business going forward?","Martin Mucci","Well I think it will be, obviously, in the health insurance business is where I see it. It's hard to tell at this point, even though it looks like they've upheld the majority of the changes. It's going to be tough to see still how they implement up to 2014, but I do think that when they uphold the complexity of health care and mandates and more regulations on small business, that the good news of that for us is that more will require outsourcing to take full advantage of that and frankly just to comply with requirements. And we think that a payroll insurance agency combination like what we're doing is going to be positive in that respect, but it's hard to put a number on it yet. I think the only negative of these kind of things is the more regulations and requirements that are out there sometimes does continue to slow new business formation from necessarily maybe starting up. I don't think that's the biggest thing. I think it's still consumer confidence. Will someone buy my product? But I think when you're starting to get into a business, any entrepreneur that hears how the taxes are unsettled, that health care is now needed, that there's all these requirements, that may slow them down. So hard to put a number on it yet, we need some time to kind of see how the whole thing kind of rolls out.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just -- I might have missed it or I missed it, just this new sales growth. I know it was up to mid-single digits last quarter. Did you guys track the number this quarter?","Efrain Rivera","No, we don't disclose it by quarter. We were up in the sale season. We were up slightly this year in units. And what we saw was down in the first half of the year, up in the second half of the year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then how does that translate into guidance or going into next year, you still expect it to be up or even accelerate from what you did in fiscal year '12?","Efrain Rivera","Look, we expect it to be up. That's what we expect going into next year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a clarification on the pricing, you said the net impact of price increases plus discounting was still in the normal 2% to 3% range that you guys usually do?","Efrain Rivera","We were in that range. We didn't say that number precisely.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And going forward, probably no change to that range?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, we don't see that changing.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Kissane with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Marty, you had indicated that the win rate was up in the quarter. Was that in the quarter or for the year? And then given that, what's been the trend in the win rate, say, over the past 2 to 3 years?","Martin Mucci","I would say that -- well, one, that was for the year. So as you look at the whole year and I don't think the quarter was much different. So the win rate and other competitors basically as we look at it, barring competitors was up, and so we're very proud of that. And that was quarter and year. The trend over the years, I think, has been fairly flat. The last 2 years has been up and fairly flat before that. And I think actually, if you went back 3 years, probably might have even been down a little bit, might have been a little bit of a loss on that. And so again, the last 2 years and this was year and fourth quarter, we're up a little bit versus competitors.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So you said you'll start to pick back up relative to the national competitor and the regionals. How about the more SaaS-based, the smaller Web-based competitors, how are you doing relative to those?","Martin Mucci","Really, Jim, we haven't seen much change there at all. We don't really see a change where we don't really lose to SaaS-based competitors because the clients -- the type of client is either a do-it-yourself or it's a full-service, and we don't see a lot of that. We do see where we gain some on manual, those who are doing it manual, that we're winning more of those clients. We're up in sales from manual providers and -- but we don't see a lot of change from those who are doing it themselves, generally doing it themselves kind of SaaS-based-type competitor. They kind of either go -- SurePayroll would see more of that but not us. And I think obviously based on their growth, they're doing well.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Are you seeing any of your existing customers move to SurePayroll at all?","Martin Mucci","No, no.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Marty, can you update us on your mix of distribution, CPAs, Web search, direct sales?","Martin Mucci","Oh, from a referral standpoint? Yes, it hasn't changed much. It's really still roughly the same. If you were to look at it generally, it's about 1\/3 from CPA, it's 1\/3 from current clients. That one might be down a little bit given the economy, and then the rest from other sources like national sales support and the SEM, the search engine marketing, has picked up, I think, where the client -- the current client dropped off a little bit. So SEM, while still a small number in general, is up dramatically from previous years, and I think you will continue see that just because of the macro kind of approach that clients are just going on the Web and search. But I think we've done a much better job in being able to attract clients and win them over from the Web.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. If I can get one last one. Efrain, can you give us a sense of the logic behind adjusting the disclosure around the HRS metrics going from your quarterly updates to an annual update?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, a part of it is that, frankly, the quarter, it seemed inconsistent to me to be updating one part of the business and not be updating the entirety of it. We give color on where we see things. And if there's some dramatic departure, we come back and talk about that. But it just seems strange because you could look at some part of the business and draw some conclusions on the business as a whole, but we weren't giving you much on the payroll side. And frankly, we like to look at the trends over a longer period of time rather than quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The thing that I just wanted to ask about was I think this goes with the margin discussion that's been addressed a couple of different times, but if you think about your sales force and the tools you've given them, how do you think about the productivity levels now versus what they could potentially be if we start to get even a couple of percentage points of client growth and how that might change sort of the longer-term relationship between sales force growth versus client growth? Is there any way that you guys sort of think about that with the new tools and comp plans and things like that you've put in place would really change that dynamic versus prior years?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think it's tough to measure with the economy the way it is, but we're certainly always looking to help them be more productive. And I think we've seen some improvement there, and so the tools have paid off. When you take all the paper out of their hands and allow them to do everything on their tablet and you put their leads much quicker in their hands and a way to monitor those leads, and you give them things even kind of some, what we call Salesforce Chatter is the name of a product where they can get back and forth between different reps and even different areas of the business and they can have kind of almost social discussions, social marketing type of discussions and so forth, I think that does make them more productive. But I think it helps you stay even where the economy is pulling against you a little bit. But I think as the economy improves, that will certainly continue to make them more productive. We're very proud of the fact that we've always had, in our view, the most productive sales force in this industry. And I don't see that changing, and I see it improving over the years.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is there any way however you'd measure it internally, whether it's revenue or client account or employees that are being paid per rep, where you sort of thought internally that these tools, et cetera, could make our guys and women 20% more productive when things pick up or is there any way you can think about it from that perspective?","Martin Mucci","Well, we certainly measure it by units, revenue and every other way possible and closing rate. And we don't disclose any of that, but we certainly measure it very closely. And as I said, I would just say at a high level, that we've seen an improvement and we expect to continue to see that. The reason why you change, obviously, incentive plans and give them additional tools is to help drive their productivity. So they're spending more time with leads and referrals, and so that we can increase the closing rate and make them more productive not only for us but for them. So we definitely see some benefit already occurring. I'd say it's slight but we're seeing it. And I think as the economy improves, that will benefit us even more.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Marcon with RW Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Was wondering on 2 fronts. First, can you talk a little bit about MMS, what are you seeing there? What sort of rate of growth are you expecting and how has the environment changed if at all?","Martin Mucci","I think the -- I don't know if the environment has changed much. I think we've kept up very well from a product standpoint with time and attendance and HR administration online. As I've mentioned probably before that a lot of that sales team really tends to lead with those products, HR administration or time and attendance, and payroll comes along with it. We've worked to improve the integration of those products, and so I think that, that has helped us from a competitive standpoint. I think we're very competitive, and I think you'll continue to see improvements and enhancements to that product set as well. We don't really break out the growth there. I think it's as competitive as it's always been, and so I think that it's doing well. I think what surprised us over the years maybe is -- that I guess I'd put a little color on is the addition of the HR online and the time and attendance online has made this a very -- a good business, and that has really lifted the revenue. We don't disclose that revenue separately, but it's really helped to lift that revenue per client.","Efrain Rivera","The growth rate and the suite of products that comprise what we call our one source solutions or MMS solutions is faster than payroll.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that continues to be faster than payroll and you're now...","Efrain Rivera","And just to put more color on what Marty said, I think there, technology is very, very important. What we see is technology migrating into that space at a faster rate than you see it in the core payroll space.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Absolutely. And then I know it's been covered a couple of times on the call, but I just want to make sure I'm 100% clear on it. With regards to the way that it's stated in the 8-K and the release, we're basically talking about fee operating margins in the 37% range, which would imply no margin expansion. But in the call, we've talked about having normal margin expansion. So I'm trying to figure out what exactly -- how we should proceed from here?","Efrain Rivera","Well, we have modest margin expansion built into our plan. And as I said, we have expenses growing more slowly than sales and added opt income with outflow. We targeted about 100 basis points in our plan.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And so that's probably the better thing to look at.","Efrain Rivera","That's correct.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And in terms of the sequencing, is that going to be back-end loaded as well?","Efrain Rivera","I think our plan is a bit more back-end loaded than this year's plan, just how expenses and revenue fell out.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know you guys have covered a lot of stuff already. So just on the 401(k), recordkeeping side, one clarification there, the asset fund flows I know have been tough and I know the fee model's changed a little bit. Did this have any bearing on the outlook? Any way to quantify this?","Efrain Rivera","Well, it has a bearing on first quarter, as I mentioned, because assets have not grown. If you look at first quarter, our disclosure assets from Q1 of '11 to Q1 of '12, we had a nice jump in assets. We don't expect to see that in Q1. That's going to be a drag on the quarter. And then going forward, we don't expect to see the same level of growth in assets that we saw in previous year. So that will have an impact, and also our model is moving away from asset fees as a driver to revenue in that business.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So when does that transition out in terms of the compares with the fee transition? I'm just curious. But I understand it's a very high-margin business in a way but...","Efrain Rivera","I think it's out. I think we'll experience a bit of that in every quarter in 2013. Hard to say exactly when. It will depend on the mix of plans that we sell.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. And just a high-level question at the Analyst Day, I'm curious, now will you give us -- I know it's a little bit of a preview, but will you give us sort of a buildup to your long-term outlook and your thoughts on revenue margins? Is that something that we should ...","Efrain Rivera","We're intending to give you at least an intermediate term of buildup.","Operator","And the last question does come from Vishnu Lekraj with Morningstar.","Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I want to touch here on the client retention rates. You did a good job over the quarter. I was wondering what is driving that mainly. Is it a healthier client base or is it more of what you're doing on your side in terms of service and things of that nature?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think it's both. I think we certainly have seen an improvement in the number of businesses going out of business, so there's fewer of those. And that's been happening for, geez, probably 9 quarters now anyway and -- but we've also seen an improvement in almost every category. So whether it's those clients who were leaving for price or leaving for service, which is a pretty small piece of the pie, or those leaving for other products, every one of them has improved. But I would certainly say, a good chunk of it is fewer out of business or those with no employees and that were leaving for those reasons. So it's across the board, improvements across the board, but a good chunk of it because that's a good chunk. Usually 2\/3 of our losses come from businesses who are out of business or have no employees and just aren't running payroll.","Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. Just want to touch here on guidance again one more time. I sort of missed this. But in terms of checks per client coming down or moderating, is that more of a mix in terms of the client cost acquisitions and then them having lower payroll headcount or is that just an assumption of lower employment growth overall?","Efrain Rivera","It's an assumption, Vishnu, of our client base, the decline or the moderation of the improvement in our client base, kind of a roundabout way of saying that. When we hit the depths of the recession, our clients then started adding more employees and they were adding them at a rate that was faster than we anticipated and we, frankly, just expect at this point it to moderate going into next year.","Operator","There are no other questions at this time.","Martin Mucci","All right.

Sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you very much, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release call and webcast. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2016. Our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussions and analysis of the results will be available later today. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our investor relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month.","On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll review the highlights of the third quarter related to sales and operations and product development. Efrain will review our third quarter financial results in more detail and discuss our full-year guidance, and then we\u2019ll open it up for any questions.","Once again, we\u2019ve experienced growth across our major human capital management solutions during the third quarter. Our third quarter financial results reflected total service revenue growth of 7%, including 4% in payroll service revenue and continued double-digit growth in our HRS revenue. We experienced positive sales growth through the first nine months, including a strong selling season. We were particularly pleased with our results in the mid-market space. Our HR outsourcing services also continued to reflect strong growth. ","Mark Bottini, our head of sales and his organization have done a terrific job working as a team to demonstrate to new clients the value of our full suite of products that they offer. Our sales force turnover is at its lower level in years, and we are already ramping up for additional reps to be fully staffed for the start of fiscal 2017. ","Our service execution continues to excel, demonstrated by continuing high levels of client satisfaction and retention. We completed a successful calendar year-end and our employees continued providing great service as we have moved to even more flexible service options. Year-to-date, we are experiencing the best net client gains since the recession as a result of both positive and effective selling and solid retention results.","In terms of product development, we continue to focus on enhancing the user experience and flexibility with Paychex Flex, our cloud-based human capital management platform. Paychex Flex delivers access to payroll, human resources and benefits information, creating a streamlined and integrated approach to workforce management. ","Earlier this fiscal year, we launched new and integrated modules within the Flex platform. This included the addition of Paychex Flextime, Paychex Flex Benefits administration, and Paychex Flex Hiring, which includes paperless recruiting, screening and on-boarding. This integrated suite allows for a simpler user interface that is supported by an industry-leading service model. We are very proud of our Paychex Flex platform and we\u2019re pleased to be recognized for the value our technology brings to our clients.","In addition to the recognition from the Brandon Hall Group and Gartner increasing our position on the Magic Quadrant earlier this year, PC Magazine recently recognized Paychex Flex as one of the best cloud-based payroll services for 2016. We are very proud of the increased recognition that Paychex software-as-a-service based products and service are experiencing, and we see this played out with solid sales and retention performance.","Last fiscal year, we launched our Paychex Employer Share Responsibility service, which is our full-service Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as ACA, solution. Our ESR product includes a multi-monitoring service with automatic alerts as well as year-end reporting. Our revenue from this ACA solution has increased as we assist clients with their monitoring and year-end reporting requirements. As a result of the demand for this service, we have increased our implementation and support spending.","On December 22, we completed the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance Partners offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. We are excited about the opportunity this acquisition provides and believe it\u2019s a great fit. The temporary staffing industry has experienced expanded growth and clients are within our targeted market of small and midsize businesses. Our consolidated financial results include Advance Partners from the date of the acquisition in late December.","We remain committed to adding value to our shareholders. Last July, we increased our dividend by 11% to $0.42 a share and have maintained a strong dividend yield of over 3%, one of the highest in our industry. Our stock repurchase program remains in place, and we have acquired 2.2 million shares of common stock during the first nine months of fiscal \u201916.","I would like to take a moment to mention something else we are very proud of. On March 10, we were recognized by Ethisphere Institute as a 2016 World\u2019s Most Ethical Company. As an eight-year honoree, we believe this award underscores our commitment to leading ethical business standards and practices ensuring long-term value to key stakeholders, including our customers, our investors and employees. We are one of only two companies in the outsourcing services category honored this year.","In summary, we saw continued strong execution from our sales and service teams, our product and financial performance remains strong, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team. We are focused on a strong finish to fiscal 2016 in a few months here.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Marty. Good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during today\u2019s conference call, we\u2019ll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and thus involve risks. Refer to the usual disclosures.","As Marty indicated, our third quarter financial results for this fiscal year reflect continued progress across major product lines. I\u2019ll cover the highlights and provide greater detail in certain areas, then wrap with a review of the 2016 outlook.","Total revenues, as you saw, grew 7% for the third quarter and nine months to $753 million and $2.2 billion respectively. Total service revenue also grew 7% for the third quarter and nine months to $741 million and $2.2 billion respectively. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the third quarter and 8% for the nine months to $12 million and $34 million respectively. We are beginning to see some positive impact from recent increases in interest rates. Average invested balances for clients\u2019 funds were basically flat year-over-year as the positive impact from client growth was roughly offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates. ","Total expenses increased 7% for both the third quarter and nine months. Compensation-related costs were the largest contributor to this growth, driven by higher wages and performance-based comp. In addition, strong growth in the PEO and the additional cost for Advance Partners in this quarter were factors in expense growth. ","Operating income net of certain items increased 6% for the third quarter and 9% for the nine months to $268 million and $837 million respectively. We maintained strong operating margins of 36% for the third quarter and 39% for the nine months, but anticipate that our full-year will remain within our guidance of approximately 38%. As a reminder, we typically experience lower operating margins in the back half of the fiscal year.","Net income was up 7% to $180 million for the third quarter and 13% to $579 million for the nine months. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.50 per share for the third quarter and 13% to $1.60 per share for the nine months. The nine month period was positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to prior year revenues that were recognized in the first quarter. Excluding this impact, net income and diluted earnings per share would have risen 9% and 10% respectively, and what you see in EPS is a function also of the effect of buybacks that we\u2019ve done over the past year.","Payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the third quarter and nine months to $440 million and $1.3 billion respectively. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. Advance Partners contributed slightly less than 1% to payroll service revenue growth for the third quarter, and let me repeat that - slightly less than 1% to payroll service revenue growth for the quarter. ","I would say one other thing - checks per client in the quarter moderated. This was partly a result of two things. One is in the third quarter, benefit--I should say bonus checks are--typically we assume they are going to be a little bit higher than the year before. That didn\u2019t end up being the case this year, although it\u2019s difficult to quantify, and we had a little bit of impact that was a result of client mix in the quarter. So Q3 is a little bit tough to predict in that respect. We ended up a little bit lighter than we had projected. ","HRS revenue increased 12% to $301 million for the third quarter and 13% to $865 million for the nine months. We are pleased with the growth for the quarter. If you recall, last quarter we indicated that we anticipated Q3 HRS revenue growth to be below the low end of the range for our annual guidance. This was due to a comparison to a stronger quarter in the prior year. We exceeded expectations, landing in the middle of the range. ","The increase reflected strong growth in both clients and worksite employees at Paychex HRS Services, our largest HRS revenue stream which includes ASO and PEO products, and we continued to have strong growth in PEO revenue in the quarter. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our ACA product that assists clients with healthcare reform, and an increase in health and benefits [indiscernible], together with higher average premiums and clients in our workers comp insurance programs. ","One other note, and we called this out in our investor day. I want to just highlight this - HCM module revenues that assist clients in HR administration and time and attendance also were strong in the quarter. You don\u2019t see that in the payroll service revenue because of the way we account for it, but as we will discuss during the call when we get questions on sales, we had a strong performance in mid-market, and you see that reflected in HRS, not in payroll. Advance Partners contributed slightly more than 1% to HRS revenue growth for the quarter. ","Now turning to our investment portfolio, our goal continues to be the protection of principal and optimization of liquidity. On the short term side, our primary short-term interest vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts, U.S. treasury securities, and high quality commercial paper. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government securities. Long term portfolio has an average yield to maturity currently of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1% for the third quarter and 1.1% for the nine months.","In December, the Fed raised federal funds rates by 25 basis points. This was the first interest rate hike in nearly a decade, as you know. With this, we have raised our guidance on our interest on funds held for clients to high single digits, where we had previously indicated it would be relatively flat. That simply reflects what you\u2019re already seeing in the numbers, so it\u2019s really not a significant change in guidance.","I\u2019ll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. We had cash and total investments of $756 million as of the end of the quarter. Note that funds held for clients as of February 29 were $4.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. As you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.5 billion for the quarter and $4 billion for the nine months. ","Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments in funds held for clients, reflected net capitalized gains--unrealized, I should say, gains of $61 million as of February 29 compared with net unrealized gains of $14 million as of May 31, 2015. Total stockholders equity was $1.9 million as of February 29, reflecting $455 million in dividends paid during the nine months and $108 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 39%.","Our cash flows from operations were also strong this quarter, and I want to call that out. They totaled $791 million for the first nine months, and again a very, very strong 14% increase from the prior year. The change was a result of higher net income, higher non-cash adjustments to net income, and positive fluctuations in working capital. So from a financial metrics perspective, we\u2019re very pleased with where we ended.","Now onto the 2016 guidance. I\u2019d like to remind you that it\u2019s based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions. Guidance for the full year is unchanged from previous quarters except as I mentioned for interest on funds held for clients. I\u2019ll reiterate some of our full-year ranges and then give some concluding color.","Payroll service revenue anticipated in the range of 4 to 5%. That obviously also includes the addition of Advance payroll in that number. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 10 to 13% - again, Advance is in that number, and we obviously expect it will be at the high end of that number. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 7 to 8%, again towards the high end of that number, and net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8 to 9%. Please note that the range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter.","Effective tax rate for the year, also excluding the impact of the net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, will be approximately 36%. Interest on funds held for clients is now expected to grow in the high single digits, as I said, as a result of recent increases in interest rates. Current guidance does not anticipate any additional increases in the Fed funds rate for the remainder of the fiscal year, and if someone can decipher what the Fed is saying, I would be interested in getting schooled on the subject. Finally, we anticipate the contribution of Advance Partners is going to add somewhere between 1 and 1.5% to total service revenue in the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s a bit of color on what\u2019s happening there. ","Finally, we anticipate higher selling expense in the last quarter of the year. We had strong sales and comp will be up as a result of that, and higher ops expense due to stronger sales also, and also client on-boarding for ACA compliance solutions. We anticipate with all of this that our operating margins in the fourth quarter will be between 35 and 36%, bringing the full-year margin in line with our previous guidance of approximately 38%.","With that, I will turn it back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Okay, great. Thanks Efrain. Operator, we\u2019ll now open it up for any questions or comments.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Daniel Hussein of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Daniel Hussein","Hi, good morning Marty and Efrain. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start off by asking about small business hiring. Your index suggests there\u2019s been stability in the past few quarters, but we\u2019ve seen mixed data points elsewhere about optimism and hiring and heard a more cautious tone from one of your competitors. Maybe could you just talk a little bit more about what trends you\u2019re seeing there?","Martin Mucci","Yes, what we\u2019ve seen with the Paychex IHS Small Business Index, which we released for the month yesterday, we saw the best three-month increase in the job growth rate for small businesses under 50 in two years, so this wiped out all the decrease that--we saw kind of a decrease in the growth rate at the end of \u201915, calendar year 2015, and then this first quarter we saw that bounce back and kind of wipe out all the decrease. So we think that small business hiring, job growth is on the upswing right now. It\u2019s not huge but it certainly has recovered the decrease we saw last year, so we\u2019re pretty optimistic about it. ","We\u2019re seeing it--you know, there is some part-time in there that we\u2019re seeing increase as well, and you\u2019re seeing it in services or in sectors of jobs like other services and leisure and hospitality, where there tends to be some part-time jobs. But we\u2019re definitely seeing some optimism in the job growth rate.","Daniel Hussein","Got it, thanks. You were expecting, I think, a potential second wind with ACA selling as you approached or past in the most recent employer mandate deadline. It may be too early to say now, but are you getting any read from your sales force on whether you\u2019re seeing interest pick up again over these past few weeks, or accelerate?","Martin Mucci","I haven\u2019t heard it yet, but I think as the deadline for the 1095Cs tomorrow hits, and there has been a lot of activity obviously in the last 30 days with clients and those who were not providing some of the data and now are scrambling to give data and make sure that they\u2019re covered, I think--you know, we still expect that we\u2019ll see a second wave pick-up here somewhat in the next quarter, but I haven\u2019t really heard that yet. But I do think it will pick up.","Daniel Hussein","Got it, thank you. Maybe one last quick one. Could you call out any non-recurring costs related to the Advance Partners acquisition, either the deal or integration costs?","Efrain Rivera","There weren\u2019t any integration costs, but obviously our expenses were higher. I think I called it out in the comments that essentially in the quarter, the additional revenue from Advance Partners was matched by the additional expense, so it\u2019s recurring, it\u2019s not non-recurring, but it\u2019s in those numbers.","Daniel Hussein","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ryan Cary","Good morning, guys. This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. Just wanted to ask a question on the growth in the core payroll business in the quarter, which came in a little bit below where we had modeled. I know you called out growth for the quarter to be at the low end of the full-year range at kind of the 4 to 5%. Once I exclude the benefit from Advance, it looks like the growth is more in that 3% range. So first, is this the right way to be thinking about this; and second, anything in particular that was a drag in the quarter? And then just lastly, how should we think about the full-year guidance range? Should we now expect growth maybe at the lower end of the range?","Efrain Rivera","Wow, you pack, Ryan, a lot of questions in one sentence, so let me unpack that. So I think you\u2019re right that about 3% is correct. In my comments, I called out specifically that the driver of that being--of the 3%, which by the way is up sequentially from the comparable quarter a year ago where we were a little bit over 2%, really was driven by checks. There\u2019s two things that happened, because I\u2019ll get a number of questions on this on the call. Third quarter is unusual compared to every other quarter in the year because third quarter is a quarter where you have more checks than normal due to bonus checks. There is simply no way to figure it out, and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at dollars to figure out whether they equate to checks, so we don\u2019t know whether there just may have been lower check volume in part because of bonus checks. And then the second thing that I called out is our client mix was a little bit lower in the quarter than we modeled, and so the combination of both of those drove the rate down a little bit. We\u2019ll have to see whether that\u2019s a trend that continues.","In part, there is a good point to that. Our unit sales growth is at this point trending about two times, double what it was last year, so when you have that, you tend to have a mix that skews a little bit lower. Then one other point that I would make on that is that the way that we report numbers, what you see as payroll is simply the portion of a bundle that is payroll. It really says nothing literally until you can aggregate to that the non-payroll portion of the sales that are made in the mid-market, and there we saw some nice pick-up in the quarter. ","So I think the short of it, after I\u2019ve said all of that, checks were a little bit lighter in the quarter than we anticipated. We\u2019ll see whether that\u2019s a trend that continues. Client mix skewed a little bit smaller than we had projected, but we\u2019ll see where we go from here. And know when I say--those of you who know when we talk about guidance, when I say it\u2019s between 4 and 5, you can peg where we expect it to be.","Ryan Cary","Great. Then I believe on the last couple calls, you\u2019ve called out new bookings growth, kind of the low double-digits range. How should we think of this trend through the key selling season? Would you say it\u2019s roughly in line with where it\u2019s been the past couple quarters? Any color would be appreciated.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we were pleased with the selling season, and I think year-to-date we\u2019ve continued to see that double-digit, low double-digit growth. So we\u2019re happy, and that\u2019s kind of across the board for the different divisions, so we\u2019re feeling good about it.","Ryan Cary","Great, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Tim McHugh","Hi guys, thanks. Just wanted to ask about the comment you just made about unit sales being 2x less what they were trending last year, I guess. When you say unit sales, can you be--I mean, is that net client growth? What do you referring to as unit sales?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so unit sales are going to--obviously you need to know what losses are, but that\u2019s one, the first part of the equation. So unit sales growth is trending higher than it was last year, and because sales--I\u2019m sorry, losses are trending in line with where they were last year, we\u2019re expecting obviously decent net client growth.","Tim McHugh","Okay. You\u2019re not willing to say, I guess, year-to-date where you\u2019re at with that, Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Well year-to-date, I\u2019d say this, Tim, that our net client growth year-to-date is higher than it was last year.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Just going back to another comment you made, the margin, 35 to 36 for Q4, was that excluding interest revenue or was that kind of that GAAP number?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, that\u2019s our op income margin, yes, excluding.","Tim McHugh","Excluding interest?","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Tim McHugh","Okay, just wanted to be clear. ","Efrain Rivera","No, no, I get your question. Thanks for clarifying.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Then you highlighted lastly--you referred to a middle market a few times as really a particular area of strength, and I think you talked about time and attendance and that bucket. Can you just--I guess, where are you seeing strength in middle market, and can you remind us maybe at this point how big that is and, I guess, how much more quickly is that growing given the core overall business, I guess, to add some perspective?","Martin Mucci","Yes Tim, I\u2019ll take that. I think--you know, what we\u2019re excited about is I think we\u2019re seeing the payoff for all the technology investment that we\u2019ve made, and so with Flex having added that full product suite, we\u2019re selling a lot more--we\u2019re selling more clients and we\u2019re selling a lot more full bundled clients with full time and attendance and HR support, benefit enrolment, benefit administration, et cetera. So we don\u2019t break out the client base specifically, but it is growing. The sales are growing very well year-to-date, and at the highest rate that it\u2019s been probably since pre-recession. So the mid-market has come on very strong year-to-date and certainly seeing that growth stronger than on the small end. All sales are doing well year-to-date, but that\u2019s the strongest we\u2019ve seen.","Tim McHugh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys, good morning. In light of the commentary on strong sales, retention remaining, I guess, stable but at a very good level, I guess I\u2019m struggling to think through how we should think about what that means for service revenue growth, because if we adjust last year for the change in PEO presentation, it really doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve seen any acceleration in service revenue growth, and if you back out the acquisition this quarter, one might even argue you\u2019ve seen modest deceleration in the last quarter versus last year\u2019s trend. So how should the better bookings and stable retention flow through? I know you don\u2019t want to talk about 2017 at this point, but is there any reason that we shouldn\u2019t expect that all the positive stuff you\u2019ve talked about is going to lead to the top line growth accelerating on an organic basis?","Efrain Rivera","Yes Gary, I\u2019d say Q3 is kind of a weird quarter in the sense that there\u2019s always some elements of timing in it, and if I just pick on the quarter and project Q3 forward and say what do you assume about that, I think you\u2019ve got to add in Q4 to get a better picture because the back half tells a better picture, and sequentially Q4 is going to be stronger than Q3. But I think you need to take both of those quarters together, and that gives you a more accurate picture of where the company is going. I think that obviously you\u2019ve got projections, and there are street projections out there, and they seem reasonably in line with what we expect is going to happen, and then we\u2019ll issue guidance off of that.","So I don\u2019t--you know, this is not a business where you can project one quarter to tell you what the rest of the year is going to look like, because there is always elements of timing, when days fall. For example, this quarter ended on a Monday. Whether the quarter ends on a Monday or a Thursday can have some impacts on revenue, so I\u2019d say you really need to look at 3 and 4 to kind of form a better opinion.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, fair enough.","Efrain Rivera","But we\u2019re pleased--you know, just one other thing, Gary. When we look at the key indicators--before this call, I looked at 12 key indicators. I\u2019m looking at client base, I\u2019m looking at discounting, I\u2019m looking at net client growth, I\u2019m looking at sales units, I\u2019m looking at annualized sales revenue - I mean, every vector was pointing in the right direction. The only item in the quarter that was a little bit lighter than we anticipated was checks and there is some variability in that, so it doesn\u2019t concern me significantly. ","Gary Bisbee","Okay, great. Thanks. Then just--you know, I\u2019ve asked you this before, but I feel like I keep needing to ask it. You\u2019ve had this strength in bookings, we\u2019ve seen it from a lot of other HR outsourcing companies, and I think at some level the Affordable Care Act has led companies to--you know, a lot of businesses to take a fresh look and decide if they should outsource more, and it\u2019s not just the ACA compliance but I think broadly PEO and other have benefited. Do you have any better sense at this point if any of that has been pulling forward future sales, or there is risk of now having to at some point in the next year comp this very strong growth in bookings you\u2019ve seen and it gets a lot more difficult, or are you--does what you\u2019re hearing from your sales force and whatnot lead you to believe more that this is going to be a sustainable trend of more desired outsourcing? Thank you.","Martin Mucci","That\u2019s a good question. I think it certainly has pulled some sales forward for clients who may not have made the choice to outsource before the Affordable Care Act kind of pushed them into it, but I also think in a general sense that we\u2019ve talked about the last few years, you see the need for HR and the acceptance of outsourcing and going to an HR administration and a SaaS-based product for time and attendance, HR administration, benefit enrolment, payroll, we\u2019ve seen that certainly come down in size from 50 employees to 100 employees, down below 50. So I think there is still plenty of opportunity to have strong sales, even--it\u2019s not just the Affordable Care Act. So we still feel good about the opportunity for future sales because the demand has come down, so meaning more clients are interested in it and gaining value from it, and the fact that I think we\u2019ve invested very timely in our products and service model to be able to respond to that increased demand.","Gary Bisbee","Great, and then just one last one from me. If I\u2019m doing the math right on Advance Partners, it looks like you paid a pretty healthy multiple, eight or nine times sales and 20 times EBITDA, or something like that for this business. Can you just give us a better sense how you justify that price as a reasonable price, and particularly given the highly cyclical end market it operates in, how confident are you they can continue to grow the business at the rates that they're doing? Thanks a lot.","Efrain Rivera","Okay, hey Gary, I think your numbers are off, so let me just correct your assumption. So we actually paid somewhere between four and five times revenue for it, and we paid less than 10 times EBITDA for it. We don\u2019t typically overpay, so that\u2019s Part A, so I think your numbers are slightly off.","The second part is we are not in the staffing business, and we have no interest in being in the staffing business, but we have a lot of interest in providing back office services to the staffing business because we think from a secular growth perspective, and Marty alluded to it earlier in his comments, we think temp staffing is going to do nothing but go up, Part A. ","Part B is there is lots of small and medium sized staffing firms, and those of you who cover that industry know that, and for every large staffing company there\u2019s always spinoffs that need financing and funding and back office services. So we had looked at this transaction literally for three years before we pulled the trigger, to convince ourselves that the growth rates were real and that there\u2019s an opportunity for someone with the right kind of both service and capital availability to come in and make an impact. So we are very, very comfortable about both of those issues, and that\u2019s really what drove the transaction, and so far, so good.","Gary Bisbee","Great, thank you. I appreciate the color.","Efrain Rivera","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Hi guys, good morning. I heard the comments about the mid-market being strong. Just curious the low end and then the high end, any changes in the dynamics of the market, especially competitively, that you guys saw in the key selling season?","Martin Mucci","Not really, Bryan. We\u2019re not seeing much change from a competitive standpoint, frankly, in any of the markets. We focus primarily on that small to midsize, up to 1,000, and primarily I\u2019d say up to 500 or so, and again very strong on the mid-market and the low end was kind of as expected in a typical selling season. As Efrain and I both mentioned, year-to-date our net client gain is the best it\u2019s been since pre-recession levels, so we\u2019re feeling good about not only the sales side of it but also the retention.","Bryan Keane","And then just thinking about this key selling season, how did net pricing look? How did that come out for the quarter and for year-to-date?","Efrain Rivera","Look - I think, Bryan, pricing is always competitive during the selling season. This was no different, and as I\u2019ve mentioned in a number of meetings, you discount during the quarter at a level that\u2019s appropriate to get the business, and then over time if you deliver service, you have a chance to recoup that discount. So I would say it was comparable to what we\u2019ve seen in prior years.","Bryan Keane","Okay, and then just finally for me, on checks per client, I know they moderated and I think I understand that for the third quarter. What does that mean for the fourth quarter? Does it bounce back, or does it stay at this depressed level? Thanks so much.","Efrain Rivera","I wouldn\u2019t use depression, but I use the word moderated. Look - I don\u2019t completely--I can\u2019t completely answer that question because bonus checks, as I mentioned earlier, in Q3 have an impact, so it could be that we see a little bit lighter checks per client going into the fourth quarter because of client mix. But I would assume that\u2019d be a little bit lighter than we had initially projected in Q4.","Bryan Keane","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. ","Kartik Mehta","Good morning, Marty and Efrain. I wanted to ask a little bit about the Advance Partners acquisition. Is this an acquisition where--you know, you talked about the temp business growing, so is this a business that you anticipate growing organically by using your balance sheet and your distribution, or is this something where you have to go acquire some other companies and other geographies to build a little bit of scale for this business?","Martin Mucci","Well I think primarily it\u2019s organically. There may be some opportunity, just like they would have if they were on their own, to acquire other companies, and they\u2019ll always look at that just like we are, that are in that kind of business. But organically what we saw was a great leadership team that had been producing solid growth, and it fits our market. It\u2019s small and midsized staffing companies that they provide everything from payroll funding to payroll outsourcing to HR support, and we think it\u2019s a good fit and we saw their clients, that\u2019s a growing industry with their clients. When we started getting into this, we were surprised at the thousands of small independent staffing firms that needed that support, and we thought they were providing a great product and had lots of growth opportunities.","When you couple that with the fact that we have a number of staffing companies as clients, independent staffing companies as payroll clients, we now, I think, can take to our clients additional product and services that they offer, and that will help their growth even more. So we saw it as a really good fit, not only from a product to service, a market and a leadership team vantage point.","Kartik Mehta","Then Efrain, you\u2019re in a very enviable position. You have a balance sheet with almost $700 million cash, no debt. I saw you bought back some shares this quarter, and I guess going forward, what\u2019s up? What\u2019s the strategy? Do you think you would continue buying back shares, or is this price, kind of where the stock is prevent that, or are there acquisition opportunities? Is there anything changing in that environment that would allow you to take advantage of maybe acquiring a company?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so three questions. I would say this, that when you look at the results for the quarter, EPS was up 9% and shares were down, so we\u2019ve been slowly whittling away at the share count and would anticipate that we\u2019ll be flat to modestly down in the future. So we do have--we added share buybacks into our capital distribution approach, but Kartik, the second point is that--and Advance is one example of it, so for a number of years you\u2019ve heard us say that we wanted to keep some powder dry to be able to move quickly to do acquisitions. [Indiscernible] pipeline is as robust as it\u2019s really been in the last three or four years, and there are a number of acquisitions that we\u2019re looking at that could consume much or all, or even more of that cash, so we\u2019d prefer at this point until that pipeline dries up to focus on the right kinds of selective M&A as a use of that cash. If in the next 12 months those opportunities don\u2019t materialize, then we\u2019ll have that discussion. Marty and I have had that discussion with the board, and at this point Part A is do M&A and then Part B will be--we\u2019ll reach that when M&A is no longer an opportunity.","Kartik Mehta","Thanks Efrain, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from SK Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","SK Prasad Borra","Thanks for taking my questions. A couple, if I may. First, probably on just the revenue visibility, has anything changed this year compared to, say, the last few years? You had seen specifically from the point of view that the unit growth you are talking about, that seems to have closer doubled compared to the trends you were seeing last year, and your revenue retention seems to be pretty stable, so what should stop from payroll growth to accelerate in the next few quarters?","Efrain Rivera","So SK, just a few points on that. So I think we have been very effective at the low end of the market in capturing units as compared to last year. In order to have significant growth in unit acceleration that would be visible in two or three quarters, we need to have sustained--continued sustained unit growth, and we look at strategies that drive that. I mean, we\u2019re fairly unique in that we play both in the micro space with everything from SurePayroll to the mid-market space with our Paychex Flex integrated solution, so we\u2019ll have to have a number of continued strong quarters in terms of unit growth to drive that higher.","But one thing I want to emphasize, which I said earlier, for us as we think about payroll service revenue growth, increasingly what we think about is HCM platform service growth, and we\u2019re seeing that already. You see that in the HRS numbers. What our sales people do, a sales person in our 1 to 50 or small market sales force, they are not simply selling a payroll-only solution. They are increasingly selling a bundled HCM solution, and we\u2019re seeing benefits from that. The benefits don\u2019t flow into the payroll service revenue line because the portion of the HCM platform, particularly HR administration and time and attendance where we\u2019re seeing really good growth, really is reflected in HRS. ","So I think we\u2019re seeing a bit of both, and we\u2019re going to focus on both driving revenue by selling more integrated HCM and also driving units by approaching that smaller market aggressively.","SK Prasad Borra","Okay, that\u2019s great. Probably just one on the cost side. Marty [indiscernible] mentioned that the implementation costs have slightly been higher compared to recent quarters. Are you broadly enough capturing that in terms of your headcount increase, and would you expect the implementation costs to stabilize now, especially the ones related to ACA, or do you expect that to inflect higher over the next few quarters?","Martin Mucci","I think it\u2019s stabilized at this point, unless we have a big influx of new sales. But I think this was the most difficult quarter to get through in getting all of the first--you know, first time going through getting all the 1095C forms out and so forth, so we ramped up for that. I think that will be--I\u2019m not sure that that will decrease necessarily at this stage, but I think we\u2019ve ramped up and I think we\u2019re holding pretty well at this stage, and then any other additional headcount will really depend on sales and the number of net clients that we\u2019re adding. Obviously we\u2019ve said the net client gain is better than last year, better than we\u2019ve seen in a few years, so that may drive some headcount; but I don\u2019t see any big jump over what we\u2019ve already done.","SK Prasad Borra","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks Marty, thanks Efrain.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Togut","Thanks, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the strength in the mid-market. Trying to piece together what you\u2019re seeing with what ADP is seeing. For example, they called out an unusual drop in client retention in the December quarter, particularly tied to slower than expected transition from a legacy platform to their cloud-based workforce now. So I\u2019m just trying to understand, is the strength in the mid-market somehow tied to this probably short term drop in client retention at ADP, or do you think it\u2019s all related to upgrades related to Flex?","Martin Mucci","I think it\u2019s more the upgrades related to Flex, so I think we\u2019re holding--you know, we\u2019re maintaining a good retention in our mid-market clients, but the sales have increased and it hasn\u2019t been, I don\u2019t think, from any one competitor. I think we\u2019re doing well against our main competitor there, but I think we\u2019re winning--we\u2019re just winning more because the product and the service levels are better. So it doesn\u2019t feel like a one-time thing to me. The sales have accelerated and shown consistency.","David Togut","When specifically did sales start accelerating in mid-market?","Martin Mucci","You know, pretty much the last two quarters, but I think mostly this quarter as you get to year-end, it\u2019s a little bit skewed. But really, we got to the point last fall, September-October, when we really had kind of the full suite brought into the software-as-a-service product, the Flex. We added the complete time and attendance and benefit administration and enrolment, and the electronic paperless on-boarding really kind of came together on a single employee record in the September-October time frame, and that is when we started to pick up speed.","David Togut","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Rick Eskelsen","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to ask a little bit on the HR outsourcing side and the PEO and the ASO, just sort of what are you seeing on demand in clients\u2019 acceptance of one versus the other? Are you seeing more clients move to the full service PEO model rather than ASO? Just kind of get that dynamics between the two of those, and then just more on the demand, which I believe was strong on the PEO.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we haven\u2019t really seen a big shift there, maybe a little bit leaning toward the PEO given the fact that--you know, the Affordable Care Act requirements. But I think we\u2019re still seeing sales both sides grow pretty well, it\u2019s just a preference, and that\u2019s why we feel very good that we have sales and service folks that kind of handle both, so they really respond to the client needs and what the best fit is. You still see PEO predominantly in certain states where there\u2019s a comfort level with it and there\u2019s just a better knowledge of it, but we\u2019re seeing that expand to a few other states but it\u2019s still primarily in those PEO states, as I guess I\u2019d say.","Rick Eskelsen","Thanks. Just one follow-up. We\u2019ve read in the press some stories about funding getting tougher for start-ups in certain situations. Two parts to the question, I guess - first, what impact, if any, does that have on your client base and growth in new client opportunities for you; and then second, what impact might that have on the competitive environment out there for you guys? Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I would start by saying we haven\u2019t heard or seen it get that much more difficult. I think some small business lenders, it\u2019s come down, but you know, there\u2019s been actually--you know, it\u2019s always difficult to fund new start-ups, and the hardest--the biggest hit to that was the drop in the home equity, because that\u2019s really how a lot of these got started, and that happened back in the recession. So if anything, I think some of that has come back and not so much tightened.","Now, you\u2019ve got also an explosion of online offerings that will provide lending to small businesses if they have some credit, so I don\u2019t--we haven\u2019t seen it have much of an impact on us at all. There was really a big impact in the recession, and I think that has slowly come back.","Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, just a little bit more color on that, just to build on what Marty said. I mentioned earlier that payroll sales, or sales units this year are trending above last year. Actually, sales units are growing about twice the rate that they did last year - the sales units, that\u2019s not client base. But what\u2019s interesting is when you disaggregate that number, our sales units from new business start-ups actually were up about 7% in the quarter, so it looks like the environment--and that\u2019s a good development for us because obviously 50% or more of our sales in a given quarter come from newly started businesses, so that\u2019s a good development. It says the environment is good for sales.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of Analysis. Your line is now open. ","Jim MacDonald","Good morning, guys. I had a couple of follow-up questions on Advance Partners. I think I heard that the impact on the payroll side was less than 1%, and I couldn\u2019t quite hear the impact--there was also an impact on the HR side. Was that slightly more than 1%?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, slightly more than 1%.","Jim MacDonald","Okay. So on Advance Partners, what kind of integration plan do you have, and what kind of timing to maybe bring it to the rest of your client base?","Martin Mucci","Yes Jim, we\u2019re already in process of--you know, we have identified the clients that we have that are independent staffing agencies. We\u2019re working with the sales team at Advance to get them out and talking to them, where they already have a relationship with Paychex and now will see this as an additional offering. It\u2019s early stage - we closed it at the end of December, but I think we\u2019ve already been working on having identified the clients, get them in the hands of the sales team, make sure the sales team understands, and be very careful with how they approach those clients because they\u2019re Paychex clients and we\u2019re trying to approach them but offer them additional services and support. ","You know, as Efrain said earlier, we don\u2019t see any big one-time integration costs for this. That\u2019s another great thing about the acquisition and bringing them into the Paychex family. We saw ongoing expense and ongoing revenue and expense, but no big one-time integration costs. It\u2019s really just bringing the groups together.","Efrain Rivera","By the way, Jim, just a point. I was asked earlier about specific integration costs in the quarter. There were a modest amount, maybe between a million and two in the quarter. We just absorbed it, didn\u2019t call it out especially in the numbers. Thought it was just not important.","Jim MacDonald","Great. Maybe just one follow-up. So do you expect to be able to accelerate Advance Partners\u2019 growth now that you\u2019re bringing them into your base?","Martin Mucci","Yes, we hope so. I mean, we certainly would model it that way. As we did the acquisition, we felt that they had good growth but they were somewhat limited from a capital perspective, obviously, and from a cash perspective for their funding, for the funding of their clients and the work that they do. And then, just the client base that we have, I think between those two, we do expect to be able to help them accelerate their growth.","Jim MacDonald","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Just a couple quick follow-up questions. Marty, at the beginning of the call, I think you said that year-to-date you\u2019ve seen your best client gains since the recession. Are you talking about total clients, are you talking payroll clients, HR clients? Can you just qualify that a little bit?","Martin Mucci","Sure, it\u2019s payroll clients. We always kind of talk about it as payroll clients, so it\u2019s the net client gain of the total payroll base, the one that we give kind of once at a year at the end of the year. We\u2019ll give the base, and year-to-date we\u2019ve seen the best net client gain because of a combination of both better sales and solid retention since the recession.","Efrain Rivera","And Jeff, we typically have been saying that we\u2019ll be between one and three, and if you looked at our numbers, we\u2019ve been slightly under two in prior years, and we\u2019re trending pretty solidly between two and three. So it takes a while for a client base of 600,000 clients to grow, but we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. I just wanted to double-check on that. Then Efrain, you were asked about the purchase price for Advance Partners. I think you said it\u2019s something in the range of four to five times revenues and less than 10 times EBITDA. What time frame are we talking about for the revenues and EBITDA - is it forward-looking, backward-looking?","Efrain Rivera","Backward-looking, and it would have been their calendar 2015, which of course you don\u2019t have any access to. But yes, so we acquired them right at the end of December and we paid between four and five times revenue. But I would just say this about Advance, and they\u2019ve done a phenomenal job. There are very, very few businesses that we have looked at, and we have looked at many, many whose EBITDA margins are at or exceed Paychex, so obviously that got our attention.","Jeff Silber","Okay. I\u2019m sorry, just one more clarification on that. That includes the debt that you absorbed in the transaction net of cash?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so--no Jeff, so part of the--you\u2019ll see when we do the Q disclosures, we settle it out. We paid off an existing loan that they had, chose to not re-fund it. We\u2019ll fund it again, that\u2019s the way the business works, but then we acquired a number of receivables that basically offset the amount of the loan. So on a net basis when you filter through that, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. It will have a--the disclosure in the Q which we\u2019ll file at the end of the day is pretty explicit.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. We\u2019ll take a look at it then. Thanks so much.","Efrain Rivera","Okay, thanks. Call me if there is any questions on it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.","David Grossman","Thanks, good morning. So sorry to ask another question on growth so late in the call here, but I\u2019m just looking at the numbers and it would appear that if my math is right, that Advance adds about 60 basis points to the service growth for the year, but we maintained the guidance for the year for service revenue growth. That\u2019s when momentum in the businesses remain pretty strong and your tone is very positive, so I guess I understand the timing issue with bookings amongst some of the other things that you mentioned, but I guess I\u2019m still having a little trouble reconciling your tone with the guide for the year vis-\u00e0-vis the acquisition. ","So if you feel you\u2019ve already addressed this, we could take this offline, or if you have anything incremental to add that may clarify it, that would be great.","Efrain Rivera","No, I get it, David. I understand the point you\u2019re making. I think I said at the--during my comments that we expected the guide for revenue to be at the high end of the range, and I\u2019m not going to call out a 10 or 20 basis point difference, so obviously when we guide to 7 to 8, we think we\u2019re going to be somewhere in the middle of the range at the beginning of the year. I don\u2019t know whether 60 basis points is exactly correct - it\u2019s not probably directionally all that far off, but now I\u2019m into discussing whether it\u2019s going to be 8.1 or 7.9. It\u2019s just too close to call, especially because as I mentioned, checks were a little bit softer so I\u2019m a little bit cautious about where we end up in Q4. That\u2019s the color on that number. The trends are strong.","David Grossman","Then on the dynamic between the strength in the middle market and how that gets recorded as payroll versus HRS, does that dynamic then continue into fiscal \u201917, so you see that--you know, you would probably see better HRS growth on a relative basis in payroll because of that mix dynamic?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, that\u2019s right, David, and look - frankly, just to kind of expand on that, and you\u2019ve covered the company for a long time, 10 years ago what we did was we saw a payroll sales person either in the small market sell payroll - that\u2019s what they sold, and then if there were ancillaries, they were sold by an ancillary sales force. That was the product we had. I would say in the last five years, certainly since Marty was CEO, that dynamic has changed pretty significantly. Our financials reflect the old dynamic, not the new one, and the new dynamic is this, two things: much, much better sales efficiency so that when Mark has a client of a certain type that we\u2019ve identified, it\u2019s a team sale, but we\u2019ve already discussed that in prior calls. What\u2019s changed really over the last 18 months is that a small market payroll sales person is able to sell an HCM bundled product, and they are increasingly doing that, meaning our payroll sales people who used to sell payroll only now sell products that are actually included in the HRS revenue, which is time and attendance and also HR administration.","So it is very, very possible that total revenue can grow nicely and payroll service revenue doesn\u2019t seem to be moving significantly, and that\u2019s a function of where the technology has been, where the market is heading, so we\u2019re going to have to figure out how we represent that a little bit more clearly. I think it is the case as we put more emphasis on selling more integrated bundles that you could very well see payroll service revenue not growing quite as fast, but you\u2019re seeing sustained growth in HRS because that\u2019s where the other components of that HCM revenue are being recorded. It wasn\u2019t a big deal several years ago. It\u2019s a bigger deal now.","David Grossman","Great, well thanks for clarifying that. If I could, just one last question on Advance. Can you give us any sense of how much balance sheet exposure you have at any given point in time now that you\u2019ve got that acquisition?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so again, I\u2019ll just point you to the Q. We established a dedicated line of credit for Advance, and that number is going to be somewhere between 125 to $150 million. ","David Grossman","Okay, and is the vast majority of that outstanding at any given time? ","Efrain Rivera","Yes, it\u2019s going to be outstanding at any given time. By the way, just an aside, David, because I think it\u2019s a great question, one of the things that we looked at--they\u2019ve been around for 20 years, and obviously I--not I, we had a look at the acquisition very carefully. They\u2019ve had very, very few problems because they have a very, very extensive credit vetting process, and we have a really first-rate group that also does that, so we\u2019ve got--there is a lot of safeguards that go into what we do.","David Grossman","Very good. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of RW Baird. Your line is now open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning, Marty and Efrain. ","Martin Mucci","How are you, Mark?","Mark Marcon","Good, thank you. A couple of quick follow-ups. First of all, you said that the retention rate has improved. Can you give us a little bit of a feel for how much it\u2019s improved?","Martin Mucci","Yes, and actually when we look at that client gain, retention has held pretty steady, which has been around our best ever, so we\u2019re right near our best ever retention. It hasn\u2019t really improved all that much, but it\u2019s holding very well even as the client--even as the sales have gone up, so we feel very good about that because sometimes as the sales increase, obviously the retention becomes more difficult as we\u2019re bringing in more clients. The sales have gone up. The retention, I\u2019d say has stayed pretty level as its best ever that we saw last year.","Mark Marcon","So still in that 81% range?","Martin Mucci","Yes, a little better, closer to 82, I think.","Mark Marcon","Great. Then with regards to the comments on the mid-market, can you just quantify what portion of the mid-market you\u2019re seeing the strongest growth in? In other words, small market is up to 50 employees, then is it the 50 to 100, 50 to 200? How would you characterize that area that you\u2019re seeing the best growth in?","Martin Mucci","Yes Mark, I\u2019ll probably go fairly broad there, but its 50--I\u2019d say 50 to 300. That\u2019s where the most new activity is, I think, when you see it because that\u2019s where there\u2019s need, particularly with the ACA compliance and so forth has come down and more are outsourcing and interested in outsourcing. So I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing probably the biggest jump. It\u2019s not in the 500-plus. You know, I\u2019m saying 300=plus, 250-plus, we\u2019re still doing fine there but the acceleration has been more that 50 to 250 or 300.","Mark Marcon","Great. Then given all your comments with regards to selling additional modules, it sounds like you should have some confidence that the HRS growth is going to hold steady at these current levels that you\u2019re seeing for this year going forward, just given the dynamics, or is there something that would drive that down lower?","Martin Mucci","I think--no, I feel pretty good about it. You never know, but at this stage--you know, the only questionable thing would be--we call it ESR, it would be ACA compliance, does that catch that second wave or not. But overall, I think you may see a second wave in ACA as well as health and benefit insurance. You know, from more people needing insurance, we made some headway there, but the 401K, the PEO, ASO all seem very steady, and as Efrain said, a lot of our bundled products on low and mid, being HR administration, on-boarding, time and attendance, all seem to be very--continuing to be very strong. So yes, I would expect that.","Mark Marcon","What do you think the ACA on a direct basis is contributing to the second half of this year\u2019s growth?","Efrain Rivera","Yes Mark, it\u2019s--so I\u2019ll answer it. That\u2019s my pause - I\u2019m trying to figure out how to best. It\u2019s probably less than 1%.","Mark Marcon","Great. Then one follow-up with regards to the comment around--or the question around acquisitions. In terms of the acquisitions that you\u2019re looking at, are you looking at things that are still more in the Advance size range, or was there some suggestion that perhaps we could look at things that are even bigger and could potentially be a bigger impact with regards to the balance sheet? What\u2019s the minimum level of cash that you\u2019re comfortable holding on the balance sheet?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, boy, that\u2019s three questions, so let me answer. So Part A, Mark, would be that much of what we\u2019re looking at is in that Advance, kind of SurePayroll-Advance range, so that\u2019s Part A. Part B, and you\u2019ve heard me in conferences say this, we do look at larger acquisitions. It would have to be right, the numbers would have to add up, and it would have to give us some sort of durable, sustainable, competitive advantage in the market. We would look--not likely, but it\u2019s not out of the question. Minimum cash, it\u2019s lower than what we have on the balance sheet now, but this is a business where you have to project a sense of financial strength to the customers to whom--who are entrusting $4.5 billion of cash to use. So I don\u2019t know precisely where that is, but certainly you would need--I would say not just cash, but liquidity, and if you\u2019ve looked at what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve been adding greater and greater liquidity over the last two or three years quietly to make sure that we\u2019re never in a position where there\u2019s any issues on that.","Mark Marcon","Great. Just to go back to the mid-market, it sounds like most of the mid-market growth has really been through adding more modules as opposed to necessarily an increase in terms of competitive wins. Is that a correct interpretation, or do you think your competitive wins have actually increased as well? ","Martin Mucci","No, I don\u2019t think so. Our number of competitive wins has increased, and I think particularly as I mentioned in the fall as those products--as the whole product suite got under that single employee record and we had that full single sign-on kind of flexibility, no, they definitely have picked up. So while we certainly are bullish on how well we\u2019ve done on ancillary sales and add-ons and full packages, it\u2019s been also the payroll in the mid-market has been very strong, strongest its been in years, so we feel very good about the mid-market payroll sales as well - payroll and full bundle.","Mark Marcon","Great, thanks for the clarification.","Martin Mucci","Okay, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning guys. I have a question about Flex. I know one of the unique aspects of Flex is that you\u2019ve got this, like, tiered service structure to it. How are you seeing client response to that? What types of service levels are the most popular? How are you seeing that evolve now that you\u2019ve rolled it out?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think for the mid-market, where we\u2019ve been talking a lot about this morning, I think the biggest, the best impact for our clients has been the multi-product centers that we\u2019ve been putting together. So in the past, you would have your payroll support and then you would have your additional products in unique supports, where they're uniquely trained on that product - time and attendance, an HRO. While that worked well, sometimes clients would say, geez, it would be even better if you were more connected as a team so that things between various products, if I had questions on how to use something or get the most value out of it. So those multi-product centers have been established by John Gibson and the team, and we\u2019re staffing those up now and we\u2019re seeing more clients come into those multi-product centers. That\u2019s probably been the biggest benefit.","The other one is last year at some point, we went to 7\/24 service, and that\u2019s been a benefit. I would say that\u2019s more of a benefit on the small end of clients, and we\u2019ve seen an increased use of that where they were doing payroll themselves online and it\u2019s off hours - it\u2019s Saturday, it\u2019s Sunday, it\u2019s a weeknight late at night and they get hung up on something that they want to do. They can call for that 7\/24 support now, and that\u2019s gained a lot of interest and a lot of positive feedback as well.","So I think it\u2019s that flexibility, and as well of course they can do a lot more self-service. They can do a lot more things themselves, and we\u2019re finding that clients don\u2019t actually stick to one service model. They this week might want to be doing more things themselves, then get hung up on creating a couple of special bonuses or something the next week and need support, and the next week they might need after-hours support. So it\u2019s that flexibility that we\u2019re finding is getting positive feedback.","Lisa Ellis","Got it. So in that example, just a clarification. How does the pricing structure work, then?","Martin Mucci","Not a significant change in pricing there. We don\u2019t really charge a lot extra for this. What we charge in the price--you know, if you\u2019re taking a full bundle of products and you\u2019re supported by the multi-product center, we feel you\u2019re paying for that level of support in the price of the product, so we\u2019re not having you sign up for various support levels. We feel that when you\u2019re buying a full product suite from us, we\u2019re going to give you a full multi-product service response to your needs.","Lisa Ellis","Got it, okay. So you\u2019re seeing as you\u2019ve got new clients coming on to Flex, they\u2019re generally buying in the full service, because you\u2019ve got a different tiered pricing structure to it, right, with different--","Martin Mucci","Sure. I mean, there is payroll only, there is obviously various product bundles, and we\u2019re seeing more take multiple products. It\u2019s never enough for us - we\u2019d always like to see even more of that, but we certainly have a lot of payroll only but we also are picking up a lot of steam, as Efrain mentioned, with taking the full product suite right up front. Our model used to be, hey, let me sell you payroll, once you\u2019re used to it, it\u2019s working well, you\u2019re feeling good about our relationship, two months later we come in with a sales force on 401K or a sales force on time and attendance, or whatever. Now, we\u2019re selling much more of the full suite of products right up front in the sale through integrated or team selling.","Lisa Ellis","Perfect, thank you. Thanks a lot.","Martin Mucci","All right, you\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Tian Jing Wang of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Tian Jing Wang","Hi, great. Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to ask, given the selling commentary here, can we infer that full service outsourcing demand is getting better versus self-service or point solutions? I know I\u2019ve asked that in the past, but I wanted to see if we could tie those things together.","Martin Mucci","You know, I think it\u2019s kind of a mix. I mean, I do think there is--it\u2019s going both ways. You\u2019re seeing those with needs coming down, so I\u2019d say even 20-plus employees, sometimes 15 depending on the business, they want more of a full service solution, so they\u2019re not just looking for payroll, they\u2019re looking for help with recruiting and on-boarding their clients, and screening and all of that, that\u2019s tied right in with their payroll. They\u2019re not just looking for payroll, so there is that growth in demand. ","Then, there is also on the low end much more of--there\u2019s more clients who say, hey, I just want an online solution with 7\/24 support when I need it, and I\u2019m willing to do and I want to do more things myself. So we\u2019re trying--you know, the changes we\u2019ve been making the last few years in technology and service models have been to respond to kind of all of that, so if you\u2019re an online client, we\u2019ve made the online, and continuing to do that, actually, this next 12 months make it much easier, make it kind of an employee journey for the client so that they can walk through all the way from hiring right through to payroll, HR, et cetera in a very self-service format, if that\u2019s the way they want to do it. ","Tian Jing Wang","Okay, thanks for clarifying that. I\u2019m curious - any impact from Zenefits and what\u2019s going on there? Have you seen any sort of client change or coming back, et cetera, to Paychex?","Martin Mucci","A little bit. I don\u2019t think we lost a lot to them, but we have seen a little bit of a pick-up on the health insurance side, I think where they probably lost some clients due to the concern about them and so forth, and the licensing and compliance. So we\u2019ve picked up some there. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s measurable or anything, but particularly in those markets on the west, midwest and west coast where it\u2019s been most visible, I think we\u2019ve probably picked up a little bit of demand there.","Tian Jing Wang","All right, great. Thanks for the time, guys.","Martin Mucci","Okay, you\u2019re welcome. Any more questions, Olive?","Operator","We have our last question from Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Sara Gubins","Hi, thank you. Just a couple quick ones. First, do you have what the final year one adoption of the ACA product was? I know you talk about it being a little bit over 50%. ","Efrain Rivera","Yes, that\u2019s kind of where we ended up, Sara. Now, just to clarify that, and Marty talked a little bit about the second wave, as new clients are coming on, particularly mid-market clients, you get a chance to sell the service, so that number as a percentage in the base could end up higher. But the initial wave was a little bit north of 50%.","Sara Gubins","Okay. Then Efrain, there was discussion about mix trending down, and that was an impact on the quarter. You also talk about new business sales being about 7%, which was pretty impressive. Is that pick-up versus recent quarters? I\u2019m trying to understand how much of the mix down might be because of new business formation as opposed to growth in SurePayroll. I know I\u2019m mixing terms between total client growth and--","Efrain Rivera","No, I get it. It\u2019s a fair question. So we\u2019ve seen sales in new businesses trending up. Q3 was a strong quarter in terms of sales to new businesses, so that\u2019s number one. When you do that, Sara, you\u2019re correct that the units that you sell then have this impact of driving checks down a bit, and in Q3 it\u2019s been particular--it\u2019s tricky because you lose the most amount of clients, obviously, and you gain a lot of clients, and if that mix is a little bit off from what we project, you can get checks being a little bit more moderate than we expected. By the way, when I say that, I\u2019m talking about a tenth--I\u2019m not talking about four or three, I\u2019m talking about being off by one-tenth in what you project, so it was a little bit lighter there. Sure had a good quarter, but Sure really wasn\u2019t driving that result. ","Sara Gubins","Okay, great. Then just last question, do you by any chance have the number of payroll days in fiscal \u201917 versus \u201916?","Efrain Rivera","The number of what, I\u2019m sorry?","Martin Mucci","Payroll days.","Sara Gubins","Number of payroll days.","Efrain Rivera","In \u201917?","Sara Gubins","Yes.","Efrain Rivera","No, not yet. I think we\u2019re going to have one less than--one less day. I shouldn\u2019t say no and then I give you the answer. The answer is one less than next year. One less than this year, just to clarify.","Sara Gubins","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. We show no further questions at this time.","Martin Mucci","All right. At this point, we\u2019ll close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until about May 2.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","May I introduce your speaker for today, President, Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Anna, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2017. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and you can access our earnings release and the Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage.","This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about a month. On today\u2019s call, I will review the business highlights for the first quarter and Efrain will review our first quarter financial results in more detail and discuss our full-year guidance. Then we will open it up for your questions.","We started fiscal 2018 with solid growth across our major HCM, human capital management product line, excuse me, in particular, our HR outsourcing services and our time and attendance solutions have continued to perform well. Total service revenue grew by 4%. We anticipated some tempering of the growth rate as a result of challenging comparisons with the prior year first quarter, which benefited from tailwinds related to the Affordable Care Act sales.","Providing excellent service to our clients remains a top priority. And we announced during last quarter\u2019s call that we completed the realignment of our service organization, our investment in this service realignment was an important strategy to help support our long-term growth, as well as an example of our priority and commitment to providing the best service possible to our clients.","With the realignment completed, we are beginning to see some benefits in the first quarter compared to the latter half of 2017. Excuse me, I\u2019m also very proud of the work our employees did for the \u2013 to provide critical service to our clients impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma that had major impacts on businesses in Houston and throughout Florida.","The contingency planning and execution was excellent and an important reason why our clients count on Paychex and the strength of our people in numerous locations to support them in difficult times. We do expect that the hurricanes will have an impact on our sales and revenue in the next quarter, this current quarter that we\u2019re in now. As businesses may be forced out of business, at least, temporarily, however, we also expect that over the next few quarters this may be somewhat offset with an increase in small businesses needed to help these areas recover.","On August 21, we announced our acquisition of HR Outsourcing or HROI, and all of its operating subsidiaries, HROI is a national PEO that serves small and mid-sized businesses in more than 35 states. We are excited about this acquisition, as it further strengthens our presence in our existing experience and successful sales and service teams in the PEO industry.","This is particularly relevant during a time of regulatory change, and together with HROI, we share a strong commitment to the PEO business. This expansion of our presence in the PEO industry along with our certification by the IRS under the Small Business Efficiency Act positions us to accelerate growth of our comprehensive HR solutions.","Small business job growth has continued to moderate during the first quarter after the sharp uptick we experienced last year \u2013 the end of last year, following the conclusion of the presidential election. While small business job growth has slowed or moderated, hourly earnings continue to gain momentum. The combination of the steadily rising wages and consistent small business job growth are indicators of the healthy small business sector.","We also announced plans in this quarter for a new building \u2013 multi-building Paychex campus based in Rochester, New York. This involves the purchase of five buildings in the renovation of over 300,000 square feet of existing space in Rochester for a total estimated cost of around $60 million. This campus will result in the consolidation of currently leased space in the Rochester area.","Also, during the first quarter, we announced a partnership with the Latino Tax Professionals Association or LTPA. As a result of the affinity agreement, the LTPA has designated Paychex the preferred provider of payroll and HR services for the organization and its members. We\u2019re proud to be a partner with the LTPA furthering our ongoing commitment to the Hispanic-owned business community with Spanish language tools and resources.","We recently announced the release of Same Day ACH Debits functionality for clients using direct deposit. With Same Day ACH, employers now have the flexibility to reverse a payroll and have money debited from employee bank accounts on the same day, avoiding the costly time lag associated with payroll reversals. This continues to enhance our position as a leader in this payments industry.","Next week at HR Tech, we will be introducing our new product bundles that are in the market. These bundles include new simplified pricing and options for paperless onboarding for our clients, employees and do-it-yourself online handbook. We will also be offering a retina scan time clock, and we are excited about these new offerings, as they respond to the evolving needs of our clients.","We continued our history of dividend increases in this quarter and strong shareholder commitment with an announcement of a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend during the same this quarter \u2013 first quarter, and our quarterly dividend now stands at $0.50 a share. In addition, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock or a total of $94.1 million to offset dilution.","Lastly, let me take a few minutes now and highlight some of the notable recognition we received this past quarter. For the seventh consecutive year, we were again ranked as the largest record keeper for \u2013 by a total number of defined contribution plans by PLANSPONSOR magazine.","In addition, this year, we also earned the ranking of largest 401(k) record keeper by total plans with less than $10 million in assets, as well as one of the leading providers of \u2013 by number of plans added in 2016. Our Paychex insurance agency team ranked number 21 on Business Insurance magazine\u2019s 2017 list of the top 100 brokers of the U.S. business. This is our seventh appearance on the list, up two spots from number 23 on the 2016 list, once again we rank as one of the fastest-growing insurance agencies in the nation.","We ranked number 5 on Selling Power magazine\u2019s 2017 list of the 50 best companies to sell for. This is the fifth consecutive year Paychex has appeared on the list moving up from number seven spot last year. We\u2019re proud to create and support a culture that is entrepreneurial, results oriented and employee and client-focused and attract some of the best sales teams in the country.","With that brief overview of our first quarter, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty. Good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks, refer to the customary disclosures. I\u2019ll start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter. I\u2019ll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap up the review of our fiscal year 2018 outlook.","Total service revenues grew 4% in the first quarter to $803 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the first quarter to $14 million as a result of higher interest rates earned. Expenses increased a modest 2% for the first quarter, compensation-related costs were relatively flat. While investment in technology and growth in the PEO contributed to the slight uptick in expenses.","Our effective income tax was 34.4% for the first quarter compared to 33% in the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Both periods reflected net discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments. The discrete tax benefit for the first quarter was $5 million, or approximately $0.01 per share. For the prior year quarter, it was $13 million, or approximately $0.04 per share. Last year\u2019s benefit was higher due to greater stock option exercise activity driven by stock price.","Talk about payroll revenue, increased 2% for the first quarter to $458 million. The growth was driven by an increase in revenue per check due to price increases, net of discounting. On the HRS side, revenue increased 7% to $345 million for the first quarter. This reflects strong growth in client bases across all major HCM services, including: our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and insurance services.","Within HR services, we continue to see strong demand, which along with the acquisition of HROI is reflected in continued solid growth in the number of client worksite employee served. We had a really good quarter from a WSE growth in the \u2013 particularly, in the PEO.","Insurance services benefited from continued growth in the number of health and benefit applicants and higher average premiums within our workers\u2019 compensation insurance offering. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds.","As indicated in the June call, we anticipated the growth in HRS revenue would be below the low-end of our annual guidance range for the first quarter. The two biggest factors driving this were the first quarter, as Marty mentioned before, benefited from the tailwinds of ACA, both in terms of our ACA module, as well as overall demand for HR outsourcing solution. Increased regulations spurs more outsourcing of HR services. This growth was anticipated to abate as the year progresses.","The first quarter last year benefited from the inclusion of advanced partners, which was not acquired until December of 2015, now that the quarter is a comparable and both included Advance, we\u2019re not seeing that level of uplift, although Advance continues to do well. Advance, I\u2019ll remind you contributed approximately 2% to HRS growth in the prior year.","Look at investments and income. Our goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles, our bank demand deposit accounts in variable rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds in U.S. government agency securities.","The long-term portfolio has an average yield currently of 1.8% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.4% for the first quarter, which is up from 1.2% last year. The average balances for interest on funds held for clients were relatively flat for this first quarter.","And now I\u2019ll walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $851 million, as of August 31, 2017. Funds held for clients as of August 31 were $5 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2017. Funds held for clients, as you know very widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.8 billion for the quarter.","Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $39 million as of August 31, compared with net unrealized gains of $32 million as of May 31, 2017.","Total stockholders\u2019 equity was 1.9 billion as of the end of August, reflecting a $179 million in dividends paid and $94 million of shares repurchased during the first quarter return our return on equity for the past 12 months was a stellar 42%","Our cash flows from operations were $344 million for the first quarter, an increase of 17% over the prior year period, if you remember, fourth quarter called out some timing that we thought would reverse in the quarter. It did indeed do that in the first quarter, and this change was primarily a result of higher net income along with positive cash flow impacts from timing-related income taxes and PEO payroll, accruals and unbilled receivables, which can fluctuate based on the timing of period and compared to payroll check dates.","We\u2019re updating our guidance to reflect the recent acquisition of HROI, as well as the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. We would recommend that our \u2013 we remind you, sorry, that our outlook is based on the current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes, the guidance for the full-year of fiscal 2018 that we just updated is as follows: HRS revenue growth is anticipated now to increase in the range of 12% to 14% for the full-year, raised to incorporate anticipated PEO revenues from HROI. To add color on gating, we were below the low-end of the range for HRS growth in the first quarter at 7% and we anticipate that HRS growth will be in the range of 13% to 16% for the second quarter and should help adjust your models. Total revenue, as you see in our announcement, is expected now to grow 6% this total company revenue.","Our operating margin is anticipated to be in the range of 39% to 40%, said approximately 40% for the first time, modifying that very slightly. Our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 35% to 35.5%, again, a modest adjustment there and the remainder of the guidance remains unchanged.","However, I will reiterate a few items for you. Payroll service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 1% to 2%. While we expect full-year payroll revenue growth to remain in this range, we believe, as Marty mentioned, the impacts of Hurricane Harvey and Irma are anticipated to result in growth for the second quarter that will be at the low-end of this range, so modifying that slightly.","Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in the mid to upper teens, reflecting the benefit of recent increases in short-term rates. We haven\u2019t assumed anything yet with respect to a potential Fed rate rise in December. When that occurs, we will \u2013 if it occurs, we will update guidance.","Investment income net expected to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million, and adjusted net income, non-GAAP expected to increase approximately 7%. Adjusted net income excludes the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018 relating to employee stock-based compensation payment.","We currently have not planned any additional discrete tax benefit from employees stock-based comp payments for the remainder of the year due to the level of uncertainty involved.","Please refer to the non-GAAP financial measures discussion in our press release and in our investor presentation for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to GAAP basis net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as further discussion regarding our use of this measure. GAAP basis net income is anticipated to increase approximately 5%.","Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP, again is anticipated to increase in the range of 7% to 8%. Again, this measure also excludes the impact of the discrete tax benefits recognized in both years.","I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Thanks, Efrain. We will now open the call to questions. Anna, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of Merrill Lynch America. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","Great. Thank you. Hey, guys, how are you?","Martin Mucci","Good Jason.","Jason Kupferberg","Good, good. I just wanted to start by asking about what you saw from a new sales and client retention perspective in Q1? Obviously, last year, you had the tough comp on new sales and you did see some of the headwinds on retention near the back-half of the fiscal year when you made some adjustments to the client service model. So through the first quarter of 2018, at least, directionally, can you tell us what you saw from those metrics, as well as how you see them evolving during the balance of fiscal 2018?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think, from a retention standpoint, I think, what we feel, I mentioned a little bit in my comments. But I feel like after having got through the service kind of reorganization and settled back out and now the tenure of the payroll specialist in those different locations is increasing. We feel like we\u2019ve seen that \u2013 we see \u2013 are seeing an improvement in the retention numbers. It\u2019s early in the year, but in the first quarter, it seems like the mix is better and particularly larger clients, we\u2019re seeing an improvement from the last-half of last year.","From the sales perspective, I think, kind of a continuation of where we were in the second-half of last year. We feel very good about how we\u2019re positioned for the rest of the year and particularly for selling season. We\u2019re rolling out at HR Tech next week some new product bundles. We\u2019re simplifying the pricing in many of the bundles.","We\u2019re adding some things that we feel will be very helpful in the kind of mid-bundle, bundles which is a paperless onboarding offering, so that clients can send an e-mail to a brand new employees, and they can complete everything paperlessly and then send it electronically to update the payroll system, and also an online do-it-yourself handbook.","We\u2019ve always had the full handbook service, where our folks are involved in a personal basis talking to the client. And we heard from more clients that many of them would just like a simple handbook that they could do it themselves online, and that\u2019s also being introduced actually has been introduced right now, but it will be talked about at HR Tech.","So I feel pretty well-positioned. I think, the competitive environment is about the same. It hasn\u2019t gotten a lot more difficult, but it hasn\u2019t gotten any easier, and we\u2019re kind of plugging along and looking forward to selling season.","Jason Kupferberg","So do you still expect that for full-year fiscal 2018 new sales growth will turn positive. I know you were down modestly year-over-year in 2017, but do you still expect that to turn positive in fiscal 2018?","Martin Mucci","Yes, sure. We definitely do. We feel like we\u2019ve got the right products. We\u2019ve changed to \u2013 I think we\u2019d talked about this that we\u2019ve talked more now upfront to clients about the \u2013 it\u2019s our, what we would call, go-to-market strategy. So we\u2019re talking more about our full HR value and selling more products upfront. So that seems to be taking up pretty well, particularly in certain areas of the country. And we\u2019ve shifted some of the smaller sales to an inside telesales team, because clients were reacting to web leads.","We\u2019ve increased our web. We do see more leads coming in. And we\u2019re trying to -\u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 we got to get that tenure built up of the new telesales team here from the first quarter. But we feel good that that\u2019s going to close more sales on the under five inside, because they\u2019re reacting to the client even faster without visiting them.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And just last quick one for me. I saw that the buybacks resume this quarter, which is good to see. Any read through from that as far as near-term potential on acquisitions?","Efrain Rivera","You mean, are they linked.","Jason Kupferberg","Well, is there any diminished probability of near-term acquisition, just given the resumption of buyback activity or yes?","Efrain Rivera","No, Jason, I wouldn\u2019t. We \u2013 I\u2019d mentioned, I think fourth quarter that we\u2019d buyback shares with a modest bias downward. If you look at our share count, that\u2019s exactly what happened.","Jason Kupferberg","Yes, perfect. Okay, thanks for the comments, guys.","Martin Mucci","You\u2019re welcome, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hey, guys, how are you doing? I guess, my first question is, just a clarification, is the entire change in the outlook explained by the acquisition and the tax rate change?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I would say that predominantly is the reason for the change, so updating it for the acquisition. And then the way the stock comp expense works is that \u2013 has an impact on tax rate. So at this point, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Right, right, okay. And how big is PEO now overall after the HROI acquisition?","Efrain Rivera","We don\u2019t separately \u2013 we don\u2019t break it out yet and we\u2019ll have to get through the end of the year, I can update it. It\u2019s \u2013 I think, the last thing we said was that, ASO and PEO combined when we updated, it was about half of HRS that\u2019s as far as we went. We\u2019ll update it as we get to the end of the year.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. And then I wanted to kind of get to sort of the impact of the hurricanes. Could you kind of break that down a little bit with regards to payroll client growth, PEO impact, particularly in Florida, because I believe you do Florida a little differently than the other states. Could you kind of go through that?","Efrain Rivera","Go ahead.","Martin Mucci","Efrain, can get more into the numbers. I think, it\u2019s early actually right now to really know, but we\u2019re trying to track really all of \u2013 almost all of Florida was impacted and then that Houston area. And so what we\u2019re trying to determine is, are they just kind of out for a week? Are they out for three weeks? Are they out permanently?","And then, as I said, we also see that there\u2019ll be some bounce back and, because I think, there\u2019ll also more contractors and so forth coming into town to fix roofs, landscaping and some of the water issues, so the damage. So I don\u2019t think we have it quantified at this point, but we will really get a better sense kind of probably in the next few weeks as to whether these clients are out permanently or not.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","And if you could comment on the difference with regards to PEO in Florida, because that\u2019s a different risk profile, right?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 they tend to be, excuse me, a little bit larger clients. So I\u2019m not sure that they\u2019ll be out of businesses as much and the risk. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll see, how much we\u2019ll see, because most of the damage \u2013 much of the damage, at least, Florida was a lot of landscape damage, not as much structural damage from what we\u2019ve seen and clients are out, because they were out because of electricity or and some are water damage.","So I don\u2019t \u2013 we won\u2019t see a big difference with the PEO, and I don\u2019t think there will be a big insurance impact from a health perspective, or maybe from a business property, but not necessarily from a health perspective than what we could say.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, the only thing I\u2019d add to that Ashwin is, of course, we\u2019d quantified it, which is why we expressed some caution on payroll service revenue. PEO benefits to some extent from the fact that we also have an acquisition there. So we\u2019ve got a little bit more flexibility in terms of calling out at that range. But my caution is informed by the fact that I\u2019ve beenthrough this once before with Sandy, and we thought that bounce back would be very quick.","We saw some impacts at the end of this first quarter from the hurricane. We saw some going into the beginning of the quarter two. And so the challenge is going to be, does that persist? Does it bounce back quickly? And my experience from Sandy is that, whatever you think is going to happen, it probably is going to happen a little more slowly. So that that\u2019s the thought process we have.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. No, that\u2019s fair. No, that\u2019s good to understand. Thank you, guys.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Danyal Hussain of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Danyal Hussain","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Danyal. How are you doing?","Danyal Hussain","Hi, Efrain. Good. Just a couple of clarifying questions on the acquisition?","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Danyal Hussain","So could you tell us \u2013 I didn\u2019t see it, but can you tell us when it closed? And then it looks like, it\u2019s somewhere in the vicinity of $65 million to $70 million in annualized revenue, is that right? And the way you had tweaked your outlook suggests maybe it\u2019s mid somewhere in the teens from a margin perspective and I\u2019m guessing a lot of that is \u2013 go ahead?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Those are all good guesstimates there, Danyal. So we closed it in mid-August, so it really had essentially no impact very, very modest impact this quarter one. The revenue is between 4% and 5% of the total HRS revenues, so that\u2019s what our expectation is for the balance of the year. And then with respect to margins, it\u2019s very modestly dilutive in the year. So, operating margins now are not what we expect they will be in a year or so from now, so and that\u2019s our history of acquisitions.","Danyal Hussain","Got it. And is there anything you could tell us about the purchase price? The [Multiple Speakers]","Efrain Rivera","Yes, hey, we disclose it. I\u2019ll tell you two things. One is, it\u2019s going to be in the Q, so we\u2019ll have a Q out in a couple of days. I think, refer to page six, a compensation \u2013 the consideration structure was a little bit different than some of the other deals we do, it was about 60% cash, 40% stock and there were some performance gates in there. So you won\u2019t be able to get the complete amount that or how it\u2019s structured, but that will give you a good idea of what we paid for it.","Danyal Hussain","Okay. And maybe just a couple more questions on PEO more broadly. Is there \u2013 do you see a lot of opportunity for additional deals in this space? And how are valuations looking? And then separately, Efrain, you called out the WSE growth looking healthy in the quarter. Is there anything specific that you can think of that drove it, or anything maybe unique about where those clients were coming from? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Danyal, I\u2019ll start, it\u2019s Marty. I think, yes, we still see a lot of opportunity. There\u2019s a number, obviously, a large number of PEOs around the country, and we do think there\u2019s some opportunity there. We were very careful about who we select and who we get involved with, given the risk, obviously? I think we\u2019ve done very well with our own risk. And we certainly don\u2019t want to mess that up, so we\u2019re very careful about who we get involved with.","We\u2019re excited about the HROI team, because they add to the great experience that we already have in our PEO and both kind of committed to that full PEO HR outsourcing. So we think there is still opportunity there. We also \u2013 it is probably the fastest growing product line we have is HR outsourcing in total, that we service over a million worksite employees. And the growth there and worksite employees, I think, has been a combination of the businesses that we\u2019ve selected have been good solid clients that are adding.","If you look at our small business jobs index that just came out today as well, growth is moderated back to our base year, but that\u2019s still a steady growth in jobs. And now you\u2019re also seeing wage increases, at least, in small business under 50 approaching the 3% kind of across the board. So that\u2019s a pretty healthy environment that even you\u2019ve got the moderate job growth of the clients and you\u2019ve got wages going up as well all good for us. And right now, the larger you get from a PEO standpoint sometimes the better relationships you have with the carriers and better opportunity there too.","Danyal Hussain","Got it. Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay. You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jim Schneider","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about the thing we\u2019ve been talking about for a year now, which is the ACA. And whether you feel like clients in the mid-market are finally getting unstuck in terms of new bookings at this point. And what do you just hearing? Go-forward, do you feel like that mid-market demand environment is finally starting to kind of fully normalize? And related to that, is there any kind of hangover impact from the DOL rules?","Martin Mucci","I think, on the Affordable Care Act, what we\u2019re seeing frankly is clients kind of holding in place. And so, we\u2019re still continuing to sell a bit of the product, but we got well penetrated into the base with the product. And we\u2019re not seeing many clients take the product out, they\u2019re not dropping the product. I think, there is just such confusion as to what\u2019s going to end up and many of the proposals still have kept some of the reporting requirements.","So even if things change, the reporting requirements may still be in place, even though the mandatory \u2013 some of the mandatory rules might not be in place. So I think, there\u2019s just so much confusion right now that what we\u2019re seeing is clients basically holding on to the product and getting a benefit in a value out of it and being sure that they\u2019re protected based on the amount of reporting that is required at the end of the year. So that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing there.","On the \u2013 I think, you mentioned \u2013 where you\u2019re mentioning the overtime rules as well?","Jim Schneider","Yes.","Martin Mucci","I think, that really is also \u2013 it\u2019s been a good opportunity for us. I think, a lot of clients have because of that and now being, of course, delayed and probably not going into effect, but clients still have found the need for time and attendance. Time and attendance has grown very well for us. And to the degree that now, I may have mentioned this earlier, we\u2019re introducing \u2013 in the next few months, we\u2019re introducing a retina scan clock.","What we found was a number of small manufacturing firms and so forth use biometric finger scan or hand scan, but it\u2019s problematic in certain environments, dirt and your oily environments. So we found a retina scan clock and we\u2019re introducing that, and I think, we\u2019re the first of the \u2013 certainly, sizable payroll companies to offer that as part of our HCM solutions. So it looks, I mean, right now those changes \u2013 those regulatory confusion and issues have been positive for us.","Jim Schneider","That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, on the guidance, I don\u2019t want to get too nitpicky here. But if I just take the midpoint of both your payroll and HRS ranges and add the impact from float, I get a revenue total number that\u2019s a little bit closer to 7% than it is to 6%. So is that just kind of some level of conservatism? Is there \u2013 is it just the impact of the hurricane to the current quarter, or is there anything else in the underlying business that we should be thinking about that might take payroll to the lower-end of the 1% to 2% range versus the higher?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So I think for the year, Jim, I said 1% to 2%. You \u2013 everyone\u2019s model is a little bit different. I think, what you\u2019re seeing there is that, there\u2019s an element of conservatism in what we put out, and there\u2019s a little bit of uncertainty in terms of where Q2 ends up. So I think, that\u2019s the reason for that.","Martin Mucci","But is it fair to assume that we know there\u2019s no reason ex-hurricane that you couldn\u2019t do, at least, a midpoint on the payroll side.","Efrain Rivera","Ex-hurricane, but you just, you said a mouthful there, so it\u2019s true. I think, Jim, here is the issue and many people on the call know this. I was very confident when Sandy hit New Jersey about what the bounce back was, I happened to be wrong not the first time and probably not the last time. So, no, there\u2019s some caution there that that\u2019s the thought process.","Jim Schneider","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask one question on the cost. SG&A was a bit lower than we expected and the sequential decline in that appeared a bit larger than spend. Was there anything in particular you call out?","Efrain Rivera","I think, it was some timing there, Gary. It was kind of broad base. We are \u2013 our expense \u2013 our expenses were planned to be year-over-year the growth to be more moderate. And we typically get a loop off to a little bit of a slower start in spending in a quarter and some really good \u2013 candidly some very good work on the op side in terms of cost containment and controls was helpful. And then sales, we really focused on sales efficiency and putting our plans together that gave us some benefits and then there was some timing, so it was pretty broad based.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. But there\u2019s \u2013 would it be reasonable to assume that it\u2019s sort of normalized a bit over the next quarter or so?","Efrain Rivera","Oh, yes, absolutely, yes, yes, that would be reasonable.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. And then on the PEO acquisition, is there anything in the technology that that you\u2019re going to maintain, or is this really about getting scale buying the customers and you\u2019d planned to move them over to your technology in some interim period?","Martin Mucci","I think, we\u2019re looking at that, Gary. We\u2019re \u2013 I think, there on, obviously a lease platform, that\u2019s pretty popular in the industry. And we\u2019re reviewing that along with compared to ours, which we feel very good about and we\u2019re going to see where that is. It does certainly build from a scale perspective. We also pick up a good strong management team that\u2019s been around, and we feel good about that. And I also, as I mentioned earlier, as you get more scale, you build even stronger relationships with the carriers \u2013 the insurance carriers. So it\u2019s a little bit about all of that.","Efrain Rivera","Hey, one other thing I want to build on just because I\u2019ve read some motes in the time period after the acquisition was done. One of the things that when we look at a PEO is, we do multiple, multiple levered \u2013 levels of actuarial review of what that book looks like. And I can tell you that, there has been a number of assets on the market that we have to the first time thought they were good and the second time we just passed.","So you can, I think, the market should understand that when we look at a deal and we look at their book of business, if that is not where we think it should be and we don\u2019t think the management team is going to manage it to the level that we want to manage. We just simply aren\u2019t interested in it, because we\u2019re not interested in netting that kind of incremental risk to our profile.","So \u2013 and by the way, the other part to Marty\u2019s earlier point, a management team that is able to manage to the level of risk that we want. So that\u2019s very important to us. And you can assume, or you should assume that this acquisition and that management team pass that gate. So just wanted to add that to what Marty had said.","Gary Bisbee","It\u2019s great. And then just one quick follow-up, the $60 million you referenced for the new campus in Rochester, what\u2019s the \u2013 I assume that\u2019s capital expense and what\u2019s the time period over which you\u2019ll spend that? Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Probably over two to three years, it\u2019s going to take to refurb some of the buildings and so forth and put the investment in it, it\u2019s about a two to three-year project. Hopefully, shorter on more of the two-year timeframe.","Efrain Rivera","And just to clarify to it, it replaces lease space, so it\u2019s not an incremental slug of expense. It actually in some ways saves us\u2026","Martin Mucci","Definitely.","Efrain Rivera","\u2026expense going forward. So I just want to make that clear.","Gary Bisbee","Great. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Rick Eskelsen","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could talk about the service realignment with it now being done. I know it\u2019s early, but I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve noticed changes in client behavior, Marty, I think, you talked a little bit about seeing some better early signs on the retention. So what have you seen so far with that now being fully in place?","Martin Mucci","Yes. The one thing I think, if you take different extremes, so you have a dedicated service center. So a lot of our clients that were online, our traditional model which is still the vast majority of our clients, we have a dedicated payroll specialist that calls out to the client at a specified time and works with the client and that model has continued and done well and so forth. But we had a number of online clients that are growing and they call in when they need something, or e-mail when they need something, and we put those teams together and have, what we call, a dedicated service center for online.","You still have a dedicated person that\u2019s assigned to you, but you can \u2013 we have a lot better technology now, in fact, like e-mail technology, we track all e-mails, they can be moved all over the country to the various dedicated service center folks. And I think, our responsiveness on e-mail we\u2019re measuring in is much better and we\u2019re getting positive feedback on that from a promoter score and so forth.","If you look at the multi-product, if you look at the mid-market, we\u2019ve built up multi-product service center, so instead of handling the payroll in one place and then transferring the cost to time and attendance teams or our 401(k) teams or HR administration teams, we\u2019ve now started putting these folks together in teams, and we\u2019re seeing some positive feedback from the clients from a perspective of, hey, everybody is in the same team and I\u2019m getting responsiveness.","So the improvement that we\u2019re seeing is, we\u2019ve seen, at least, early in the year, we\u2019re seeing retention improve a little bit and the mix of the mid-market, which probably had the biggest change is also improving. And that\u2019s probably the biggest part. Of course, it\u2019s 7\/24 service as well, and all that is we can put teams together. It was \u2013 we\u2019re able to use the experience, but have better service performance and responsiveness to our clients.","Rick Eskelsen","And have you seen a change on the \u2013 on your employees side of things? I mean, I got to think that with the \u2013 during the change, there was probably some churn of your people. Internally, has that sort of stabilized? What have you seen from your internal service workforce?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it has. Good question. We did see that spike up a little bit, because it\u2019s changed and some \u2013 or more growth were in certain locations, and so we had to add some new people. We have seen that the tenure do very well. In fact, we track the new hires and our performance on keeping new hires and building up their tenure has been \u2013 has improved dramatically here in the last six months.","So, because we\u2019ve made an extra effort to be sure that once you onboard with us that we\u2019re getting trained and you\u2019re staying with us, so we have seen that. So that the turnover rate of the payroll specialist is down in this, what we call, senior rate, which is an experienced certified payroll specialist as you move up through our training modules during the first 12 to 18 months has gone up as well and it\u2019s getting back into the range that we like to see it from a seniority perspective.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you. Last question, Efrain, just clarifying. Did I hear correctly that the HROI acquisition closed mid-quarter, so to reflect that, at least, the cash portion is reflected on the current balance sheet?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, that would be correct. So it closed in Mid\u2026.","Martin Mucci","August.","Efrain Rivera","\u2026not mid-quarter, sorry, Rick.","Rick Eskelsen","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","HI, just a couple of clarifications. On the HRS, Efrain, you talked about it spiking up a little bit of 13% to 16%. I\u2019d be curious just to make sure I understand the puts and takes here that drive that higher. Obviously, there\u2019s an acquisition there, there\u2019s easier comps. Just want to make sure I understand it? And then what it also means for the back-half for 3Q and 4Q, should be around those same growth levels?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. On the second one, maybe a tad higher, but I think the comparable range is for the back-half, Bryan, and then you\u2019re right about Q2 tailwinds from ACA abate \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, headwinds from ACA abate a bit in second quarter and the comps get a little bit easier and then you have the acquisition on and that\u2019s basically what driving that growth rate Q2.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. And then you talked a little bit about rolling out some new products for simplifying pricing and going to pricing bundling, I think, you launched that at HR Tech, What is the overall impact to pricing in general then for something like this? And I guess, maybe you could just give us overall comments on how pricing is looking? And is there ways to increase price that can push pricing higher, or are you seeing any pricing pressure that would push it down? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Well, I think, we felt from, Bryan, we felt from the price increase in the spring, that we did okay. And it looks like and through the summer anyway that it\u2019s holding this pricing simplification is just we used to break out pricing. It was a little bit more confusing to clients and to new prospects and for the sales reps to present based on kind of some many checks and so forth, and we\u2019ve gone more to a subscription or more to a simplified pricing of, here\u2019s a base price and a price per check. And so it\u2019s a little simpler to present to the client.","We\u2019ve heard that for some time and wanted to get that change. And then the product bundles, we\u2019ve had bundles for some time, but we revamped them and added some more features and functionality to the product bundles, including this in the second bundle in the range to start adding things like a do-it-yourself handbook online, as I mentioned, and in paperless a simple paperless onboarding, which we hear very strongly has been very positive on the mid-market side and now we\u2019re bringing it down to kind of the under 50, and then we\u2019ll be adjusting for background checks as well.","We\u2019ve had that in the bundles in different ways. We\u2019re going to try to simplify that. And then also and not from the bundle standpoint, but also releasing the new clocks as well that we feel will be very popular in a fast-growing business segment for us.","Bryan Keane","Okay. But the net impact of some of these pricing changes probably don\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t move the needle, or does it move\u2026?","Martin Mucci","I don\u2019t think so by itself. No, we weren\u2019t looking necessarily, it\u2019s more of a simplification of it and a better presentation, which we think will increase sales and be easier for us to sell for the clients and easier for the clients to consume. But we don\u2019t expect that just changing the bundles to drive much change in the revenue. But we still feel like we have pricing power, at least, based on what we saw in the last price increase.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. Thanks so much.","Martin Mucci","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel. Your line is now open.","David Grossman","Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Hey, David.","David Grossman","Good morning. I\u2019m not sure if I missed this earlier. But did you talk at all about the strategic kind of rationale behind the HROI deal? What you saw in that company that was compelling, given that obviously you already have huge scale in the PEO business?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think, David, Efrain kind of touched on it a little bit. But I think, when you \u2013 when we look at PEO, so we think, we see HR outsourcing growing very quickly for us at kind of all sizes of clients. And it\u2019s really come down in size and we\u2019ve mentioned that probably many times before. We have both the PEO and the ASO model.","We\u2019ve also been able to take a process of where if you\u2019re in the PEO and from an underwriting perspective, the risk isn\u2019t right for health insurance. We also move you \u2013 we can take you through the agency \u2013 the insurance agency now the 21st largest in the country. And so we\u2019re seeing positive from that standpoint too.","And as we look at PEO, as we look at a lot of opportunities and we\u2019re very careful about a PEO that has good risk based on all the work that we do and pretty a few levels down that has a management team that we feel can scale. And that by adding even more scale to our business, there\u2019s still some pretty large PEOs out there. You gain some credibility and some leverage with the carriers \u2013 with the major carriers in the country, and that\u2019s a positive for us. So we look at a lot of opportunities and we select very few to go after and complete.","David Grossman","But did HROI have any unique presences mostly a blue-gray business? And is that kind of a \u2013 impacts your presence in \u2013 with the workers\u2019 comp carriers, or is there something different about their model?","Martin Mucci","No, I wouldn\u2019t say. So I would say that they \u2013 I would say just that they\u2019ve handled the risk extremely well that they\u2019re an experienced team and from a sales and operations perspective and \u2013 but they\u2019re pretty much across the country. And I think 35 states last we looked, and so we felt they added scale and not necessarily didn\u2019t certainly change our risk profile at all, but kept it very positive. So it wasn\u2019t any specific thing that they did. It was they were adding scale, which gives us more clout with carriers, for the pricing and gives us just that much more experience in sales and operations support.","David Grossman","All right, great. Got it. And then just one other question unrelated. As you know, there has been a lot of recent debate about the margins related to the different segments of this industry, the small versus the mid-market, and I really don\u2019t want to drag you into that debate. But can you help us, at least, better understand in the context of your own business how the margins differ, if at all, between your small business and mid-market segments and what may drive that, in fact, if there is a difference?","Efrain Rivera","Well, I think, David, I talked to a number of you. I think the at its most basic, pricing power changes as clients get larger and not surprising smaller clients are asking you do a lot more for them. And as a consequence of that, they\u2019re willing if you provide great service to pay for it.","As you grow larger and you certainly are in the mid-market, now you have \u2013 typically have more back office support and help. That value of service is important, but it\u2019s different than when you\u2019re a 5% shop than when you\u2019re 60%. So pricing flexibility is a little bit more constrained and I mentioned that.","So Marty said, pricing in general has been good, it\u2019s held, but we\u2019ve been cautious about how much price we\u2019ve increased in the mid-market, and I think that that continues to be an issue as you go up. The second thing I would say is that, increasingly, in order to service mid-market clients who have integrated product bundles, you need teams of service providers. And so the ratios are a bit different than small market clients.","And that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen in the industry not just us, but in the industry people go to multi-product products service centers. And you\u2019ve got, while you still can get efficiencies, the efficiencies are very different than when you\u2019ve got a small client. So combination of those tends to have an impact on pricing and margins and then throw in competition.","So now you get the trifecta of more constraints there in the mid-market. So I think that many of those factors just are not as present until you get into the very, very low-end of the small market, there it\u2019s a little different discussion, because now you\u2019re talking about DIY providers and that\u2019s a different segment in the market. So I think, it is fair to say that the margin profiles are different.","Martin Mucci","Yes, and I think, I just \u2013 the only thing I\u2019d add to that, I think, Efrain said it before too. We\u2019ve always been very mindful of keeping cost out of the business. It\u2019s hard once they\u2019re in to take them out, but we\u2019ve always been pretty careful about having a high margin business and not being largely in that small market, we\u2019ve been able to not to have to customize a lot of process and procedures, but keep our costs very low be able to set up a client very quickly even if they go out of business in six to nine months, which many do.","We\u2019re able to set them up quickly and keep the costs out. We don\u2019t have a lot of layers of management. I mean, you know the business well. I mean, we\u2019ve been very careful about that. So I do think there\u2019s some differences in the businesses from that standpoint, but certainly everything Efrain said as well.","David Grossman","All right. Great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.","Martin Mucci","Okay. Thanks","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMC. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just I think you answered with David Grossman. Just want to follow-up on the risk model for HROI. Is it a fully insured plan, or is it a minimum premium plan, sounds like it\u2019s more minimum premium just want to make sure?","Martin Mucci","They tend to be more minimum premium, Tien-tsin.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. But \u2013 and then I guess, for you, you were previously just out in Florida. So are they a little bit more geographically diversified?","Martin Mucci","They\u2019re more Southeast-based, I\u2019d say, so a lot of it has an overlap. There\u2019s a little bit more in other states, but there\u2019s some overlap with what we already do.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. No just want to make sure we caught the\u2026.","Martin Mucci","No, thanks.","Tien-tsin Huang","\u2026the difference there. Then the just a quick follow-up. Just the balance growth here going forward, it\u2019s been sort of 5% to down for a while, you guys mentioned age inflation and whatnot. So what\u2019s the outlook for balance growth?","Martin Mucci","I think, we\u2019ll see modest client balance growth in the balance of the year. I can\u2019t call it precisely, but that\u2019s our expectation.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Okay. Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin Mucci","Good morning.","Efrain Rivera","Good morning.","David Togut","Your major national competitor has recently talked about accelerating innovation, particularly introducing a new payroll engine, a new tax filing engine under pressure from an activist campaign. I\u2019m just curious how you respond to that and whether you think you need to accelerate your own innovation strategy over the next couple of years in response?","Martin Mucci","I think, I definitely do. I think, we already have kind of it that innovation mindset. We\u2019ve been moving everything to and have moved everything in our development to mobile first and, for example. And so basically, everything is designed for a mobile phone use and then expands to the desktop if you\u2019re using the desktop.","And so all of our development went agile from a development standpoint years ago to be able to crank things out faster and be able to carve pieces of the project up and get product out quicker. We went to mobile first from a design perspective. And we\u2019ve certainly are moving to always try to be and have our UI, our user interface always on the front of kind of the development that\u2019s out there as much as possible.","So I think, I mean, I do think that\u2019s very important. I think, we feel good from the front end of these products, but always can do better and we\u2019re always pushing to say, hey, what are our competitors doing and what do we have to look like a year or two or three from now to start building that out? As a large company, you always got to do that in particular, I think. And then the back end, we feel very good about that keeping up as well.","So whether it\u2019s our tax pay engine or anything, no one for other than one other company probably move \u2013 certainly move any money and more money than we do. And we\u2019re very proud of the fact that that goes extremely well, and we\u2019ve been doing it for many, many years. So, yes, I think, you always have to have that innovation mindset and we feel like we\u2019re always moving to keep up with it and be sure we\u2019re ahead of the competitors.","Efrain Rivera","One of the thing, David, I\u2019d add is, if you look at what we did \u2013 Marty did five years or so ago, when we saw that we had a need for a DIY SaaS platform in the micro enterprise space, we went out and bought it. So one of the other things that we are not averse to is, if we see technology we like, we buy it, and then we integrate it. You have to be disciplined about doing that.","I think, we\u2019ve done that very well with things like myStaffingPro, which is a talent onboarding and Marty just mentioned net time, which is our time and attendance product. We\u2019re constantly looking for that. And our mentality is, we\u2019re going to look for good technology and if it makes sense using our IT resources identify it and bring it into the fold. So it\u2019s not a solely our internal development. It also is part of our business development focus.","Martin Mucci","Yes, a lot of things have changed. I mean, it\u2019s a really interesting question when you even think from how you interconnect with other \u2013 others through an API interface and we\u2019ve been active with that. And as Efrain said, we buy some technology sometimes to give us a fast start and then build it into our products. And like time and attendance and myStaffingPro for the HR onboarding and paperless onboarding. So we try to speed up the cycle as much as possible.","David Togut","Understood. Just a quick follow-up question, have you seen any distraction impact on your principal competitor sales force during this proxy fight?","Martin Mucci","I don\u2019t think so. I think the competitive environment seems to be about the same. It doesn\u2019t appear that, at least, from our standpoint that that has changed much at all.","David Togut","Thanks so much for taking my question.","Martin Mucci","All right, David.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of Baird. Your line is now open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning, Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Hey, Mark.","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Mark.","Mark Marcon","A couple of quick questions. One, just topic in the news Equifax. To the extent that you believe that the data is now out there. Do you have to do anything incrementally in order to secure the data or to make sure that the right people are being paid or anything along those lines?","Martin Mucci","I think, we\u2019ve always had very much a mindset of the security of our data. And in fact, we don\u2019t do anything with Equifax other than kind of some of our own employee kind of work that some large companies do. We don\u2019t pass client employee information to them. And we\u2019re always \u2013 and 21 of the fastest-growing areas over the years has been our IT security team.","I remember, years ago when I started, it was probably six people, and it\u2019s much more like 10 times that, at least. And so we\u2019re very careful about what we\u2019re doing. I think multi-factor authentication coming out with MFA years ago and we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re really pleased with the fact that when multi-factor authentication first came out, clients were taking the easiest way to do that.","And now the majority has swung to what we call level two, which is what you see with most banks and so forth, which is getting a text if your call \u2013 if you\u2019re coming in to do your payroll from a PC, a laptop, or something a device that weren\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t recognize, you have to \u2013 you have signed up to get a text from us to verify who you are.","We have seen incidents where our clients \u2013 for our clients go down dramatically. We never had a lot, but we had enough that we really pushed that and we\u2019ve seen that go down. And so we see the clients paying a lot more attention to taking the precautions necessary, because small businesses in particular not always careful about sometimes about the laptop, but they\u2019re on the road, they\u2019re trying to do things, and we\u2019re trying to protect them. So we\u2019re very careful, very diligent about it. We know how sensitive our data is and we do our best to protect it.","Mark Marcon","Okay, great. And then a couple of numbers questions. Just CapEx for the year now with the campus acquisition?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Mark, I think, we\u2019ve disclosed that, I think, we\u2019re at around $180 million is what we set out with the campus included.","Mark Marcon","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","I think we\u2019ve put a \u2013 noted it, don\u2019t hold me to that number, look in the Q, we set it out.","Mark Marcon","All right. Great. And then with regards to HROI, the margins are guided down for Q2 through Q4?","Efrain Rivera","Right.","Mark Marcon","If the deal is modestly dilutive\u2026.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Mark Marcon","We did better in the first quarter, is that all explained by HROI, or is there maybe some conservatism in there?","Efrain Rivera","I think it\u2019s primarily HROI, Mark. So \u2013 well, I mean, first of all, if you just take Q1 and then project forward and then say what the margin would be, I think, you end up getting a little bit of a incorrect view of the rest of the year. Just remember that some of that was timing. And as we get into other quarters in recent years, our margins in Q1 have been the highest of the year, so\u2026","Mark Marcon","Oh, yes. I get that. I know the normal seasonal pattern, but it seems like it\u2019s a little \u2013 just a tad more than I would have expected?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. No, we\u2019re not trying to be overly conservative, we\u2019re trying to be as realistic as we can. I will say this, that in most instances, this is my seventh year here doing it, we\u2019re pretty much on what we say. So I think that that\u2019s our expectation at t his point.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And then the EPS doesn\u2019t go up much for the deal?","Efrain Rivera","For EPS going up for the deal, Mark?","Mark Marcon","Yes.","Efrain Rivera","No, because it\u2019s actually modestly dilutive.","Mark Marcon","Just to the margins, but\u2026.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. No, no, but it doesn\u2019t. No, it\u2019s not going to help EPS this year.","Mark Marcon","Okay, great. But then you did say that the margins will go up in the following year. Can you just give us a little more color on that?","Efrain Rivera","No, no, Mark, I\u2019m not going to go there. So I have no idea at this point in time.","Mark Marcon","You do.","Efrain Rivera","[Multiple Speakers] By the way, I applaud you on your skillfulness asking, he declined to answer the question.","Mark Marcon","I know declined, but not I have no idea.","Efrain Rivera","You got it, yes.","Mark Marcon","All right.","Efrain Rivera","You have the modest idea, I won\u2019t talk about it though.","Mark Marcon","Okay. Is it 50% is it roughly 50% Florida in terms of the worksite employee?","Efrain Rivera","On the PEO?","Mark Marcon","Yes. HROI?","Efrain Rivera","I haven\u2019t disclosed that. We\u2019ll give more color on it.","Mark Marcon","I know, but when we look at the offices and then think about the penetration in the markets?","Efrain Rivera","I think, if you want to make a reasoned guesstimate there, I\u2019m not going to disagree with that.","Mark Marcon","Okay, great. And then \u2013 and this with regards to the commentary on the price increase for this year that you\u2019ve always pass along at the usual fashion, usual date. Did that \u2013 was that on the lower-end of that traditional range?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, it was, yes, it\u2019s on the lower-end of that range. Yes.","Mark Marcon","Okay, great. And then as we think about just the new sales and all initiatives that you\u2019ve got in place, should we think about the growth in this upcoming sales season being more skewed towards the mid, or the lower-end of your client range?","Martin Mucci","I don\u2019t think, it\u2019s skewed either way, Mark. I think, we\u2019ve got initiatives going across the board, so I don\u2019t see it skewed either way. We certainly got a number of initiatives like the inside sales and the additional web investment for the leads,. probably attacking more of the small end, but we\u2019ve also got a number of things with the bundles and other products that are attacking that mid-market. So I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s going to be skewed any different.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And just the same-day reversals that you\u2019re capable of doing now, how big of a deal is that going to be in terms of being able to get new sales?","Martin Mucci","I think, it\u2019s going to take a little bit to catch on. I think the clients \u2013 this is one of those things, where clients don\u2019t realize what a benefit that is unique to us until they need it. So I think, it could help probably more on the retention than it may on the front end and on the sales side.","When you have a \u2013 especially as online clients, if you make a mistake and I overpay Efrain and it takes me a week to undo it as opposed to I can undo it that same day without even a real impact to him, that\u2019s a huge benefit to the client. But I think it\u2019s going to be more of a retention benefit than it is probably a new sale benefit.","Mark Marcon","I would use it as a sales as well?","Martin Mucci","No, no, I would use it. I\u2019m just saying most clients see those things as, well, that\u2019s never going to happen to me. So I\u2019m not going to make a mistake, I\u2019m not worried about it. But you see that more and more as clients are doing more online, they\u2019re making those errors. And then if you can\u2019t reverse it that quickly and that employee quits or doesn\u2019t can\u2019t afford to pay you back, it\u2019s a real issue. So it \u2013 I\u2019m just saying, it tends to be, they believe it more once they see it and need it.","Mark Marcon","Great. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about how a client growth and checks per payroll are trending as you start into the new fiscal year?","Efrain Rivera","We don\u2019t talk too much about either until we\u2019re through the year. So I would just say, Lisa, it\u2019s early to make a call on all that.","Lisa Ellis","Okay. And then second one is just anything you would call out, sort of state level changes from a regulatory environment perspective? Like in the past, we\u2019ve seen things like overtime rule changes, et cetera. Is there anything like that on the horizon as we look out to the next few quarters?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I\u2019d say, one of the things we\u2019ve seen quite a bit now are these state changes. I think the two biggest ones that are causing issues would be the overtime regulation \u2013 there\u2019s three, overtime regulation, family leave and minimum wage rules, because they\u2019re all very much \u2013 as the Fed has tried to reduce regulations, the states have picked them up and increased them and it\u2019s causing a lot of confusion for clients.","So if I\u2019m a multi-state business and I\u2019m in two or three states, it\u2019s very difficult for me right now to track all the minimum wage changes that are happening by state and sometimes city. Family Leave now going to impact, and they\u2019re are all different. So what do I have to do from a family leave? What taxes am I \u2013 should I be deducting for family leave, like New York State they already kicked in before the actually the family leave, our benefit is even available January 1. So we\u2019re seeing family leave, overtime regulations and minimum wage are the three biggest changes happening kind of state by state.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Stephen Sheldon","Hi, it\u2019s Stephen Sheldon for Tim this morning. Yes, most of my questions have been answered. But you talked about seeing strong WSE growth for the PEO business. So can you maybe quantify what kind of growth you\u2019re seeing there organically? And how that compares with what you\u2019ve seen over the past few years?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So we don\u2019t update those numbers until the end of the year. But we \u2013 when I call out that number, I\u2019m calling out organic growth, not acquisition, obviously when we discuss that as we get to the end of the year. But I can\u2019t quantify it, but it\u2019s stronger \u2013 it was strong growth in the quarter in the double-digit range.","Stephen Sheldon","All right. Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Martin Mucci","Anymore questions, Anna?","Operator","We don\u2019t show any question on queue.","Martin Mucci","All right. At this point, we will close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 30 days.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, and good morning, and thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Call and Webcast. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, before the market open, we released our financial results \u2013 excuse me, for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage. And we will file our Form 10-K by the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.","On today's call, I will review highlights for the fourth quarter in fiscal 2016 related to sales, operations, and product development areas. Efrain will review our fourth quarter fiscal 2016 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance. And then, we'll open it up for your questions.","We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2016. Our momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Efrain will talk in more detail about the financial results, but I want to touch on a couple of key points. First, total revenue was up 9% in the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year, reaching nearly $3 billion, a new record for Paychex. Payroll service revenue continued to experience steady growth of 4% for fiscal 2016, driven by growth in client base and revenue per check. And our payroll client base finished this year at approximately 605,000 clients, the highest client growth in recent years. Solid sales execution during fiscal 2016, along with high client retention in excess of 82%, positively impacted our client base. Client retention was consistent with last year's record high retention.","HRS revenue benefited from strong demand for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services, as we once again realized double-digit growth in client worksite employees that we serve. In particular, our PEO has been an area of strong growth. In addition, our full-service Affordable Care Act product contributed to the HRS revenue increase.","During fiscal 2016, we made significant enhancements to our Paychex Flex platform, which is our proprietary cloud-based human capital management, or HCM solution. Paychex Flex is a robust technology and service model that supports our clients for every phase of their employees' journey from recruiting to retirement. This model allows business owners and HR professionals to tailor a solution encompassing tools, capabilities, and services that meet the unique needs of their organization and employees.","Earlier this year, we completed the integration of the remaining key HCM modules with Paychex Hiring, Paychex Time, and Paychex Benefits. We believe we also have the best in market mobility offerings for both administrative users and employee self-service that allows access to our HCM suite with a single mobile application.","Paychex Flex continues to receive positive reviews evidenced by multiple awards and acknowledgement received throughout this year. Earlier in the year, we earned recognition from the Brandon Hall Group Excellence Awards for advancements in workforce management technology for small and mid-sized businesses; PC Magazine's review referred to Paychex Flex as excellent, calling it more robust and scalable than some of our competitors' platforms; and most recently in the quarter, we received a 2016 TekTonic Award from HRO Today for the best-in-class mobile and cloud-based technology suite for comprehensive integrated HCM services. We are very pleased by this recognition, and it supports our belief that Paychex Flex technology, combined with a unique mix of personalized flexible service options, sets us apart and provides great value to our clients. We remain committed to our investments in product development and technology to keep us a market leader.","Sales execution during 2016 was strong, with another year of double-digit growth, especially within the mid-market space. We believe the value that our Flex platform provides is a key driver to this success.","During fiscal 2016, we announced the acquisition of Advance Partners, who joined the Paychex team during the third quarter. Advance Partners offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. Advance Partners and its leadership team has already proven to be a great addition, with their positive results and opportunity for growth in the expanding staffing market.","Throughout the year, we have continued our shareholder-friendly actions. We maintain a strong dividend yield; and in July of 2015, we increased our regular quarterly dividend by 11%. The dividend increase supports our history of providing exceptional shareholder value while continuing to make strategic investments for the long-term sustained growth of Paychex. We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired an additional 2.2 million shares of common stock for $108 million in fiscal 2016. As of May 31, 2016, our stock price was over $54 per share. And that has a total return of over 102%, or 15% on an annualized basis, over the past five-year period.","The regulatory landscape for HCM continues to get more complicated, making managing HR increasingly difficult. We strive to be a valuable resource to our clients to educate them on changes and assist them with compliance. Recently, new overtime rules were approved by the Department of Labor that will expand overtime protection to millions of workers. We are well-positioned to help our clients comply with these new regulations. Our advanced suite of time and attendance products, including web and mobile tools, can assist companies with the scheduling, tracking and reporting of time, which will be critical to managing this new regulation.","In summary, I'm extremely proud of the leadership team and all of our employees of Paychex, who have continued to deliver great service and product solutions, resulting in continued high client satisfaction and continued high levels of client retention. We also continue to focus on providing leading-edge user-friendly technology and unique personalized service to our clients, while delivering solid, consistent top line growth, strong operating margins and excellent returns to our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will make some forward-looking statements for the future events, and thus, involve some risks. Refer to the customary disclosures.","As Marty indicated, we had a strong finish to 2016. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the quarter and for the fiscal year and then provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2017 outlook.","Total service revenue grew 9% for the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $12 million; and 9% for the fiscal year to $46 million. Increases were primarily the result of higher average interest rates earned. Average investment balances were up 1% for the fiscal year, showing a positive impact from client growth, which is offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates.","Total expenses increased by 8% in the fourth quarter and by 7% for the fiscal year. These increases were mainly in compensation-related costs, resulting from higher wages and higher performance-based comp. Strong growth in our PEO also contributed to the increases. Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of the growth in total expenses for the fourth quarter, but less than 1% for the fiscal year.","Operating margin was 36% for the fourth quarter and 38% for fiscal 2016. Operating income net of certain items increased 10% to $264 million for the fourth quarter and 9% to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate was 34.3% for the year compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2015. This is due to software production tax benefits, as we've discussed in prior calls. In our first quarter, we recognized a discrete item in the form of a tax benefit derived on income from prior years related to customer-facing software we produced. This discrete item was the largest \u2013 had the largest impact on the effective tax rate. While we have ongoing benefits of the impact, it's not as significant.","Net income growth increased 11% to $178 million for the fourth quarter and 12% to $757 million for the fiscal year. Diluted EPS increased 11% to $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter and increased 13% to $2.09 per share for fiscal 2016. Net income diluted earnings per share would've increased 9% and 10%, respectively, without the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter.","Payroll service revenue increased 5% for the fourth quarter and 4% for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounts. Fiscal 2016 also benefited from two additional processing days during the year; one day in the first quarter, and one day in this quarter, fourth quarter. The extra days added approximately 0.5% to total payroll revenue, as did the acquisition of Advance.","HRS revenue increased 14% to $311 million for the fourth quarter and 13% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year. Paychex' HR Services continued to experience solid growth in clients and client worksite employees served. The PEO, in particular, contributed double-digit growth in client worksite employees served.","Insurance services revenue growth benefited from continued growth of our ACA product and an increase in health and benefit applicants. The workers' compensation portion continued to grow with higher average premiums and growth in clients. Advance Partners contributed approximately a little bit less than 2% to growth in HRS revenue for the fourth quarter and approximately 1% to fiscal year growth.","Investments and income. Our primary goal, as you know, continues to be to protect principal and to optimize liquidity. Combined portfolios, including both short-term investments and long-term investments, have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We did see moderate benefit from the 25 basis point increase by the Federal Reserve on a short-term portion of our portfolio, but our long-term portfolio as of May 31, 2016, has an average yield-to-maturity of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.1 years, fairly unchanged from last year.","Average investment balances for our client funds were flat for the quarter and up 1% for the fiscal year. While client growth positively impacted our average balances, this was offset by the impact of lower state unemployment insurance rates this year. The average invested balances for our corporate funds were down 9% for the year, largely due to the cash outflow for the business acquisition as well as share repurchases.","I'll now walk you through the highlights on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $793 million as of May 31, 2016, and no debt. Our cash flows from operations hit a milestone, exceeding $1 billion for the fiscal year, 14% higher than last year. Our net income, non-cash adjustments, and favorable working capital changes all contributed to the increase.","Funds held for clients as of May 31, 2016 were $4 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.1 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of approximately 1%. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $48 million as of May 31, 2016, compared to $14 million as of the end of last year.","Total stockholders' equity was $1.9 billion as of May 31, reflecting $607 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Dividends paid represented 80% of net income. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 40%.","Now let's turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. I'd like to remind you that the guidance and our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions, continuing without significant changes. Payroll service revenue was projected to increase approximately 4% compared to fiscal 2016. The projected growth is based on an anticipated client base growth and increases in revenue per check. This growth is tempered by one less processing day in fiscal 2017. So, we'll have one less processing day this year, and that day will occur in the third quarter. So, I'll come back to that in a second. So, one less day, and it occurs in the third quarter.","HRS revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 7% to 8%. Net income is expected to increase approximately 8%, excluding the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. And that's important to bear in mind, when the two years are compared.","Our operating income net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to be approximately 38%. We anticipate a modest impact on leverage growth, as we are making investment in operations to support both mid-market and compliance solution services. So, I will get the question, and I'll answer it now. So, we don't anticipate \u2013 do we anticipate leverage? Yes, we do. We think it will be modest, because, as I just called out, we're making investments in \u2013 with operations and compliance service solutions to bolster and to support that growth.","With respect to the quarters, as previously mentioned, there will be one less processing day in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Now let me get a little bit more granular, so you can fine-tune your model. Payroll revenue for the first and second quarters is expected to be at or above the full year guidance for payroll revenue. The third quarter, we expect to be below. I just mentioned we have one less day. It will be below the full year range. And then the fourth quarter, at this stage, we anticipate will be between 3% and 4%. So, just to reiterate, first and second quarters, we expect to be at or above the full year guidance for payroll revenue; third quarter, below, and fourth quarter between 3% and 4% at this point.","HRS is expected to be within the full year guidance range, with the exception of the third quarter, which will fall below the full year range. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36%.","Interest on funds is anticipated to be in the mid-single-digit range. We have not included any potential Fed fund rate increases in our guidance. I'd like to call out that when I reviewed consensus models, many of the numbers were close to what I'm reporting, but there was one important difference. Interest on funds held for clients was higher in the consensus models, and it looked like to the tune of about $0.01 to $0.02. We are not including any assumptions with respect to Fed rate rise increases. And as you well can appreciate, those look a lot more uncertain than they did even three weeks or four weeks ago.","And then finally, with respect to EPS, we expect EPS in each of the quarters to be comparable, meaning pretty similar, with the following exceptions: First quarter, we expect will be modestly higher, and the third quarter, modestly lower; the third quarter, in particular, because of the one less day on payroll processing. So, that's the fine-tuning on the guidance.","And then just want to make one final comment. It was about five years ago that Marty started to assemble the team that has led Paychex over the five-year period. And he set an ambitious goal. The goal was to hit $3 billion in revenue. That was an ambitious goal because when we finished 2011, we were growing 4%. This quarter, we're really on the cusp of that goal. It's an important milestone internally for us.","Marty cited the returns for the past five years. We compared very favorably versus the S&P 500 and even against the S&P Technology Index. Those results are a testament to both employees, the executive team and to Marty's leadership. We're not the kind of people who brag or smack-talk, but we're quietly very, very pleased that we're on the cusp of that milestone, but we're also grounded enough to understand that we have to earn the trust of our clients, employees and our shareholders every day if we want to succeed. Every question you've asked in the last five years has caused us to think, to question and it's challenged us, and we've appreciated that. And yes, finally, we're not satisfied. We're hungry for more.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Martin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Efrain. I can't wait to close the call right there, but we'll open it up for questions and comments. Tessa?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for incoming questions. The first question comes from Jason Kupferberg. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you?","Efrain Rivera","Hi, Jason.","Jason Kupferberg","Wanted to start with a question on core payroll and I appreciate all the quarterly color for the fiscal 2017. That's helpful. I'm assuming that the first half of the year being above the full year guidance is largely because of Advance and then obviously you've got the headwind in Q3 from one less day, and then you mentioned Q4 being 3% to 4%, which I think would not be burdened by processing days or by Advance. So it seems like kind of a cleaner number. I'm just trying to think sort of medium-term-ish harkening back to the Analyst Day last year and with that, would that imply or would it be fair to infer that then that 3% to 4% run rate is something that's realistic to sustain assuming no other acquisitions or typical fluctuations in processing days?","Efrain Rivera","Jason, so I think that is a fair number. The only caveat I would add to that is that what that number that we're giving on payroll suggests is. We're just not getting an uplift from checks per payroll, which if you went back two years ago, we were getting 2%-plus on checks per payroll, combination of \u2013 small commendation of mix, but just very, very, very modest assumptions on checks per payroll just don't contribute to payroll revenue growth. So I think it's somewhere in that range.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And still 2% to 4% on pricing for payroll this year?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, yes, yes.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Understood. And then just switching over to leverage, I mean that color on the reinvestments this year is helpful. Is there anything we should be thinking about also, though, in terms of mix shift? I mean I'm thinking about areas like PEO which are obviously growing very well for you but presumably carries lower margin percentage. So when we think about the ability for the business over multiple years to drive meaningful operating margin expansion, is that an inhibitor? Is it big enough?","Efrain Rivera","Really not. You know what, I'd just say if you look at our results this year, our leverage down to the EBIT line was about 100 basis points. So we had a pretty good year in terms of leverage. Now what you're seeing there is the fact that \u2013 two things that are implicit there. Number one, we had a really good year in mid-market sales. In some areas, our win rates were really, really, really strong. And as we look into the year we did two things this year. In 2016, we added to the mid-market sales force, which we don't typically do mid-year but we did. And as we added to the mid-year sales force, we were also transforming the service model. So we've made a lot of changes on the service model to improve service to mid-market clients and just in anticipation of that growth, we decided that it was important to have a year where we'll put more money into bolstering our service there.","So that's what's happened. I think it's really kind of more of a one-year to two-year thing than a long-term issue in terms of affecting leverage. And finally to your point, PEO is just not big enough to really move the needle yet. It could if it really grew significantly beyond where it is now, but not affecting it now.","Jason Kupferberg","And just last one for me, can I get your perspective on where we are in the ACA cycle? What's assumed in the fiscal 2017 HRS guidance for ACA versus what the contribution looked like in fiscal 2016? Because obviously the overall guide for HRS is calling for steady growth.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think, well obviously today's a big filing day, and it's been certainly a complicated process. And probably the most complicated is just helping clients through the process, what was needed and especially those clients that came in kind of later in taking the product. But, an outstanding job by the employee teams that have been working on it and we feel pretty good about the filing that we're doing. And a lot of work, by the way, with the IRS too, our compliance team's working with the IRS for this first year of real, true filing.","I think you'll see some of that sales, obviously there was a lot of upfront sales, and I think you'll see some of that slowdown some. However, when you think about how many new clients come in to us every year, we think we'll have a great attachment rate of that product that really is necessary. And one of the costs, as Efrain said, with the investment in the mid-market, one of those costs is continuing to invest in the ACA support because as we've learned, as we've gone through, this requires even more support of the clients and the filing requirements, and a little more technology to kind of help the clients through the process. So I feel good about it, it's been a tough number of months to get through this, but we're excited on the filing date and the additional investments we're going to make.","Efrain Rivera","Hey, so, and Jason, on the other question. This year, ACA compliance services were, contributed less than 1% of the growth in revenue. Next year really is pretty negligible in terms of growth. If there's some, I should say it's not zero, but most of the clients, the bulk of the clients that needed the service signed up, and a number of them will probably understand that they needed it and we'll have some additional clients. But we've absorbed that headwind, if you will, that modest headwind into our guidance and feel pretty comfortable about where revenues is going to land next year.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Thanks for the comments.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Danyal Hussain. Your line is now open.","Danyal Hussain","Hi, Marty and Efrain. Thanks for taking the question. Just, this is a follow-up on leverage. I guess it sounds like a lot of the investment is one-time or sort of catch-up in nature, or maybe anticipatory in nature. But is the go-forward operating leverage in that model? Is it more service-oriented, and so is it lower going forward?","Efrain Rivera","No, I don't think so. I think two things. One is you only go through a Flex transition a few times in a technology cycle, so frankly, it's a byproduct of the success we are having selling Flex. So it's not a change to the model, it's really, frankly, the success we're having in the mid-market, requiring \u2013 in our world, bolstering our service a bit. So that technology and that service is scalable as you grow clients initially the way we are now, we just have to scale up the service component of it. So it's more short-term in nature.","Danyal Hussain","Got it. And to that point, actually, on Flex, so if you think about R&D spend, given the changes you've gone through and the products that recently \u2013 are we at the point now where maybe you can start to see more leverage on that cost? Or is there maybe not as much opportunity given how much you have to update with ACA?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think we're at \u2013 well, there's always continued investment, but I think we are at a pretty good place for the level of IT spend in R&D, and so I think, you'll gain something there, but we won't be going up much in that spend, I don't think, but you won't see it necessarily go down a lot, either. So it will be a pretty good steady place there. I think what Efrain has talked about the most is we're gearing up for some of the service. As you add it all, if we added all these products, we're changing some of our service models and we're putting more technology in self-service for the client, so there's some things that they can do, there's more things they can do if they want to, or they can still come into the payroll specialist or other teams. And, so I think IT is at a pretty good spend rate, and they'll continue to go up, but not as much as they have in the past, because we got to a pretty good place with the level of investment.","Danyal Hussain","Perfect, thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Togut","Thanks. Good morning. Given your commentary about the mid-market sales force, can you quantify your anticipated growth in the sales force for fiscal 2017 as a whole? And if you could call out any variations versus overall growth by segment, that would be helpful.","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so I'll talk to that and then let Marty give some more comment on it. So David, this year, we had pretty strong growth, actually even a little bit higher than we had planned on the payroll services side, which would include mid-market. And as I mentioned, we had pretty healthy growth in mid-market sales adds. So overall, we're still going to be in the 2% to 3% growth range this year, but that's because in payroll services last year, we were between 5% and 6%. So some of those adds were done in anticipation of this year.","And we add selectively to certain sales forces. You've heard in previous calls, for example, that when a year or so ago, a year-and-a-half, we added mid-year to PEO and that paid some dividends. So each year, we're taking a look at where we think there's opportunities and adding selectively to the sales force.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think it's consistent growth, as Efrain said. And because we added \u2013 and we were very happy with the fact that we added kind of mid-year particularly in that mid-market area earlier than normal. So instead of making sure we were staffed up to begin this fiscal year, we actually added probably three months earlier than normal into the mid-market because of the demand, which was a really good thing. But you'll see overall I think the growth will be in that normal kind of 3% range. And we add a little bit to all of them, but mostly, as Efrain said, it's in the payroll space, and particularly in the mid-market.","David Togut","Thank you. And then for 2017, what's your anticipated client portfolio growth, total balances?","Efrain Rivera","Okay. So that could mean two things, David. Do you mean client count, or client balance growth?","David Togut","About client balance growth.","Efrain Rivera","I would say it's probably in the 2% to 3% range. Unless \u2013 so assuming rates were lower this year, and it's a little bit tough to anticipate, but I'm just assuming it will be wage growth and not \u2013 there won't be a change in any of the other balance figures.","David Togut","Got it. And then in the fourth quarter, total client count growth was 2.5%. If we strip out Advance Partners, is 1.3% a fair assessment of organic client count growth?","Efrain Rivera","All right \u2013 Advance had no impact on the client count growth.","David Togut","Got it. And then...","Martin Mucci","Yeah, the payroll client. That's the payroll client base, and for the year, what we were saying was it was over 2%.","Efrain Rivera","Yeah.","Martin Mucci","2% for the year.","David Togut","Got it. Just a quick final question. What dividend growth rate would you anticipate in July when the board announces a new rate for the year ahead?","Efrain Rivera","That's a good question. So we'll let them talk about that, but I'd just give two pieces of guidance. We've said we like to keep it in that low-80%s range as a percentage of net income, and we'd like it to track income, yeah. So it will be somewhere in that range.","David Togut","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Martin Mucci","All right, David.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Gary Bisbee. Your line is now open from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Gary.","Martin Mucci","Hi, good morning.","Gary Bisbee","So help me understand one thing. As I look at the guidance and then I think about how you've talked about the business in the last year, so you've got the best client growth since 2007, you're at record retention again this year, you've had a real ramp in bookings the last two years, float's no longer a big drag, you've got seven months of the acquisition in the upcoming year versus five months in the year you just finished. I really struggle to understand why revenue wouldn't accelerate at least modestly, and the guidance implies none. So is there something else going on like less pricing? It just feels like something doesn't add up here with the simple math. And I did hear you clearly that the checks per client is not as big a driver as it's been in the past, but it just feels like there should be some acceleration, given how strong you've been performing.","Efrain Rivera","Well I'd say the first thing I'd mentioned is part of the answer to that, Gary. So checks per client, when they go flat to modestly negative because the client mix, you end up having an impact on payroll service growth, number one. Number two, it is, it's not seven months, it's actually about six months\u2019 worth of revenue that we'll get from Advance. So although that's a pretty minor number, it's not quite as much as you're suggesting. And I think there's more, I think what we'd recognize as we've gone through the year is that the higher the client growth, and we've set pretty ambitious goals again next year, it'll be between 2% and 3%, initially that comes at some impact in terms of what you're expecting on overall pricing.","So we recoup that over time, but as you grow, and this has been the history of the company prior to the recession, you pay a little bit of a price on checks and also on overall rate based on what's happening with client growth. So it's all of that. And then the third thing that I would say, which you're not factoring in, is we had a nice bump, uplift from the ACA compliance product. And while I had mentioned I think earlier in response to Jason's question that we absorbed it in the guidance, of course, we're not having that uplift in growth this year that we had last year. So if you stripped all of that out, you'd see underlying acceleration. We're obviously not going to detail all of that out to get to the guidance. So those are the factors that affect the overall rate.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","I'm sorry, one other thing by the way. Sorry about that, Gary. We have one less day in the year. So that's the other part of payroll service growth. So all of those things imply if you made [indiscernible] I won't put you through the pain of doing, you'd see that we're actually accelerating a bit.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. That's helpful. And then a question on Flex. Just how does the product roadmap look from here? You've talked in prior quarters about some of the major components that were added this last fiscal year. Are there more big pieces to the puzzle that need to be integrated or added? And then also, as part of that, where are you now in terms of migration of customers?","Martin Mucci","Yes. On the Flex product, I think, Gary, we've got most of everything, the main pieces in there, particularly the paperless on-boarding and recruiting and the benefits administration now that came in from BeneTrac that we integrated in. So we feel pretty good. I think there's always other components that we're looking at competitively to see if we need to add, but for the most part, kind of the vast majority of everything is in now, and integrated on a kind of single employee record, which is working well for the sales and so forth. The vast majority of our clients have, are on the Flex platform. And so while we continue to work on some of the mid-market, the vast majority of the clients are already on Flex and there isn't a migration that's needed from that standpoint.","So I think we're in good shape with people on Flex. And they are gaining, anyone on Flex is gaining all the mobility additions. So a lot of work now is going to making mobility and the online visibility into a simpler, easier to use, more HTML5 kind of language. Also the options for, we haven't talked about it, but the options for Spanish, we've really put most everything in Spanish now and we're seeing a nice uptick in sales to Hispanic businesses, which has been a focus for us the last few years from both the sales and service perspective. So I think what you'll see now is not as much product functionality that's missing as it is the look, the feel, and the mobility piece of it. And by the way, everything's being developed now here mobile-first. So basically you make it simple so that almost everything can be done on the phone, and then it grows more complex online.","Gary Bisbee","Great. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Sara Gubins","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Efrain Rivera","Good morning, Sara.","Sara Gubins","Within payroll service for the client count growth, I'm wondering if you're able to assess how much of the growth is coming from new business formation in the last year versus taking share of existing businesses.","Efrain Rivera","Yeah. I don't have a precise number on that Sara, but I can say that in the fourth quarter, sales to newly-formed businesses were up about 10% from the quarter before. We had a pretty nice bump. So I think we're getting some uplift from being, I think one, probably more competitive there and second from a little bit better business environment.","Sara Gubins","Okay. And then in terms of the client mix shift, given the fast growth in PEO, the ACA tailwind, and Paychex Flex. Are you seeing the client mix shifting more towards companies with over 50 employees?","Efrain Rivera","No, no. Actually, I think I mentioned in a previous call, and we'll put out the exact number to the right decimal in the 10-K, but our average client size is \u2013 was 17. We may have ended the year at 16.92 or 16.95. No significant change. I think we continue to have strong mid-market sales. I would expect that number may go up. But this year was a little bit anomalous in that it skewed a little bit lower. But tiny, but it moves the needle.","Sara Gubins","Okay. And then just last question on M&A. You've talked in the past about being interested in doing some larger M&A. What does the landscape look like? Is that something that's on the horizon in fiscal 2017?","Martin Mucci","Yes, we're still pretty active and we've got probably one of the better pipelines we've had. Still looking, the decision is the value and the fit, and we're very selective about what we've acquired. We've done more acquisitions in the last five years than I think probably any time in history, and we felt very good about each one of those, whether from SurePayroll to now Advance Partners. So I think we're still very active in it. It's hard to say whether things will come to fruition or not, but we feel good about the pipeline that's out there and the activity that we're involved in right now.","Sara Gubins","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Rick Eskelsen","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess just following up earlier on the Flex question. Can you talk a little bit about how the client uptake has been on the newer modules that you've rolled out?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it's \u2013 I think it's been good. Particularly the time and attendance piece of it as we've integrated it in, and the mobility functionality that's with it where you can punch in, punch out and so forth, I think, has been probably the most popular, and I think that's because you see the overtime rules that have been approved now, and that will be enacted soon. I think a lot of a number of clients are now looking at time and attendance as something they really have to have and they're looking at great options like ours.","I think the electronic basically paperless on-boarding and recruiting of new employees has been good. It's relatively new, and getting the sales teams to make sure it's in that first proposal has probably been more of a challenge, so we'll get it all in there. But I think that one has got a tremendous opportunity in front of it, I think we're starting to really capture that now, a few months into \u2013 after the release of it.","Rick Eskelsen","Thanks. And then just with your success in the mid-market and the team selling that you've talked about a lot recently. Is there like an average number of modules that clients are taking currently, and how might that compare to the last couple of years? Are you seeing that number going up?","Martin Mucci","It definitely is going up because we can see it from a revenue per unit standpoint. We've seen a nice uptick over the years of revenue per unit. So more clients are taking the products upfront, particularly with the integrated selling approach, and that's kind of in all sizes of clients. Mid-market right down to I'd say, 10 to 15 employees even. There's much more of an acceptance of taking more modules, and there's much more of a need for it, and so the value has been much greater.","I don't know if I'd really, if there's really an average number, but it definitely has increased the revenue per unit, and we're good at both, I think we're much better now at the integrated selling of selling net value upfront that we've talked about. And then as we go on, if the clients don't have it, we have a great team that comes kind of \u2013 back around to the clients and said, hey, now that you have, let's say payroll and time and attendance, let's talk about benefit administration and, so that can help you in Affordable Care Act and everything else that we offer. So definitely the attachment has been a big part of our \u2013 a big assistance to our growth rate.","Rick Eskelsen","Last question, just following up on Sara's question on M&A. What areas are you looking at most? Is it things to add in payroll and HRS? Are you looking at some of the adjacent and other business areas you've talked about in the past? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I'd say we're always looking at payroll. There's opportunities out there for that, and we're looking also at product additions, tuck-in for product, but we've got most of that now, but we're always looking for that. And then of course all the areas that we're in, whether it be 401(k), PEO business, we're always looking at those opportunities as well. And then always looking at outside the country as well, what other opportunities are there for us. It's just a matter of, as I said, we've never been probably more active or a longer pipeline, but the valuations are still relatively high, and we're very selective as to what we go forward with. But I would say all of the above we're interested in. As long as they're a good fit and are good for both obviously for the company and for our shareholders, we look to go forward with it.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you. Hey. Good morning, Marty and Efrain.","Efrain Rivera","Good morning, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta","Efrain, any thoughts on how you might manage the flowed portfolio considering we're in a little bit of a different environment than we were a few months ago? Have you changed your thoughts on that at all?","Efrain Rivera","It's interesting you say that, Kartik. So as I was driving in this morning, I was trying to figure out what happens if we're in an environment where the Fed doesn't raise during the year and at this stage haven't decided to make any changes, but it's certainly is something that we'd have to look at the duration of the portfolio if the yield curve looks the way it is now over time. And no decisions on that, but that's something we'll have some discussions on as we go through the quarter.","It's just, as you can imagine, it's pretty dizzying trying to figure out what the right scenario is when I would say three months ago, we were thinking there might be as many as three raises in the next \u2013 in the fiscal year, and now it looks increasingly like if you get one, that will be a lot. Maybe zero. So, yeah, we're thinking about how to create the right portfolio structure without increasing risk.","Kartik Mehta","And, Marty, you talked a little bit about Flex, and obviously Flex is a much better product for your clients and you talked a little bit about maybe trying to sell more value-added services. It seems like that's just starting. Could you see Flex because of your ability to sell other value-added products or what you've at least seen so far, help kind of accelerate the revenue growth rate for the payroll business?","Martin Mucci","Well, we certainly hope so. I mean, what we've seen is more revenue per client and we've seen that consistently, and that's because the Flex platform allows that integration of various product bundles of different functionality within a single employee record and that it also allows you to have access to the mobile app, which has been very popular. So I think the opportunity is there. I mean, when we look out, obviously, as far as we can go as the guidance that we look at pretty closely that Efrain has detailed, and so we certainly hope the opportunity is there. We're keeping it and we're, I think, very, very competitive with it, and that certainly is our hope.","Efrain Rivera","I mean, the other thing, Kartik, I'd like to add that is important and I think I've mentioned this after the third quarter doing a number \u2013 in a number of comments, it's important to remember that when we sell Flex, a portion of that revenue is payroll, and a lot of it's reported in HRS. So I cautioned that while we're not walking away from looking at payroll revenue as an important part of the revenue growth of the company, increasingly, when we sell Flex, a portion of that is reported in HRS. So all of the discussions we've talked about, modules like time and attendance, HR administration, expense management, applicant tracking and recruiting, employee shared responsibility or ACA, those are all recorded in HRS. So you need to look at both pieces to really kind of get a complete assessment of how we're doing.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, we think of it more kind of in total service revenue because it does, obviously, it bleeds over into both of them.","Kartik Mehta","That's fair. And just for a last question, now that you've owned Advance Partners for a few months, and that was a business that you were excited about in the beginning, I'm just wondering, is that something that still is what you expected? And is that a business that you could potentially acquire other businesses to get additional scale?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think so. In fact, we feel they've been performing extremely well and the whole leadership team has come with the company, so we're excited about that. And so they performed well. We have already been looking for opportunities to increase the scale there and have a few kind of in the pipeline that we're looking at. And, yeah, we think, we're very pleased with the first six months of how that's been going and the results that they have, and, of course, the tie-in into our clients that have a number of opportunities for them and some opportunities from their clients for us. So we're very pleased with the acquisition and the team there and how we're off to a good start.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Martin Mucci","All right, Kartik.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Silber","Thanks so much. I know you're mostly a U.S.-centric focused company, but I'm just curious in terms of the impact of Brexit, if at all. Would this maybe preclude you from potentially expanding in that region, if you think it will have any impact on your U.S. business at all? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, this is Marty. I don't think so. We don't see much there. We're mostly, outside the US we're mostly in Germany, and then we have the Brazil startup there. So we don't see it. Obviously, from an acquisitions standpoint, there are opportunities there that we would be probably a little more cautious about given kind of the uncertainty over a longer period of time. But right in the short term, certainly, it has very little, if any, impact on us, at least from the UK perspective.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay. And then just a couple of numbers-related questions. You mentioned the investments in growth this year. On the expense side, would that be on an operating expense line item, SG&A or a combination?","Efrain Rivera","It's mostly operating expenses, Jeff.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay. And then, sorry, just one more.","Efrain Rivera","That's okay.","Jeffrey Silber","I'm sorry, on the fourth quarter, you had negative investment income. Can you just walk us through what happened?","Efrain Rivera","I was waiting for that. You get the gold star for that question, Jeff. So the answer is we had some small investments that we wrote down the value, didn't write them off, but wrote down the value when we looked at it in the portfolio. Very small things. But the way we record that is in that line, so that's why it went negative a little bit.","Jeffrey Silber","Do you know what the EPS impact of that was or...","Efrain Rivera","Very modest. Maybe half a cent, if that much.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay. Great. All right. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much.","Efrain Rivera","Okay. Yes.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Grossman, Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.","David Grossman","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","Martin Mucci","Hi, David.","David Grossman","I was hoping, maybe, Marty, if you can stretch your comments about the middle market. It seems you're doing well. And as you probably know, there are several others claiming prosperity in that segment as well. How much of that may be ACA-driven or other fundamental factors in the marketplace? And obviously you've done a lot to invest in that segment over the last several years, and just curious if there are other factors at work there that may be driving the market clients to go to an outsourced solution?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think definitely a number of them. One, I think the need, the complications of compliance with all of the regulations have increased. So you have ACA, but you have the recently done overtime regulations. You have paid leave now for families you have got to keep track of. You have a lot more immigration and keeping track of who your employees are and all of that that you have to be backed up with. And the enforcement of the rules we see are stronger. So more businesses are being impacted by audits, by investigations, by are you following the rules correctly. And because states and the Feds are also looking for more revenue sources, so states can go after things.","So I think that whole regulation side has become increasingly more complex at a lower level. So we're seeing people, we're seeing clients buy time and attendance that normally were probably 40 employees and higher 30, PEO tended to be higher, now it's coming down lower, they're looking for help with insurance and benefit plans because they have to be more competitive. The other second thing would be the market is more competitive now for employees as you get closer to lower unemployment and full employment. And so people need more help with having more competitive benefits, more competitive recruiting tools, being able to recruit online, paperless, attract new employees. And I think, there was another one there I was thinking about.","And I think, the acceptance of cloud-based technology and having and getting away from desktop and on-premise solutions has rapidly increased the last three years to four years, but we're still seeing that increase where years ago, people wanted to do more things themselves, worry about the security. Now, they want to trust their security of information with a third-party outsourcer, kind of totally reversed from five years or six years ago.","Now they trust that Paychex is large enough and a big enough IT security team that they're going to do their best to protect their information where I used to have to do it inside. So I think there's just a big push of regulations, compliance, and the need, therefore, pushing down to a lower level. And so we're seeing that that mid-market that I would say used to be 50 to 500 or 1000 has really pushed down to maybe 15 or 20. To 500 is a real sweet spot right now that has a lot of focus.","David Grossman","So, with the product set that you have now, obviously they're at one point historically, that was a limiting factor for you and the mid-market itself. Any appetite to go after a bigger client or a bigger client service segment of the market? Or do you feel you'd rather just sit below the radar screen where others may define the mid-market?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, it never feels like we're below radar, but I think there's \u2013 that the real sweet spot of what has taken off and made many companies at least appear to do well, and I know how we're doing well, is really even that 15 or 20 to 500. I mean, we were still selling anywhere from one employee to 1000, but I would say the hottest area right now is 20 to 250 or 20 to 500. Those are the clients that really have been pushed with much more regulation and need for the products, and are now much more open to outsourcing.","So I think we feel good about the opportunity that's ahead of us, that that's going to drive our growth, and it also allows us to really focus on those markets. That's a pretty huge market, 1 to 1000. And we feel pretty good that, hey, we're very focused on that, and that's who we provide the best service and the best products to.","David Grossman","Got it. And then maybe just one quick numbers question, and Efrain, I'm sorry if I missed this, but when you take both the Advance piece and the loss of the processing day, what is the net impact on next year's revenue?","Efrain Rivera","So, the loss of the processing day, didn't call that out specifically, David, but it's, I'd say, probably about 25 basis points. Advance is about probably another 25 basis points.","David Grossman","So, it nets to zero?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah.","David Grossman","All right, guys. Thanks very much.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from James Schneider, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Jim.","James Schneider","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the \u2013 on the HR Services growth forecast, whether \u2013 anything specific in terms of product-specific drivers you can call out contributing to the growth? And you've talked about time maintenance and HR administration as being drivers in the past. Anything notable to call out, as far as the FY 2017 guidance is concerned?","Martin Mucci","I think, PEO, we haven't talked as much about that, but I think, PEO is still very strong. And that \u2013 part of that is supported by \u2013 or helped by the need for insurance support and benefit plans and so forth. So, we still see that growing very well. Worksite employees are double-digit growth again. And so, I think, the PEO and ASO, both models are continuing to grow well.","401(k) has been very steady. And we've \u2013 I think, we've talked about the fact that we went after larger \u2013 what we call large-market or higher-asset clients. And we feel that, that's got a great opportunity as well. A lot of things kick around about 401(k)s and so forth, but we're still doing very well, really introducing some more 401(k) record-keeping plans than anybody else. And we've got a solid sales and service team that really do very well there.","So, the sales have been consistent, the client growth very consistent in 401(k). And the retention this year, probably the best it's been in our history. So, I think, all those components, we don't talk to as much, but they've been steady and real good components of the growth.","James Schneider","Thanks. And maybe \u2013 could you just maybe comment at a broad level about the level of discounting you're seeing in the market right now, and maybe whether there's more pressure or less pressure than there was, say, a year ago, and if so, in what segment?","Martin Mucci","Yeah. I think, it's a little bit more pressure, probably. I think with more competitors and so forth, it's not a big change in the competitive environment, believe it or not. For the number that are out there, we all seem to be doing well. But, I think, there's a little more pressure on price. And on the low end, there's a little more pressure, because, I think, as new businesses \u2013 as Efrain said, the new businesses have kind of come back, and so when you have new businesses that start up, there's always a little pressure to \u2013 for them to first kind of outsource and go to someone to do their payroll, and maybe their payroll and time and attendance. There's a little more price pressure to get them in started, but remember, that we then roll-off a lot of times the discount for a period of time. So, I think, a little bit more pressure there, but nothing that would be major at this point.","James Schneider","Got it. Thanks. And then maybe quick clarification. The 8% net income guidance for fiscal 2017, does that include or exclude the tax benefit you saw in fiscal 2016?","Efrain Rivera","That's excluding that benefit break. So, yeah, I called that out, so it's important to remember.","James Schneider","Got it. Thank you very much.","Efrain Rivera","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Marcon, R.W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Mark Marcon","Hi. Good morning, Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Hi, Mark.","Mark Marcon","Hey, Marty. First of all, nobody else said it, but great job over the last five years for you and the team.","Martin Mucci","Oh, thank you, Mark. Appreciate that. Efrain went off script there, so, I appreciate it. It's a great team, very proud of the team.","Mark Marcon","So, a few questions. First of all, with regards to the mid-market, has there been any discernible change in the pace in terms of bookings growth, the pipeline, post this kind of \u2013 on the mid-market, a little bit of the ACA surge in that over-50 employee segment?","Martin Mucci","I \u2013 there certainly has been sales growth. That's, as Efrain and I said, that's where we added nice percent of the sales force mid-year, which is rare for us. We felt the opportunity was so good with the Flex product and all the additional modules that we added. So, sales, for me have been definitely stronger. I think, the other thing you may have mentioned...","Mark Marcon","I'm just saying like post the calendar year transition and that surge of activity, the clients that may have come on just because it's like, okay, we're scrambling to get ready for this. Now that, that scramble is over, are you seeing any sort of change in the pace?","Martin Mucci","No, not really. No. Okay, no, not \u2013 we really haven't. I mean, those \u2013 and that's why we felt good about having those additional sales reps in place there, because we're still seeing a strong demand. And I think it's all the things that I mentioned earlier that \u2013 why we're seeing that. So, no, we feel very good. And the other thing is mid-market, as I might \u2013 I think, I mentioned earlier. It's funny, it used to be that kind of 50-line for us, but I think you're seeing a lot of what you could call mid-market demand anyway is kind of gotten down to an even lower size. And so \u2013 and that momentum has picked up, and that gives you a lot of opportunity to sell more products if they need more.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then can you talk a little bit about the \u2013 what the right level of leverage expectations beyond this year would likely be, like how do we think about that relative to the normal historical pattern?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so, Mark, I...","Mark Marcon","And ex float.","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, ex float. So, we, this year, ex float, we were at about 50 basis points of leverage, which is what we typically do in a given year. We'll be less than that next year for the reasons that I called out.","Mark Marcon","Yeah.","Efrain Rivera","But I still think that going forward, we're going to try to be in that 50-plus basis point leverage range. And if we can't hit that in a given year, then we're going to have a specific reason why we can't. In this case, we had a lot of discussions internally about do we add the resources that \u2013 both in compliance services, as I mentioned earlier, and in mid-market. And it was pretty clear that given the amount of growth we had to do that. But I don't think that's going to happen every single year, but it was important this year. But I don't think it changes long term, the trajectory of building plans that include 50 basis point plus, because that's the way we go into our planning cycles. And we think it's doable. It's hard, it takes a lot of work, but we think it's doable.","Mark Marcon","Great. Can you talk about the opportunity to go in and sell some of the newer modules, the newer solutions to some of the older, existing clients in the mid-market? What's \u2013 how much runway do you have there in terms of upselling some of those existing clients?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think, still quite a bit of room. When you think about the penetration, these products really haven't been \u2013 many of our products, even HR administration online, and time and attendance online are older. Time and attendance product really haven't been around that long. It's been more of the last three years to four years, maybe five years tops, then we track a little bit longer in benefits admin. So, there's room there. And I think, as they see the benefit of Flex and the mobility that comes with it, the mobile options, and the whole different look and feel to it, I think, that helps sell them, along with if there's many more product modules available to you, and the fact that it's really with one single employee record.","I think that is pulling a lot of clients in, where five years ago, we would've said, a, you have Payroll, and you have other modules, but they're not fully integrated. Now, there's much more of a pull from the clients [indiscernible]. So, I think, we've got some nice opportunity still in the mid-market.","Selling new, we're selling much more integrated upfront and better attachment rates, but there's still a lot of room, which we \u2013 and we do that. We attack, we go back into the base to sell them the value-added features that they need.","Mark Marcon","Are you doing that with the regular sales force, or is there a kind of a gatherer group that kind of goes into existing clients?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, it's a mix. We have both kind of a virtual sales that go back into the base as well. But those existing reps who have the relationships and so forth will also \u2013 and with the clients, will go back and sell it. So, both can sell.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then just one numbers question. What's the net income base \u2013 the precise net income base that we should be using for the fiscal year that this was completed as a basis of comparison for the 8% net income growth for this coming year?","Efrain Rivera","Good question, Mark. Let me post it, so I don't get the wrong number. I'll post it shortly. Okay?","Mark Marcon","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","In other words, just so everyone knows, look for it in the \u2013 either in the slides we'd put up, or if we've already posted them, which the team probably did, we'll just amend it to include that number. Okay?","Mark Marcon","Excellent. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","And something off here, and that will be wrong, so...","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you. Hi, Martin. Hi, Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Hi, Ashwin.","Efrain Rivera","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","So, I think, Mark just asked a question and you just answered this, the 8% net income guide. Then you said it excludes the $0.05 tax benefit.","Efrain Rivera","That's correct, yup.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","You're basically saying go off the adjusted lower EPS base, correct?","Efrain Rivera","That's correct, yup.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. And is there a specific factor that takes the tax rate down modestly this year?","Efrain Rivera","This year?","Ashwin Shirvaikar","It seems like your guidance was maybe 50 basis points lower.","Efrain Rivera","Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, it's a combination of two things. One is some work on state taxes that we have done; and also, the software tax credit change has a continuing impact going forward. So, it's the combination of both of those. And superior work for our tax group. But beyond that \u2013 but that's it.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. I have a sort of a broader GDP sensitivity question.","Efrain Rivera","Yeah.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","So, when you look at the mix of business that you have now, which has a higher contribution \u2013 higher percent contribution from HRS, which to me, it basically says, a bigger share of wallet, and anytime you have a bigger share of wallet, it probably means a more stable client. You've got the bigger mid-market business, again, similar conclusion. You've got investment contribution that's almost a third of what it was going to the last downturn. So, how do you think of the potential impact of the downturn in economic expectations, should it happen?","Martin Mucci","So if it should happen \u2013 I mean, I think, obviously, the biggest impact \u2013 if I get your question right, Ashwin, I think the biggest impact there would be new client growth. Because last \u2013 anytime a recessionary-type thing happens, it has impact on the payroll service revenue growth, because the clients either more go lost, because they can't sustain the business, and fewer start up. So, the client growth puts obviously a damper on that. I don't think we've definitely laid it out what exactly that would be.","It doesn't always have an impact on the number of products they buy, because they typically buy those that bundle, let's say, because they need it for those that are staying in business. The biggest impact will be losses, client retention. And new business start-ups would be the biggest impact, I would say.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. Got it. And we get a lot of questions on operating leverage. So, Efrain, you tried to clarify in your prepared remarks, but I still have a question. And that's it basically...","Efrain Rivera","I expect no less, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Specific to technology spend, last year, I think, was the first time in many years that you've said basically that it's \u2013 the rate of growth is settling down, similar comment this year. Is this just the kind of market and client expectation that you have to keep that tech spend up, where you don't really get leverage from it, but it's clearly not hurting on operating margins, so you kind of \u2013 when you say steady the percent of revenue? Is it...","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think, that's basically what I was trying to say earlier on that piece of it was it's not \u2013 for a while, that was \u2013 well, it was hurting margins a bit, but we were offsetting a lot of it with operational efficiencies. In driving those efficiency, those dollars kind of backed to IT for technology investment, and kind of resetting the level of technology spend versus the operational spend. And so now, we kind of feel like the technology spend got to a point where it's pretty normalized, it's in a good place, we don't see that going up dramatically.","I don't necessarily see it going down, because there's always technology in our \u2013 and we want to stay on the leading edge, from a competitive standpoint. But \u2013 and then, there's not as much operational leverage, but we continue to, as Efrain said, we're going \u2013 we continue to try to look. It's kind of in our DNA here that we always are looking here. Revenue growth is x. We're always trying to look for 50 basis points or so to see if we can continue to leverage the business. And obviously, the better that growth rate is, the better opportunity we have to leverage, and that's a constant focus. Anything you want to add?","Efrain Rivera","No. That makes sense.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Understood. That makes sense. So, that answers all my questions. Happy Fourth of July coming up here.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, thanks. Hey, Ashwin. Before you go, so \u2013 and then to Mark's question, apologize, I didn't have the schedule right in front of me. So, net income excluding the tax event this year, the correct base is $738,600,000, in case I wasn't clear. Then we'll just post it to the website, too, and the schedules that we release shortly, if we haven't done it already.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. Great. Thank you for that. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Lisa Ellis, Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, guys. Just one quick one for me. Can you just talk about \u2013 with Advance, now that you're five months or six months into the acquisition, the role they're going to be playing in your portfolio, like are they a customer acquisition engine for you, where you'll be able to sell in your existing payroll and other services? Or how should we be thinking about that, both for Advance and then, I guess, future acquisitions like that?","Martin Mucci","Yes, for them, as Efrain mentioned, they're really not in our client count, so \u2013 in our payroll client count that we always give for the over 600,000 clients. And \u2013 so, it's not so much about client acquisition, other than for themselves. So, we're looking for them to grow their revenue base through new clients, obviously, and selling more product to them.","To us, it was broadening, really, the markets that we serve. So, here's a company that is profitable, is \u2013 had nice revenue growth, good leadership team, saw a lot of potential, and the staffing business that they support, those staffing companies, we saw is a growing market, and because there's continued more temporary help and staffing help that's going to be needed, I think particularly with overtime rules and so forth. So, we saw them as a component of the portfolio to grow revenue.","There'll be some overlap between us, and the fact that we have a number of staffing companies that are payroll clients or other products, and so we'll look to refer. We're already doing that, looking to see if those staffing companies who were clients of us for payroll could be helped by payroll funding and other support from Advance. But I think, that's how we look at it, it's another opportunity to broaden our revenue growth, because we see staffing companies as a real growth opportunity.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thank you. Thanks a lot.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. Is that it, Tessa?","Operator","Yes. We show no further questions at this time.","Martin Mucci","All right. At this point, we will close the meeting. If you're interested in replaying the webcast for the conference call, this will be archived until August 1. Thank you for your interest in Paychex, and thank you for your participation in our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 earnings release call and webcast.","We're very proud of our Paychex employees and the great fiscal year 2016 we had.

If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Go ahead sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's third quarter fiscal 2014 results. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday afternoon, after the market closed we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2014. We also filed our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter. These documents are available also by accessing our Investor Relations page at paychex.com and this teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.","On today's call I will share my thoughts on our results and update you on how we are doing in operations, sales and product development areas and Efrain will review our third quarter financial highlights and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for your questions.","We are pleased with our results in the third quarter. We continue to make progress driving new business revenue and selling more value added services and increasing revenue from our client base. We released additional enhancements to our online and mid-market products and in fact we\u2019ll be releasing the next version of our mobile app user interface this week. Along with these technology enhancements we remain focused on providing industry leading service to our clients and their employees.","Efrain will go into more detail on the financial results and comparisons. However I would like to provide you with some highlights of the quarter. Total service revenue showed good growth of 7% for the quarter. Payroll service revenue growth of 5% was supported by solid results in the core payroll product. HRS revenue increased 12% in the third quarter as we continued to benefit from demand -- support from demand for human resource outsourcing solutions and strong execution highlighted particularly in the PEO business. Checks per payroll have improved for 16 consecutive quarters now, third quarter growth was 1% moderating a bit from the first half of the fiscal year.","From a sales perspective we continue to experience good new business revenue growth particularly in core payroll and Paychex HR outsourcing solutions. Our execution in service operation s also continued to be excellent. The team did a great job for our clients with year-end processing including the distribution of our W2s and year-end reporting ahead of schedule. I also want to note that our business continuity plans have performed extremely well through severe winter conditions that many of our clients experienced, ensuring that our client needs our service even in the worst condition. This is probably one of the toughest winters that we've gone through from a service perspective and we've just done an excellent job particularly on the East Coast as went through a number of storms.","I am proud of the partnership and the service commitment demonstrated by our employees that continued to result in client satisfaction and client retention results that remain at very high levels. This effort is really a testimony to the strength of our client service model, always putting our clients first.","From a technology perspective continued investment in our SaaS solutions and mobility offerings positioned us for long-term growth. We have market-leading SaaS solutions, levering the latest technologies, our online HR, administration and time and attendance products are integrated with our Paychex next generation offering. We are experiencing increased demand for our SaaS solutions across our client base.","We continue to invest significantly in our online capabilities as well as our mobile applications and whether you are a client or client employee our mobile app provides clean and efficient access to all of your own information with one to two clicks. We give clients the ability to start, edit and submit their payroll with the best mobility app in the marketplace. And as I mentioned we'll be introducing the latest version of the mobile offering this week.","During the third quarter we officially initiated our operations in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and enhanced our portfolio of value-added products and services with the official introduction of Paychex's payment processing services. This is a full suite of payment processing solutions, including credit and debit card processing, mobile and online payment services and point-of-sales solutions designed to meet the evolving needs of today's small businesses. This service is being offered in partnership with Elavon, a leading global payments provider.","In the past few quarters I've talked about our new products designed to help our clients manage compliance requirements of the Affordable Care Act or more commonly known as Healthcare Reform. We continue to execute on the rollout of those product offerings in this area including our Paychex employer, shared responsibility service of more robust monitoring service in our Paychex benefit account. These products while new to the market represent an opportunity for us as we are uniquely positioned as both the payroll provider and insurance agency to help small businesses with these regulations.","The frequent changes in ACA rules have caused some clients to delay decisions on purchasing products or making changes to their healthcare plans. However we continue to see healthcare reform as an opportunity for us as we are able to provide clients with the most up-to-date information on the latest requirements.","We also continue our shareholder friendly actions. We increased our dividend back in July 6% to $0.35 per share and we continue to repurchase Paychex stock opportunistically and we have repurchased approximately five million shares of common stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2014.","And finally last week we announced that on April 1, 2014 just next week in conjunction with IHS Inc. we will launch the Paychex IHS Small Business Jobs Index. This is a new monthly index that examines the state of small business employment in the U.S. by measuring aggregated small business payroll data from a subset of our small business client base. The index will identify and track small business employment trends and provide probably the most real timely accurate insight into national and regional employment activity as well as report on state and metro employment trends for many of the country's largest states and metropolitan markets. This index does not indicate Paychex financial results.","In summary I am pleased with our results for the third quarter and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team across all organizations from sales to service. And I will now turn over the call to Efrain Rivera to review the financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Martin. I would like to remind everyone that during today's conference call we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve risks. Refer to our press release for a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors.","As Marty indicated our third quarter financial results for fiscal 2014 represented good progress. There are a number of -- there are some of the key highlights for the quarter and nine months that I\u2019ll talk about now and I\u2019ll provide greater detail in several areas and wrap with a review of 2014 outlook.","Total service revenue grew 7% for the third quarter and the nine months to $626 million and $1.8 billion respectively. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 3% for the third quarter and 1% for the nine months to $11 million and $31 million respectively. This result was due to lower average interest rate partially offset by an increase in average investment balances.","Expenses increased 5% for both the third quarter and the nine months. The increase was mainly in compensation-related costs with higher wages and higher performance based comps. Wages were impacted by our investment in product development and supporting technology and new sales initiatives, implemented in fiscal 2013. For the nine months we also experienced higher sales-related costs attributable to new business revenue growth.","We maintained strong operating margin of 38.4% for the third quarter and 39.7% for the nine months. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 12% for the third quarter and 9% for the nine months. We expect operating margin for the full year to be approximately 38%. Net income increased 11% to $169 million for the third quarter and 8% to $482 million for the nine month period. Diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.44 per share for the third quarter and 7% to $1.31 per share for the nine months.","Turning to payroll service revenue, it increased 5% for the third quarter and 4% for the nine months. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll, revenue per client and client bases. As Marty already mentioned our checks per payroll growth metric continued to improve with the rate of growth moderating from earlier in the year. As we expected, checks per payroll increased 1% for the quarter and for the nine month period, 1.5%. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases, net of discount coupled with the impact of increased product penetration.","The third quarter payroll revenue growth was bolstered by one additional payroll processing day in the quarter compared with the same period last year. The estimated impact on payroll revenue growth is in the range of 0.5% to 1%. Note that payroll revenue growth is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter due to one less payroll processing day compared to the prior year and we anticipate that payroll service revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be at the low end of the full year range.","HRS, HRS revenue increased 12% for both third quarter and the nine months. We continued to experience rapid growth in both our ASO and PEO as well as in our online HR administration products. Interest revenue increase reflects client growth primarily in HR solutions, retirement services and online HR administration products. Our online HR administration products continued to grow due to success in sales of SaaS solutions.","Within HR solutions the PEO continued to show strong growth in the number of clients we served. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in average asset value of participant funds. Insurance services revenue growth reflected higher premiums in workers' comp insurance services and an increase in the number of health and benefits applicants. HRS revenue growth was tempered modestly in the nine month period by higher direct cost in our PEO.","Note that HRS revenue quarterly growth can vary due to the volume of client, PEO worker\u2019s compensation and basis points earned on retirement services client employee funds, basis points change in the fluctuations in the financial markets in the asset value fund invested. PEO net service revenue also exhibits greater variability between quarters due to a number of factors, including change in the worker\u2019s comp claims experienced.","Turning to our investment portfolio, in the short term portfolio primary investment vehicles remain high quality variable rate demand note and bank demand deposit accounts. In the longer term portfolio we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.1 years.","Our combined portfolio earned an average rate of return of 0.9% for the third quarter compared to 1% for the same period last year. For the nine months we earned 1% compared to 1.1% for the same period last year.","Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during both the third quarter and the nine months due to growth in checks per payroll and the client base. For the nine months average balance benefited from the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on December 31, 2012 which resulted in higher social security withholdings.","Let\u2019s turn to the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong, cash and total corporate investments totaled $964 million as of February 28, 2014 and we had no debt. Funds held for clients as of February 28, 2014 were $4.9 billion compared to $4.1 billion as of May 31, 2013. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day to day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the nine months, a year-over-year increase of 5%.","Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $39 million as of February 28, 2014 compared with net unrealized gains of $35 million as of May 31, 2013. Total shareholders\u2019 equity was $1.8 billion as of February 28, reflecting $383 million in dividends paid during the first nine months. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 34%.","Cash flows from operations were $706 million for the first nine months, a 16% increase compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by higher net income, higher non-cash adjustments to net income, monthly higher amortization of premiums of available for sale securities along with higher depreciation and stock-based comp cost and changes in our operating assets and liabilities, related primarily to [time].","I would like to remind you that our outlook, turning to fiscal 2014 guidance for the remainder of the year is based on our current view of economic and interest conditions continuing with no significant changes. As I have mentioned the growth rate for payroll services revenue is expected to be at the low end of the full year range in the fourth quarter as a result of one less processing day compared to the same period last year.","Our payroll service revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 4% for the full year and at the high end of that range. HRS revenue growth is also expected to be at the low end of the full year range for the fourth quarter for similar reasons and because we believe there will be a moderation in HR solutions performance. Overall HRS growth is expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% for the full year.","Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of previous guidance although at the high end of that range. Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 9% to 10%, adjusted up slightly from previous guidance. I remind you that in the fourth quarter of last year we recognized an additional tax provision for the settlement of the state tax issue which impacted diluted earnings per share.","Our operating margin for the year is anticipated to be approximately 38% and as I mentioned to many of you 38% can be anything up to 38.5% and we don't call it to the nearest half percent. This is slightly lower than the margin experienced in the first nine months of fiscal 2014 as our margins are historically lower in the second half of the fiscal year.","Finally thanks to those of you who participated in our Investor Day survey. Based on survey\u2019s feedback we decided to move it later in fiscal year \u201915 and we\u2019ll provide further information as we finalize the detail. Thank you very much and let me turn it back over to Marty.","Martin Mucci","","Thanks, Efrain. Operator we\u2019ll now open the meeting to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","","Hey, thank you, guys. I appreciate you taking the question. Can you just give us a sense, now that the key selling season is over how your sales force did relative to the quota that they had during the key selling season and are you still expecting to be -- or I should say where are you expecting to be in kind of your 1% to 3% target range for organic client growth this year, now that you did get through the key selling season I am guessing you got some better visibility on where you might land in that range?","Martin Mucci","","Jason, it's Marty. We don't necessarily we don't give the client growth number for the end of the year as you know because we want to get through the whole year. But I would say on the sales execution and selling season, continued solid performance there, so particularly in the HRS side in core payroll and HR small business and in the HRS particularly in the PEO, as we have said in some comments, feel really strong and the PEO came in really strong in the year and I think that's healthcare reform. I think that's just real resurgence there and that's been good. But really overall very continued solid execution from a sales perspective.","Efrain Rivera","","And Jason just to add to what Marty said we don't give the specifics but we feel very comfortable that we are within that range.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. And I think in the past, over the last several quarters or so when you guys have asked -- have been asked where pricing is running in core payroll, and seems like you've indicated it's been closer to the lower end of that longer term 2% to 4% range that you have made at the Analyst Meeting, a couple of years ago. Was that the case again during this quarter?","Efrain Rivera","","Yeah, we are still feeling good retention from a client base and from a revenue, I guess I would say capture perspective, feel good about holding the price increase that we did last year. And I would think we never really changed that range going forward and we wouldn't want to get any more specific than that coming up.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Okay, and then just last question I think you mentioned seeing good traction on the SaaS side of the business. Can you give us any sense just in terms of mix of new sales how you've seen that shift, presumably the SaaS mix there has been increasing but any numbers you could give us just to help convey how much demand you've seen for SaaS, perhaps relative to the classic full service outsourced model?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, it's an interesting mix. I will give you a comment then let Efrain pick up as well. But it's our model is we're giving over the last few years with all the technology investment and what we rolled out, we see a much bigger impact of clients moving to the online apps, but it's with our service tied into it.","So what we like -- the way we positioned is was deliberately to say hey, you have a dedicated person there available to you but we have a much more robust online payroll time and attendance HR administration solutions for you as well. So if you want to do it online through the SaaS solution you can do that, if you want support and use your dedicated person you can do that.","And what we're really starting to see is very much what we hope which was a mix of both using the solution and so many more online clients signing up for online but then using other service person as well, when they need to. So this week I may put in my own online payroll, I may call for something I need but I am putting it in myself, the next week I may go to the payroll specialist.","What we're seeing, the biggest push online has continued to grow very much but the biggest push also had been in the time and attendance and HR solutions, the administration that our SaaS products online and we're seeing across both small and mid-market some growth in those products that's picking up in penetration and sales.","So I wouldn't give exact numbers but we are certainly seeing a better penetration rate on the new sales; our attachment rate and a better penetration overall into the customer base.","Efrain Rivera","Just to add to what Marty said when we say SaaS products we're talking about a suite of products that not only includes core payroll but includes things like timing, attendance, HR administration online, those are doing very, very well for us and they are both sold to our core base and also to -- in the mid-market space. With respect to the low end, the micro enterprise space, SaaS it's doing very well, it's continued to do well, that part of the market, the low end SaaS is very attractive to that portion of the market and so [payroll] translates very, very effectively there.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Okay, thank you guys for the color.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Go ahead sir your line is open.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Hey good morning, Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Good morning.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Efrain, you said client growth, you don't want to give the client growth numbers but you are comfortable within the range you've set, is there a difference you are witnessing between may be the short payroll type of clients versus what I would consider your traditional Paychex type of client in terms of net client growth?","Efrain Rivera","So we look at both and I think we are satisfied with the performance of both segments of the market. So I would say Kartik, the answer to your question is that we see growth on the low end and we've seen growth in our core client base also.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then Efrain, you had what I consider a very good margin quarter, seems like good growth year-over-year. Anything specific as why margins were really strong this quarter or is it that just one extra day and maybe just management of the expenses, was there anything else in terms of sales or sales execution or commission that might have impacted that?","Efrain Rivera","I think Kartik that really, our model is -- has a significant component of variable expenses associated with it. And when we deliver strong top line growth the marginal expenses associated with that, that top line are relatively small and I think what you see in the model is that when we had strong revenue quarters like we did this quarter a lot of it flows to the bottom line and that\u2019s the way the model is built. So the more top line growth we deliver the better leverage we see. So I guess I'd characterize it that way. In other words we did everything we were thinking of doing in the quarter from an expense standpoint. There was nothing unusual about our spending pattern.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question Marty, have you seen any change or difference in terms of what\u2019s happening with your healthcare insurance business? I know at the beginning of the year you thought there might be some impact because of the Affordable Healthcare Act. I'm wondering because of all the changes that are happening or the delays that have been announced if that's impacted the business any differently than what you had anticipated?","Martin Mucci","","Yeah, I think it certainly as moderated a bit. I think what we\u2019re finding, as I mentioned in the comments, Kartik was kind of a lack of decision making on some parts of the small business and really mid-size business because the rules keep changing and so I think the employers are not sure what to do exactly. So I think that it slowed a little bit from what we had expected or hoped for. The good news is the products are out there and the products that we rolled out giving the tools to the employer are really helpful. There is -- we\u2019re finding a lot of confusion from the small business and midsize business base and we\u2019re able to help them.","So the good news is it's continuing to get us -- our reps in front of them with different products. I guess I\u2019d say the moderate news is that they are not buying as much insurance because they are not sure if now it's been pushed off a little bit and I think you might see that pickup more in toward into the summer and the fall as they look at benefit plans and start to see some, could be seeing healthy premium increases and they may look for alternatives from folks like our insurance agency, who can give them those tools.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Martin Mucci","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company","Hi, yes. Just wanted to ask you, you talked about seeing in the payroll growth, I guess better attach rates. Can you -- what is, I guess what solutions are included within the payroll services growth that you are attaching? And I guess the follow on, associated question also is, can we look at the revenue per client growth that\u2019s helping payroll growth partly reflecting that you are seeing, that your growth was in the mid-market necessarily than with smaller clients at this point or is that not a good conclusion to draw from the data?","Martin Mucci","No, I\u2019ll start on the product and then let Efrain take that last part. I think Tim primarily what we\u2019re seeing is time and attendance solutions picking up and from a SaaS product standpoint anyway we\u2019re seeing time and attendance solutions that we would have felt were more mid-market are actually sliding down as well into the -- what we think of as the under 50, the small business market and that\u2019s been a nice pickup for us. So our time and attendance online solutions as well as some of the HR administration but mostly time and attendance are picking up into the small business. So they are showing up in the 20 to 50 where we were thinking they would be more seen in the 50 plus.","Now we have a small end clock as well, when we purchased the Icon Time Systems, very basic clock, and that\u2019s the work in the under 10 but we\u2019re seeing even better pickup on the SaaS solution for time and attendance over 20, I would say.","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, I would say, I don\u2019t think we can draw any conclusions on mid-market growth rates and I think that Tim what you see is a bit better client base, a bit better pricing, a bit better sales execution overall is really kind of driving what\u2019s going in payroll service revenue. In payroll service revenue we don't include the SaaS products that Marty just mentioned so time and attendance and HR online administration are reported in HR ad. So although we are attaching you are seeing some of the growth occurring on the HRS side.","Now core payroll is I should say payroll is basically payroll services, tax pay, employee deposit which is executing better this year than we were last year.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company","","Okay and then I guess just given you had another SaaS based competitor become public, there\u2019s another one that\u2019s on file, that I guess just give us updated comments on the competitive environment as you see it from particularly in the I guess the small to mid-market right now.","Martin Mucci","","Yeah, I don't see a lot of difference you know, whether they go public or not, you know obviously I don't think it changes a lot, it gives them a little bit of some name out there to get going public but we don't run into them too much -- we\u2019re still running into mostly the national competitor. They are not going to be able to offer as much from the service model perspective across the country, they are not going to offer quite as much from a technology perspective in its broader category from small to mid-size, I don't think as we do.","So I think we\u2019re seeing kind of still the same level of competition and I think our investments from a technology standpoint combined with the service has been particularly strong right now. So I guess I would say for once Tim I am really glad that we invested where we did starting I would say four years ago when we really put a lot into the mobility app and the SaaS solutions because they are competing very well and it's positioned us nicely for the competition, that\u2019s coming up. But there is still more regional competitors from that standpoint. Efrain anything you want to add to that?","Efrain Rivera","I would just say Tim that we know them very well, we know them in detail, we know their weaknesses and their strengths and we take all competition in this space seriously.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi, David.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","","Good morning, Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","","Good morning.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Marty you mentioned some very recent enhancements in the mobile and SaaS product areas, can you perhaps lay out the broader new product roadmap over the next 12 to 18 months what we should expect from an innovation perspective from Paychex?","Martin Mucci","","Yeah, I think the biggest thing is we have talked about it in the past, but I think we\u2019re seeing it come to fruition which is very much exactly what the clients want, which is an integrated experience for the way that we\u2019re delivering the entire product. So we started seeing a few years ago that really the mid-market and sometimes even the higher and small market is selling more to an HR or time and attendance need of the client and then payroll is part of that.","And so what we worked on was enhancing products that we either purchased or built over the last four to seven years and then enhancing them to integrate the experience, put a revised look to them so that there is a combined, there\u2019s a single sign on, there\u2019s a combined UI -- the user experience and user interface for them. And you\u2019ll continue to see a more, I guess I\u2019ll say in that market you\u2019ll continue to see more integration and more UI and additional functionality that is more sophisticated and integrated like job costing and so forth that giving them everything and you are able to update, for example in the past we would have issues where you had -- you could update people's -- employees information in multiple places and sometimes that was confusing to the client.","We now have one kind of people section that applies to the time and attendance HR in payroll and you can update in one place that updates everything and it\u2019s a much smoother seamless approach for the client and you\u2019ll continue to see that integration and usability improved and modernized. In mobility, like this week its making user interface even more modern and we just released this, the UI, I would say 12 to 18 months ago. Now we\u2019re releasing kind of an updated UI for the mobility platform. So the changes are going to be more frequent and they are just more modern as we see what the competitive market needs.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","That makes sense. Just as a related question could you update us on the performance of some of your recent acquisitions and new products like ExpenseWire, myStaffing and Kashoo?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, myStaffing, extremely strong performance from -- on organic -- they sell directly to clients as well and there is some indirect partners -- sellers there, indirect partnerships, that's selling very well and selling into our base as well. There is just a huge need for talent from applicant tracking through talent management and so forth and doing well.","ExpenseWire is performing fine, that's from an expense management again integrating. We're pulling more and more those acquisitions into the overall mid-market products, so that there is more of a seamless integration along with our time and attendance and HR administration, so the client has a full suite.","And then from Kashoo perspective on the Paychex's Accounting Online app very recent so we're getting good signups, we're getting a lot of attention. We're kind of learning how to drive more and more the, not only the sign up but then the adoption and actually registering and signing up the client.","So we're working with Kashoo and then of course the private label version, our own is how do you drive -- we're doing pretty good driving activity in and then it's how do you get them to register in and sign up for the product. But it's very early, so we're kind of learning a lot in that market. But we're happy with -- we like the product and we're continuing to rollout with them additional enhancements to the Paychex accounting online.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","On the topic of Kashoo, Intuit on its recent quarter reported 95% growth in their payroll processing business, are you seeing that the level of Kashoo, was that a little bit above or little bit below from a client size perspective?","Martin Mucci","So you are saying they are seeing a big jump in their payroll processing service?","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Right, I know they are targeted typically at very small businesses that may be below your average client size but I am just wondering if you see them at all in the market from a competitive standpoint.","Martin Mucci","Okay. No, I think mostly what we'll see them, SurePayroll will see them and SurePayroll continues to perform very well. So that's the other acquisition that we would talk about it. Three years now we feel very good about SurePayroll continue to have good growth in more even in their direct channels and the indirect channels that they've done a lot of white labeling with banks and so forth. But even the direct channel's even stronger than we had expected. So we feel real good about their growth and their continued competitiveness against Intuit and others.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Just a quick final question, I thought in your comments about the strength in new business sales in the quarter, you called out every area as being strong except the mid-market. Do I have that correct or there was another message you are trying to send on mid-market payroll?","Efrain Rivera","I think what we said there David was we just called out the one that were the strongest. We could have called out a number of different sales areas and we called out the ones that were strongest.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good morning.","Martin Mucci","Hi Gary.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","I think in the comments you said that for the nine months sales commissions was one of the drivers of growth but didn't specifically say that, that was a big driver of cost growth this quarter. Should we read into that a change in that the trending or growth of new business this quarter versus early in the year or am I reading too much into it?","Efrain Rivera","I think you are reading too much into it. Actually sales expenses for the nine months are up with sales growth for the year. So I think you are reading a little bit too much into it.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, all right.","Efrain Rivera","And by the way, so as Marty said we continue to have very solid sales execution for the year and expect that to continue.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, okay. The next question you talked a lot about new product launches over the last few years and certainly all the product development investments you've been making, can you give us a sense, either numbers or sort of anecdotally how much of those efforts are to upgrade existing offerings that are going in and supporting the same revenue that you've been getting from customers versus driving incremental revenue through new sales or actually being a separate service?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I guess I would say certainly because when you look at the offering as a complete offering and we are seeing that more and more come down in the marketplace from people who wanted payroll years ago only and tax pay and direct deposit too, hey I would like something for my HR administration and time and attendance in particular, I think what you\u2019d see is the development has helped, it's both, it\u2019s shored up the existing product base but it\u2019s certainly getting more revenue per client in the addition of the time and attendance offerings.","When you look at our product development work it's been about building mobility, so the clients have more choices to how they get to us and do their payroll, so they have a better online product now, and a much better mobility, I think the best app in the market place, for us from a payroll standpoint and combined services. So those kind of shore up the existing products for what clients expect now from a competitive standpoint. So if we didn\u2019t have mobility for example, I think it would improve sales and retention overtime, particularly the two national players compete and some of the regionals can\u2019t do as much in that standpoint.","Then there is also -- when you take something like time and attendance, we didn\u2019t offer as robust a product few years ago as we do now and so that\u2019s the new revenue streams that have helped the HRS growth in time and attendance, HR administration online, both SaaS products, BeneTrac, the benefit and enrollment products that we added there and so forth. So it\u2019s a combination of shoring up and keeping you very competitive and then also adding more products to it.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great and then just one more question about the competition, and I totally realize that you grow your revenue in dollar terms more in a year than the size of most of these new upstarts. So looking at the growth rates is unfair but there just seems to be an awful lot of more press by very unscientific review of banner ads on the web and other things. It\u2019s just showing a lot more discussions around some of these upstarts. So in light of all that have you changed the mix or sophistication of how you\u2019re marketing and attracting customers, doing efforts to compete with what seems like some more brand awareness and probably somewhat more tech savvy new entrants trying to come after your market share?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, a couple of things on that. One, I think that one of the positive things about all the press and some of these regional players going -- doing IPOs or partial IPOs I guess I\u2019d say is that they bring more awareness to the market of the products and so there\u2019s a little bit of plus there for all of us and I think when you look at Paychex or another national competitor, hopefully clients see a much bigger strength there of being around for 40 years and producing consistently solid results retention service numbers et cetera. So I think there\u2019s actually a little bit of plus there and we already have the competition, so it\u2019s interesting.","From a marketing perspective we definitely have pushed a lot more on the web. We\u2019re picking up a lot more leads from the market search and that\u2019s been a bigger part of our approach. We also have found a much better way to handle those leads. We\u2019ve evolved into much more real time handling of the leads themselves that come in. So I think our marketing has picked up some, always can do I think more, but I think it\u2019s a balance of where do you spend the money, is it on marketing around sales, which we kind of put in, in that category and we always tend to give more on the sales side and put more on our actual execution of the sales team and put more money there for supporting the sales team and their execution.","But I think the marketing -- our marketing has picked up, our website is much stronger, our whole process of handling the lead is stronger, and I guess that\u2019s how I look at it. I appreciate that you do talk about looking at absolute numbers of growth as opposed to percentages because that certainly means a lot to us. The amount of growth of what, 5% to 6% means for us is a lot bigger than sometimes the entire company that someone else might be looking at.","Efrain Rivera","Hey Gary, one other thing I\u2019d add to what Marty said, we don\u2019t talk a lot about the efforts, that support sales but we have an entire organization where we\u2019ve made significant investments, our national sales support office here, both in terms of technology and numbers of people. And I would say, I would put our ability to both generate and convert leads up against anyone. We can put a person -- feet on the street within hours of getting a web lead, which I don\u2019t think many people can do. And we also have both SurePayroll, as I mentioned to some of you. SurePayroll and our core sales competing, we let them compete head to head in terms of web and sales lead. So we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re missing anything that\u2019s occurring in the market. We just don't toot a horn with respect to that either.","I think to be in this game long term, not short term but to be in it long term you would have to have a compelling service proposition and a compelling technology position. And what we have been doing is we have been improving both. Some people in the competition have not been doing that. We think long term the right solution that works is the one that combines, that creates a sustainable advantage by maximizing both, not just one.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi, Sara.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. A question about checks per payroll trend and the 1% growth in the quarter; I know that your comparison was more difficult and you have highlighted that it would slow, but I am just wondering what you would expect going forward and if there\u2019s any potential mix impact on that?","Efrain Rivera","There\u2019s a little bit of mix impact always, just to kind of refresh your recollection. We\u2019re not doing same store comparison, we do a little bit of validation and make sure it\u2019s not too whacky but it\u2019s not a same store comparison. We are just taking the amount of checks we admitted and comparing them to a prior period. So you get some mix effect in there. I think Sara what happened, we had a pretty strong Q3 last year. There was some Sandy overhang, there were bonuses in there, we think that may have affected that number.","Now we\u2019re normalizing down in the -- I would say that we\u2019re down in the 1% -1.5% range that\u2019s what we have seen during the year. Our assumptions are that will continue to moderate but we\u2019ll see. We haven\u2019t got it precisely correctly, so you are going to get some variability there and our expectation is, one we will be probably moderating slightly down from there.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then separately, could you talk a bit more about the new payment processing service with Elavon and I am wondering how that fits into the chain of client acquisition, since I generally think of clients signing up for credit card processing first and then maybe adding on payroll solutions after that.","Martin Mucci","Well I think you know -- Sara you are right. I think when we went into this and we started trialing it we really kind of looked at that we are getting in pretty early on a new business and that we had -- because we had feet on the street we would get to the new businesses as they started up and would be successful in signing them up for the first time. And what we found in trialing it, in a number of zones around the country was that wasn\u2019t always the case and that, so we actually changed the sales model around and we sell more of that now basically over the phone and into the client base and we are having more success there. And so what we found and it's kind of its own animal.","So you have to know the pricing, you have to know how to price it per transaction, the different kinds of businesses and what we found was a little bit more of a specialized team over the phone and concentrated could sell into the client base more successfully than 200 reps going at brand new clients the first time. So we trialed that around, found the best way we think to sell it and now we\u2019ve kind of officially introduced it and we\u2019re just starting to get you know some traction and results on it but we are definitely starting to get some traction.","So we feel with -- you know over 500,000 clients and under that on the small business side that we have got a nice opportunity there, with Elavon obviously. So what we are doing is setting it up, we\u2019re getting to the client base who have the strength of knowing the Paychex brand and knowing that they already use us for money flow and so forth and that by trusting us that they\u2019ll sign up with us with competitive packages and all the solutions that Elavon brings and then we get a piece of that action on a go forward basis.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Go ahead. Your line is open.","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities","","Good morning guys. Back when you just reported HR client service in place on a sequential basis you sometimes had a more moderate growth over year-end given high attritions. It looks like you had a really good quarter, does that mean you actually had pretty good client employee growth over year-end this year?","Efrain Rivera","I think we had good growth over year-end but I think Jim, we just really had strong sales in HR services overall. It\u2019s been a good sales year from that perspective.","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities","And does that processing day impact next quarter? You said that HR services wouldn\u2019t be at the low end, next quarter growth rate, is that as affected by processing day or is it something else there?","Efrain Rivera","No, there is a little bit of impact on there but I also called out we had a very, very strong quarter in terms of HR solutions and look, we'd love to have every single quarter look like that. But at this point we don't think that will repeat quite to the extend it did this quarter.","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities","And just one final sort of technical question, so last quarter your SG&A sort of jumped a bunch, in this quarter it was didn't -- the increase wasn't very much at all. Anything going on there that I should know about?","Efrain Rivera","Not really, what ends up happening, what's ending up happening in SG&A is that we are adjusting as we go through the year variable elements at constant terms. We get it right sometimes we overshoot a little bit. And we develop a view of kind of how it's going to project quarter-over-quarter.","I would say in terms of the year we think it will be pretty close to what we expect to deploy, may be it shifted a little bit from one quarter to another. And then rate of IT spending also has an impact on that. So it can shift a little bit but not dramatically beyond what we expected when we started the year.","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities","Great, thanks guys.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Davis of Credit Suisse. Go ahead your line is open.","Ryan Davis - Credit Suisse","Hi guys, this is Ryan calling in for George. I had the first question about the selling season. It sounds like you guys had some positive comments around it. Is it surrounding like the overall selling environment being better or is it may be a product of market share gains or combination of the two?","Martin Mucci","I think -- well I think the overall environment is okay. I think it's still -- we would say from a new business start, one way to gauge it. Is it still fairly sluggish? I think new business starts are up a bit but it's nothing to kind of write home about. It's not back to pre-recession levels yet that we've seen employment is up a little, when we look at checks per payroll and so forth.","So I think it's just kind of continued good execution on the sales side, more than that the environment is suddenly swelled or anything. I think we've seen some positive in the environment but it hasn't been anything to be overly excited about. We see kind of a steady improvement in the small business environment. Efrain anything you want to add to that?","And I think as I said the execution has been consistent and in good there. So I think it's been just as much that more that than the environment itself.","Efrain Rivera","You have to group it.","Ryan Davis - Credit Suisse","Okay, fair enough. Now focusing in on the margins, ex [inaudible], they have been on a nice upward trajectory over the last several years. Is it a point where these -- it kind of takes a breather given commentary, I guess of accelerating new sales growth '14 over '13. And some of the acquisitions and the gracing cost, is it fair to assume these, the market could take a breather?","Martin Mucci","I think we'll talk more about that when we get to the fourth quarter and talk about plans. The rates and the extent of leverages that is the function and part of top line growth. So as we grow top line more, we get more ability to leverage. So we have to go through the plan and look at it.","I would just say what I say to everyone one on this point which is that when we go into a plan we look at trying to get leverage and when we get the leverage we try to beat it during the year. So that's what you see.","Ryan Davis - Credit Suisse","Okay. And just one quick model maintenance question on start-up, it looked like there is a negative swing and the net change in funds held for clients' cash flow and balance pretty significant I guess what is that from?","Martin Mucci","Not sure what exactly you are pointing to.","Ryan Davis - Credit Suisse","So year-over-year it looked like there is $1.4 billion negative change in funds held for clients?","Martin Mucci","I am sorry, yeah. Well it's -- I would urge you to really think about average funds held for clients. It really is very dependent on when a particular quarter closes, how much we have in funds, how much we have disbursed on that day or that quarter. On average if you look at our Q, I think nine months we call out the balance, the average balance $3.7 billion, so that's really what you need to focus on we're up about 5% for the nine months period.","Quarter-to-quarter it can really, really swing and it's really a function of when the quarter ended, what funds we\u2019re holding, what payments needed to be made.","Ryan Davis - Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Martin Mucci","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Thank you. Hi, Marty, hi, Efrain. I guess my first question is with regards to the impact of new partner product that you introduced, some of it you covered, but there\u2019s been a range of payments, accounting, payroll cards, the new announcement recently. What is the revenue implication in terms of ramping revenues of that and also given their partner products as opposed to your own products how does that work with regards to margins and split of economics?","Martin Mucci","Well, obviously we didn\u2019t gave too much detail on it from a competitive standpoint what we\u2019re doing with the partners exactly but I guess it's pretty small at the beginning with what we think that there is a nice value added advantage we have of getting into the client base and we decided instead of certain things like payment processing et cetera going out and acquiring a global payments process or our regional payments process was better to just get a commission on the sales there, on the ongoing transactions. And so it\u2019s positive but it\u2019s going to be pretty small compared to our overall revenue.","We certainly hope that it will grow with the client base, as we penetrate the client base more but it\u2019s a little bit early to tell. When you look at the accounting that's a partnership with kind of an investment in Kashoo and then labeling our own product. So a piece of that it will be a pretty small for a while until we start converting clients and getting them to register and then overtime we may make a bigger investment there and then it starts to show up as a bigger impact on our revenue stream.","So again these tend to be small longer-term investments that we think have a great opportunity to become significant but over the longer period of time.","Efrain Rivera","The other thing Ashwin I\u2019d say and just echo what Marty said, it is a longer term play, but in the shorter term what we know is that the more products the client have the stickier they are. So that\u2019s a part of what we\u2019re trying to do is to build multiple touch-points with the client so that they are stickier within the base.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Right, understood. With regards to one of the product lines that you had for some time now healthcare, how big is it and with regards to ACA being I guess for the small business segment the below 100 being pushed out by maybe a year, is that affecting growth in the segment or are people looking forward and saying there is something they need to do?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think from a size perspective I think we publicly said the agency is over a $100 million in revenue and that we have over a 100,000 clients, and that's for our insurance agency and I think specific to the health piece of it, as I mentioned earlier, it has moderated a bit, because I think clients -- it\u2019s been a good opportunity for us to get in front of client and support them with the products that we already rolled out which help them decide there is tools there as to whether on a monthly reporting and monitoring service whether it applies to them or not but I think all the confusion in the delays now the 50 to a 100 don\u2019t have to have insurance for their employees in \u201915, 2015 I think all that has moderated the sales of some of the products in short term.","I do think as you approach the fall and people start looking at their annual premiums going up I think they will be well positioned to offer them options and in expertise to combine both because we offer that payroll company all the other solutions that we have, added services and an insurance agency, I think it will position us well. But it kind of pushed it out a bit as the rules have been and the requirements have pushed out.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Right, and just so I understand the people that -- your sales force that are selling whether it is specialized sales force and does it now have to be re-focused on other things or is it more fungible than that?","Martin Mucci","No, it\u2019s a specialized sales force on the health and benefit side and the worker\u2019s comp insurance and other insurances side we are a full service agency. There are specific sales force that are licensed and sell those products in the field and over the phone and they are still out selling and there is good execution there, it's just not quite as big of an increase as we expected. We think it more moderate but it will continue to -- it's continuing to grow, that\u2019s for sure.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Okay, my last question is with regards to the index that you've introduced, how much of that is more of a branding exercise versus is there a lack of information in the public domain today that you will focus on bringing out? What sort of information is there in public domain?","Martin Mucci","Yeah I mean there\u2019s a number of indexes out there but I think we felt we talked about this for number of years internally about whether to do it or not. We think that we\u2019re uniquely positioned because the one thing that we keep getting at is looking for more real time data on small business growth and we\u2019re taking basically a subset of our overall client base of 350,000 of the clients under 50 in creating an index with same store sale -- the same store that kind of shows year-over-year what the worker growth is for those clients. And the conclusion we came to was hey we have some unique data here.","Typically you would get that kind of data from Federal Indexes that are or federal sources that are kind of lagged three quarters and that we were getting a push forward, hey how about some real time data from some of your clients, so we felt that we had something unique here. It\u2019s real time, it focus on under 50 and I think we have some of the best data in the business and so we produced an index that we think will add something a little bit different for the marketplace.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Okay, thank you guys. Good execution on the margin.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Thanks Ashwin. That's hard praise.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. So couple of quick questions on pricing. You talked about offering a bundle of the core payroll product with some online solutions. What does pricing look like there? Is there a higher revenue per client solution or does it fall somewhere between the core product or just the pure SaaS product?","Martin Mucci","No, it\u2019s really when you don't count your payroll and if you look at just the Paychex offerings there is no real difference. It\u2019s a complete offering for the small business under 50. You are looking at a complete offering with both online and that\u2019s part of the full suite. You are getting full service, dedicated service and you have the online and mobility it\u2019s all part of shoring up that product.","The good news that we have seen is we\u2019re continuing to grow the revenue per client as we have said and we think that, that\u2019s been part of higher retention and better new business revenue being higher so a stronger I guess a stronger offering that is driving up the revenue per client and again we have said that the price increases are holding as well. So we think that\u2019s all part of a complete offering.","When you look at your payroll it\u2019s a different offering. It\u2019s roughly a third typically in an average client that we see, we have said that and that\u2019s continuing to hold up very well on a price perspective as well.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Got it and on the HR side you mentioned in the release that you are getting higher average premiums in worker\u2019s comp does it that going to translate into higher expected claims cost or is that all a pass-through?","Efrain Rivera","No, that\u2019s just underlying rate that we would negotiate with [carriers]. It really doesn\u2019t have to do and on workers comp by the way at least within our agency that\u2019s broker business so we are not taking an interest on that portion of business.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Martin Mucci","Welcome.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeffery Silber - BMO Capital Markets","","Thanks so much. I know it\u2019s late. I will just ask one quick one. Efrain on the guidance and looking at the operating margin, I know you said 38% could be 38.5% but even at that level it does imply some margin contraction for the fourth quarter. Is my math correct? Is there something going on that we should know about?","Efrain Rivera","","You are right, Jeff and if you look at every fourth quarter kind of going back probably three years you see we have pretty significant contraction in the quarter and it\u2019s just a higher spend quarter in general and part of that, just to get kind of one level deeper is that IT spending typically has been going up double digits. This year is no exception and that ramps through the year, so that we exit the year at higher spending and then there\u2019s other sales related expenses that occur in that quarter, that typically kind of burden that margin a bit more.","Jeffery Silber - BMO Capital Markets","","But would that still imply margin contraction on a year-over-year basis compared to fourth quarter last year?","Efrain Rivera","","I haven\u2019t looked at quarter over quarter. I am just sticking to guidance. It shouldn\u2019t, Jeff even if we\u2019re between 38 and 39 we should be a little bit better. I have to look at it specifically.","Jeffery Silber - BMO Capital Markets","","Okay, great. I think that\u2019s all I have got. All right, thanks I can follow up offline.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan Chase. Go ahead, your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey good morning.","Martin Mucci","Good morning.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah I just want to ask about retention, I am sorry if I missed this but did you give any color around what retention looked like in the quarter versus spend?","Martin Mucci","Retention just started -- continues to be very strong. I think we're still looking approximately at the highest levels of retention we've had in our history, certainly five to six years. So we still feel very good about the client retention that we're seeing in the client base.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","All right, that's just good to know and then just, I know you had a lot of questions, not surprisingly about SaaS and some of the changes gone over in the public market place but just -- can you just give us a quick high level [inaudible] on just right now to date point solution versus service bureau sort of given all the stuff that's going on in the world with ACA and what have you, sort of what are you seeing on the ground in terms of preference between the two sides, because I know there can be push and pull at different periods of the cycle?","Martin Mucci","Not seeing any drastic change, I think we continue because of the investments we've made and what we've rolled out. We feel good about the SaaS offerings that we have, both small market and large, that we're well positioned and the perspective from the offerings from the small business to mid-market, the time and attendance, the HR administration, the benefit enrollment all real SaaS solutions.","But our focus has been very much offering the combination of that with the service, that's what folks are not seeing as much when they are usually when they are going somewhere else. We're still trying to give you that dedicated model and focusing that you have all the technology you have all the SaaS and cloud based solution that you want, all online now.","There isn't -- we are not selling software that you are putting on your system and haven't been really for some time. It's all SaaS based and everything is becoming more and more integrated across the product set. So we feel very well positioned there, so even with all the hype we probably, as I think Efrain mentioned earlier we don't hype that as much and people look at us more as a service bureau but we are very much a SaaS based with the service model is how we look at it.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Just lastly I now want to go to the PEO stuff, a lot of good commentary there, are you making some incremental investments in the PEO, given some of the commentary around pick-up in demand?","Martin Mucci","Yeah what we did previously, probably last year they went more to the SaaS model, the new online Paychex's next gen product. And so I think what we're seeing is that paid off -- that's being paying off very nicely because not only that we always have good service in the PEO model but as PEO kind of came more in favor, back in favor in the marketplace we were really well positioned to execute on the sales side not only for the need but because we have technology and the service level.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Great, great quarter guys, appreciate it.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of R. W. Baird. Go ahead your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi Mark.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Hi, Efrain, hey Marty? Congrats on a great quarter. One strategic question, just as we continue to see an expansion in terms of the solution set, how are you thinking either or about build versus buy versus alliances as you optimize your solution set, just you had a couple of experiences, just how are you thinking about that?","Martin Mucci","Yeah I think, we look at that a lot it's always -- we're very proud of the investment that we've made and that we're feeling good about them paying off as we kind of talked about through the call. But we're always on an eye to a year out, two years out, three years out in how well positioned are we in the various markets and we're very open to build or partner and always kind of looking pretty closely at that.","We think we have a tremendous distribution model still. Our field sales team, of course the 3,000 sales people in the field have continued to execute and so it's all about how fast can we give them more to sell and what the best way to do that. And obviously you've seen kind of the smaller end when we look at payment processing we think there is an opportunity there, we partner. When we look at a new product like accounting online we partner.","If we think that in various markets we're better our partnering we'll look at the we think that in various markets we\u2019re better off partnering we\u2019ll look at the economics of that and the opportunity to grow and we\u2019re very open to it.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Great and then with regards to some of the sales initiatives that you put in place such as going after franchises, can you just give us a little bit of sense for what areas have seen the strongest results in terms of the initiatives that you laid out at your analyst meeting?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think one the banking channel that something that in the past we were much stronger on the CPA channel not as strong in the banks I think that Mark Bottini and the team there building a team that really are dedicated, more focused on the banks and support of the bank channel has led to all a number of referrals and sales there, and we\u2019ve seen that. We think that\u2019s been very successful particularly in certain markets and because we just focus better on, that was one of the initiatives the franchise has picked up as well. I would say even more successful in signing up the franchises and now we\u2019re kind of learning how best to service those franchises.","So there is connections to subway, there is connections to Yum brands, there is Connexions there. Now we\u2019re learning who has more kind of cloud in those organizations because we\u2019re still not -- you are requiring them to sign up with you but you\u2019re driving influenced from the headquarters type of thing, and so we\u2019re learning a lot how best to partner with the headquarters and with the franchisees.","But there\u2019s something we continue to invest in and I think that team has been very successful in building the relationships and signing up new franchisees from a corporate standpoint and now we got to pick-up the pay side on closing those franchisees and these we\u2019re finding different ways to sell into the markets once we have the agreement as well. So the initiatives on banks, franchisees and so forth we feel they are doing good. They\u2019re picking up momentum and so we\u2019re feeling pretty good about them.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","That\u2019s great. And then one last question with regards to the expense performance this quarter, I mean it was basically isolated to the other line, what are some of the areas that just fluctuate within that?","Efrain Rivera","","The other line\u2026","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Yeah, so when we go through the Q, as an example there is -- you breakout expenses between wages and compensation, the other\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yeah as you\u2019re looking at it by natural categories.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Yes.","Efrain Rivera","I think, I\u2019d say this that our P&L is variable and we have a fair amount of ability to manage expenses intra-quarter and obviously based on what we\u2019re seeing in the year we can make adjustments as we go forward. So there\u2019s nothing unusual popping out in that category. We have higher IT expenses and we did a really good job on operating expenses, controlling that growth as the financial statements in the K, there\u2019s nothing strange going on there.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","I was just wondering if you can keep that up.","Efrain Rivera","Look if you ignore the natural category expense breakdown and look at what we\u2019re doing, step back a bit, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re leveraging operating cost and we are continue to invest in IT so SG&A growing faster than sales primarily driven by G and ops expenses growing slower than sales. That trend, that macro-trend, irrespective of where it falls from a natural expense category standpoint is a trend that we expect to continue.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Great, thanks very much.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Martin Mucci","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, your line is open.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","","Hi this is Ashish Sabadra on behalf of Bryan.","Martin Mucci","Hi.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","Hi, most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick one on the CPA channel. I was just wondering if you could provide a quick update on that one.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, that continues to be good for us, pretty solid across the board. We maintain those relationships and I think the only thing that would moderate that sum is just the new business growth as we\u2019ve said continues to be a bit sluggish and a lot of the new business referrals came from the CPAs. So that has probably tamped that down a little bit but the relationships and the approach from the CPAs and our referrals from them continue to be okay.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","Great and just one more, quick question on the partnership model. Is there an opportunity for you to partner with other technology vendor and provide services as on top of that, these could be into a segment where you\u2019ve not currently tapped them, could be much more the big mid-tier clients or other HR solutions that you currently don't have in your portfolio. I was just wondering if you could just comment on that.","Martin Mucci","Yeah we are always -- I might have mentioned earlier, we're always open to that. We think we're not going to go too far flung from what we do but in providing strength to the employer-employee relationship and if there is a technology need or a market that we think we can be very successful in and leverage the great 3,000 sales people that we have out there that execute well and we can bring them something else.","We would certainly be open to that versus building. It's always a matter of looking at the economics of that and certainly what we think is our level of success. So we're certainly open to it and always looking at those alternatives.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","Okay thanks.","Martin Mucci","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi, Joe.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi, how are you guys. I got a ton of questions, how much time do we have left? I am just kidding. So just two quick ones, hopefully they are quick, but how do you measure the progress of the technology upgrades? In other words I am wondering do you measure that per usage and if there is any color, if not that's fine and then just one quick follow-up.","Efrain Rivera","Yeah I wouldn't say as much and usage at this point as it is the selling. So are we selling it, are we competitive. And again with good continued sales execution we feel good about that and increased penetration. So we're seeing increased attachment and increased penetration in those SaaS solution so we feel that, that's a good marker for us.","And then certainly retention and we see good retention of the products that we're rolling up from a technical standpoint. And so we closely monitor that, we look at obviously all the surveys that we are doing on top of that and are counseling, tweaking and changing to keep competitive. So I think it's more of a measurement of that then usage necessarily of the product itself.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then secondly it sounds like the business is better after sort of slogging away at it for quite some time here. Yet the traditional catalyst like small business starts haven't necessarily picked up. Should we start thinking about that differently? Are there -- you finding new catalysts within the business that can pick up the slack even though we haven't seen the traditional ones pick up steam?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think that's fair. I mean we still have a good percentage of sales that come from new businesses and while that's sluggish it certainly is up from where it was last year. It's not back to pre-recession levels. So I do think -- I don't want to mislead you and think that new business still isn't the strong part of our business. We're still very good at that and get referrals from CPAs and new business and banks and so forth.","But I do think that we -- knowing that we were -- that, that continued to be kind of sluggish coming back we look for new ways to attract to get referrals, that we've looked at new ways to retain clients, we looked at new products in investing a lot of the technology investment has been that we also I think have gotten -- we've done a nice job in building the revenue per client. And so we're taking even getting better at saying we've done a lot of product here to sell into the client base. And we're not going to wait around for the economy to be super strong, let's just sell in to the client base as well as bring in new clients. And I think may be that mix is -- it's changing a little bit. Efrain anything you want to add?","Efrain Rivera","Hi, Joe, so I think that the execution we're seeing is a result of our ability to extract value from the distribution base we've got and there is long way we've got a long way to go in that process.","Martin Mucci","I think we've also found new ways to refinance, so if you take like our initiatives on 401(k), we've always sold into the small market but we would say small market for 401(k), very successful. And but we started looking at how do we increase that over what we've always been doing. And we found a way to go in to the large market, larger assets for clients and we really sent build our sales team just focused on that, build a team small team focused on financial advisers and getting more leads from them.","So we're not just going to traditional. We really worked hard to find new ways to grow what we've always been good at.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Our last question comes from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi, David.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, sorry I am late here, actually got on the call late so if this has been answered we can take this offline but just really quickly I had a quick question about the exchanges, where are you, I know you had announced a partnership with one of the small business exchanges. Just kind of wondering where you are in that process and what impact you expect the exchanges to have on your business both near term as well as out two or three years based on what you know right now.","Martin Mucci","Yeah I think Evolution1 was the partner we were in with and we have that set up and we are not -- one of the things that what we were trying to do there was help businesses, small businesses who are under pressure to give to -- we don't have to do small business group insurance, small group insurance but want to provide something to their clients to do some pretax and then go over to the private exchange and use that. Unfortunately some of the changes in the healthcare reform kind of took away that benefit at least at this point the pretax benefit. So if I am a small group employer and I want to just give you know $300 a month to my employee pretax that\u2019s not really necessarily an alternative anymore, that it\u2019s going to be pretax and so forth.","So it\u2019s slowed kind of that whole thing for us on the private exchange piece. We still have the partnership, we still offer it. It\u2019s just not quite as attractive as it was previously and that may still change as these rules kind of solidify over the next year or so. And then the exchanges in general we have not seen as much of a loss, I would say to the exchanges yet that we thought we might see on the small business side and we haven\u2019t -- we have seen the sales to those who need insurance. We\u2019ve seen that moderated as I mentioned earlier, just we haven\u2019t seen as much of a decision making process from the clients because they are kind of confused and they realize like 50 to 100 don't have to do anything now in 2015, up till 2016.","So I would say overall the whole exchange piece hasn\u2019t caused any major disruption. It also hasn\u2019t accelerated anything. It\u2019s been a more moderate kind of thing and we expect to see more of the opportunity and maybe the impact in the next fiscal year as they approach 2016 will be the bigger impact.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","","Right, great, thanks very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","You are welcome.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Martin Mucci","Great.

Sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of Paychex's first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for first quarter ended August 31, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and you can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage as they become available. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.","On today's call, I will review highlights for the first quarter in relation to sales and ops and product management development areas. Efrain will review first quarter financial results and discuss our full-year guidance, and then, we'll open it up to your questions.","We're off to a solid start for fiscal 2017 with positive results across all major product lines. The number of client worksite employees served by our human resource outsourcing services grew by double digits on a year-over-year basis.","Our cloud-based HCM services including time and attendance and human resource management continued to gain strong market acceptance in the quarter as well as last year. Payroll service revenue grew 4% for the first quarter. HRS revenue increased 15% for the quarter driven largely by growth in the client base across all major HCM categories.","Total service revenue, up 9%. We acquired Advance Partners last December and are very pleased with their contribution to our results. Advance Partners contributed approximately 1.5% to the growth in the service revenue for the first quarter.","Client retention has remained strong, providing excellent customer service as our top priority. We have continued to invest in our operations and compliant services to support growth and ensure we maintain best-in-class client service.","One area of focus has been the expansion of our multiproduct service center, which primarily assists our midmarket clients who attach additional services with payroll. We've also invested in our insurance operations team to increase support for our Affordable Care Act service clients as we approach the 2016 calendar year filing.","We recently announced the expansion of the AICPA-Paychex partner program to include human resource services in addition to payroll and retirement benefits. This program allows CPAs who refer to us to broaden their advisory role with clients by offering them a suite of best-in-class services and provides a strong referral channel for us. We are proud to be the preferred provider of payroll retirement and now human resource outsourcing services for the AICPA, CPA.com, and its CPA members.","The Department of Labor's final overtime rule will become effective December 1, which will expand overtime for millions of workers. This new legislation makes accurate time and attendance tracking more important than ever, and we have found that many businesses remain unaware of the legislation and the impact on their business.","We recently announced enhancements to our time and attendance service portfolio with the addition of Paychex Flex Time Essentials, TrueShift Time clock and an advanced scheduling feature within our Paychex Flex Time module. The investment in this technology demonstrates our continued commitment to providing industry-leading solutions that educate and assist our clients to comply with the new regulations and stay more connected to their employees and their businesses.","These new products enhance our commitment to supporting our clients for the entire employee journey from the posting of a position, interviewing a job offer, onboarding the new employee, and handling all the daily tasks and life events with a simple integrated SaaS software-as-a-solution platform combined with personalized and flexible service options.","We are very proud of the support our employees provide small and midsize businesses with this broad and advanced product set in commitment to great service, particularly as we enter our 45th year in business.","Along with that, I\u2019m very proud of some recent recognition our Paychex team has received. Our insurance agency ranked number 23 on Business Insurance Magazine's 2016 list of top 100 brokers of U.S. business. This is our sixth appearance on the list, and we once again rank as one of the fastest-growing insurance agencies in the nation.","We've been named to Selling Power Magazine's 2016 list of 50 best companies to sell for landing at number seven. This is the fourth consecutive year Paychex has appeared on the list moving up from the number nine spot last year, very proud to be in the top 10 of best companies to sell for.","And Paychex was once again ranked as the largest 401(k) record keeper by total number of defined contribution plans according to the recent survey by PLANSPONSOR Magazine, a national publication dedicated to the pension and retirement industry.","We also continue with our shareholder friendly actions in the first quarter. In July, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% or $0.04 per share to $0.46 per share. Our Board of Directors also approved an additional authorization to repurchase up to $350 million of our outstanding common stock which expires now and May 2019. We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter but we'll continue to assess the opportunity to buy back shares during the year to offset dilution.","In summary, we are off to a great solid start. We're receiving very good recognition and I'm very appreciative of the great work of our Paychex employee team, sales ops, and all the support teams in the company.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Marty, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risks. Please refer to our earnings release which includes a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors.","As discussed first quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 represent a solid start to the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and end with a review of our 2017 outlook.","Total service revenue grew 9% for the first quarter to $774 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the first quarter to $12 million as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Expenses increased 8% for the first quarter, and Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of this growth. Compensation-related expenses increased 6% primarily due to higher wages resulting from growth in headcount in both operations and sales.","Our effective income tax rate was 33% for the first quarter compared to 29.7% to the prior year's first quarter. The effective income tax rates have been impacted by discrete tax items recognized in both of these periods, so last quarter - last year's first quarter and this year's first quarter.","In the first quarter of this fiscal year, we recorded a tax benefit resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance partially offset by the recognition of an additional provision related to a state tax matter. These items increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.025 per share to be precise.","If you remember, last year in the first quarter we\u2019ve recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produced. This resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.06 per share for that period, so now if I could just do an editorial.","You'll see that when we talk about net income, we carefully say as reported net income. So we're going to give you guidance on as reported net income and net income excluding discrete items. The punch-line of that - the punch-line of that is that there's been no change. We just need you to look at those two items, down to discrete items, and we will talk about that in a second, and see that essentially it doesn't change the guidance. I have seen some notes that seem to think it does - it doesn't, I\u2019ll come to that in a second.","I just mentioned adoption of new accounting guidance impacting the effective tax rate. We early adopted new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payment. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit in the income statement. This was previously required to be recorded as additional paid-in capital in equity.","On an as reported basis, net income increased 4% to $217 million and diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.60 per share in the first quarter. Growth rates for net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted by approximately 5% and 6% as a result of the recognition of the discrete items in the respective periods, so I give you those numbers, so you can reconcile back to what it would look like if you excluded those items.","Let's talk about payroll service revenue, it increased 4% for the first quarter to $451 million. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting.","In addition, Advance Partners, which we acquired last year contributed approximately 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for the first quarter. Checks per payroll were not a contributing factor in the reported payroll revenue growth, and we expect to continue to see that to be the case.","Our HRS revenue increased strongly to 15% in the first quarter $323 million. Increase reflected strong growth in client base across all major HCM Services including our comprehensive outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and HR administration and I take this point or pause to say that remember that part of what we report in HRS are the modules that we sell on the HCM system. So in order to understand clearly what we're doing, you need to look at both categories.","Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see strong demand which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth in the number of client worksite employees served. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our full-service Affordable Care Act product and growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth.","Retirement services revenue benefited from increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value purchase and funds, as well as an increase in plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed approximately 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for the first quarter.","Investments and income. Our goal is to predict principal and optimize liquidity as you all know on the short term side primary short-term investment vehicles or bank demand deposit accounts and variable-rate demands. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities.","Our long term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Combined portfolios earned an average of 1.2% for the first quarter which is up from 1% last year. I'll just say one note on that, the Fed - it's very difficult to figure out what exactly is going on. Our guidance at this point does not include or anticipate any increases in the interest rate as I look at consensus model, looked like some of you are modeling an increase in their - at this point it's not in our guidance.","Average bounces for interest on funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% during the first quarter primarily as a result of lower state unemployment rates partially offset by growth in client base. I'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $944 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of August 31 were $3.4 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 2016, but as you know funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they averaged $3.8 billion for the quarter.","Our total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments in funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $63 million as of the end of the quarter and this compares with net unrealized gains of $48 million as of the end of May 31. Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of August 31, 2016 reflecting $166 million in dividends paid during the first quarter, a return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 39%.","Our cash flows from operations were $295 million for first quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. This change was primarily a result of higher net income, a slight increase in non-cash adjustments and fluctuations in working capital.","Now guidance for the remainder of the year. So with the close of the first quarter, when you take the opportunity to fine-tune the guidance we provided last quarter, we remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes against to the full year fiscal of 2017 is as follows; payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%, and if you recall this is a change we had set 4% and from our perspective it's fine-tuning.","Let me give you some detail on the quarter so you know how we expect to get to that. On a quarterly basis if you look at the second and the fourth quarter - second and fourth quarter we expected to be in this range. In the third quarter which is where we lose one day this year, we expect to be between 2% and 3%. So let me just reiterate that. Second and fourth quarters comparable on a daily basis to last year we expect to be in that range of 3 or 4. In the third quarter expect to be between 2 and 3 we have one less day in the third quarter.","HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain the same which is 12% to 14%. Total service revenue continues to be in the range of 7% to 8% also. Consistent with prior guidance, income excluding float as a percentage of total service revenue is expected to be approximately 38%. As you know, first quarter has typically had a higher margin and we expect that operating income excluding float in the second quarter won't be as high, we expect it to be between 38% and 39%.","Now, as reported net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. Some people took that and assumed that there was a change in guidance, simply reflecting the fact that we now have discrete items in first quarter and discrete items in the prior year first quarter. We wanted to give you a number that you could anchor your model on to understand what it looks like before you subtract them. So as reported - I repeat that again, net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. This reflects the impact of the discrete tax items I just mentioned which were recognized in both this quarter and prior year first quarter.","And it should be obvious that our previous guidance with adjusted for the discrete item in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Obviously, we did not know at the time, we\u2019re going to record a discrete item in the first quarter what we would have thought. When you make the adjustments and we exclude non-recurring items, net income will be the same as our prior guidance. So there is no change to the guidance, it simply gives you another data point on which to anchor the market.","Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35% which also reflects the impact of the discrete tax items. So, you can see our tax right in the first quarter was lower, subsequent quarters will be a higher to get us to approximately 35% for the year. Other aspects of our guidance have remained unchanged from what we previously provided.","I hope that clarifies the guidance and I will turn it now back to Martin.","Martin Mucci","Great, and operator, we'll now open up for any questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Rayna Kumar","Good morning, this is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Thanks for the clarification on the net income guidance. That was very helpful. Just one more on the guidance. I know you said you fine-tuned your payroll service revenue from 4% growth to now 3% to 4%. I guess what are you seeing that may be different in the market that made you bring the guidance a notch down?","Efrain Rivera","Well we said the guidance was approximately 4% when we released in or when we discussed it in the fourth quarter, and it just simply reflects fine-tuning as we look through the remainder of the quarters in the year. So, we don\u2019t think it represents a significant change from where we were, and it puts us pretty comparable to the growth rate we had last year.","Rayna Kumar","Got it. So your largest competitor is seeing some client losses in the mid market. Are you, is Paychex benefiting from this?","Martin Mucci","I think - this is Marty. I think to some degree, yes, I mean I don\u2019t think we felt like the competitive environment has changed all that much. I do think that we're very proud of the product that we have now, very full suite of HCM's total solution including the latest time and attendance additions. And so I think we\u2019re competing very well with them. I think - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed. We haven't seen a change dramatically but we\u2019ve certainly continue to feel very positive about where we are.","Rayna Kumar","It's very helpful. And lastly, could you just quantify on that price increases you're seeing in both payroll and HR services? Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","So payroll is different from HR services, but both are in the same in the same range -- in the range of 2% to 4%. On HRS, we don't uniformly apply price increases across all products. We really do that based on where we see the market. So - but our price increases are in the 2% to 4% range.","Rayna Kumar","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the core payroll outlook. And I understand that in terms of order of magnitude, it is fine-tuning from about 3% to 4%. But historically it's somewhat unusual for Paychex to tweak its outlook really at all so early in the fiscal year.","So just curious what led to the decision to kind of formally make that change, even though it's not a big one given that you've got eight months left in the fiscal year? Was there anything kind of company specific or I think you said you are not really assuming any changes in the macro backdrop. So just on the margin where -- was there a little bit of an adjustment from your perspective?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I guess, Jason, what I - I\u2019ll be answering that, this way. So when we look at the year, there are lots of things that can affect what we expect the growth rate to be not the least of which is what's the composition of the days in a year. And so, where we begin and where we end has an impact as we go through the year and we look at what the run rate is on a particular day. That's one thing that influences it.","But second thing is, what is the actual impact of one less day in a given quarter? So in the third quarter, we have one less day. We quantify that impact as we go through the year and understand what we think it will be, and that basically was what was impacting our decision to fine-tune a bit.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. I mean, as you look beyond this year, I mean is three to four kind of a new normal \u2013 I mean you've got the U.S. economy that\u2019s basically running in the range of full employment, you\u2019ve still got a little bit of help from Advance on a full-year basis this year. So I just want to make sure our expectations are properly calibrated, eventually unemployment, probably tick-up.","So is three to four a decent range or do you think you can really be mid-single digits in core payroll kind of over the medium to longer-term?","Martin Mucci","So two things I would say, Jason. One is, it\u2019s early I think we need to go through the year and see.","Jason Kupferberg","Yes.","Martin Mucci","I would say that we do not get the contribution from checks for payroll that we were getting two or three years ago and don't expect that that will recur. So you got to work a little bit harder. And then the third thing I would say is that, I want to be careful to say that the payroll service revenue is core payroll, it is not. Payroll service revenue is core payroll plus the portions of the HCM bundle that are payroll.","That number can vary and it will depend on what - how much of those packages we sell in the mid-market and what the pricing the payroll in the mid-market is. You have to look at both components of revenue in order to understand what the trends are. So subject to all of that we'll update as we go through, we\u2019ll update when we get to the end of the year.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Just one more from me. I think you haven\u2019t bought back any shares and I think three of the past four quarters, but you did the new authorization over the summer. So is the lack of buyback just because the current price is not viewed as attractive enough or is the M&A pipeline becoming more robust or any other factors that you might highlight? And thanks for taking the questions.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I appreciate it. I think it has something to do with the timing of authorization and the other factors. You mentioned we're excluding the price of the shares that\u2019s really not part of what goes into our thinking.","Jason Kupferberg","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Danyal Hussain","Hi, good morning, Martin and Efrain and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the relative performance of payroll versus HRS and I know Efrain there's one thing you called before at the revenue allocation process that maybe, if you could talk a little bit about more about it and specifically is that client are being given an explicitly higher discount on payroll upfront then exchange for adding more module or did they only see a single bundle price, just little more color there, will be helpful? Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","Well I think Danyal to your point, there is no general answer I can give on that. But certainly depending on the deal you discount at, what you think make sense and is logical. So, it could very well be that a bundle that has more modules and it is discounted more than a bundle that has fewer models in it.","So that's part of the equation. But there is other elements that add into it which is, what\u2019s the composition and the size of the clients you are selling in a given quarter. So that can be variable, so as we go through the year we'll see where we end up.","Martin Mucci","And I think the focus more and more they do see a bundle price, so I think more and more we tend to look at the total service revenue, the allocation between them, because we are selling more and more bundles and the bundles are getting larger and more complex. I think we tend to more and more look at the total service revenue growth and where that growth is and how we target that. So it gets a little bit harder here as Efrain said that keep - kind of splitting this up and allocating it out and getting really fine-tuned on everything","Danyal Hussain","Got it. And then just the question on the upcoming December 1 deadline, could you just remind us what the current penetration is of the timing and product. And then you mentioned some of these newer I guess versions, so is there any revenue uplift associated with those?","Martin Mucci","We certainly expect it to be. What we are doing is we fine tune the full product the Flex Time with more - with better more I guess I'd say more advance scheduling modules, so there is lot more flexibility to scheduling and how you do it. We've added a clock on the low end that gives you, it's a wireless clock and that's the shift time and it makes it easier to have a clock and maybe some difficult locations and has a couple of other features with it as well.","And then the Essentials is probably the biggest thing we've introduced. It's a basically a scale down version of our web- based Paychex Flex Time offering. So to make it easier for clients to get started and to have a product that doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles on it but that they need it.","So we do think there is going to be some uplift. We've seen double-digit increases in the sales. I'd say the penetration is still pretty low. So it's definitely, I'd say where we are now, you know 10% or somewhere in there little bit more, but it will lot of room to grow and our biggest opportunity I think right now is we still see 50% slightly or 50% of our clients based on our surveys or in businesses in general, small businesses that are impacted, you are not even aware of the overtime regulations.","So we think there is going to be some good sales not only this quarter, next quarter, but I think it's going to continue as the compliance requirements and maybe some push back on enforcement makes businesses realize they really got a - they got to get involved and make sure that they are recording and scheduling time appropriately.","Danyal Hussain","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment one last time on the kind of the pricing environment and I think Marty you referenced the fact that in the mid market you're seeing little bit more mid market pricing pressure. Can you maybe say whether that is at all a contributor to the downtick in the core payroll guidance, or whether it's just another factor of the bundle pricing that you referenced earlier?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I don\u2019t - on the mid market if I did - you might be misread, I didn\u2019t really feel - I don\u2019t see too much different pricing pressure there. I feel the competitive environment is pretty much the same as that has been same number of competitors and I think if anything we are feeling stronger about where we are from a mid market product than we certainly did a year or two years ago with the complete bundle product that we offer and the addition that we're constantly making almost quarterly to the HCM bundle we have for Flex.","So, we are feeling good about it. The pricing is as Efrain said still in that 2% to 4% kind of increased range. I think we are holding price pretty well particularly in that mid market and we are gaining more revenue per client based on the bundle. So we feel pretty good about it right now. I think the only thing that we see impacting that would be more of the economy in general and we don\u2019t really see any major changes there other than that businesses are getting closer to full employment and we are seeing the checks per client slow, but we expect that frankly for the last couple of years as people came back from recession.","So we feel good about the mid market and we are fully staffed, in fact we've increased more reps there than any other division in the mid market because of the product investments we've made and the opportunity we have between service and product. So you're pretty good about the mid market right now and the opportunity particularly for selling season.","James Schneider","Understand, thanks. And then maybe - can you maybe comment on the bookings environment you've seen over the past few months separately on the HRS versus the PEO side and whether those have been running kind of ahead of plan given the fact that you've been putting up little bit stronger HRS revenue growth in the current quarter than you guided too.","Martin Mucci","I think the human resource outsourcing in total, we're reaching nearly a million client employees now and between our product sets and I think that need continues to grow. So, we're feeling good about overall HR outsourcing solutions that we're providing. So I think that\u2019s going to continue.","The need as these rules keep getting more complex, whether it\u2019s time and attendance or minimum wage or ACA even for this year for many clients now starting to even pay attention that didn't last year as the rules and deadlines are really sticking this year as opposed to being delayed last year. I think that needs are going to continue to increase and will do well in that in that category.","James Schneider","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Rick Eskelsen","Hi, how are you? Thank you for taking my question. The first one is just a quick follow-up on the question related to the timing of attendance products. Can you just confirm that, that\u2019s in HRS piece of the - how you reported. So if there is an uptick, it would be in HRS.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I'd confirm two things, one is, yes it is and second, we did see an uptick.","Rick Eskelsen","Specifically from the time and attendance?","Martin Mucci","Yes, we did.","Rick Eskelsen","Okay. Then the next question is just more of a sort of a philosophical one about service versus technology, would you guys having built out your technology platform and just got the full functionality here and you\u2019re turning up the dial on some service investments, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how you view service relative to technology and the competitive differentiation there.","I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about how you think your services, a big strong differentiator. So just what, how do you view that now and what do you think the investments you\u2019re making are going to do to continue to deepen that. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Yes I think so - we\u2019ve always been very much known as a service company and our technology was really more internal that next external for the client facing in beginning about six years ago, we really ramped up the investment and technology. And I think the technology becomes part of the service story, clients want to do more themselves, they want to do it online, mobile, they want to do and how they want to do it when and where they want. ","And I think that the investments have been very balanced in both technology and service from a service perspective, the big investments, particularly the last few years have been driving now multi-product centers, so pulling our folks together to service multiple products in those bundles together driving a little bit more self service, so clients can do more things and their employees can on the web around mobile apps.","I think it\u2019s always going to be about service, it\u2019s how you define service and the service definition has become a lot more about technology and how easy it is for clients to use it, if they want to use it and when and how they want to use it. So we feel very good about the balance of investments that we\u2019ve made in technology and service and continue to make.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Marty, I wanted to ask you about, you talked about ACA and that being a benefit, I'm wondering as you look at the HRS business, how much of a benefit do you think that is and can it continue into next year or do you start comping against that next year?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think you do to some degree. Obviously, even last year the big sales opportunity was that initial push for the majority of our existing clients to say, hi, you need this and we sell it to them. We've done well there with retention in the sales last year now you\u2019re selling more to those clients that in our client base either weren't. We\u2019re not aware of it, it didn\u2019t apply to them or they just didn\u2019t bother to buy it and they're trying to get through it on their own and then new clients coming on of course that now needed we\u2019re changing.","So I think you\u2019ll see that has some impact this year because there\u2019s not as, obviously as much opportunity as last year. But, but what then on the other hand, we see time and attendance in the overtime regulations as the new opportunity not quite as big as the ACA opportunity, but I think, yes the comps will get tougher on that only but more to last year because you had that initial, I can sell a lot of clients that my existing client base that doesn't have it.","Kartik Mehta","And Efrain I know I apologize, I know I\u2019m parsing words here but I just want to make sure if you talk about checks per client not helping, was it a detractor or was it just neutral?","Efrain Rivera","It actually had a slight, a slight negative effect largely due to mix, but we\u2019ve been that\u2019s been part of the equation over the last three or four quarters - certainly last three quarters.","Kartik Mehta","And then just one last question, Marty. Advance Partner seems like that acquisition is going well, I just wanted to get your thoughts on your ability to maybe consolidate that industry more and make it a bigger part of Paychex. Is that a possibility now that you own it and just your perspective on the industry and the Paychex's ability to grow in that?","Martin Mucci","Yes, Kartik I think it is. I think there is an opportunity there that if we've seen the leadership team there and their results have been very positive and better than we've expected and as we've gotten to know that industry little bit more from the leadership team there and now getting to know the business even better, we do think there is an opportunity for more roll up there with various smaller firms, there is a tremendous amount of companies that do this on a small basis and our niche kind of oriented and I think it really benefit from a consolidation strategy there.","So we're certainly looking at that and trying to be very opportunistic and see if the evaluations are correct and I do think we have the capacity to do that and the leadership team there has capacity to do that. ","Kartik Mehta","Thanks, Marty. I appreciate it.","Operator","We have a question from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open.","Stephen Sheldon","Good morning. It's Stephen Sheldon in for Tim. First, now that Paychex Flex is out in the market and most products are on the platform. I guess where you're guiding kind of incremental investments spending at this point?","Martin Mucci","Well it continues to be into that product like when you think about I think now we are getting more probably fine tuning - when you think about time and attendance for example, we saw that the existing module is very good for mid market and more complex clients, but we had a real opportunity one of the difficulties with time and attendance is somewhat complex to get started and that tend to turns clients off sometimes.","And so we scale down and rolled out the Flex Time Essentials now just this quarter. And so I think you'll see continued investments like that. The other thing is analytics. We are getting more into data analytics and using our reporting packages to guide - to make them more flexible and easier to gain data out of the reporting packages to offer data analytics to our clients frankly of all sizes, and you'll see continued investment in analytics and reporting.","And I'd say as well, continued kind of adding more kind of bells and whistles. At the same time we're building out a simpler interface to HTML5 for all of our products and mobile first design. So everything is being designed now mobile first and so that it can be used very effectively on our mobile approximately, as well as then expand to whatever device you are using.","So more products finding niches where the product like Flex Time Essentials can be used and the design itself making it easier to use.","Stephen Sheldon","Okay. That's helpful. And then I think you touched on it little bit before, but just wanted to ask about usage of cash on this point and maybe an update on the M&A environment and the pipeline you are seeing? Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","I think earlier I answered the question on Jason might have asked about share repurchase. So we'll do share repurchases to combat some dilution that we are seeing. So that will be part of it this year and then the M&A pipeline is pretty robust. So there are number of opportunities that we see could use part of that cash or all of it.","So we are - we continue to evaluate those frequently get down the road down and then for whatever reason it doesn\u2019t look up to pretty choosy, but we think there is opportunities out there and that's why in part that cash is there.","Stephen Sheldon","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel. Sir, your line is open.","David Grossman","Hi Efrain, Marty, good morning. Just quick follow-up to one of the question I think Marty you'd mentioned in response to the Affordable Care Act, you said you were pretty much comping against that strength already this year, I just wanted to make sure that I heard that right?","Martin Mucci","I think well what we are having against is yes that big first burst last year that we had been able to sell a lot to the existing client base, that didn\u2019t have it. Basically went from no one having it to a large number of our clients having it. Now you are selling to those clients that now needed because their situation changed, they're new clients, or they just didn\u2019t bother with it last year because they thought it didn\u2019t apply to them. So, it does put a little bit of a push on us that we've got to surpass the initial growth rate last year.","David Grossman","So stated differently, I think the spirit of the other question was that going into fiscal 2018 you wouldn\u2019t really expect much of a headwinds from whatever thrust you got or incremental sales you got from the Affordable Care Act last year? ","Martin Mucci","No, not in 2018, actually more of the pressure is this year because we are selling\u2026..","David Grossman","Right, okay. And then the second question I had is, this week one of the ERP vendor mentioned that they were moving down market and I think the way they characterized this was about 250 employees. And I know that probably above your sweet spot, but I'm just curious what your views are on that segment given that it seems to be getting increasingly crowded and then if you could tie that into your comment about the use of -- the increasing focus on technology and more interaction if you will with the end user?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I heard we\u2019ve -- I'm not sure exactly who that, because I guess I haven\u2019t seen that, but there is a number of over the years that there\u2019s been a number of large players who have said, hey, I am going to come down into that below 500 market and capture that. And the issue is, usually they are very heavy in technology and complicated technology and have a hard time bringing it down to a business that has an HR Department of one to five to 10 people, and making it simple for them to use, affordable for them to use, and then being able to service them and keep the margins that they're used to.","They also tend to be much higher in software development, typically and technology only then knowing how to service those kind of clients. I think we've had obviously a track record of moving up and our -- we do feel like in the mid-market our sweet spot is certainly, anywhere from 20 to 500 in that mid-market space. We used to think it was 50 plus, but it really has come down some with the need to the business.","So it doesn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t seen much change in the competitive environment and while I'm always concerned about changing competition, we don\u2019t see anybody right now knew that\u2019s coming down, that necessarily could be that successful. But, hey, that\u2019s why we got to keep our products and service great, so that we can certainly compete with anybody.","David Grossman","Right. Can give us a sense for just kind of important the technology is versus the service, as you migrate between these different break points in terms of employees?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think the technology gets more important as a component of service when you get a 100 plus, 200 plus, because there are also we are seeing clients move more toward pushing employees to be more self service. But that\u2019s exactly where number of our investments have been going as being sure that whether it\u2019s on a mobile app for the employee of the client, or for the client itself that they can do things, they can make changes, they can view, so they are taking heat off the HR departments of these companies.","And I think so when you get a 100 plus, 200 plus, the technology is important, but you better have the service to back it up, because, well it sounds great when those employees got to do something self service, you want to have some place for them to fall back on to call and that\u2019s where I think we are very good at balancing both the technology investment and our service. Particularly now when we have added web chats, 7\/24 service, multi-product centers all those are appealing to that group that\u2019s looking for technology, but once it fall back to personalized committed service.","David Grossman","I got it. Thanks. That\u2019s actually very helpful. And just one last question. Efrain, for the headwind when do we actually anniversary that on the balance?","Efrain Rivera","That\u2019s a good question. I think we're going to -- we'll battle it most throughout the year. So I think probably somewhere in third and fourth quarter, my guess is probably more fourth quarter.","David Grossman","All right. And then it does not then it flattens out for fiscal 2018?","Efrain Rivera","David, yes, I would expect that and then every year we go through another round of seeing what\u2019s happening with unemployment rate. So we could have variability.","David Grossman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane, dialed in for Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","David Ridley-Lane","I wanted to ask about the pace of service headcount additions to support the midmarket and maybe Affordable Care Act offerings. Are you currently at the plan staffing levels, are you planning to continue to increase through the year.","Martin Mucci","Yes David, at this point we\u2019re at the planned levels, we're stepped up in all areas. And we\u2019ve got full complement of what we need we feel unless the sales pick up more than we thought, but we feel very good about where we are. We've also made some technology changes to make it easier for a client to give us the information and for us to file because there won\u2019t be - we don\u2019t expect any delay in the filing requirements this year. So we\u2019re fully staffed in and ready to handle it.","David Ridley-Lane","Got it. And then on the adoption of same day ACH payments, would that have a potential negative impact on your client float balances over time.","Efrain Rivera","I\u2019ve been asked a couple times so same day ACH if it reached widespread adoption could impact short term cash balance, probably not long-term. It also has a benefit in that you may be able to get additional fees for running very late payroll. So it's too early to tell. I would say, it\u2019s a very modest negative but that would depend on it being adopted in a widespread way.","Martin Mucci","Yes, we've really seen is - it\u2019s a benefit to our clients that have a last-minute change or something as Efrain said, there might be some revenue opportunity there. There is also a great service opportunity where someone a client makes an error needs a last-minute change, we\u2019re now able to work that through the banking system with the ACH and so we\u2019re not expecting it to be kind of like a basic payroll, where that's the norm, it\u2019s more an additional service really that we can provide.","David Ridley-Lane","Got it. And then just a quick numbers question. Does the new $350 million buyback replace deal authorization?","Martin Mucci","Yes, yes. Basically we cancelled that out in start with 350.","David Ridley-Lane","Got it. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys, good morning. First question, does the new share-based payment accounting treatment, assuredly thinking that as a discrete impact on the quarter, or is that going to be an ongoing impact of putting this and if so do you have a sense what you\u2019re expecting in the remainder of the fiscal year and moving forward.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so good question. So it is discrete and it will remain discrete when we, when we recorded in a given quarter. It could have modest impacts in subsequent quarters, we\u2019ll call it out, we don\u2019t expect that will have the level of impact that it had - that it had this quarter. So I\u2019ll just leave it at that.","Gary Bisbee","And was there sort of a catch-up impact or was this just - that there was for some reason bigger tax benefit than normal from options this quarter and now that close the P&L versus historically didn't?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, there wasn\u2019t a catch up - without getting into the weeds on the mechanics of the computation which are complex, sufficed to say that the combination of an increase in share price coupled with an increase in share exercises ended up creating a situation where we had more benefit in the quarter. And this will happen periodically throughout in the future. And we\u2019ll just call it out when it happens. We don\u2019t anticipate that it will be as sharp as it was this quarter.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, great, thanks. And then there's always a lot of questions about the payroll growth versus HR and I guess it seems to me that you alluded a couple of times that may be the distinction isn\u2019t as strong as it was in the past. But from that perspective, can you just help us understand how much of your selling efforts headcount time in the field, however you want to talk about it, its focused on upselling more components, the broader product set into a pretty sticky in large phase versus people who are out there prospecting for new payroll customers. Has that changed is it more of the focus selling more stuff in the base today than it was in the past?","Martin Mucci","I don\u2019t think is changed. Well, obviously there is lot more opportunity, but I would say you know probably if you thought about core payroll and that sales team and then the way MMS the mid market team goes after, probably 40%, 50% is still on acquiring new clients and going after them and getting them on board and then the other 50% is really there - when you think about all of HRS really they're selling into the base for the most part.","And then a number of the core and MMS payroll teams are back selling more clients - more products, but I'd say it's probably around 50-50 and I don\u2019t know if it's changed all that much.","I think they are focused though on selling the full package upfront is different. So it's a little bit different than the way I was probably you're thinking about it. We sale a lot more full package right upfront, our old style would be so payroll you get used to us, you get happy with us. Six months later I come back and see if 401(k) is value to you or workers comp or health insurance.","Now what we are finding is clients want the full value upfront. They want - they have a full need in mind and it's not just they want payroll for now and then I'll come talk to me. So we are selling more and what we call integrated sales approach where multiple teams will go and see a brand new client and sale them could be everything including HR outsourcing because that's what they really were looking for and payroll was just coming along with it.","So but I think if you say 50-50 roughly that would be fine, it just a focus is very different now for the sales team every from core right through.","Gary Bisbee","And then can you just give us an update on penetration of some of the key categories and what's getting factor to further penetrate and whether it's 401(k) or full outsource than some of the other major product categories, is it price, is it you are getting out and telling the story what can you do to drive that penetration are?","Martin Mucci","Well that's something obviously we are always looking at. I think the penetration rates are still pretty low, so lot's of opportunity there for us. I think it's a combination of all of those. It's a combination what is the client see the value and for like 401(k) for example and or do they feel the pressure from their employee base. We are feeling more clients come to us for products like insurance and 401(k) because there is - it's harder with full employment are moving towards full employment, it's harder for them to capture new employees unless they have the benefit packages that they might not have needed two years ago in order to compete for their employees.","So it's the need in the market. It's a value to the client and it's execution. Obviously, we spend a tremendous amount of time training, making sure the products are available, making sure that we have the training and all the sales force tools. We've added tremendous amount of tools to the sales force, data analytics what clients we have that are most likely to buy 401(k), most likely to buy insurance, sales force all of that tools all helped execution.","So it's a number of things, I'd say penetration rate still give us tremendous amount of opportunity. We are moving them up, but there is still lot of room to grow and I think we are putting everything in place to be successful about it.","Gary Bisbee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tian Jing Wang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tian Jing Wang","Good morning. I was going to talk to you guys. The slides - just looking at the slides it looks like on the cash the long term capital strategy page you are talking strategic accretive acquisitions. I'm curious accretive is that sort of one year sort of ambition or is it - are you telling us where we shouldn\u2019t expect any dilutive deals from there.","Efrain Rivera","I would say that's a long term issue and when I mentioned this, look if the technology is right we think there is a strategic advantage in buying a company for example SurePayroll that would not accretive we'll do it. So every deal is not going to be accretive right out of the gate, some aren\u2019t. So we are pretty tough on the criteria of dilution in the first year, but if it makes sense we look at it.","Tian Jing Wang","Understood. That's good to know. And then just on the overtime legislation, you said there was a little bit uptick in this quarter, but is there a time frame which we might expect a more significant uptick and tax rate on time and attendants?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think we actually have pretty good uptick double-digit growth in this quarter and I think it will -- my expectation would be -- it will be into the next couple of quarters that we\u2019ll continue to see sales do very well with time and attendance.","As we are getting closure to that December 1 time frame, this month, next couple of months should see probably the biggest benefit. But I think after that I think clients are really just kind of making themselves aware. But the other thing is -- there is a lot of discussion in the news about, will it be over turned, could it be push back through some court proceeding, but we don\u2019t see that happening at this point, but that could be making clients say, I'm going to wait and see how it happens.","So it should be a good year overall, certainly for time and attendance, but I think that this next quarter, this quarter and next quarter probably the best.","Tian Jing Wang","Got it. So going into and coming out of it we could see little bit of lift, that\u2019s good to know. Then just lastly just I know there is a lot of questions around payroll and HRS, but just broadly speaking for the quarter how did each of those lines come in versus your internal plan?","Efrain Rivera","They were within the range of expectation. So -- I think that\u2019s part of what we look at every quarter is and try to understand what we think trends are and adjust based on what we are seeing. You can see we didn\u2019t change our guidance on income, fine tuned revenue actually HRS services had a strong quarter. We\u2019ll see where we end up year, but overall we think we are in the range of what we expected.","Martin Mucci","And we feel good about how we are positioned; we've got fully staffed. From a sales rep standpoint, we grew pretty much all the divisions, but -- in particularly the payroll divisions and that\u2019s getting kind of these new reps -- the newer reps to get up to the production that we like to see. But we're fully staffed in that group. We're are fully staffed in the service teams to handle ACA, which was you know struggle last year just there was just so much change going on there and so we feel good that we are kind of on target for what we expected.","Tian Jing Wang ","Great. Appreciate the update.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the HRS services could you just talk about like what are the two most penetrated solutions that you are currently offering and what sort of penetration rate that has in order to give a perspective in terms of the opportunity for further cross sell?","Martin Mucci","I think the two most penetrated would probably workers comp and the insurance and 401(k), and but the biggest opportunities are still 401(k) certainly and I think we\u2019ve talked about it. We expanded the last -- roughly now two years until what we call large market 401(k). So where we focus a lot on new plans for the first almost 18 years of having the product.","The last couple of years we added a whole team which is expanded on conversion plan. So larger asset plans and that group has been doing very well particularly in first quarter we had some nice growth there. So we are building relationships with brokers who refer us now and as these rules get more complex for brokers I think they are bringing our talented kind of tenured team on the large market in the more deals. So that\u2019s very good.","So lot of opportunity in 401(k) and lot of opportunity in HR outsourcing would certainly be the next largest meaning ACA -- I am sorry, ASO, PEO and HRE or HR Essentials. So biggest opportunity as big as revenue basis and opportunities that grow I think are 401(k) and HR outsourcing by far.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And what\u2019s the penetration rate currently?","Martin Mucci","On HR outsourcing you know less than 10% and if you look at client employees, I did say that we're approaching a million worksite employees and we put out about 11 million, 12 million W-2s. So we are little less than 10% on the employees that we are servicing and not all of them will need it based on their size, but we think that their penetration rate is less than 10 and certainly has a lot of upside.","Mark Marcon","That\u2019s great color. And then with regards to -- there is clearly a greater emphasis with regards to selling more modules upfront when first sign a client. Can you give us a little bit of perspective in terms of over last couple of years how that\u2019s changed in terms of like typically we used to sell maybe three modules, with the brand new client and now we are up to five, six et cetera like what\u2019s -- what you are seeing on average with new clients, above the smallest clients that you might have just be signing up for this payroll?","Martin Mucci","I would say, it\u2019s hard to look at it, because the way we bundle it we don\u2019t think of it as quite as models, but I would say that, probably 25% of the clients to 30% of the clients are taking something maybe 20% to 30% are taking something more right now. This is relatively new approach to the way we\u2019re selling, because we\u2019ve had so many years of selling payroll then coming back. ","I think if you're asking how many do we sell a larger bundle upfront. I\u2019d say its closer; it\u2019s more in the 20% to 30% range that we\u2019re selling a bundle versus payroll only and in it has at least one additional service or module with it. I mean we\u2019ve seen the revenue per client has been, we\u2019ve been successful at driving up that revenue per client year after year. So it\u2019s probably the last couple of years. So I hope that helps.","Mark Marcon","It does. And then you mentioned checks per client not getting as much help partially due to mix, where are they -- you\u2019re not selling as many like tiny clients anymore are you? ","Efrain Rivera","We sell small, I mean we absolutely compete very well, its an interesting point Mark. So, there is a trade-off between, if you\u2019re going to go get clients you have to take them away or you have to get them new. And I think we\u2019ve been doing very -- we\u2019ve been very effective particularly in the fourth quarter of last year, we had very good unit growth. So we continue to see unit growth and there is a little bit of a trade-off between unit growth, the unit growth, we\u2019ve been seeing, which has been between 2% and 3% and size of client. So that impacts a little bit. It has a little bit of a drag on growth in the short term not in long-term. ","Mark Marcon","And tiny, I was talking like the sub six employee?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, yes, Mark, absolutely, but a lot of new clients are in that category, absolutely.","Martin Mucci","Remember, we're still get great referrals from CPAs and so forth. And so we\u2019re still seeing 50% of the sales are coming from brand-new businesses, and Efrain said a lot of those brand new businesses are sub six.","Mark Marcon","Okay, great. And then client retention, I didn\u2019t hear any comments there.","Martin Mucci","Yes, still feeling very good about it. We\u2019re right on plan. It\u2019s remained at pretty much close to highest levels of client retention. So right now we feel very good about it. It was a good quarter, continued right through from last year.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then lastly on just the strategic acquisitions, you mentioned maybe it was -- maybe I misheard, but I thought I heard you say potentially could use all of the cash. Is that, I mean, that sounds unusual relative to what you\u2019ve done in the past?","Efrain Rivera","No, I guess, what I was saying, Mark, is that we have opportunities in the pipeline that could use all of the cash. It doesn\u2019t mean we have an opportunity that\u2019s going to use all of the cash.","Mark Marcon","I mean that would not be the expectation.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, that would not be the expectation.","Mark Marcon","Great. Thanks for clarifying. Congrats.","Operator","Next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. ","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me. Just wanted to follow up on the comments related to the Accountable Care Act. Now that you\u2019re into the first quarter, I know there\u2019s been a lot of debate about whether this year is going to continue to be strong in Obamacare as companies that didn\u2019t choose to comply last year due this year versus whether they\u2019re sort of a hangover effect or not. So how are you feeling about that now that you\u2019re a few months in?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so we\u2019re -- I think the point was, Lisa, that just that last year, it was kind of that first chance to go after the entire client base, nobody basically have the product. There are a very few, and so we\u2019re able to sell a lot in the particularly in the first few quarters of the year. And now when you anniversary that, we\u2019re still selling the product, but there\u2019s not as much opportunity there. ","So I think then the question was what does it look for 2018? 2018 won\u2019t be much of an issue because I think we\u2019ll be very consistent with 2017 to 2018. But 2016 to this year, 2017, there is some impact that we\u2019re not selling as much. On the other hand, we\u2019re selling more of the time and attendance solutions, but their revenue is not quite as much -- the opportunity is not quite as much there. ","And it\u2019s not as probably as far-reaching or as demanding or as creating as much angst with clients as the Affordable Care Act was because of the penalty situation. Now the overtime stuff could start to pick up if enforcement picks up as well. But I think that\u2019s just going to take a little bit longer. So again, it\u2019s having some impact versus last year, but it\u2019s not a huge thing, but it\u2019s having some impact.","Lisa Ellis","Yes. And are there other regulatory changes or rules on the horizon that you would call out like that you see sort of steady pipeline of these real thing considered either at the federal level or in certain states that would kind of continue to drive the incremental secular demand from the regulatory changes?","Martin Mucci","Yes, there hasn\u2019t been - there has been a steady flow based on current administration and probably won't change much in the election which could have some impact, but minimum wage for example right now it's extremely confusing for our clients minimum wage rules are different by state, the Feds talk about changing minimum wage they have for government, but some of those are in that tied into government, but states are different, cities are different and we really help a lot of our clients help - we help them through our payroll service only or our HR outsourcing to stay up with minimum wage changes because not only are they are not changing ones they are changing over period of years and you have to make sure that you stay current with those.","And there is a lot of work on identifying like who is a the kind of immigration type things, who is - you got to know your customer, you got to know your employees, you got to make sure you got all that well documented.","So the rules keep coming, I don\u2019t think that helps necessarily the business environment in general because of over regulation, but it certainly gives Paychex a lot of opportunities to go and talk to clients about their payroll need and their HR outsourcing need, because small to midsized business is just can't keep it up with all of these changes.","The other thing is that enforcement and the penalty have increased as states and federal governments have looked for revenue sources. So not only is there an issue about whether you are compliant, but if you are challenged on your compliance, we can provide a tremendous amount of help. If you get a penalty in payroll, if you get a penalty for a time issue - a time and attendance issue, we're there to support you with expert documentation and background and relationships with federal state and local governments and that's a big plus that we sell to clients, but they don\u2019t realize sometimes until they are hit with an audit or enforcement penalty.","Lisa Ellis","Got it. And then just one final follow-up. I think the last couple of quarters you called out the dynamic in the client base that's been interesting, I think overall average employees per client have been slightly trending down due to the strength in SurePayroll and there is new business formation on the low end, but then at the same time your mid market offerings have been performing well. So it's almost like Barbell kind of effect, or you continuing to see that sort of trend in the client base or anything else like you called out?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, let me just provide little more color on that. Yes, if you look at average client size is down very, very slightly that has an impact but you are right the difficulty is you can't see that completely in payroll, so if you look at our mid market platform taken as a whole including the module that are typically sold with our HR online and time and attendance, you see nice growth over the last two or three years.","Payroll has done fine too, but it has a little bit of that headwind because of slightly lower client size driven by some positive which is increasing client growth. So, we've gone from growing the client base of 1% to growing between 2% and 3%, hopefully that continues to grow.","The reason why we are not as concerned about that is that those clients eventually become larger and purchase more services. So we want to keep the funnel reasonably open at the top.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thank you. Good clarification. Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ariel Hughes from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Ariel Hughes","Hi, Good morning. This is Ariel Hughes. Can you provide us with some color around the correlation between rate increases and float income, specifically around the expected lag time between rate and floating from increases? Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Typically you're going to see at least one if not sometime two quarter to reflect full impact of the rate increase and then we quantify in the Q or in the K at least that the impact of 25 basis points translates into about $3.5 million to $4 million on an annual basis. So that's kind of the thought process that we have.","Ariel Hughes","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question in queue comes from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. ","Glenn Greene","Thanks for squeezing me in. Two questions clarifications really on earlier discussion. So first is on the ACA dynamic from last year into this year. I guess I\u2019m little confused if you\u2019re talking about sales bookings benefit last year or revenue benefit and yes I\u2019m a little confused as how quickly these things convert. And the order of magnitude what we\u2019re talking about is, was there sort of a revenue benefit last year that you're now lapping and is overemphasizing this.","Martin Mucci","No, just that that\u2019s sales. I\u2019m sorry, just to be clear, glad you asked the clarifying question, that from a revenue standpoint it\u2019s sales perspective. So I\u2019m just saying that we had a big sales impact last year \u2013 we've had a good sales impact last year as we sold the client base, but this year so sales have come down some in the ACA product itself. The revenue because the retention of the clients has been fine and so and there hasn't been any price change really associated with that product or anything else.","Glenn Greene","So I guess the natural follow-on is the magnitude of the revenue benefit that you\u2019re realizing in fiscal '17 related to that.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so Glenn I was asked this periodically during the year, we got about a point benefit last year on revenue from additional ACA, ACA revenue and obviously we're anniversarying that and it\u2019s incorporated in the guidance and are dealing with that, that's slight drag and particularly in HRS.","Glenn Greene","Okay. And then I know Efrain you went through this in great detail and I appreciate, I know you want to have clarity out there, and I hate you go back to the guidance but I can tell there is still something huge and so I\u2019m going to be specific. So what you\u2019re talking about is take the reported fiscal '16 net income or roughly $757 million well at 7% and then just for sake of argument, we can argue with the fully diluted share account but just using this quarter at 364, we\u2019re talking 222 to 223 in EPS and maybe you get some benefit from share repurchase.","Efrain Rivera","Yes it depends on what your assumptions are around shares et cetera. But yes, you\u2019re right.","Glenn Greene","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","And the reason is maybe I'm being too helpful. You\u2019re going to have a set of reported numbers last year. We're going to have a set of reported numbers this year. I can't give you guidance this year that now excludes one thing in one year and another thing in another year. I could have just done it and say, hey, it is as it is. But my concern is someone's not going to pick up a number that they should. The other thing I would just say is that we want to stir as much away from providing guidance that's not on a GAAP basis, so that\u2019s why we try to clarify stuff.","Glenn Greene","So one last thing, so the lower tax rate, the 35% that you now sort of alluded to in your guide, is that the good run rate to think about obviously beyond fiscal '17?","Efrain Rivera","35% no, Glenn, because we\u2019ve got a benefit in the first quarter. So that\u2019s why you - if you remember our guide at the beginning of - in the fourth quarter we guided to 35.5% to 36%. That's a better number than the 35%. The 35% benefits from this one-time benefit we got in Q1, which is from the one-time benefit we got the prior year.","Glenn Greene","It makes sense. Okay. I got it, thank you very much.","Operator","Speakers, we show no questions in queue.","Martin Mucci","All right. Thank you, Jim. Well, at this point, we'll close the call. I just want you to know that we appreciate the interest in questions. We feel very good. As we said, we\u2019re staffed up and ready. We\u2019ve increased our sales force. We feel good about the product and the technology and service investments we've made, and I think we\u2019re off to very consistent and good start.","At this point, we\u2019ll close the call. And if you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. Our annual meeting of stockholders will be held on Wednesday, the 12th, October 12 at 10 a.m. in Rochester. And that meeting will be broadcast simultaneously over the Internet as well.","Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex.

If anyone has any objections you may disconnect. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Martin Mucci. You may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's fiscal 2014 year-end performance. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. ","Yesterday afternoon after the market closed we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2014. We expect to file our Form 10-K by the end of July. Our earnings press release is available by accessing our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about a month.","On today's call I will review the highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 in operations, sales and product development areas. Efrain will review our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2015 guidance, and then we'll open it up for your questions.","We are pleased with our solid financial performance during fiscal 2014. Efrain will speak to this in more detail. However I would like to provide you some of the highlights from my view. Our payroll service revenue reached the top of our guidance range, driven by progress in revenue per check, client-based growth in checks per payroll. HRS revenues rose at double-digit rate in the fourth quarter with strong demand for our human resource outsourcing solutions and our 401(k) record keeping product. In fact we were recently recognized by Plansponsor Magazine for the fourth quarter consecutive year as the largest 401(k) record keeper by number of plans. We\u2019re very proud of that and proud of our sales and operations teams in 401(k) among the other groups. ","Our payroll client base finished the year at approximately 580,000 payroll clients, an increase of approximately 2% from the prior year. This is an improvement over the fiscal 2013 client gain. Our checks per payroll has improved for 17 consecutive quarters. Fourth quarter growth was 1.1%. Sales performance during 2014 was strong and we exited the year with solid performance in core payroll and Paychex HR Outsourcing solutions in particular. Our new sales annualized revenue growth frankly reached the highest level it has in seven years. We\u2019re very proud of the sales team and the leadership.","Our execution in operations also continued to be excellent, demonstrated by our consistently high client satisfaction scores and our exceptional client service coupled with our leading edge technology and products, we really believe sets us apart from our competitors. The dedication of our service team resulted in our best year ever in client retention at approximately 82% of our beginning payroll client base. ","We continue to invest in our SaaS, software-as-a-service solutions and mobility offerings that position us for long term growth. We\u2019re experiencing an increased demand for SaaS solutions across our client base. This month we acquired a leading cloud-based time and attendance solution provider. Our online time and attendance offerings have experienced strong sales over the last few years demonstrating the high market demand for these offerings and contributing to the success of all our online HR administration products.","The addition of market leader nettime\u2019s SaaS time and attendance products and development team will further accelerate our ability to deliver the latest cloud-based time and attendance functionality coupled with our HR and payroll solutions. Just last week we also announced the release of our new Paychex\u2019s accounting online mobile app for the iPhone. The universal iOS app allows users to access their Paychex accounting online account from their iPad, iPhone or iPod touch to keep track of their business finances anywhere and anytime.","In the past few quarters I have talked about the roll-out of new products designed to help our clients manage the compliance requirements of healthcare reforms. This includes our Paychex employers share responsibility service, a more robust monitoring service and our Paychex benefit account. These products while new to the market represent an opportunity for us as we\u2019re uniquely positioned as both a payroll provider and insurance agency to help our small businesses with these regulations. ","The frequent changes in the rules has caused some clients to delay decisions on purchasing products or making decisions under health plans in the short term. However we continue to see healthcare reform as an opportunity as we\u2019re able to provide clients with information and keep them updated on the latest compliance and requirements. We continue to strength our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to our clients, small and midsize businesses and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients along with CPAs and other interested parties with the impact of regulatory changes. ","The Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., website helps small business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage and both this website and Paychex.com have sections dedicated to the topic of healthcare reform. ","During the fourth quarter in conjunction with IHS we launched the Paychex IHS Small Business Jobs Index. This monthly Index examines the state of small business employment in the U.S. and provides information on macroeconomic trends. By measuring aggregated small business payroll data from a subset of our small business client base the Index identifies and tracks small business employment growth and provides timely, accurate insight in to employment trends. We are encouraged by the recent results of the Index which have shown a trend of sustained moderate growth in employment for those companies under 50 employees. ","We\u2019ve continued our shareholder friendly actions as well. We\u2019ve maintained a very competitive dividend yield with our current quarterly dividend at $0.35 per share and we\u2019ve also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired approximately six million shares of common stock in fiscal 2014. In May our Board approved a new plan to repurchase stock up to 350 million shares -- $350 million worth of shares of Paychex common stock with the authorization expiring in May of \u201817.","In summary I am extremely proud of our employees\u2019 efforts on behalf of our clients and our shareholders. They have continued to deliver great solutions, high client satisfaction and record levels of client retention. We\u2019ve a solid leadership team that is clearly focused on sales and service execution, technology innovation and product expansion to drive our plans in fiscal 2015.","Our service revenue has increased over $400 million in over the last three years versus very little growth over the previous three. And even with accelerated product investment and innovation we\u2019ve maintained the industry leading operating margins. We\u2019re clearly focused on growth by providing our clients, the service and products that will help them succeed in their small and midsize businesses.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Marty and good morning. I would like to remind everyone that during today's conference call we'll make forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risks. Refer to our press release, that includes a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors, the customary disclosure. ","As Marty indicated Paychex delivered solid results in fiscal 2014 and just as importantly metrics improved across almost every category we looked at. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter and fiscal \u201914 and then I\u2019ll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of the 2015 outlook.","We introduced new health insurance offering within our PEO during fiscal 2014. Due to self-insurance provisions within the new offering we began classifying certain PEO direct costs as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. The change had no impact on net income, a supplemental schedule was added to the press release to show the impact of the classification change on the fiscal 2014 results of operations. ","For this discussion of fiscal 2014 results I'm going to provide growth percentages that exclude the impact of these adjustments in order to focus on the business drivers and what\u2019s currently in your models. In future periods all discussions will use results reflecting this change in classification. ","Total service revenue grew 6% for both the quarter and the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the fourth quarter and decreased 1% for the fiscal year to $10 million and $41 million respectively. Low interest rates were partly offset by an increase in average investment balances. Expenses increased by 4% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the fiscal year. The increase was mainly in compensation-related cost with higher wages and higher performance-based comp. Wages were impacted by our investment in product development and supporting technology and new sales initiatives implemented in fiscal 2013. ","Operating margin was 35.9% for the fourth quarter and a robust 38.7% for fiscal 2014. Operating income net of certain items increased 8% to $218 million for the fourth quarter and 9% to $942 million for fiscal 2014. We are closing in on the $1 billion mark for EBIT and should surpass that next year. Operating margin is typically lower as you know in the second half of the year. ","Net income growth increased 18% to $146 million for the fourth quarter and 10% to $628 million for the fiscal year. Remember that and I\u2019ve seen this in a couple of notes that there\u2019s an implication to the guidance somehow we decelerated from this year but you need to remember that we took a $0.04 write-off in the fourth quarter of last year and that is what\u2019s causing the fourth quarter to look high. ","Diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.40 per share for the fourth quarter and increased 10% to $1.71 per share for fiscal 2014. And I would just point out again that these numbers include the fact that we took -- increased our provision for state income tax matter in the fourth quarter. ","Looking at payroll revenues, payroll service revenue, it increased 3% for the fourth quarter and 4% for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in revenue per check, client base and checks per payroll. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases partially offset by discounting coupled with the impact of increased product penetration. As Marty already mentioned our checks per payroll metric continued to improve and our client base increased approximately 2% from May 31, 2013. So the rate of growth on improvement in the client base accelerated this year.","The payroll service revenue rate of growth was lower in the fourth quarter and this was a result as I mentioned throughout the year, one less payroll processing day compared to the same period in the prior year. The estimated impact on payroll revenue growth in the quarter was approximately 1% based on that lack of a day. ","HRS revenue, point out that during the year we upped guidance on HRS revenue and in the fourth quarter we grew 10%, to $213 million and 12% to $832 million for the fiscal year. Both were at the top end or the yearly guidance was at the top end of the range as Marty mentioned. ","We continued to experience rapid growth in both our ASO and PEO as well as in our online HR administration products. Paychex HR solutions experienced solid growth in clients and client employees served. You\u2019ll notice that we did the disclosure, including the press release, we are up to almost 800,000 clients served and it won't be too long before we're talking about 1 million clients served by our products. ","Our PEO experienced strong demand during fiscal 2014. HR administration products continued to grow due to success in sales of SaaS solutions, in particular for our time and our attendance products. Retirement services revenue benefited from growth in number of plans, as Marty mentioned our recent recognition and an increase in the average asset value of retirement services, client employees\u2019 funds. Insurance services revenue growth reflected higher average premiums in worker's comp insurance services. We have also experienced a modest increase in the number of health and benefit applicants. ","Turning to our investment portfolio our long-term portfolio which is primarily made up of high credit quality municipal bonds is an average yield currently of about 1.6% and an average duration of three years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of nine-tenths of a point for the fourth quarter and 1% for fiscal 2014 consistent with the same period last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year due to growth in checks per payroll and client base and wage inflation. For the fiscal year average balances also benefited from the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on December 31, 2012 which resulted in higher social security withholdings. ","I'll now walk you through highlights of our financial position that remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $937 million and no debt. That 937 is despite the fact that if you've read the press release that we spent $250 million in the year buying back shares. So we had a really strong year from a cash flow perspective, you can see that on the statement of cash flows. And I would say our financial strength is second to none. ","Funds held for clients as of May 31, 2014 were $4.2 billion compared to $4.1 billion as of May 31, 2013. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.9 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of about 4%. Total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $35 million as of May 31, 2014. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $1.8 billion as of May 31, 2014 reflecting $511 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Dividends paid represented 81% of net income on return on equity for the past 12 months with 35%.","Cash flows from operations, as I mentioned, were $881 million for the fiscal year, up 30% increase compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net income, higher non-cash adjustments in net income largely due to higher amortization on premiums available for sales securities and changes in operating assets and liabilities.","The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll and income taxes, fluctuations in income tax payments related to the settlement of a state tax matter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. ","Now turning to 2015 guidance, I would like to remind you that our outlook for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 is based on current view of economic and interest rate continuing with no significant changes. Our guidance for 2015 is as follows; payroll service revenue projected increase in a range of 3% to 5%; projected growth is based on anticipated client-based growth and increases in revenue per check. ","HRS is expected to be in the range of 16% to 19%. This and total service revenue reflect change in classification of certain PEO direct cost as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. There is no impact in net income from the change. The impact of the change in classification and HRS revenue will add approximately 5% of the HRS revenue growth rate. The HRS revenue growth rate by quarters impacted by the classifications of PEO direct cost as we did not begin on new health insurance offering until January of 2014. I am going to come back to that. It\u2019s very important as you look at your models that you understand that implication. HRS revenue growth also includes additional revenue from 401(k) plan restatements that are periodically required by law.","Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 8% to 10%. The impact of the change in PEO classification adds approximately 2% to the service revenue growth rate. Operating income net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to be in the range of 37% to 38% for fiscal 2015. Again this is based on the PEO changes to revenue. That\u2019s why that number is lower than it was last year, so it does not imply any deterioration in our operating margins. Net income is expected to increase in the range of 6% to 8%.","Our operating income, net of certain items as a percent of service revenues is expected to be between 37% and 38%. The PEO direct cost impacted by the reclassification are all reported in operating expenses. As you update your models I\u2019ll have more to say about that in a second. Effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 is expected to be consistent with the rate we experienced in 2014. And interest on funds is anticipated to be relatively flat compared to fiscal 2014. Don\u2019t expect it to be above it, don\u2019t expect it to be significantly below it.","And then while we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance the PEO impact to revenue requires further detail for you to accurately update your models. At the close of this call we will post a schedule on the website detailing quarterly HRS revenue growth expectations for fiscal 2015 as well as operating income margin due to the PEO reclassification. You need to look at that schedule to understand how to get the quarters right. The effects on revenue and margin are going to vary by quarter. The effects will be more marked in the first two quarters and then more attenuated in the back half because the plans that we put in place started in January in the PEO. So you should consult the schedule as you update your models. I'm happy to answer any questions you have and I\u2019ll try to get to you if you want to call me today, happy to get to you quickly. ","And finally we anticipate the first quarter earnings growth will be modest due to investments in IT and sales force growth, and what happened was, compared to last year, we start the year at a higher rate of spending in IT than we did in the first quarter of last year. That\u2019s because we continue to make significant investments in IT and also we were adding to the sales force. As the year progressed we continue to add to the sales force. We anticipate that we will be up approximately 5% in the sales force this year. We like what we\u2019re seeing and feel now\u2019s the time to invest. So with that I will turn it back over to Marty. ","Martin Mucci","Okay thank you Efrain and now operator if you will open the meeting to any questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And the first question comes from David Togut with Evercore. Your line is open. ","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Thank you, good morning Marty and Efrain. ","Martin Mucci","","Hi, David. ","Efrain Rivera","Good morning.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Marty you indicated that FY\u201914 new sales, annualized revenue growth was the highest in seven years. Can you quantify for us what the sales growth was?","Martin Mucci","Dave, we don\u2019t normally give that detail. I will just tell you that what we\u2019ve seen has just continued to accelerate kind of throughout the year as we -- and we ended very strong in new sales revenue growth. And I think you know a few years ago we were fairly flat in the total annualized revenue that we were producing in sales and it\u2019s started to pick up last year, and it\u2019s continued to pick-up again this year and it is the best we\u2019ve seen really since recession times, pre-recession.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Can you maybe just bracket for us what the range might be, are you talking about mid-singles, high-singles, low-doubles?","Efrain Rivera","It\u2019s in advance of our revenue growth. So that\u2019s what we look at.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Got it, and then with the new fiscal year kicking off can you quantify what your pricing strategy is in payroll for FY\u201915, did you already put through the price increase?","Efrain Rivera","We do tend to do that somewhere around this time. I won\u2019t say exactly the date. Most of you actually know it. But I think our pricing view is what we\u2019ve said -- we\u2019re in that range of 2% to 4%. ","David Togut - Evercore Partners","And what do you expect that to be net of discounts this year, ballpark? ","Efrain Rivera","In the range. Sorry to be too coy. ","Martin Mucci","It's a little early but I think based on what we've seen last year and this year we don't -- it's early right now on the feedback on that but I would say to the low to the mid-part of that range. ","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Do you expect client count growth to approximate what it was in FY\u201914 or to increase based on the pipeline? ","Efrain Rivera","Well hey look, it is July hard to believe. I think we would like it at least to equal this but our expectation, it will be better yeah. ","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Got it and just\u2026","Efrain Rivera","On that point I will say this that we exited the year in the fourth quarter at a nice clip. So we feel pretty good about where we're at, where we're starting the year. ","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Got it, and just a quick final question. Efrain you highlighted the strong tax spending expected in FY\u201915, can you quantify for us the growth in tax spending this year and perhaps if you could touch on what your top couple of priorities are for that spending? ","Efrain Rivera","On the priorities I will knock it back to Marty but I would say if you go back two or three years we were saying we were growing at close to 20% in some years. If you look at where we are in the last six years we've doubled the total amount of spend in the company. I mean it's a part of the fundamental changes company has undergone, our rate of spend now is essentially twice what it was when we entered the recession. That was a deliberate strategy -- we are, we understand this is a technology-enabled service business and that going forward we need to continue to spend at that sustained level. That doesn't imply an increase from where we're spending currently. It just implies that we continue to spend at a pretty significant rate and then, and the thing I am most proud of is that we do that and we expand margins which is pretty extraordinary.","So and we think we still have an opportunity to do that. So I won't detail exactly what we spend, it was certainly solidly double digit and each one of those decisions around spending on tech is hard fought but I think that an emphasis that the company has created over the last six or seven years is significant investments in IT because that's the cost of being in this business. So I'll turn it over to Marty. ","Martin Mucci","Yes, I\u2019d say on the product overall it's integration and performance, so very broad spectrum of products that we have through both development and acquisition and our work has continued to be on integrating that. We've made a lot of strides in that. We just continue to keep -- trying to make it easier and easier for our clients that use the multitude of products.","And then when we do that as well as the integration and simplicity of using all the products is the speed and the performance and we just keep up in the -- what were the goals of what we're trying to do there and we've had some nice success. Of course the mobility and so forth as well everything just keeps moving. We don\u2019t build anything without going right back at it to make it faster and more integrated and easier to use.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Much appreciated. Thanks for taking my questions. ","Martin Mucci","Great, thanks. ","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ryan Cary - Jefferies & Co.","Hey guys, this is Ryan Cary for Jason. Quick question on checks for payroll, I know in the past you had mentioned expectation that checks for payroll will moderate in the second half of '14, is the 1.1% growth you saw in the fourth quarter kind of more or less than you expected? And then going forward should we expect the first half of '15 to return to the first half of '14 levels or more consistent with the current run rate kind of like that 1%, is that going to be the new normal? ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah -- so second question, second - same as the first, 1% is about what we expected and we quite frankly could see it moderate a little bit from where we are at this point, going in to next year. We don't expect it to pop up and with the launch of our Small Business Index I think we look at that data even more closely than we did before. And trends just seem to be slowly kind of plugging along at that rate. ","Martin Mucci","That's kind of unchartered territories but after recession it continues to be kind of sustained, moderate growth in employment. So it's not going to be big jump back, it's been a slow and steady so to actually keep the growth in checks this long has been very different. So we continue to expect that to moderate but the hiring does seem to continue, so that\u2019s good news. ","Ryan Cary - Jefferies & Co.","Okay, great. And as we think about the quarterly progression results going into \u201915 are there are any quarters we should be aware of that have either more or fewer processing days that can impact comps either direction?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, thanks good question. The answer is no, thankfully I exhausted all my day\u2019s explanation but stay tuned for fiscal \u201916, we\u2019ll talk about it then. ","Ryan Cary - Jefferies & Co.","Okay, and just lastly from me, I was hoping you could provide an update on the progress with payment processing offering. How has the update been compare to your expectations I\u2019d love any color on kind of how the rollout is going and your thoughts about the business going forward.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, it started slow and what we found was using a lot of the field payroll forces, the sales forces, to sell it became a little more complex than we thought because of the complexity of the pricing. And so what we did was last year around half way through the year we brought it inside so it\u2019s referred from the outside sales force and now is sold primarily over the telephone and that has really started to pick up some traction. So it\u2019s still early and very small from our standpoint but it\u2019s really picking up good traction now by selling it. We\u2019re a dedicated team who understands the details of the pricing per client. It actually has even given us some payroll leads where we\u2019ve sold payment processing saved the clients in dollars and actually been referred to other products and sold other products to them. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. Finally it\u2019s really starting to build some traction and more to come on that. ","Ryan Cary - Jefferies & Co.","Great, appreciate the color guys. ","Efrain Rivera","Thanks. ","Operator","Next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","Hi this is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Brian Keane. A quick question on the guidance. Last year I believe when you gave the guidance the range was within a percentage. This time you\u2019ve given a 2% range. I was just wondering if there has been any change in your guidance philosophy.","Efrain Rivera","No, not really. I think it doesn\u2019t imply more volatility. On the HRS side we went to three points simply because attachment rates on some of the other -- on healthcare can sometimes vary but we thought just to keep it more consistent. We\u2019re obviously pegging at the middle of the guidance, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing but the future is uncertain and we put those ranges represented what -- where we could end up. ","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","Okay actually just a quick follow up on that, you mentioned you\u2019re pegging it to the middle of the range but just wondering because at the low end of the range it would imply a slowdown in the growth rate but given that payroll is improving, small business sentiments are improving what will take you to the low versus high end of the range?","Efrain Rivera","Unforeseen factors that at this point we don\u2019t see. You never know, I will say that if you saw two years ago we guided to, I believe at that time it was around 3% to 4% in payroll. We ended up at 2% and I spent three quarters trying to explain a multitude of external factors that everyone assumed were competition when they weren\u2019t. So that stuff can come up. Q3 was a great example so suddenly we end up with some pretty bad storms and it becomes more complicated. So stuff like that can happen, so we trying to kind of create a more all-weather scenario for where we think our results will be but in the absence of those we don\u2019t anticipate being at the low end of the range. ","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks for the color. Quickly on -- when we add up the number of the customer growth of 2% and then checks per client of roughly 1, 1.3 and pricing increases they don\u2019t add up to the revenue growth and I was wondering is that also related to the mix in the sense SurePayroll or if you could help us parse out what the customer growth how much is driven by SurePayroll versus the core payroll growth and if the mix also has some impact?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, mix has some impact but I think you can\u2019t just add it, I\u2019ve mentioned this to people repeatedly checks don\u2019t add up, one for one. So 1% checks doesn\u2019t equate to 1% revenue. There\u2019s mix within checks so that might equate to 33% of that 50% or sometimes a little bit more. ","Second, client growth is achieved over the course of the year. So you can add two it at best is half of that, right, because it\u2019s a weighted average during the year and then you got to figure out pricing. So we feel pretty good, we saw growth across all the segments that we thought should grow in core. And I would say this for people who wonder about that issue, if you look at our data, if you look at our data over since 2011 and you look at our revenue retention, we've grown 200 basis points in revenue retention. You saw client retention at its highest level, Marty didn\u2019t talk too much about that, but client retention currently is at its highest level. But our revenue retention is at its highest level too. So we feel pretty good about where we're at.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","That's great. One final question from me was the HRS, the growth slowed down a bit in the fourth quarter. Was that mostly tough comps or were there any other factors? ","Efrain Rivera","It was primarily tough comps. We had a really, really strong Q3 and actually last year we had a real strong Q4. So a little bit tougher comp, it was really not too much else going there. ","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks for the color. ","Operator","Next question is from Sara Gubins with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you. Are you seeing any change in the average client size for payroll services? You talked about that being about I think it's was around 17 or so before, is that changing at all? ","Efrain Rivera","Hey, I am going update that Sara, it looks like we skewed a little bit higher this year. ","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. ","Efrain Rivera","So we\u2019ll update it. I don't have the exact number in but our preliminary data would suggest we were up closer to 18, but we'll get that info out. ","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Do you think that there is, I might be pushing this a little bit but do you think that there is anything related to the strong growth in HR services as I would assume that there would be a greater propensity to buy from slightly larger clients?","Martin Mucci","May be a little bit but I will tell you that what we're finding is that we're definitely selling more of the products, even more of the products down market. Things are -- everything is coming down and it's giving us a nice opportunity to sell to the even the under 20 space many more products. So I wouldn't say it's probably that because what we're finding is these products are even selling more down below 20.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great and then just last question on share count. Could you may be help us think through the balance between the share purchases that you did over the course of the year and not seeing the share count decline close to that magnitude, just talk about the issuance? ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah good question. So I guess the way I\u2019d characterize it is this way is if you look at Q4 our share count finally went down in Q4. So vis-\u00e0-vis Q4 last year and this year you started to see it come down. We had a fair -- when the stock ran from let's say 30, low 30s up to 45 we had a lot of exercises in pent up demand because there was a significant amount of shares still out there. So we had about 3.3 or so million dollars of projects, 3.3 million shares that were exercised. ","So long story short we saw that and we wanted to buy the offset dilution and that's why you don\u2019t see necessarily a significant reduction in the number of shares. ","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. ","Efrain Rivera","Sure. ","Operator","Next is from Joseph Foresi with Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Martin Mucci","Hi, Joe.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets","","Hi, good morning. This is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to see on the margin side I think Efrain you had mentioned you are expecting sales force to increase about 5%. I just want to see how that ended up with how the year ended and just want to see how when we think about your guidance for margins should we assume some SG&A to increase as a percentage of revenue and there is still to be some operating leverage with respect to operating expenses? ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so I would say this, it's going to be lumpy in the first half of the year and you are going to have to look at the schedule we've got because it's very difficult to talk about leverage, Jeff without referring to that schedule. It won't look like there is leverage it looks like we're deleveraging and you are going to see that really frankly through the first three quarters and then you start to level out a bit in Q4.","So you got to look at that schedule. If you look at it and you don't have the data but if you were to look at it without that yes you would see some leverage, it would be modest. We've made a decision that probably cost us approximately a penny to increase, put more into and increasing the sales force. We thought that made sense and so we decided that investment was the right one to do. ","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, thanks and maybe just, could I get some additional color on the SaaS kind of penetration that you\u2019ve seen recently and I was also wondering, I think you Marty had mentioned that there\u2019s still some like slow decision makings on healthcare-related plans. I just want to see if that changed at all in the last few months, I think maybe some more commentary was given three months ago, just wanted to see have you seen any changes going forward? Thanks. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah I\u2019ll start on the healthcare one, I think we\u2019ve continued to see that. I think particularly that may happen through the summer, until you get more closer to the fall as benefit plans starts rolling out and people start seeing rates and so forth for January 1st for starts. I think what we\u2019re finding is just there\u2019s been so many changes in healthcare reform and dates that the clients are more kind of like sitting back a little bit, so even though we had the products out pretty early we are getting some traction on the products because it\u2019s clients have to start to understand right now what changes they may have to make in part time, full time when they hire the next person, what kind of impact that\u2019s going to have to them particularly if they\u2019re around the 50 mark. ","And so I think it\u2019s kind of picked up a little bit towards the end of the summer but it still been slower than we expected and I think that\u2019s because of the changes. So haven\u2019t seen a lot of change there. On the SaaS it continues to increase. We don\u2019t really give a percentage but you can see everything we\u2019re doing pretty much is in investment is in SaaS. The acquisition in nettime was also for SaaS. So we\u2019re seeing a big pickup in SaaS-related products for the HR services and support, HR administration, benefit enrollment, time and attendance, expense tracking, everything frankly that we offer is pretty much now on a SaaS basis and that we\u2019re seeing a large pick-up on it. So that will just continue to grow and frankly it won\u2019t even be a discussion of non-SaaS, it will be just SaaS. ","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets","Thank you. ","Martin Mucci","Okay. ","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Martin Mucci","Hi Gary. ","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, just want to understand exactly why the accounting change or the change in how you\u2019re presenting the data you\u2019re not taking any insurance risk, there is nothing like that that forces you to recognize this. I'm assuming and if that\u2019s right and why make this change? Thank you. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah so Gary let me just explain this. And without again going too far down a hole with the way you account for a cost in the PEO, we, in certain markets decided that it made sense for us to go to something called the minimum premium plan where your risk is capitated but you do take some risk based on the book. And within the PEO and most PEOs do risk you were taking risk also on worker\u2019s comp. So you have to do some underwriting, you have to be pretty good at underwriting to do it. That is not all of our PEO plans but it is some of them. When we did that, that tipped us to now represent those -- that portion of the revenue as gross, essentially include the cost of insurance. So I would say yes we do take a bit more risk but it\u2019s capped. ","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Okay and so you would have an insurance provider that would be offering you like the equivalent of you would be capped out at a number per current, right okay all right, should we think about this as something that might modestly increase the volatility or are you pretty confident in the underwriting in the history of the data such that you have a strong ability to predict this?","Martin Mucci","Which volatility, top line or bottom line?","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Well I mean if there is ever a difference between what the actual insurance costs are relative to what you forecast? Because you\u2019re taking more risk\u2026 ","Martin Mucci","So let me take, yeah -- thanks for the question because I think it\u2019s a great question. So the short answer is it really shouldn\u2019t have a dramatic impact on income unless you really don\u2019t do your homework and start taking risk that are inappropriate. So I think we understand one of the really terrific stories over the last three years is that if you remember the calls we were having three, four years ago, about how the PEO wasn\u2019t doing well. Behind the scenes we decided that we needed to put a major effort against fixing it and we did. ","So we do a really good job now of understanding what our risks are in a PEO. So you shouldn't see significant amounts of fluctuation based on earnings but the rates of attachment of all these plans can't swing sometimes, the top line. So you could have a little bit more volatility on the top line. That's why we called out in a schedule that we're publishing shortly what the revenue will look like. It will even out as we get into next year. So you could see a little bit more top line volatility but shouldn't dramatically affect the bottom line. ","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great, that's helpful. And then just a follow up question, can we get a sense of the mix of the good new sales performance in fiscal '14 and I guess product any highlights, good or bad you mentioned and then how much of it\u2019s concentrated on new customer versus selling more to the existing base? Thank you.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah the new, the sales performance I was talking about was really new customers. We have done a good job I think in selling more products but for the most part it's been selling new customers and I would say it\u2019s in the payroll side, the core payroll side and particularly the PEO and HR solutions, HR support products have been very strong.","But across the board we really had a good year, our best in many years from a sales performance perspective and I think that's great execution on the leadership team. It's been a new leadership team really for a number of years now and Mark Bottini has come in and run all the sales, about three years ago he\u2019s built a new team, a leadership and I think it's just been, it\u2019s was just a very good execution as well as a little bit of the economy coming back slowly as well.","So I think we've just gotten a better and better at the comp plans, the support tools, the leads and everything across the board. So I would say primarily strongest has probably been the core payroll and the HR solutions but really across the board it's been pretty good. ","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just one last one the 5% sales headcount growth for fiscal '15 how is that compared to what the actual sales head count growth was in fiscal '14? Thanks a lot. ","Martin Mucci","Pretty modest I am going to say may be couple of percent in last year and we just thought given where we're at trying to step on accelerator a little bit. ","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","","Great, thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is open.","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities"," ","Hey good morning guys.","Martin Mucci","Hey Jim. ","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities"," ","Can we talk a little more about the strategy for going self-insured, how that helps your competitiveness and how broadly it's been picked up so far?","Martin Mucci","So the long and the short is that in certain markets, Jim essentially minimum premium plans where you capture liability is basically what you need to do to be competitive in that market. And as those of you who've covered the company for a while know we didn't do that in the past but thought it was important, number one, Number two, I would say that the stage of maturity of our PEO is at a point where we feel pretty comfortable about our ability to underwrite and understand that risk and obviously was discussed pretty extensively. And the third thing I would say is that we recognize that there is a nice opportunity in the PEO. We want to put ourselves in the best position to capitalize on it.","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities"," ","And just fine, so how many markets is it in, I mean what kind of percent take up do you expect? ","Martin Mucci","So the majority of our plans still are in the hands of third parties. So we are in currently with one state that's got a minimum premium plan. ","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities"," ","Okay. And is the PEO becoming more competitive because of this, is that -- and kind of the flip side of that, is that impacting your brokerage business which was you said was flat? ","Martin Mucci","Well I think, you referenced it. I think it is becoming -- we really thought good about the execution of the PEO team and I think this makes us more competitive, particularly in certain markets. So we've kind of tackled this by market, as Efrain said, we're in one major market for us where a lot of the PEO sales have been and that's where we did this because we felt frankly it was more competitive, we had better flexibility to compete and there was a better opportunity for us and that the timing was really right from both internally from our execution perspective and externally from the opportunity size that\u2019s out there. The PEOs obviously have a very good opportunity and particularly with healthcare reform and so forth now thing are really picking up. So this was the right time to do it and we felt very good about managing the risk in the underwriting as well. ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah and Jim with respect to the insurance business let\u2019s say that there\u2019s two aspects to that. We had a super strong year on worker\u2019s comp insurance. It really -- they really did very, very well. And on H&B we anticipated that the under ten market was going to gravitate towards exchanges. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. So client count is a little bit deceptive in that sense because that\u2019s reflective of a lot of smaller plans gravitating down where we think that will settle out. We\u2019ll get back into a pattern of better growth there because we pivoted that sales force. We made both an investment in that sales force, in numbers and also we have redirected them towards selling in the above ten employee space. ","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities","And just one more, we haven\u2019t talked much about the middle market. Could you just give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing there?","Martin Mucci","Yeah I think the competitive environment hasn\u2019t changed a lot, even though there has been a lot of talk about it in IPOs and so forth. We haven\u2019t seen a big change there. I think what they\u2019re looking for is exactly what we\u2019ve been working on the last few years which is the breadth of product and integration, very much a SaaS focused and we feel good about across the board, the products that we have. ","I think that we like to see even more growth there but I think this is going to be a good year for us on the mid-market side I\u2019d say last year was good. It wasn\u2019t as great as we like to see but I think we were still kind of integrating all the product set but we have a very strong product set, time and attendance and HR administration online in particular is really taking up and that\u2019s why we went after the acquisition of nettime, because we felt that the opportunity for time and attendance is really big, not only in the mid-market but moving down but we thought that that was a great product and great development resources frankly to keep the product very competitive. So I\u2019d say mid-market this is going to be a good year for them and last year was good and it could be even much stronger this year. ","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities","Great thanks. ","Martin Mucci","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open. ","Martin Mucci","Hi David. ","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. It sounds like you\u2019re expecting some acceleration in the HRS segment, so sorry if I missed this earlier but can you help us better understand why you\u2019re becoming more optimistic in the key segments that you think will drive that incremental growth?","Martin Mucci","Well I think we\u2019re optimistic David because we had good success this year. We\u2019ve seen that the PEO has done very well, the HR solutions, the ASO model on the other side has also done well. I think what we\u2019re finding is that the opportunity for HR outsourcing has really continued to grow and we\u2019re very good at it. We\u2019ve been doing it a long time. We\u2019ve over 400 HR specialists out there handling more and more clients each. And I think we\u2019ve really got the model down extremely well, whether it\u2019s a PEO or ASO that sales force is both -- sells both products. So they look for the needs and the value to the customer and sells it that way. ","So I think the HR solutions frankly is just we had a stronger year than we even expected and we think that\u2019s going to continue and we may move slightly the MPP plan with the PEO to give us even greater flexibility and to capture the opportunities from a profit standpoint. So we feel very good about that and in there too is a lot of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done, ExpenseWire, myStaffingPro, a number of products and now we\u2019re getting them integrated even more tightly with our payroll processing and I think that\u2019s all very good news for across the board. We\u2019re starting to capitalize on the investments and the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done. ","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And can you [lay out], a segment how much of growth this year will be acquired growth and then I guess I was also thinking perhaps the Affordable Care Act maybe at least for the moment a catalyst for small businesses to embrace an outsourced solution at least at the front end of all this as everything seems to keep changing and just looking for external support, at least again at the front end of this change. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah, it definitely is. It's been slower than we expected on the healthcare reform because of all the changes. We've put some very good products out early on helping you track ours, helping you tie in your time and attendance to measuring how many hours and full time equivalents and all the things that you need. And we have very good products on that side but it's gone a little slower than we expected because the government, the federal government keeps changing the dates and the rules and who it applies to and I think that's made people more cautious about deciding. ","But I do think that's going to -- as we get into '15 that's going to come more and more too ahead and people will start more businesses, will make more decisions. So I do think that's a bit of a catalyst and it's been a catalyst frankly just to get in the door to talk to more prospects because they're wondering how it applies to them, do they need something or what. I also think that's going to help on the PEO in total HR outsourcing. ASO and PEO models as well because once they start making decisions on healthcare I think they are also seeking the opportunity to just outsource the HR because the compliance requirements, frankly beside healthcare there is just a ton of compliance requirement that just keep coming out by state for things that they are going to have to do. So I think that that's where we see continued opportunity there. ","Efrain Rivera"," And David the nettime acquisition is less than 1% of revenue and less than 1% of HRS revenues. So it\u2019s relatively modest. What we liked about it was, it is the leading SaaS time and attendance product of its type on the market. And there are not a lot of those products on the market we like the technology we would like the team and feel we're really, really well positioned in apart of the market that shows a lot of promising growth both inside or based outside it.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I see, well thanks for that. And I am wondering if I could just go back to the conversation about check growth and client growth and perhaps I've got a bit of dated view of this but my understanding has been historically that during periods of low client growth your check growth would go up because you typically add at the low end right in terms of new business creation fewer employees basically. ","So I am wondering if you could help us make the connection between what has been perhaps stronger than expected check growth and relate that to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of client growth and perhaps the moderation related to better client growth next year. And then secondly, help us understand if there is any impact on pricing as the mix shifts from kind of selling more, if you will, into the existing base versus taking on new clients. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah, okay. So let me take a stab at the first one so I understand what you are saying so if you -- if in a given year you are adding a lot of clients that are call it under four typical new start up at 3.5 it\u2019s going to have a diluting effect on your checks per payroll. And so if you have a lot of adds you would see checks per payroll decline.","That's in a steady state environment David. We're employees weren't necessarily adding a lot for employees and I think that what we didn't model very well was if you look at the last five years, no surprise we didn't add clients there for a period of time. So that did have an impact on increasing checks per client if your client base was growing. So you had a rapid acceleration of client based growth starting around 2010, I shouldn't say a client base, client employee growth that's what the data suggests.","And now you've kind of leveled off a little bit more on steady state. I think when you put all that together we anticipate that cheeks per payroll are going to start dipping below 1% sometime over the next several quarters and then it won't be worth having too much of discussion on it will just be steady state and our adds on the client side will start to really dilute that, so it doesn't really become that important.","So a lot of things have changed over the last seven years to kind of change that equation a bit. But I think that's fundamentally what's going on. And then I apologize because I don't remember the second part of your question. ","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc."," ","It was on pricing that, does that dynamic is client growth accelerates and checks per client decline out, that the checks isn\u2019t issue but as you do more business with newer clients how does that effect the pricing equation if at all?","Martin Mucci","I think it\u2019s still the pricing, we still had pretty good pricing power. Now it\u2019s one, it\u2019s still little early to tell we need to kind of get through the first quarter to kind of give a sense of it this year but we\u2019ve really been able to stand that range the 2% to 4% range that we typically talked about our annual pricing and we\u2019re getting it on new clients, the new clients where you\u2019re in on a competitive standpoint has been pretty good. We haven\u2019t seen our discounting go up a lot on new sales. It\u2019s been fairly consistent so I think there\u2019s always competition there but and frankly if we\u2019re getting it from our referral sources then there\u2019s less competition and more just coming with us which gives us even more pricing power. So on average for new client acquisitions we haven\u2019t seen a lot of discounting go up much.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay got it. And then just lastly on the flow income, can you remind us how much of the portfolio turns over this year and the related yield compared to the reinvestment rate assumed in your guidance?","Martin Mucci","Yeah okay nice, that was a very succinct way of putting a lot of pieces together. So about 15% to 20% of the long term portfolio is going to turn over this year. I think we mentioned we are at about 1.6% we probably get some more close to that. Although I always caveat that because rates have just been very volatile. So as we speak publicly in the 255 to 260 range on a ten year treasuries and we were up to 3.1 but that\u2019s a sense of what happens. And then David the other parties that were typically 45% to 50% short term. So essentially that\u2019s turning over every day and we\u2019re getting eight basis points. ","I think there is a disclosure in the K is that 25 basis point move is going to create about $4.5 million worth of additional income to the bottom line. So just one point not to complicate it any further but based on where you expect interest rates to be you can modify the portfolio either longer or shorter. We\u2019re staying a little bit sort of in the middle neutral at the point, at this point because we think that there -- some things are going to happen with the Fed sometime reasonably soon. ","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So you\u2019re saying that the embedded rate of 1.6% is relatively -- is comparable to what the reinvestment now is on the long-term?","Martin Mucci","Probably a little bit higher but it doesn\u2019t really\u2026 ","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And I assume you have some visibility on this, can you give us an idea of how much of the portfolio turns over in fiscal \u201916?","Efrain Rivera","\u201916 is priced similar about 2015 to 20%, it\u2019s always around that range. ","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay thanks a lot. ","Martin Mucci","Thanks David. ","Operator","Next is Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. ","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","Thank you, good morning just a sort of a couple of questions love to hear. I was wondering just sort of give us a little bit of update on sort of a traction you\u2019re getting with SurePayroll, maybe a sense for what the customer growth was on the SurePayroll this year and what\u2019s your sort of expectations is for industry growth how that sort of SaaS industry, what kind of traction the industry is growing out at this point and how you sort of did relative to the industry?","Martin Mucci","Yeah Glenn, of course we don\u2019t break it out any more but we\u2019ve been very happy with their growth. Their sales have been very strong, retention has been good, and they\u2019ve continued to build partnerships as we have with banks, with referrals and so forth in banks for their white label product which we actually go into the banks now and have been very successful going in together. So either you want to give referrals to us or you white label a SurePayroll product of a number of banks. So we\u2019re very pleased with it. We don\u2019t want to break the growth out because it\u2019s becoming more and more of integrated part of us but we\u2019re very pleased with their growth and they\u2019ve reached some nice milestones this year. ","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","And then on the margins the 37% to 38% guide for \u201915, down a little bit from this year and I think Efrain you talked about a few things like the investment, sales growth of 5%. The other thing would be the reporting change the change in the insurance reporting is that a meaningful drag or not to significant or anything else we should be thinking about as relates to the margins?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah Glenn, If I wish I could just have a -- one thing, when we put out the press release we couldn't to my -- in deference to my good friends on the West Coast we release before so they get -- they don't have to get up at 7. We probably in the future would just simply release a day up because a lot of notes just had it wrong. You need to see the schedule. So the point you are making is a very valid point.","The reason why the margins are down is because of the reclassification on the PEO cost. We\u2019re still continuing to leverage. During next year it's going to appear lumpy until we get close to Q4 and then it starts to normalize. So the answer is no, our margin isn't deteriorating. It's simply the reclassification of these costs. Please if I can\u2026 ","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","Can you quantify that, there might just be simple -- we'll see the schedules but is that 50 basis points or something like that? ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah you are looking at a quantification of about 100 to 150 basis points. But it would be pretty explicitly stated on the schedule. And I wish I could just put it all out but it was just going to be too confusing. So and for those of you who have any questions whatsoever please give me a call or have one of your associates give me a call and I\u2019ll walking them through that if you have any confusion on it at all. And look at -- I can't, we can't have a pre-call to say we had a change in terms of the way we did the accounting, but thanks for asking the question. ","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","Yeah and just one more on the share repurchase, you renewed obviously upped the authorization in May, but would you think it would be sort of sustained at the same level of appetite to repurchase shares this year as relative to fiscal '14? And should we see a benefit on the share count going down more so than in '14?","Martin Mucci","No, I would say we're just going to keep it relatively flat and purchase to offset dilution at this point, if we make a change there we'll chat with you.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Martin Mucci","Sure. ","Operator","Next is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Silber - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks so much, I know it\u2019s late, I\u2019ll just ask last one quick one. Looking at the client growth acceleration in payroll services, were there any types of clients where you saw faster growth may be you focused a little bit more on your sales effort there? ","Martin Mucci","No, I would say across the board we had pretty good growth there. And really one of the things we forget that we still have an Advantage Payroll base that we purchased back in 2003 that we haven\u2019t really been selling, continuing to sell in that market. That drops off, that continues to just kind of drop off because we're not selling new but across the board, whether it's the SurePayroll core payroll, et cetera, international we've kind of had nice, pretty good growth, some ups and downs but pretty good growth across the board.","Jeffrey Silber - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Martin Mucci","You're welcome. ","Operator","Next is from George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","George Mihalos - Credit Suisse","","Hey guys, most of my questions have been answered but just quickly if we look at the outlook for HSR revenue growth, the 11% to 14% on adjusted basis, that compares to the 11.5 that you did last year. Is all the acceleration on attachment of ACA related products that could potentially kick in? ","Martin Mucci","No, it's not. It's basically George it's really just strength in the HR solutions portion of the business and also the other products that we sell. ","Efrain Rivera","It's across the board but you will see the biggest growth part of that is still going to continue to be the PEO and HR outsourcing business. But 401(k) continues to grow and across the board in insurance and so forth. ","George Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Okay. Should we be thinking that growth would be a little bit more backend loaded throughout the course of the year or fairly uniform?","Efrain Rivera","It's a little bit, George what I would suggest is you look at the schedule because you will see while if you look at our EPS, between first half and second half, there is not a huge amount of difference for the implied EPS, what you can see the growth is a little bit more back half weighted.","George Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Hey, thanks good morning. Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my question, just on the -- I want to ask about float income growth it seems conservative at flat given what you showed in the fourth quarter and how you did better than you said last year. Anything unusual there I caught the rate commentary you gave to Dave, I thought fund balances would help you could get to positive. ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah we could get to positive. I think what we're -- what's happening is every quarter when we reinvest we're looking at a different interest rate scenario. And I would say we looked at four different interest rate scenarios last year meaning that what we saw in the market differed every quarter and so we have to make a decision in that quarter, do we go long or do we go short. And our bias now is to stay a little shorter because we think that longer we\u2019re going to see a pop, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at, that\u2019s what the guidance implies. ","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Understood okay. So obviously that will be fluid and we\u2019ll get updates as we go, makes sense. Then just one more clarification, just I know there\u2019s a lot of talk about PEO, how does the mix shift to PEO if that\u2019s indeed what\u2019s happening, how does that impact your payroll service revenue at all and does it impact your payroll client account because I'm not sure how those things get treated if you follow my question. ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah good question, so if we add PEO clients they are included within our payroll client number, I would say the numbers weren\u2019t big, so don\u2019t think that what was driving it was PEO. But I think I\u2019ll just use that question to highlight something important people think of Paychex as or typically have thought of Paychex as sub payroll and attach ancillaries and what\u2019s increasingly occurring company as you know the way that we capture our client can be through a PEO sometimes when we attach payroll after an HR sale. It\u2019s the breadth of offerings and that breadth of offerings combined with mobile technology that pulls all of that information together that I think uniquely positions us in the market. ","So going in through one single sign on, which virtually no one has through one integrated suite of products or of one database which is what we\u2019ve been doing from one investment standpoint permits to you enter either through the PEO through the ASO through a 401(k) and go back into payroll to I think we\u2019re really uniquely positioned there so the sales are occurring in a lot of different ways.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Understood, it\u2019s very clear, as long as we can invest, thanks. ","Martin Mucci","Great thanks. ","Operator","Next is Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. Good morning, how large is the sales force now?","Martin Mucci","I think we are over on the feet on the street over 2,600. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Over 2,600 and how many are running a typical quota? In terms of what you used to be targeted back in, prior to the recession?","Martin Mucci","Last year a lot of them, remember that typical quota is going to vary by product but if you look at the core I would say we did very well last year. ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah I don\u2019t think we typically have broken that out or anything so. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","We talked around the edges to see if we could kind of get to it. So it sounds like we have enough that are running at that level, that really doesn\u2019t necessitate an increase in terms of the sales force. ","Martin Mucci","Oh yeah I think and we definitely as you know Mark, we\u2019ve kind kept that on a low side of ads and then as we saw more productivity and we saw the execution across the board and the opportunity I think growing now is the time to add the additional reps in various areas so\u2026 ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Great and then with regards to major markets how should we think about that particularly given some of the discussions. Isn\u2019t that an area where we are going to be investing a little bit more?","Martin Mucci","Yeah we continue to invest. It\u2019s hand good investment. Now the interesting thing is that that investment really spreads across when I would say years ago hey these time and attendance offerings for example or HR online offerings are for the 50 plus it really has come down quite dramatically and so we don\u2019t, we think of the investments frankly is almost the entire base anymore maybe not under five or under 10 or some, but definitely under 20 you\u2019re selling time and attendance solutions whether it\u2019s our simple time clocks or whether it\u2019s the new solutions they are selling a lot more broadly. ","So you kind of start with the over 50 but you\u2019re definitely seeing it all come down. The needs are deafening and there is some, it\u2019s because of the simplicity the integration of the SaaS and the adoption is really taking it much, much further down market. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","How are you thinking about the upper end what you\u2019ve traditionally targeted with regards to majors?","Martin Mucci","I think we\u2019re still, I think we\u2019re doing well there and you\u2019ll continue to see that the investments we\u2019re making will help us and I\u2019ll say 250 to 500 range, as well. I think we\u2019re competitive there but certainly our focus and majority of the client base has been lower and we\u2019ll continue the things we\u2019re investing in, will continue to help make us very competitive on a 250 to 1,000 but I would say primarily 250 to 500 to 600 to 700 we do very well there. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Okay great and then so just going back to the margins .So if we were to adjust this past fiscal year under where would the margins have been?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah the margins would have been between 38 to 39. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","I'm sorry, I meant fiscal \u201914 which just ended.","Martin Mucci","Yes. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","If we wouldn\u2019t apply a similar treatment to what you\u2019re going to do prospectively?","Martin Mucci","Prospectively UG market to be a 50 to a 100 basis points higher. So let me explain because at this time which is deafening. This year we clogged out our margins were approximately where they were between 38 and 39 about 38.7, 38.6, by applying the same logic so I'm not inflating the top line with the -- not inflating us not there, I'm not grossing up the top line, it be between 50 to 100 basis points higher in prospectively. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Okay so in other words if we take a look exclusive of float, you basically been running incremental margins north of 50% for two years now. What you basically say if I'm interpreting things correctly despite the increased investments behind the sales force and technology the leverage is still there other than this change and so the reality is we\u2019d still see incremental margins that would be in the similar range?","Martin Mucci","That\u2019s correct Mark and put another way, this year\u2019s going to be lumpy and choppy because we\u2019ve got these additions to revenue. By the end of the fourth quarter and by the way I\u2019ll just repeat for those who are still here on the call, there is a schedule, hopefully it\u2019s out by now on the website that details this and helps you really refine the model. By the time we get to the end of the, by the time we get to the end of \u201915 you\u2019ll see that margins start to normalize. But we\u2019re doing it on a higher level of revenue you can\u2019t get even to the lows of the margin that we\u2019re talking about if we weren\u2019t leveraging so there is leveraging the model I guess and we will continue to do that. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","And is there an anticipation that in the first quarter of next year or in the third quarter of next year the add that we had for this treatment that we would end up seeing higher adds in other words\u2026","Martin Mucci","No, it actually levels out. Mark what I would suggest is look at the schedule and you\u2019ll see it and we\u2019ll talk about it in detail, but the first two quarters are where you see the most of the revenue add, third you see some and then by fourth it really diminishes. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Just out of curiosity why wouldn\u2019t you just, within your next press release just and at least until things level out just include a paragraph where it\u2019s like if we had treated things in a similar manner?","Martin Mucci","Yes, that\u2019s good feedback, we may do that. By the way it is in our current press release. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","I know I appreciate it. That made it a lot easier, okay.","Efrain Rivera","We will continue to do it. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah we\u2019ll take a look. Because the biggest thing that Efrain mentioned was the margin really it\u2019s probably the one thing that\u2019s been misunderstood. It didn\u2019t go down 100 basis points or so it\u2019s -- we have not gone down on margin it just brings more revenue up in the top line. ","Efrain Rivera","Mark we\u2019ll either put it in or I\u2019ll just talk to it. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Because I mean if somebody is just going through the math and is making an adjustment to say the last quarter the way it look is if we make that adjustment the 37 to 38 that\u2019s been guided to doesn\u2019t seem to imply any sort of margin improvement, which would imply that your incremental margins are going down which is something that you\u2019re not which is clearly not going to be the case. ","Efrain Rivera","Yeah but again what I would say is look at our supplemental schedule that we\u2019re posting because you can\u2019t understand the numbers without understanding, how much in each quarter we\u2019re adding revenue by this change. ","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Great thank you. ","Martin Mucci","Okay thanks Mark. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Your line is open. ","Michael Baker - Raymond James","Yeah I just wanted on the new health insurance offering understand if like in fiscal \u201916 could we continue to see some impact as you potentially rollout to more markets or is this just kind of a one year impact?","Martin Mucci","Well I think you\u2019re saying on the PEO piece of this right, when you say insurance offering. ","Michael Baker - Raymond James","Yes. ","Martin Mucci","I think it\u2019s something we continue to look at. Right now we have one plan in a major area of our PEO and we\u2019ll continue to look at this from a competitive and opportunity competitive nature and opportunity perspective and there could be more which would -- could produce more changes and if that\u2019s the case then we\u2019ll go through this. We\u2019ll probably get even better at refining exactly what the impact is but it could, at this point we don\u2019t plan on it but we continue to look at our markets and find that if it makes sense to do more we\u2019ll do more. ","Michael Baker - Raymond James","Okay and in the market where it exists can you give us the underlying healthcare cost trend assumption that you\u2019re using for the product?","Martin Mucci","No, but it\u2019s probably close to national averages.","Michael Baker - Raymond James","Okay I appreciate it, thanks for the color. ","Martin Mucci","One other thing I want to say just to refine that, that underlying cost trend is going to be a function of your ability to underwrite the people in pools. So if you\u2019re good, you hopefully can beat that trend by getting the right people in your pool. So that\u2019s all subject to a little bit of managerial effort. ","Michael Baker - Raymond James","Right and just to that point though, you could actually see what we call favorable trend as well in other words people are kind of more focused on the risk side of it but periodically at least within the year you could experience favorable trend and then factor that into your pricing next years -.","Martin Mucci","You cover the PEO, it\u2019s part of the strategy that you use in the PEO. ","Michael Baker - Raymond James","Right I guess the other concern that\u2019s out there is that because we see what can happen to the pure play to self-insure. There was just kind of that element of uncertainty there. Is there any potential down the road to like you do for interest rates give at least some sense and I know there are other pieces because you have what we call stop loss or some form of app on it, just to kind of ease some of that because normally what happens is the concerns tend to creep up what we call back half of the year given some of the -- and not when I mean back half of the year I mean calendar year. ","Martin Mucci","Definitely I know what you\u2019re saying, so yeah I think we\u2019ll call that out. Subject to -- there are certain competitors in the market and we look at -- we try to level at the disclosures we provide, no one else is doing so we don\u2019t most assured, we see some trend changes we\u2019ll talk about it. ","Michael Baker - Raymond James","All right thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open. ","Martin Mucci","Hi Tim. ","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, it\u2019s actually [Stephen Sheldon] [ph] in for Tim. Just wanted to clarify is the 5% sales force growth expectation is that for core payroll or is that for overall sales force payroll?","Martin Mucci","It\u2019s for overall. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then I think you said that acquisitions would add less than a 100 basis points overall revenue growth in 2015 but just wanted to ask is there any assumed impact from acquisitions on your margin guidance?","Martin Mucci","It has a slight negative impact but again I didn\u2019t call out either because frankly there are surrounding areas. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay thanks. ","Operator","Thank you and our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open. ","Martin Mucci","Hey, Ashwin. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Hey guys, thank you keeping this open so long. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to ask and I hopped off the call for brief bit so I apologize if this was asked. Do you have any clarity on the number of processing days in each quarter for this fiscal year? Because I know that last year it kind of created some ups and downs?","Martin Mucci","Yeah it created noise. I could have done a better job on that one, but yeah the exact same days, so there\u2019s no date changes. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","So on a year-over-year basis just to clarify its going to be the same days each quarter?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, same days each quarter. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup","Got it, okay well that was the only clarification I had I just want to say happy 4th to you. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah same to you and everyone else on the call.

You may begin.","Martin Mucci","Good morning, thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's first quarter of fiscal 2015 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning before the market opened we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2014. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at Paychex.com. This teleconference will also be broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.","On today\u2019s call I will review the highlights for the first quarter of our sales, operations and product development areas and Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance; then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. ","We are off to a good start in fiscal 2015. We are pleased with our progress toward our growth goals and we begin the year with momentum in both sales and new product enhancements. Client satisfaction and retention also remain at high levels. ","Payroll revenue is trending well with growth of about 4.5% due to increases in revenue per check, client base and checks per payroll. HRS revenue grew double-digits for the first quarter as we continue to experience success in selling HR outsourcing solutions to our clients.","Total service revenue grew 9%. The positive momentum we saw in fiscal 2014 in sales execution has continued into 2015 as we experience solid performance in both new sales revenue and units. Our payroll and Paychex HR services in particular continue to do well in Q1. ","We also quickly brought onboard the increase in sales reps we planned, so that we are fully staffed and have been successful in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements in addition to our strong CPA referral channel. ","Our partnership between our selling organizations has never been more efficient as they have moved down market to be sure our clients are receiving the full value of the breadth of services that Paychex has to offer them. ","Our execution and service operations has continued its standard of excellence, demonstrated by strong client satisfaction results and client retention levels that remain consistent with recent highs. Our innovative leading edge technology in products, coupled with our exceptional client service we believe is a differentiator in the market. ","From a technology perspective, continued investment in our SaaS solutions and mobility offerings position us for long-term growth. We have market-leading software-as-a-service solutions leveraging the latest technologies and continue to invest significantly in online capabilities and mobile applications.","We recently introduced mobile applications for both our Paychex online accounting services and our expense management solutions. In addition, our online payroll application was recently awarded a five star rating by a leading publication, the only major payroll provider to receive such a rating.","We completed the acquisition of nettime solutions, a leading cloud-based time and attendance solution provider, adding yet another powerful offering to our software-as-a-service portfolio. This acquisition pairs Paychex exceptional customer service and on boarding team with the SaaS time and attendance technology of a market leader.","In summary, we are off to a solid start for sales, service, product strength and financial performance for fiscal 2015 and I greatly appreciate the work of our Paychex employee team across the country.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Marty and good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that in today\u2019s conference call we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and in such involve risks. Refer to the press release for a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. ","You may remember that during the latter part of last year we introduced a new health insurance offering within our PEO for PEO clients and work side employees. Due to the self-insurance provisions within the new offering, we began classifying certain PEO direct costs as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. This change had no impact on operating income. This new product offering had an impact on our first quarter results, since it was not initiated until the second half of fiscal 2014.","As Marty indicated, our first quarter financial results for fiscal 2015 represent a strong start to the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I will provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our outlook.","Total service revenue grew 9% for the first quarter to $657 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the first quarter to $10 million. This was driven by a 3% increase in average investment balances and as I\u2019ve discussed with some of you, we are getting to the point where we bottom down in terms of decreases on our interest related to our client fund portfolio. ","The expenses increased 12% for the first quarter, but this was primarily in compensation related costs and the PEO direct costs. The increase in the portion of PEO direct costs is the result of a healthcare offering as I mentioned previously. ","The increase in compensation-related cost was driven by higher performance-based compensation costs, employee benefit related costs and the sales headcount. We talked a bit about our increase in sales headcount. We are up year-over-year in sales headcount. We continued our investment in our product development and supporting technology, which has been growing at a faster rate than our total expenses.","Operating income net of certain items increased 5% to $257 million for the quarter. We maintained strong operating margins and anticipate that our full year will be within our guidance range, which I\u2019ll discuss shortly.","Diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.47 per share for the quarter and net income increased 5% to $171 million. Diluted earnings per share were positively impacted by stock repurchases we made in the first quarter and in fiscal 2014. ","On the payroll revenue side, service revenue exceeded 4% for the first quarter to $413 million. We benefited from the increases in revenue per check, client base and checks per payroll and I got a \u2013 I saw a note that indicated what were checks per payroll and we didn\u2019t call it out specifically. It was about 1% as we drift in that range or slightly below and we won\u2019t call it out specifically, so check per payroll up about 1%. ","Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases, net of discounting along with the impact of increased product penetration and as I mentioned, checks per payroll are growing, but at a more moderate rate as we are expecting. ","On the HRS side, HR service revenue increased 17% to $244 million for the first quarter. The increase reflects strong growth in both clients and work site employees of Paychex HR services and an increase in PEO revenue as a result of the new minimum premium healthcare offerings started during the second half of last year. ","The increase from the new PEO healthcare offering represents approximately 2.5% of total service revenue for the first quarter, so just so you hear that again, the increase from the new PEO healthcare offering represents approximately 2.5% of total service revenue for the first quarter.","Online HR administration products contribute to growth through sales, success of our SaaS solutions and retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in the number of plans and an increase in average asset value of participant funds.","Turning to the investment portfolio, our goal as you know is to protect principle and optimize liquidity. We are conservative in the way we manage our portfolio on the short-term side. Primary investment vehicles are bank demand deposit accounts and if you look at the balance sheet, you\u2019ll see that we had a fair amount of cash in the quarter. That\u2019s because of timing and we didn\u2019t choose to invest all of that in VRDN\u2019s in Q1.","In our longer portfolio we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.3 years. I would just say that we are positioned where we want to be, to take advantage of rising interest rates should they come at some point soon hopefully.","Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the first quarter, compared to 1.0% for the same period last year. That\u2019s the first time in a while we said the compare is positive. ","Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the first quarter. This was driven by wage inflation, along with favorable trends in our client base and checks per payroll. ","I'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $956 million and no debt. Funds held for clients were $4.1 billion compared to $4.2 billion as of May 31, 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.6 billion for the quarter; the more relevant comparison. That\u2019s a year-over-year increase of 3%. ","Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains on the portfolio of $41 million as of August 31, 2014, compared with a net unrealized gain of $35 million as of May 31, 2014. ","Total stockholders equity was $1.8 billion, reflecting $138 million in dividend paid during the first quarter and $38 million of shares repurchase. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 35%. ","Cash flows from operations were $263 million for the first quarter, which moderated from the prior year. The change was a result of fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities offset by higher net income and non-cash adjustments to net income. ","The fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll and income taxes. It really was primarily as a result of timing of a large income tax payment we made in the year prior period. It is common for us to have some significant fluctuations of working capital between quarters.","With respect to guidance, we reaffirmed our guidance for fiscal 2015. I\u2019d like to remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Total service revenue as we previously said is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 10% with the ranges for payroll and HR as consistent with previous guidance. Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 6% to 8% and operating margin and tax rate for the year are expected to be consistent with prior guidance.","And I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Okay. We will now open the call to any questions. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). The first question today is from George Mihalos with Credit Suisse.","George Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and a very nice start to the year.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","George Mihalos - Credit Suisse","I wanted to kick it of on the payroll growth side, a 4.5% number sort of at the high end of your 3% to 5% range. Just curious, is there any reason why you wouldn\u2019t be narrowing the range say to 4% to 5% from the 3% to 5% and the 3% seems conservative, even if we are only in the first quarter. Just wondering if you are seeing anything else there?","Martin Mucci","Yes, George thanks. So I guess it\u2019s a philosophy issues. Sorry, I should state what the philosophy is. What we try to do when we come into the year is say, what do we think the ranges are for the year as a whole, so we don\u2019t have to revise every quarter guidance. We try to call out, if somehow a quarter falls, is a little bit unusual in terms of the guidance. So yes, I would say at the bottom end, right now 3% is pretty conservative. We obviously start a little bit better than that number, but we still feel comfortable with the overall guidance range.","George Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Okay great, thanks for the color there. And then wanted to switch gears as it relates to your payroll card program or initiative, the partnership with Skylight that you have. Any color you can provide there as to demand for payroll cards and just wanted to get a sense, is a payroll card more profitable to Paychex than a standard check?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s more profitable. It\u2019s not necessarily more profitable, because we have a partner obviously involved in providing it. I\u2019d say the demand for it George has been consistent, but not huge. I think we were one of the first to have a payroll card, meant (ph) over 10 years ago and it just \u2013 it has a small kind of grouping; those that are on bank for example and so forth. ","And while we\u2019ve seen that go up and down a little bit over time, more and more people want one card if they are bank. They want one card, they don\u2019t want a separate payroll card, so I would say that the demand is consistent. We really like the product that we are involved with now and think that that may pick up demand a little bit, but it\u2019s one of those things where we just like to offer a full wide range of offerings to the client as to however they want to receive their pay.","George Mihalos - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks George. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from S.K. Prasad Borra with Goldman Sachs.","S.K. Prasad Borra \u2013 Goldman Sachs ","Thanks for taking my question. Just with regards to your investments in sales force, when do you expect to see the benefits come through? Is it more second half weighted or we should start seeing movements in the first half as well?","Martin Mucci","Yes, as I said, I think we got off to a good start. I think the new headcount that we\u2019ve added in the last quarter, I think you\u2019ll see more of those benefits in the second half of the year. We have a great training program, but obviously they get trained. They start building their relationships with CPA\u2019s and other channels and I think you\u2019ll see that more in the second half of the year. But we feel like we are off to a very good start. We continued in from Q4 and feel good about both sales units and revenue from the perspective particularly of payroll.","S.K. Prasad Borra \u2013 Goldman Sachs ","And probably just to follow-on on that. What\u2019s the split between the sales force recruitment in payroll and HRS segments?","Martin Mucci","As far as what the additions were?","S.K. Prasad Borra \u2013 Goldman Sachs ","Yes.","Martin Mucci","The additions were a little stronger on the payroll side. We felt that that was starting to pick up again in the second half of last year and so much of the ads \u2013 I won\u2019t break it out exactly, but much of the ads were on the payroll side and because we felt we are very well positioned on the HRS services side.","S.K. Prasad Borra \u2013 Goldman Sachs ","Thanks for taking my question.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Smitty Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley.","Smitty Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. Just wanted to just get some more color on the PEO segment. How it\u2019s tracking and may be you can give us an update in terms of how pricing is developing on the PEO side?","Martin Mucci"," ","I would say we thought really strong about the last half of the year from a competitive standpoint where we feel very competitive. They\u2019ve done very well with the carriers. The new plan as Efrain mentioned, we think has put us in an even better competitive position in the Florida area and so we feel very good we are off to a \u2013 the big months are kind of coming in now this quarter is what\u2019s coming up for the benefit plans and so forth, but we feel very strong fully staffed on the sales side, a lot of experience in that team and of course we offer both the PEO and the ASO version. ","So what\u2019s good about the way I believe we offered it is, whatever the client needs to get the most value out of the service we have to offer him. But feel very good about the PEO side and our opportunity you are coming up particularly this second quarter as we see benefit plans get subscribed too. ","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I\u2019d just add Pramod that we are positioned certainly in the market as well as we\u2019ve ever been positioned. The addition to the minimum premium plan really helps in Florida, but we are seeing good demand across other markets. So the only caution or caveat I'd put on that is that third quarter is a big quarter for PEO and that\u2019s where you see kind of how much you are winning the battle. So we feel good about where we started. Still the year needs to play out a bit more.","Smitty Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And may be just a follow up on nettimes solutions. Can you just give us some more color in terms of the level of traction that you are getting with that new offering and may be compare that to your legacy T&E product. And are there any other product sets that you are looking to buy or to build or buy to improve your overall product portfolio at the movement?","Martin Mucci","Yes, right now we are feeling very good about the portfolio of products. The nettime was an opportunity that we felt we had a \u2013 there was a real market leader there and that the team would fit very well and would fit into our SaaS products. ","We are seeing good traction really out of the gate as we integrate it into our payroll offering, which will come in stages and then there is organic growth that we\u2019ve continued at nettime itself. So we feel good about the organic growth, which they\u2019ll sell directly and integrating it into our payroll platform. ","We\u2019ve already had a number of sales. We are training everyone in our team on the product and so you\u2019ll see a good combination of sales from the organic and to tie into Paychex. The integration takes a little bit of time, but that will be coming up in the next quarter or so. So we are very pleased with the product. The whole management team is in place at nettime. Our leadership is taking a very strong role and is just a great cultural fit with the company, so we feel very good about where this is. ","The legacy product has been very strong. We had a good strong year last year and we\u2019ll just kind of phase. The legacy product has little more for us integrated bells and whistles on it, which we are introducing actually even this quarter and next year. You\u2019ll see not only web-punch online, but complete mobility punch as well, time punches and so we\u2019ll still be building on the legacy product for a little bit until we get nettime fully integrated in, but we are really pleased with the product and everything that it offers.","Efrain Rivera","They had a really nice track record of growing that business over 60% over the last three years and it\u2019s a good example of the kind of acquisitions. We like smaller. We buy them to grow them, not for growth and good products set, good management and they are off to a good start.","Smitty Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Thanks for that. And may be just one last quick question is, as you can give us an update on the retention ratio, the retention rate that you are seeing in your business.","Martin Mucci","Yes, very similar to last year, we are really ahead from our perspective on retention, so very strong. It\u2019s probably still at historic best for the company from a payroll retention stand point and we feel very good. So not only the sales have great momentum, but the retention is right up there with our historic best and we haven\u2019t seen any change in that. Obviously big quarter is coming up here with year-end, but so far we are feeling very good about the retention.","Smitty Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. ","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Hi guys, thanks. I wanted to just ask a little bit about new business formation. Get some general observation from you guys on whether you think we are stable or is there any improvement there, I know its obviously an important source of new sales and growth for Paychex?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so Jason two answers to that. It would be greater if we had real time data on what\u2019s going on in the economy in the absence of that. We\u2019ve noticed a trend ticking up on our sales to newly formed businesses and it seems like over a number of quarters now we seem to be picking up in that area and if you go back a couple of years ago, we weren\u2019t seen that trend. That now seems to be evident. It looks like you getting better business formation, but of course we are kind of an indirect, our observation on that is indirect, our sales to new businesses are up.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Okay. Is there any way to get a feel, either qualitatively or quantitatively whether or not that\u2019s reflective of any kind of share shift in terms of who is winning new businesses or is it not enough data to really call that out.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, there really isn\u2019t enough data to pull it out. Its very difficult to get that granular for new business sales, and I would tend to describe it a little bit more to some underlying growth in new businesses and then I think we are getting better at execution too. ","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we have felt good about kind of the win loss ratio against competitors, that we are definitely seeing an up-tick in the sales from competitors and kind of when we look at it from a net gain from competitors and we are definitely an up-tick and a positive at this point as we started to see that the second half of last year too. ","So well Efrain\u2019s right, its quite hard. We are still not at the full new business, a creation that we were pre-recession. Its certainly up, but it\u2019s not where it was based on everything we see. But as Efrain said, new sales, sales to new businesses are up and definitely the gain from competitors is up. So we are feeling very good about that.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Okay. And then just on pricing, are you still kind of trending closer to the lower end of 2% to 4% range and I wanted to just gets a feel in terms of contract renewals in general, what percent of those are currently being done with the unit price increase versus how many are flat and how many have a unit price decrease and has there been any change in those relative percentages over the past, I don\u2019t know a year or so?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so Jason so what we said is 2% to 4% I would say we are floating off the bottom of that a little bit closer to the middle of it. We do not give uniform price increases, so that\u2019s experienced a little bit differently by different customers and we also don\u2019t have contracts. ","So one of the things that does differentiate us is that virtual across every single customer that we have, if you don\u2019t earn our keep from a service standpoint, you can get to walk without penalties. We do a little bit of that in the mid market, but that\u2019s a relative small part of our business. So I would say the pricing environment is easing somewhat.","Martin Mucci","Yes, we feel good about it you know. Now that we\u2019re through that first quarter, we have not seen a lot of fallout from the price increase and so that\u2019s always a good determining factor in that first quarter, although we would see it typically in the July, August timeframe and haven\u2019t, so\u2026","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Okay. Just my last question, any update you wanted to provide on the Brazil, JV or what\u2019s happening overseas in Germany and your kind of processing offering as well.","Martin Mucci ","Yes, I\u2019d say Brazil is off to a good start. There was a delay in some of the electronic filing requirements that we had expected the government had put in place, they delayed for year, but we are off to a pretty good start. We don\u2019t give exact client growth, but we feel very good about the start that we\u2019ve had there since January and in Germany sales are above plans. So they are continuing to do well and we are always looking for other ways to grow Germany even faster and the other, Brazil as well.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies","Okay. I appreciate the comments. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Hey, good morning Marty and Efrain. Efrain as you look at the results that you reported for the first quarter, would you say were they in line with your internal plans or were you a little bit a head of internal plans?","Efrain Rivera","Crickets right. We felt pretty good about the first quarter.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","","Alright, so Efrain the balance sheet looks amazing still, you have a lot of cash on hand. Any thoughts as to what you would like to do with that cash. I know you have a share buy back in place and just beyond that?","Efrain Rivera","Yes so we do have an opportunity to buy shares back. We have bought to-date, including last year about 7 million shares that we purchased those significantly below where the stock is trading. We obviously thought that made a lot of sense where we see opportunities to go and buy. We will do that opportunistically, we think that makes sense. ","But the other thing is we have a good pipeline of acquisition opportunities. We want to keep our powder dry. We are as all of you know, we don\u2019t tend to do stupid acquisitions just to grow and we like some properties out there. Now, whether there\u2019s going to be something that we see over the course of the year, we\u2019ll evaluate that and if we are getting to the end of the year and we have a significant cash build up, then we\u2019ll have to have a discussion with the board about what next steps would be there. ","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then Marty just on the Paychex accounting online business, how its progressing, where you are, if you think you need to change the business model at all. ","Martin Mucci","Well, I think the biggest thing we are learning is how to really acquire the clients and kind of get them, and I guess I\u2019ll even step back further, get them to even to realize it\u2019s a great accounting product that we have invested in with Kashoo and this has been out there for a while. It\u2019s a strong online accounting product. More of a book keeping type of software as a service, but they still come to Paychex for payroll benefits and outsourcing and while the reputation is very strong there, they are not always \u2013 it\u2019s a different marketing game to teach them about the accounting or bookkeeping online that we have available to them. ","So I think the biggest thing, I wouldn\u2019t really change much. We may get a little more aggressive as far as getting to our own clients and in getting them to understand that we have this nice offering that I think is going to be a real benefit and value to them. So probably more from a market standpoint, we are trying to see if we can get the knowledge that its out there and that its us and that it has all the power, the strength of Paychex behind it, that\u2019s the biggest thing. ","Other than that, we are really pleased with the product. I think we are just finding that the marketing is a little bit different in the approach and so forth and we expect that to start to pick up. ","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Hey, thank you very much. I appreciate it. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Joe Foresi with Janney Capital Markets.","Martin Mucci","Hi Joe. ","Jeff Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets ","Hi, good morning. This is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to see if I could get an update on the sales force hiring. I know you were targeting 5% growth on the sales force hires for the year. Just wanted to see how Q1 shook out. ","Martin Mucci","Yes, I\u2019m not sure if \u2013 yes, that was confusing. We are probably more in like the 3% type of growth rate and we felt very good about that. We\u2019ve been fairly flat the last few years. Didn\u2019t grow a lot in the sales force given the economy and some of the results and things that we were doing in sales. And this year we decided, we committed to a good strong 3% growth and that all got completed very quickly. So we hired up between the fourth quarter and the first quarter and we are fully staffed. A lot of training has already been done and I think they are hitting the ground running. ","So I feel very good about that. We really haven\u2019t put \u2013 we\u2019ve been more cautious the last couple of years. This year we started getting back to the kind of old trends of adding 2% to 3% to the sales force in the year. ","Efrain Rivera","Just Jeff one other add to that. While as Marty said we are going to add 3%, we are actually up over that when you compare where we were in the Q1 of last year. We came in a little light last year and Q1 started the year, built up and then added 3%. So we are actually above the 3%. ","Jeff Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets ","Okay, great. And I know last quarter you had called out some increased investment in the first half of the fiscal year. You were above your operating margin guided range in the first quarter. Is there any kind of push out on your increased investment on the IT side or sales force like heading into Q2? ","Efrain Rivera","As Marty said, I think we did a lot of the hiring we were going do on the sales force in Q1. IT will ramp a bit as we progress through the year. So I don\u2019t think we are way off what we were expecting. ","Jeff Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets ","Okay, thanks. And one final question just on \u2013 I know its been, we have discussed kind of delayed decisions on the healthcare reform side. Just wanted to see if there was any update on that. If clients are addressing compliance requirements. Thanks. ","Martin Mucci","I think you know Jeff we are still get a lot of interest. It gets us in front of a lot of clients, but I think that this quarter we\u2019ll get a better sense of it again as the benefit plans. People come up, some are getting off exchanges, some of the small clients are going to be moving to the exchanges. I think we\u2019ll get a better sense. ","I think we\u2019ve still seen kind of a, I wouldn\u2019t say a freeze, but kind of a hesitation to know what to do and of course the delay in some of the requirements for the 50 to 99, the under 100, 50 to 100 basically has pushed off that decision for a few more. ","We still feel okay. We got a very strong health insurance team out there and they are getting in front of a lot of clients, but you are still seeing a little bit of hesitation I think. Got great products to help them monitor whether it applies to them, how it applies to them, give them real time information, but we are not seeing a big up-tick, at least at this point, but we do expect it will probably pick up a little bit more in the next few months. ","Jeff Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets ","Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Togut with Evercore.","Martin Mucci","Hey David.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Thank you. Good morning Marty and Efrain. ","Martin Mucci","Good morning. ","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Marty you highlighted that up-tick in competitive takeaways recently. Could you just flush out those comments a little bit. Why do you think your competitive takeaways are increasing? It seems that there has been an increase in innovation generally across the payroll services industry. ","Martin Mucci","Yes. Well, when I think, you know I think we\u2019ve been a big part of that innovation up-tick. When you think about where we were just a few years ago versus today, online product very strong and we are seeing a big push from clients looking for online products. We have a very good online product, we are continuing to add to that constantly and the report writer and report builder products are very strong for us. ","Then you have mobility, so we are really \u2013 I think we have the best mobility product out there from a combined product breadth for the clients, so you can have everything on you. You can get to one to two clients, you can do your own payroll, your employees use it for certainly their pay stubs and W2s and 401(k) information. So I think we\u2019ve been part of that. ","I think that\u2019s helped us between that and the great service that we\u2019ve always been know for. I think it has put us in a very good position and I think the sales team has really hit those strides in execution, particularly the last half of last year and continued into the first quarter this year are just doing very well. ","We\u2019ve also gone after \u2013 not only we\u2019ve had very good referrals from CPAs over the years, but we\u2019ve gone after making sure we are getting the CPAs that we hadn\u2019t in previous years, with a lot of work that Mark Bottini and the sales team are doing with more direct hitting CPAs that haven\u2019t necessarily referred in past years and getting into those, and the bank channel has picked up for us for us as well as franchise referrals. ","So we\u2019ve signed up not only the support of like SUBWAY and Tim Hortons and Yum Brands and Midas, but also from our banks; Union Bank and SunTrust of course and a number of others, we all have strong relationship. So I think all that\u2019s helping us kind of beat the competition a little bit more than we have in the past. ","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Along the same vein, your primary national competitor has talked about completing their entire small business base over to a SaaS base platform by the end of June of next year. Do you think that will have any impact on your head-to-head competitive success versus them? ","Martin Mucci","I don\u2019t think so. I think for those clients who want a SaaS base offering, we have a very good one and what we I think combined very well is the dedicated personal service with that offering. So you can have a great online offering and I\u2019m sure our competitors do, but I think we have a extremely competitive offering that we\u2019ve invested in for a number of years and knew this was coming, and on top of that just have always provided that great dedicated service, very personalized to the client and I think that helps a lot. ","What we like to show a client from a sales perspective is if your getting on with us from payroll, particularly in that under 20 range, look you can do your payroll on your mobile phone, you can do it online, you can do it through a payroll specialist, you can change up, you can call us when you need to, you always have a dedicated person available to you and I think that on top of having the innovation has prepared us very well, even as clients move to a SaaS based offering, we have a very strong one and a number of clients, a great number of our clients are on a SaaS based offering already. ","Efrain Rivera","And David what I\u2019d add to what Marty said is that when a client is interested in payroll and they are searching particularly over the web, I\u2019ve said this to many of you, we don\u2019t steer them one way or the other. If what they want is a SaaS based solution, they want to get up and running quickly, SurePayroll is there and they do a phenomenal job. ","Not every client wants that. Some clients want more service. Service matters. Make no mistake about it. We know that from research, we know at what size clients service matters. If you leave yourself in a situation where you\u2019re only offering your SaaS, you\u2019ve exposed some vulnerability, because clients do value and are willing to pay for service.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Understood. Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. A clean quarter. Just a few sort of number questions. Just the first one for Efrain. On the HRS revenue growth, the 17%, could you just sort of help us sort of parse the benefit from the acquisition of and also the premium healthcare product. I know you called out what it was as a percentage of total service revenue and if my math was right its, I don\u2019t know, $6.5 million of revenue, but what I was trying to understand is what the contribution to that 17% revenue growth in HRS was along with the acquisition benefit?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, acquisition benefit is negligible. It really wasn\u2019t very much, so essentially nothing. On the service revenue you said 6.5, that\u2019s not quite correct. I said 2.5% of total service revenue, so its more in the $16 million range than the $6 million.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","Yes, I said $16 million, must have just misheard.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So that was the benefit from the accounting change.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","But you restated the prior year thought too, right.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, that\u2019s correct. Yes, we did, yes.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","So the growth contribution is less than the $16 million, right.","Martin Mucci","No, we didn\u2019t have it in the first half though.","Efrain Rivera","No Glenn. In the first quarter the numbers include some element of the adjustment, because the first quarter of last year as we stated has a workers comp gross up. So the right apple to apples is an addition of $16 million for the change.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on the margin expectations throughout the year, you were sort of asked this question before, but obviously typically your first quarter\u2019s the strongest and you again had another strong sort of margin quarter, not as strong as a year ago quarter and you obviously had a very tough comparison versus a year ago. But how should we think about the seasonal pattern of the margins. Is the first quarter typically going to be as it is historically going to be the strongest margin quarter of the year?","Efrain Rivera","Its typically been the pattern. I mean it could change in a year given investments, but typically we\u2019re going to have our strongest quarter in the first quarter. At least the trajectory of the direction Glenn is going to be similar to prior years.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay, and then just quickly, I can then infer from your pricing commentary and your attrition commentary, it sounds like competitively your seeing no change. At a minimum you feel at least stable to perhaps somewhat better competitively.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I would say somewhat better Glenn. I think definitely between the momentum of the innovation and the products that we are offering and the execution from sales, we are feeling better from a competitive standpoint. So yes, I feel the market, the competitive environment hasn\u2019t really changed all that much and we feel we\u2019re even in the best position we\u2019ve probably been in a long time.","Efrain Rivera","Just to add to Marty\u2019s comment, Marty called out the recent review we got for our online product and we don\u2019t highlight SurePayrolls numerous awards. We win a lot of technology awards. ","I think seven years ago, five years ago we recognized that there were investments to be made. If you look at the breadth of products that we\u2019ve got, you look at nettime, you look at myStaffingPro, you look at ExpenseWire, these are all leading products in their respective categories. So we understand this is a technology gain. We are very, very clear on that.","We also understand which some people in the market seem to be forgetting, its also a service gain and especially in the under 50 space where we have 94% of our clients. Ability to provide service is a differentiator and while some people don\u2019t seem to be thinking it is, we\u2019ve done the research and we know it is. So we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks. Good morning. With the checks per payroll growth around 1%, how much of that 1% do you think is mix, maybe bringing that down versus actual hiring trends? ","Martin Mucci","So if I give you 1% Sara, that\u2019s an apple-to-apples. So we modified the methodology a little bit using our normal methodology and also doing same store. Same store for us is about 1%. If you don\u2019t do it the other way we\u2019re doing it, there\u2019s probably a two-tenths difference; its not significant. So the 1% probably is \u2013 well, not probably, but is a hiring within the base. ","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So really, your seeing really slower hiring than you had been before.","Efrain Rivera","I would say if you just look at our small business index, so where we\u2019ve seen, where definitely this year has been strong at the rate of growth in hiring in small business over last year and even thought its been a little, its tempered down a little bit the last three out of four months, its still stronger than last year and its definitely stronger than our base year for the index, which is 2004. Its like a whole percent stronger hiring growth rate in small businesses under 50 employees. So we still think that hiring is up over last year, even though it tempered a little in the summer. Its still stronger than last year and we\u2019re certainly benefiting from that.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then separately, last quarter you talked about new sales growth being the highest that you\u2019ve seen; I think it was in seven years. Did you see continued momentum along those lines in the first quarter?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, definitely. Definitely felt that the execution continued. We are seeing not only good unit growth in the number of sales, but also holding price and gaining in kind of the revenue per client. So we are seeing very good sales execution and feel very good that that momentum has continued and we certainly are looking forward to continue through a big selling season here coming up.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, and then just last question I wanted to clarify something from earlier. The sales force hiring for the fiscal year, you said you\u2019ve done about 3% so far. I had thought that you were thinking about planning on doing 5%. Is the target now 3%?","Efrain Rivera","No, I think that probably what happened there was we were comparing against where we were at a point prior to the year. Right now we\u2019re about 4%, close to 4.5% higher than we were last year. So at the end of May we\u2019re about 4.5% higher than we are.","Martin Mucci","But we were down a little bit. Last year headcount, there was a little bit more turnover. Turnover has come down a lot and it wasn\u2019t super high last year, but it was higher than it is now and so turnover is come down and we were a little bit low, below where we wanted to be last year at some points of the year and where we are now is besides the new hiring everything is fully staffed, in fact overstaffed in a few areas.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you very much.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks so much. Sorry, just a quick follow-up on the sales force question. Assuming normal turnover will sales force have probably stayed relatively stable for the rest of the year, is that correct?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think what we\u2019re saying is it would be up. It will stay fairly stable for now, from where we are now, yes. ","Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets","That\u2019s my question.","Martin Mucci","Yes.","Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, great. And then just on the seasonality side, Efrain I know you called out a few things last quarter regarding growth rates in the HRS revenue and your operating margins for each quarter. Any changes to that or anything else we need to be aware of on a seasonal basis. Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","Not particularly. We\u2019ll call out in next quarter\u2019s call if we see anything\u2019s that are different from guidance, but no. I think the other thing Jeff I\u2019d say is that if you look at the presentation that we posted, should have posted it just recently, we have the supplemental guidance schedule at the end there. We are still within those ranges, so if you look at that closely, that\u2019s a pretty good guide for where we expect to be.","Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets","All right, great. I\u2019ll take a look at that. Thanks so much.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Keen with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Keen - Deutsche Bank","Yes, hi guys; just a couple of clarifications. What percentage of the new sales is going towards the SaaS based solution versus more of a full service model in core payroll?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, we don\u2019t break that out Brian specifically and its becoming increasingly difficult to do so and the reason for that is that not only do we have SurePayroll, but we also have our own online product, which Marty talked about earlier. If you combine both of those, you\u2019re probably up over a quarter, maybe even 30% or so of sales in those models. That\u2019s about as definitive as we can get.","Brian Keen - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And the record sales you guys have seen, does that get us to potentially outside kind of the guided range? Are we trending above the range of kind of where we guided to for core and HR? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense. How does it translate into revenue if the sales numbers seem to be due and come track it ahead of plan.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, no. I don\u2019t think we are ready to start changing the guidance ranges. I would say we feel pretty comfortable that we\u2019re well within those guidance ranges. Build revenue builds over the course of the year and while we feel real good about Q1, we still have three quarters to go. We\u2019ll get a better picture as we get through the selling season, get some early signs. ","Brian Keen - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and just last question for me. It looked like finally we turned the corner on interest and clients\u2019 funds, but just your expectations, we always get the question on rates and rate increases. Just maybe give us an update on that. Thanks so much.","Efrain Rivera","So you know our assumption is not much is going to change in this fiscal, so this fiscal growth is to May. We think the real action then starts to occur in 2016. The fed is really giving a lot of very inconsistent signals. It looks like they want to race sooner rather than later, but our planning assumption is really, its going to be a 2016 event, not a 2015 event. If they do it, obviously we\u2019ll be happy with it, but its probably a next year event.","Brian Keen - Deutsche Bank"," ","And then just remind us, a raise of 25 basis points or just the impact of the model, just so we can get ready for it.","Efrain Rivera","It\u2019s about between $4 million and $5 million; that\u2019s the cliff notes version. It\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that, but that\u2019s our disclosure in the Q, so yes. It starts to add up in a hurry if we get what we hope, which is a rise in short term interest rates and the long part of the yield curve also goes up.","Brian Keen - Deutsche Bank","Okay, super. Thanks so much.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis.","Jim MacDonald - First Analysis ","Yes, good morning guys.","Efrain Rivera","Good morning.","Jim MacDonald - First Analysis ","I just wanted to clarify a comment. Marty, I think you said something about moving down market with your sales force. Maybe you could explain that.","Martin Mucci","Yes, one of the things is that we found that in selling, our approach in the past has been a lot in what we call core payroll sales side. Its been very much the sell-in payroll and then the other sales teams would kind of reach in over time at different stages to say, hey, are you ready now for a 401(k) or workers comp or health insurance and so forth and while we made some changes this year in saying that if you\u2019re a certain size, that we are coming in now with a combined sales force. ","So I guess what I\u2019m saying is, we\u2019ve kind of moved down in offering the full breadth of our services right up front in the way we approach a client and I think we\u2019ve gotten some nice traction and good stories on it already. By approaching a client with multiple sales teams together at once if they are lets say 20 employees, you might go in with HR Outsourcing, 401(k) and payroll all at the same time. In the past our model was much more, hey I\u2019ll sell you payroll and then the other teams will come in after you\u2019ve had a month or two on the service and see if you need something else. ","So we\u2019re finding that that kind of the need for those services, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen this, has kind of pushed down over time and with the technology and the number of products available and we think that this is a better way to capitalize on some of that. Its making sure the full need of the client is addressed right up front as opposed to our traditional model, which was selling them payroll right up front.","Efrain Rivera","And I would say one other thing Jim is that our sales force execution capability is really, really superb and that\u2019s helped us to understand the potential of this integrated selling approach and its paying dividends, yes. ","Jim MacDonald - First Analysis ","And maybe just another update on how you\u2019re doing in the middle markets. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve talked about that much yet.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think there we\u2019ve offered an awful lot of products, so we\u2019re combining all that product. I think you\u2019ll see shortly we are going to kind of brand that whole thing together, because we\u2019ve been adding a lot of product as Efrain said and mentioned. ","MyStaffingPro, ExpenseWire, our own Paychex, next generation offerings, our time and attendance now with both our legacy product and nettime and we are in the process of being sure. Now we\u2019ve already been selling it that way, but we are kind of bundling it all together and we\u2019ll be announcing that shortly to kind of put a tag all the way around that, along with we\u2019ve been changing some of the service model there to be sure that when you have multi products from us, that its handled as smoothly as possible from a multi product standpoint. ","So mid market is, we\u2019d always like it to be stronger, but its doing well against the competition that\u2019s out there and because I think we have a full breadth of product as well as a great sales team there.","Jim MacDonald - First Analysis ","Thanks very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Tim McHugh - William Blair","Yes, thanks. Just following up on that last one I guess, are you seeing faster growth in the middle market or amongst your smaller customer base at this point, just relative to each other?","Martin Mucci","Relative I\u2019d say, kind of the small under 50 is stronger. I think that\u2019s the marketplace. I think that\u2019s the economy. What we are seeing is small business starting to pick up finally. Still not where it was, but that\u2019s starting to pick up and that we\u2019re offering that approach of \u2013 we\u2019ve already been offering the larger clients the 50 plus, the multitude of products upfront. This approach of selling the breadth of our services below 50 on the front end is a newer approach and so I think that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re picking up there a little bit faster because of that approach. ","Also, the referral channels that I talk about, the banking, the franchise and of course are continuing in the CPA referral model, its always been strong for us, that\u2019s where you see the smaller business growth come from, because these are start-ups or companies that have reached the size, that under 50, but that they need a payroll solution. So I definitely say that the under 50 is seeing a little bit stronger growth rate now. I think that\u2019s more because of those things than anything.","Tim McHugh - William Blair","And the change in the PEO business in terms of the self assured plans, I get that counting impact that you\u2019ve described to us, but I guess is it driving a significant improvement or acceleration in the growth rate of that business as well. I mean is it also helping in the unit adds in a big way, because its more attractive to people.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I mean its still fairly new to us, but I definitely \u2013 we did it as much, because from a competitive standpoint we felt that it was worth taking on a little bit more of the risk and so forth, because we had even more competitive product. ","We still have a number of carriers, but this plan particularly in Florida where it\u2019s a very competitive PEO market I think put us in a great spot. We\u2019ll find out a lot more in the next quarter or so as you get into the true selling season of benefits and so forth, but we feel very good that that\u2019s positioned us even more competitively now in the PEO.","Efrain Rivera","And we also \u2013 just to add to what Marty said, I mean we really have a terrific PEO team and group that manages that business. So I think our execution capability, our product capability have never been better.","Tim McHugh - William Blair","Can you or would you, in terms of the comprehensive I know you report comprehensive HR Outsourcing, kind of work side employees. Can you give us a rough sense of how much of that is PEO at this point and how big is that business now for you guys?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, its still relatively, I should say on the gross of it \u2013 I was going to say it was relatively small. Its still not the bulk of HRS, but its growing in importance. Tim, the reason why I give you a somewhat imprecise answer there is that unlike other competitors, we manage our ASO and PEO and this other smaller product we call HR essentially, which is a lighter version of our outsourcing product together in one sales force and we are somewhat still agnostic in terms of whether a sales person sells a PEO or ASO. Its going to depend on what client needs are.","HRO, HR Outsourcing is the biggest part of HR services and that\u2019s where we are seeing the growth in that segment of the business. PEO, ASO, for us they are largely interchangeable, both from a financial metrics standpoint, excluding the gross up, because that has a little bit of an impact on margins. But in terms of the offering, we go to market where we are willing to sell either depending on what the client wants. ","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think the point there is Efrain saying, when you look at all the products combined, that outsourcing of the HR function is a significant part of the HRS business and I think as we said in fourth quarter, we don\u2019t give the numbers, all that probably one a year, but we service more client employees than any competitor combined and I think for the most part probably any two competitors combined. When you combined PEO, ASO and what Efrain\u2019s HRE, kind of an essential offering, we are the largest HR outsourcer in that product set. So we are very proud of that and that growth is going very well. ","Tim McHugh - William Blair","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is fro David Grossman with Stifel.","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, thank you. I\u2019m wondering if we can just go back to another question, because maybe I just misunderstood. But when we look at the growth year-over-year of 17% in that HRS line, to get an apples-to-apples number, should we backing out $16 million of this year revenue, because that\u2019s \u2026","Martin Mucci","That\u2019s correct.","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","So it looks like then the growth rate was about 10% year-over-year. Does that sound right to you?","Efrain Rivera","Not too far off.","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Right. And is that, I don\u2019t know if I got good comps for the year, for the fiscal \u201813 year. So is that deceleration from what we say last year or last years numbers.","Efrain Rivera","Its comparable to Q4 of last year. ","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And then, but the guidance for the year is \u2013 how do we normalize that guidance for the\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so I think we went through that David. So we have a 16% to 19% guidance range and we said about 5% of it is the PEO. 16% to 19% HRS to be precise and minus 5%, so you pick the number you feel makes more sense. So I think the gist to your question, not reading in too much is that we expect HRS to accelerate as the year goes on.","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Right, and what is the basis for that, based on \u2013 because you guys certainly improve your visibility in your business, so\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I think there is probably three things on that; one is we expect insurance services to accelerate as we go through the year, that\u2019s a function of a number of things, not the least of which is being fully staffed and anniversarying some comparison in that business that we talked last year, that\u2019s one. And then I think as Marty said, we talked a lot of this call, just the growth and the momentum in HR outsourcing services we think continues to build through the quarters and through the year. ","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Right and just on that last point, is there anything we should be thinking about in the context of what\u2019s going on, either with the affordable care act or the regulatory environment at larger that would make us more optimistic or less optimistic over the next 12 to 18 months.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I\u2019ll let Marty talk to kind of compliance related products, which is its own sort of set of discussions. But I do want to clarify that our guidance doesn\u2019t assume that there is some material change in what we are seeing in terms of up-tick of some of the compliance related products, which Marty can talk to a second. We just are looking at based on the rate and on our plan where we expect to be as the year progresses. ","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think in general, David its not getting any less regulated. Everything is getting more complex and so one, regulations aren\u2019t going to get any easier and the healthcare reform just continues to drive a lot of confusion at all levels as to when its kicking in, what does it mean for them and I think its probably still pretty fluid from the way things have been. ","Second, the technology has gotten a lot better, the innovation has gotten a lot better, and for example our products and in others products, other competitors products that drive the ability to use HR services online at a lower level of client size, employee size and so a lot of that is come down because the technology and the products have gotten better and I think that that bodes well for us. ","We talk about time and attendance, and we talk about HR administration online, products that we have. These used to be 50 plus solidly, 50 to 100 plus. They\u2019ve come down and many clients are using them now, and the mobility offerings make it a lot easier as well. We find that the mobility offerings are being used by clients for everything from their employee contact list to reviewing an employees 401(k) with them right face to face, just looking at their mobile app. So all that bodes well I think for demand for HR online, payroll online and a lot of the other. ","We didn\u2019t even really touch on 401(k), but 401(k) continues to be very strong as well. I think the market leaves it always a little shaky and 401(k) whether to jump in or not, but we are certainly seeing assets increase and our initiative on large market, larger plans has started to pick up and pay some dividends as well. ","Efrain Rivera","Yes, and just to build on Marty, I just focused almost exclusively on HR outsourcing, but we also expect that our retirement services revenue is going to build through the year too. ","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","Right. And just one last thing; again, based on the comment you made earlier, if the quarter came in perhaps a little bit stronger than you had anticipated and again, that you typically have pretty good visibility on your business going into a year, let alone a quarter, can you help us better understand what the components were that maybe kind of drove a slightly better result than you had anticipated. ","Efrain Rivera","Yes, David I think I\u2019d just leave it that to say we thought we had a strong quarter, we were pleased with it. If we were happy with what we saw on the payroll service side and HRS continue to performer strongly, I\u2019m cautious about getting too granular about projecting Q1 trends for the remainder of the year, because as I said easier, we try to give annual guidance and stick with that, so we don\u2019t get into a quarter-over-quarter conversation. ","And the only think on caveat is the selling season is important to us and its good to start well, its much, much better to finish well and so we will continue to work on doing that, so we can continue to deliver good results. ","David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus","All right, fair enough. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tim Wiley with Wells Fargo.","Tim Wiley - Wells Fargo ","Thanks and good morning. I wanted to \u2013 you just touched on it, but my question was about the 401(k) and retirement services business on two fronts. First was, I remember \u2013 I guess this is probably within the last couple of years. There was some shift towards different kind of plans that I think was sort of herding the revenue growth relative to asset or account growth in that business. I\u2019m sort of curious if we\u2019ve sort of cycled through that and there is not any kind of revenue issue relative to account growth or asset values that would have been a headwind like you transitioned through. ","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think you have might been \u2013 I\u2019m sorry go ahead. ","Tim Wiley - Wells Fargo ","No, and then the second part of the question if I could was just again you talked about the confidence you have in that business. Just anything specific to sales or product or if there are different referral channels that maybe more productive around 401(k) and retirement services that you are focused or sort of figured out some opportunities around the sales management referral channels to help that business. ","Efrain Rivera","I\u2019ll let Marty take the second part. So the first part Tim, I think you might be referring to the fact that about two years ago or so we decided to take a portion of the retirement services sales force and dedicate them to the up market. When we did that, we took people who were servicing the smaller market out and didn\u2019t necessarily replace those. So we had a little bit of a transition in that business as we did that as the larger market reps were starting to ramp up. ","So we\u2019ve anniversaried that. We think that the larger market reps are doing a really good job and in execution its helped our growth rates and retirement services and fell that we\u2019ve got a nice runway in front of us. You can see that in part by the amount of the growth and assets that hasn\u2019t been just market growth, but its also been planed growth, meaning more plans and larger plans. So I think we are past that anniversary. ","I\u2019ll let Marty talk about the second part question. ","Martin Mucci","I think Efrain pretty much covered it. I think the other thing we were doing was, we were having a team that builds a lot more \u2013 focuses on relationships with the financial advisors and I think that that\u2019s really starting to pay some dividends there. ","It takes time to kind of build that relationships, so that they trust us going into not only a brand new client, but to go with a larger client and a conversion of a larger asset base and we are really starting to pickup I think some momentum there and some trust from financial advisors to not just give us the start-ups, but the larger clients as well and I think to us that gives us confidence that we are going to see the year either as we predicted or a little bit stronger. ","Tim Wiley - Wells Fargo ","Great. Thanks very much. ","Martin Mucci","Okay. ","Efrain Rivera","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird.","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Good morning and congratulations Martin and Efrain. ","Martin Mucci","Thanks Mark. ","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","With regards, just staying on the 401(k) for a second, so what sort of level of growth should we anticipate roughly speaking on return of services? ","Efrain Rivera","Mark, obviously we don\u2019t break that out. It doesn\u2019t grow quite as quickly as HRS overall, but it\u2019s a little bit less than that. ","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Just a little bit less that what, the organic underlying growth. ","Efrain Rivera","Correct yes, the organic underlying growth. Thanks for the clarification. ","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Yes, and then with regards to the healthcare offering on the PEO side, how should we think about the profitability of that. ","Efrain Rivera","The profitability of\u2026","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Of the minimum premium plan healthcare option. ","Efrain Rivera","Yes, that\u2019s an interesting discussion that\u2019s probably worth a long, long time. But for purposes of the financial statement it\u2019s a pass through. Its actually a little bit more complex than that, simply because you can make some money on the plan, but what ends up happening is that just helps you to be that more competitive in the future and buy down future rates. But from the standpoint of financial, our financial results, its largely a pass through. Whatever your expenses are, you are not permitted to take a margin on those expenses. ","","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","So, it sounds like the reality of what we should think about from an economic perspective would basically be that 11% to 14% growth on an underlying basis is really where we should focus. ","Efrain Rivera","That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, yes. ","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Okay, great. And then with regards to the core, really glad to hear about how things are shaping up. Can you talk a little bit about some of the sales force metrics with regards to both the turnover rate, as well as the percentage of sales people that are currently running at your historical quarter rates? ","Efrain Rivera","Yes, well one, for turnover it\u2019s a little bit below where we\u2019ve been historically. Kind of historical average is in that 30% to 35% turnover rate. We are at the low end to that range right now and that can always change, but for first quarter its been very good. ","The recruiting I think of the new reps has been very good. So I think we are picking up a very good quality of new reps and the training consistently has been revamped and so forth. I think its very good execution in the leadership team across the board from the senior team right to the district sales managers. It just feels like a good experience level now in that team and that they done very well.","So when you look at the metrics and I think I have said this, the units what they are selling, the number of units is good, as well as holding price. So that to us bodes well from an experience level and in execution of the rep. So they are not just going in selling price and we are getting more units at a low price. We are getting unit growth and revenue per unit growth. ","So again first quarter, but we are feeling positive about the execution of that sales team from those kind of metrics. ","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Great and is there a sizable percentage that are now approaching our old historical pre-recession quarter rates. ","Efrain Rivera","I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go that far. I would say from a annualized revenue perspective, there is certainly showing some promise, but I don\u2019t think again the economy isn\u2019t where it was pre-recession. But I\u2019d say, relative to the last few years and last year where we started to see really the best in seven years, we are still at that level. So it\u2019s defiantly the best we\u2019ve seen since the recession and it continues to go up. I wouldn\u2019t say its right at that pre-recession levels yet though. ","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","Right and then one last one. Marty, with regards to the commentary in terms of the competitive takeaways, I missed that in terms of who that\u2019s coming from. Can you\u2026","Martin Mucci","No, because I don\u2019t think I said. So it didn\u2019t miss the exact things here, but it certainly is the national player and as well as the regionals, more regional players. I think what you are seeing is, national player I think what we are doing very well is selling the value of our service combined with the technology and that means that they can be online or they can be a SaaS offering that\u2019s online with mobile or full service.","I think from the regional players what you are seeing is particularly smaller players in the market. They are struggling more with the technology. They don\u2019t have the mobility offerings, they don\u2019t have the online offerings. These are changing constantly. We are updating our mobile offerings probably every quarter with something new. And the smaller players just can\u2019t, you just can\u2019t keep up with that technology now and we are finding the clients are really using it. ","At the beginning it was sporadic use. It\u2019s a lot of use now. Not do much doing they payroll but for a reports, for information or working with their employees on issues. They are using the mobility a lot. "," ","Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird","That\u2019s great color. Thank you very much. ","Martin Mucci","You\u2019re welcome Mark.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein.","Lisa Ellis - Sanford Bernstein ","Hi guys, good morning and I\u2019m happy to be joining these calls. I had a question on the PEO business. Clearly, a healthy growth there. Can you characterize what if any risk you take on as you grow this business and sort of what the mitigation approaches are around that? ","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so Lisa there\u2019s two risks that everyone takes on, who is in the PEO business. It\u2019s the quality of the workers comp, underwriting and then secondarily, although we have talked a lot about minimum premium plans, we still have a lot of health insurance plans that are not under this cost sharing arrangements. ","In the cost sharing arrangements and I should say the risk sharing arrangements, if your healthcare book is not what you would expected it to be, you can end up with having more healthcare costs than you gauged and the same thing with workers comp. ","We use a number of sets of actuaries. I\u2019m pretty familiar with the underwriting process in both areas and we set the probabilities that we will exceed our targets at a very, very low rate. Meaning, when we ask our actuaries to do projections of what we think the costs are, we are not asking them to do a 95% probability and typically we\u2019re asking them to set it at 99%-plus. ","So on the workers comp side, we have done that over a number of years and have very, very good results managing books, our books of business on the workers comp side and we feel pretty comfortable we have very deep expertise on the healthcare side, understanding and assisting risks and in the last year really build up our underwriting capability and our management capability is the PEO. ","So we fell pretty comfortable. Wouldn\u2019t go down this route if we didn\u2019t. ","Lisa Ellis - Sanford Bernstein ","Yes, and has that been sort of the rate limiting factor on growth in the business, given we are seeing health growth in the PEO business is kind of across the industry and the economics, they are kind of coming in new to the space. ","Right, the economics to you and the economics to the client appear to be pretty compelling. So I\u2019m just trying to understand like really nice healthy growth, but why isn\u2019t that faster. Does it end up being the underwriting component of it that kind of rate limits that? ","Efrain Rivera","No. I think its one element of it, but Marty faces the decision around how to make tradeoffs with investments across a number of different sales forces that are growing and so I would say two or three years ago people who followed us closely knew we struggled a little bit in the PEO, took a breather, retooled and have really gotten ourselves back in the game. ","So I think our level of investment in that sales force is commensurate with what we think the opportunity is right now. And one other thing I would add to that is that its not just PEO for us. That\u2019s an important element of what we sell in HRO, but we have a very, very strong ASO business, which is very similar to PEO, but doesn\u2019t have some of the risk characteristics that the PEO does. So we\u2019re looking at it a bit more holistically than other competitors do.","Lisa Ellis - Sanford Bernstein ","Terrific, and real quick on the core payroll business. You mentioned that you\u2019re seeing continued growth in the number of clients in core payroll. I know you don\u2019t disclose that on a quarterly basis, but can you kind of bound that? I know in this past fiscal year it went up above 1% for the first time in several years. Are we sort of still running in that trajectory, stronger, weaker?","Efrain Rivera","So last year we finished at about 2%. We\u2019re certainly in that range.","Lisa Ellis - Sanford Bernstein ","Good. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning. Good results. So just quickly on the competitive take away question. I caught the national and regional, but what about against point solution providers. You made it pretty clear that service is still in high demand. How about the competitive take away versus point solution providers? ","Efrain Rivera","Okay, so define your definition Tien-tsin on\u2026","Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JPMorgan","Yes, I\u2019m thinking about point, you know I\u2019m thinking about call it a payroll always player or benefits only provider, only 401(k) administrator. Just trying to think about, unbundling all the different HRS solutions out there and seeing if maybe those are drifting in your direction. Does that make sense Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, it makes sense. ","Martin Mucci","And I think that that is \u2013 we tend to do very well again. I think that the demand for the HR, kind of the overlapping services is pushed down in the market and so with the technology and the offerings and so forth, and so I think the point service, kind of the point providers as you\u2019d say, I think its tougher for them to sell by themselves and the better you can integrate that experience and make it easier for the client, they do \u2013 more and more clients need multiple services and they are not as interested in, hey I\u2019m going to take things from three different providers. ","So the key is, okay now and you can see what we\u2019ve acquired over the years. We\u2019ve brought in these great point solutions and the key is to integrate them as seamlessly as possible from a service perspective for the clients, so that you\u2019re adding a lot more value. They don\u2019t have the time or the desire anymore to integrate themselves, the clients, to integrate three different products and I don\u2019t think, and so it\u2019s all a matter of integrating it in together and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve continued to do and we\u2019ll continue to work on.","Efrain Rivera","And Tien-tsin, in the under 50 space particularly, it maybe different in the enterprise space. What clients value about \u2013 one of the many things that clients value in that space is the ability to have one single point of access to your data. So a single sign on is really, really big and then when that single sign on is coupled with your ability to access all of the different aspects of the data that your trying to manage, be it health and benefits, 401(k), HR Outsourcing, that\u2019s really the compelling proposition. It maybe different in the enterprise space, but certainly in the under 50 space they are looking for that integration as Marty said.","Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JPMorgan","Yes, now that makes sense. Its just my only follow-on is just, I know there\u2019s a lot of questions on the 3%, the sales force increase, but given the single point of access, the sales person is now required to be smart on a lot of different subjects. So does that change your comp structure or even your go to market and how you touch the client?","Martin Mucci","No, not really. I mean I think we\u2019ve had it. We\u2019re very competitive first of all from the comp structure and we always made changes to be sure we stay very competitive on that, but also we are doing a lot of team selling. So the point I was trying to make earlier is that where we\u2019ve come down now, where that was always the approach, pretty much the approach anyway on the 50 plus, below 50 now and probably even in that 20 and above range, there\u2019s a lot more team selling going on. ","So we have expertise, not necessarily expecting the rep to know everything. Its saying, hey when you used to go in and sell payroll and then your 401(k) sales team would come in a month later or two months later or six months later. Now we go in together as a team on a lot of these leads and say what\u2019s the full breadth of what the client needs and look to sell them upfront. ","So its not necessarily requiring a lot more from each individual sales person, but more of a team approach to the way we\u2019re selling, which seems to be getting some traction now. I think the markets ready for it and I think we\u2019re going to \u2013 we will execute it well.","Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JPMorgan","Got it. Thanks Marty, thanks Efrain.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Martin Mucci","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Martin Mucci","Hi Ashwin.","Operator","Please check your mute.","Martin Mucci","Okay, I think Ashwin may have left the building.","Operator","I\u2019m not receiving any response and I\u2019m showing no further question.","Martin Mucci","Okay, at this point we will close the call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] ","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer to begin.","Martin Mucci","Great, thank you and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2019. You can access our earnings release on the Investor Relations webpage. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July and this teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.","On today's call, I will review business highlights for the fourth quarter. Efrain will review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2020 and then we'll open it up for your questions.","We closed fiscal 2019 with growth across our major product lines and solid progress toward our objectives. Our total revenue growth was 16% for the fourth quarter, which includes, of course, the incremental results from Oasis Outsourcing Group. Management Solutions revenue grew 4%, while PEO and Insurance Services revenues grew 67% or 10%, excluding the impact of Oasis. ","As we look back on fiscal \u201819, we had a solid service and retention performance, a number of innovative enhancements to our product offerings and mobile app and we completed the largest acquisition in our history. The acquisition of Oasis added scale to our PEO business, and we ended the fiscal year, serving 1.5 million work site employees across all of our HR outsourcing services.","In addition, we are beginning to realize the strategic benefits of the acquisition through the expansion of relationships with insurance partners and opportunities to upsell within the existing Oasis base. Our newly combined PEO leadership team continues to expand our leadership position in the HR outsourcing industry. ","Fiscal 2019 reflected excellent execution in client service and operations, as seen in our client retention and our client satisfaction scores. Our client retention has continued to increase from the prior year, and we ended the fiscal year with payroll client retention on par with our historic best. We have made significant investments in our salesforce this year, particularly in our [insight] [ph] sales and mid market sales forces and in demand generation.","These incremental investments are having an impact, as we have experienced increased sales momentum with these efforts. In addition, we have continued to produce solid new sales growth from our SurePayroll, HR solutions, retirement and PEO sales teams. The momentum in new sales coupled with improved client retention has resulted in overall growth in our payroll client base. As of May 31, 2019, we serve approximately 670,000 payroll clients. ","In addition, excluding work site employees acquired as part of the Oasis acquisition, the number of work site employees served by our HR outsourcing services reflected double digit growth. America\u2019s businesses are operating in challenging times. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in nearly 50 years, while employers try to ramp up their hiring. As a result, there is a lack of talent to fill open jobs and the regulatory environment is complicated and continuously changing. ","State jurisdictions are continuing to advance employment related laws and regulations that impact the hiring and employment of workers. Also, the way people work is changing, requiring employers to understand employees\u2019 workplace expectations, challenges and requirements. In this evolving landscape, businesses are looking for simple solutions that help them build their business, stay compliant, improve productivity and recruit, hire and retain talent. ","Paychex is uniquely positioned to meet these needs through our breadth of service offerings, but more importantly, through the combination of our innovative technology, and personalized service model. This sets us apart and allows us to be true partners and advocates for our clients. We renewed our commitment to reducing the complexity for our customers related to payroll benefits and HR administration when we launched our new branding earlier this year.","Our tagline, the power of simplicity, reinforces this commitment. We continually invest in our solutions to make payroll and HR administration simpler for our clients and their employees and provide solutions the way they are working today. 70% of the usage of our five star mobile app is done by our clients\u2019 employees. We are making it easier for the employees and more productive for our clients through an increased number of self service options. ","The enhancements we have made throughout this past year include the HR centre with performance and learning management and enhanced HR data analytics, benefits management enhancements with a refreshed enrollment experience for health and benefits and retirement and increased options through the use of chatbots and artificial intelligence. All of these enhancements are designed to provide simple solutions for our clients and their employees. ","This focus on steadily investing in the innovation of our Paychex Flex human capital management technology played a significant part in our recognition by NelsonHall as a leader in payroll outsourcing for the North American small business market. This was our third year in a row receiving this designation.","Shifting to other solutions, we currently face a retirement crisis in the US. A recent report from the US Federal Reserve found that a quarter of Americans have no retirement savings. We recently launched enhancements to our 401(k) product design to help address this crisis by simplifying retirement plan enrollment and management. These enhancements included a new participant dashboard and added functionality in the advisor portal.","The new participant dashboard makes the process of enrolling in a 401(k) simpler than ever, and also provides a unique combination of tools and resources to empower participants in preparing for the retirement. Our mobile app allows a new participant to enroll in as few as four clicks, which has already resulted in increased participation rates. ","We also continued to return value to our shareholders. In May, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.06 or 11% to $0.62 per share. During fiscal \u201919, we returned almost $900 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. ","In summary, our fourth quarter caps another successful year for Paychex. Our state-of-the-art technology, full suite of HCM product offerings, and world class personalized service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth within our market ecosystem. Our organic business combined with our new acquisitions have positioned us well for fiscal 2020 and beyond. The sustained efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients continue to drive the company forward.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such involve some risks. Please refer to our earnings release for the customary disclosures.","In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measurements exclude certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release and investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 to their related GAAP measures.","I\u2019ll start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I'll touch briefly on full year results and wrap with a review of the fiscal 2020 outlook. Total revenue and service revenue, both grew 16% for the fourth quarter to 980 million compared to 958, I'm sorry, and 958 million respectively. Excluding Oasis service revenue, total revenue both grew by 5%. ","Expenses increased 22% for the fourth quarter to 666 million, but if you exclude the Oasis acquisition, expense growth was 6%. The increase in total expenses excluding Oasis is primarily driven by increased headcount due to incremental investments in the salesforce, technology resources and operations to support the growth in business. In addition, an increase in PEO insurance costs contributed approximately 1% to the growth in total expenses in the fourth quarter. ","Operating income increased 4% to 314 million. Operating margin was 32.1% for the fourth quarter compared to 35.7% for the same period last year. Margins were impacted by business mix, but -- due to the growth in the PEO business, accelerated investments in sales, technology and operations as well as some one-time acquisition, integration and amortization costs associated with the Oasis acquisition.","Our effective income tax was 25.8% for the fourth quarter compared to 28.5% for the same period last year. Net income increased 6% to 230 million and adjusted net income increased 10% to 228 million for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.64 for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.63.","I\u2019ll now provide some additional color in selected areas, management solutions revenue. As you know, this includes our payroll service revenue together with other HCM products included in many of our product bundles. It increased 4% to 695 million for the fourth quarter. The increase was primarily driven by growth in our client base across many of our services, along with growth in payroll revenue, and payroll revenue per check, which increased or improved as a result of increases, net of discounts. ","Within management solutions revenue, retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in the number of plans served as well as an increase in revenue earned on the asset value participants, 401(k) funds, PEO and insurances revenue, it increased 67% as Marty mentioned to 263 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the acquisition of Oasis, PEO and Insurance Services revenue increased approximately 10% for the quarter. The increase was driven by growth in clients and client work site employees across our combined PBS and HROI PEO businesses. ","Demand for our existing PEO services along with growth within our client base resulted in double digit growth in the number of client work site employees served. Insurance service revenue benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit clients and applicants, partially offset by the impact of softness in the workers\u2019 comp market as we discussed last quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 25% for the fourth quarter to from 25, I'm sorry, 25% to 22 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. ","Average balances for interest on funds held for clients remained flat for the fourth quarter as the impact of lower client withholdings resulting from tax reform legislation and changes in client mix were partially offset by the impact of wage inflation. Interest expense, net, I\u2019ll note that we had a net non operating interest expense compared to net investment income in the prior year. This is a result of interest expense of the $800 million of debt financing that we utilized to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. The $800 million is made up of private placement debt securities with terms of seven or 10 years with coupon rates of 4.07% to 4.25% respectively. ","Now, let me touch on year-to-date results quickly. Management solutions revenue, again up 4% to 2.9 billion; PEO and Insurance Services revenue increased 48% to 822 million, 19%, excluding Oasis. Interest on funds held for clients, up 27% to 81 million, driven by interest rate increases and partially offset by impact of decline in average invested balances. Total revenues increased 12% to 3.8 billion, 7% growth excluding Oasis. ","Operating margins were 36.3%, tempered by investments in the business, the acquisition of Oasis and growth in the existing PEO direct insurance costs. Net income increased 4% and adjusted net income increased 11%. Diluted EPS increased 4% and adjusted diluted EPS also increased 11%. ","Turning to our investment portfolio, as you know, our goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long term portfolio has an average yield of 2.1% and average duration of 2.9 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2.1% and 1.9% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively. These are up from 1.7% and 1.5% for the respective periods last year.","Let's talk about our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of almost $800 million as of May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients were, as of May 31, 2019, were 3.8 billion compared to 4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018. As you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day to day basis, and averaged 4.1 billion for the fourth quarter and 4 billion for the fiscal year. ","Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of 20 million as of May 31, 2019 compared with net unrealized losses of 38 million as of May 31, 2018. The move to a net gain position was due to declines in longer term yields. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was 2.6 billion as of the end of the year, reflecting 827 million in dividends paid and $57 million worth of shares repurchased during 2019. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a very robust 42%. ","Cash flows from operations were 1.3 billion for the fiscal year, an increase of 1% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments, partially offset by fluctuations in working capital. Working capital fluctuations related to timing around collections and related tax payments for our combined PEO business along with higher accounts receivables related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing clients. ","Now, let's turn to the guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based upon current view of -- our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our management solutions revenue is anticipated to grow 4%. PEO and insurance revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 30% to 35%, reflecting a full year of Oasis. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in a range of 4% to 8%. ","At this stage, we do not contemplate either any increases, obviously less likely and no rate declines. We will watch and see what happens. Total revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. Operating income, as a percent of total revenue is anticipated to be approximately 36%, comparable with this year, reflecting the expected impact of higher PEO direct insurance costs. ","EBITDA margin for the fiscal year 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%, again, comparable to where we are -- where we end this year. Net interest expense is anticipated to be in the range of 15 million to 18 million, reflecting a full year of interest on outstanding long term debt, which I discussed previously. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Net income and diluted earnings per share are both anticipated to grow approximately 8% and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are both expected to increase in the range of 8% to 9%. And remember that we don't plan on necessarily the benefit of -- tax benefit when we get stock comp exercise, which is why we adjusted out.","I will provide further color on the gating. Management solutions revenue quarterly gating is anticipated to be consistent with the full year guidance, with the exception of the first quarter, which is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%, largely due to a mix of days in the quarter. However, please note that growth rates for the PEO and insurance revenues are anticipated to be significantly higher in the first half of the fiscal year, until we reach the anniversary of the Oasis acquisition. ","So, we anticipate growth in the range of 60% to 65% in the first half of fiscal 2020 and then growth of 11% to 14% in the second half. So, let me just repeat that. We anticipate growth in the range of 60% to 65% in the first half of fiscal 2020 for PEO and Insurance Services and then growth moderates to 11% to 14% in the second half, as we anniversary the Oasis acquisition. ","Our net income gating is also impacted by the timing of the Oasis acquisition together with related amortization expense and integration costs. This causes lower net income growth in the first half of the fiscal year. In addition, incremental investments in sales, technology and operations are ramped over the year during fiscal 2019. ","We expect net income growth to be below the full year guidance range provided at approximately 3% for the first half of the fiscal year. And then we expect it to increase to a range of 11% to 13% in the second half of the year. So, let me repeat that. We expect net income growth to be below the full year guidance range for the first half of the year, and we expect it to be approximately 3% for the first half of the fiscal year and then we expect it to increase to a range of 11% to 13% for the second half of the year, due to the factors described above. ","Then, one final point on -- specific to Q1, for the first quarter fiscal 2020, net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 1% to 2%, with the most significant driver being that of investment spending, funded by tax reform that was just starting to ramp up during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and incremental expenses from Oasis.","So with that, and with that color on the guidance, I will, one, refer you to our investor slides for more detail that have been posted on the web and I will now turn the pull back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Efrain . Operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call for any questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays.","Ramsey El-Assal","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask again, about just your operating margin guidance. You took it down a little bit and of course, you called out higher PEO direct insurance costs. Can you again just sort of remind us of the drivers of those higher costs? And also, are there any other secondary factors or headwinds. There was quite a bit of content in your remarks and just kind of parse out for us exactly what's happening in terms of your expectations for guidance for margins in this coming year?","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Ramsey, the first thing I'd say is that it wasn't a change from what we said before. We said that operating, when you go back to Q3, and we said it would be consistent with this year, which was 36%. That's what we called out this year. So I would say that, with respect to your question on the margins, what we're seeing is that we, by having more PEO revenue in the mix, it has a moderating impact on margins and it's offset by other efficiencies in the business, which is why even though our PEO revenues are up as a percentage of total revenues for the year, you see that the impact actually year-over-year is not significant. ","The other thing I would point you to is that in Q3, we said that our EBITDA margin would be comparable to our operating margin. And that's exactly what we just stated. So I think it's consistent with what we said before. ","Ramsey El-Assal","Fair enough. I wanted to ask you a broader kind of industry question about the PEO market in terms of further consolidation, just in terms of the industry, do you expect this market to kind of continue to consolidate, you\u2019ve got another couple of good sized players out there, probably a lot of smaller regional players as well, how do you see the market landscape changing? ","And then just a quick final bolt-on is, what interest rate assumptions are you using for your fluid income growth guidance. And with that, I can hop back in the queue.","Martin Mucci","Okay. Ramsey, I'll take the PEO one. I think you will see some further consolidation. I think as it becomes more competitive, you need to have the breadth of services and the relationships with the carriers to offer the best, both combination of product and service, the best technology from a mobile standpoint as well, for the enrollment of the benefits. And you got to have the experience to handle some of the pretty rapidly changing requirements from the state side and from the carriers on what the new insurance plans are, what the new rules are, and the HR piece of it is becoming even more important many times than the benefits themselves. ","So I think smaller players will find it, continue, will continue to find it difficult to provide and compete in this environment. And certainly with our acquisition of Oasis, there's been a lot -- even more interest, I think, in the consolidation and the growth in that market, which continues to grow very strong across the board. I think as I noted and Efrain mentioned I think as well, our growth in work site employees was double digits, even without the Oasis acquisition. So we're very proud of the sales and the service that we're providing in the PEO market.","And I'll turn it back to Efrain on the interest rate assumptions.","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so Ramsey, in my comments, I mentioned in the fourth quarter, our combined portfolios were 2.1%. You can see for the year, we were 1.9% for the full year, so I would expect that, when you look at the full year impact, we're going to tick up slightly from where we are in fourth quarter, we'll have a little bit of benefit from balances that should be a bit higher than what we had this year. But it's modest. You can see in the guidance, a 4% to 8% increase on interest on funds held for clients, we're being somewhat cautious on what we expect in terms of the portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider","I may have missed the exact client count growth, you used to call it out in your prepared remarks, can you maybe talk about, within segments, small, micro, small and mid market kind of where you [Technical Difficulty]","Martin Mucci","I think it's either on, I think it's on \u2013 in the press release, and it's on our investors slide. So we ended the year at about 670,000 clients. Last year, we disclosed 650. We saw growth or -- we saw a lot of growth in the SMB segment of the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America.","Jason Kupferberg","I just want to start with a question on core payroll revenue growth and thank you for the final quarter disclosure on that metric. I think it did slow to a point down to 2% in Q4 and came in I guess 2% rounded for the full year. Was that effectively all pricing? And then would you expect to get a similar amount of pricing in fiscal \u201820?","Efrain Rivera","Jason, I don't think it slowed. I think what you're seeing is that we anniversaried the acquisition of Lessor last year. So Q3 was a tick higher and it is very difficult, I would caution to compare Q3 to Q4 now, because Q3 has certain kinds of revenue that only recur -- only occur in that quarter. So, I think we ended up, we were pleased with where we ended up, we had client growth, we certainly saw some really robust results in parts of the market. Our internal sales were very good. SurePayroll had a really strong year and we are positioned really well from a digital marketing standpoint and from an internal sales standpoint. So I feel really good about where we're exiting the year. And obviously, we had client growth, which is the ultimate indicator of that.","Jason Kupferberg","And just anything on the pricing?","Efrain Rivera","Look, pricing is a part of -- is a part of the equation. So, we would expect certainly that we can continue to get price and never had an issue. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah, we've had, especially when you think about the client retention at historic highs, we think the pricing has stocked very well. And we've been able to sell the value of not only the technologies and that we've been introducing in the mobile app and so forth, but the service as well. So I think, still having the pricing in the same range we've been in the past, it should absolutely be doable, and we should be able to retain and hold that pricing as well. ","Jason Kupferberg","And I just wanted to make sure I heard the comments properly around the fluid income forecast. I think you indicated you're not assuming any changes in fed funds. I mean, obviously the market is pricing in a high probability of that next month. So I just wanted to make sure that you still got the rule of thumb right on that, if I recall, a 25 basis point change in fed funds is roughly a percent or so of net income, does that still hold?","Efrain Rivera","25 bps, no, it's not correct. So, it's about a 25 bp drop would results between in a impact of about 3 million to 4 million. So, I haven't done the, maybe that equates to 1%, but I would caution a little bit about that because one of the things that we looked at when we looked at the guidance was, we have ways to adjust the duration of the portfolio to deal with changes and modest changes or declines during the year. So I wouldn't necessarily take that to the bank, because we do have some things we can do, if we see some modest decreases during the year. And that's why we are conservative on the range we've provided. ","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And then just last one, kind of on the macro front. I know you guys obviously have no client concentration, but just wanted to see if we can get an update on which parts of the economy these days you're most exposed to, construction, manufacturing, service industries, restaurants, whatever it may be, just as people contemplate where the US economy may be heading in the next 12 to 18 months, how we should be thinking about Paychex\u2019s exposures?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think, we're pretty well spread across all of the different sectors. And I don't think we're seeing any big change in any of those. On our small business index that we put out for clients under 50, we're seeing kind of all sectors kind of hanging in there at the same, manufacturing has been down, but it's about the same. And I would say still the strongest from an index perspective is those other services, discretionary services, and those type of things that were pretty heavy in. ","And so I would think that they're still doing pretty well. And, they're still -- they're not necessarily growing, but they're growing, but they're growing at a slower rate than they have in the past. But they're still growing. And I think the thing would be to watch some of the minimum wage increases, and has that done anything. We haven't seen a big impact from those at this point. And instead, we're seeing sometimes more hours worked in general for those jobs. So I would say we're pretty spread out and we don't see any major concern at this point, we're not seeing any signs of necessarily a slowdown, still growth, little slower growth than in the past, but that was some of the recovery as well. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley of Wolfe Research.","James Berkley","Just wondering what you guys are seeing for bookings on the PEO side, you\u2019re still trending low double digit to low teens like you were last quarter, any change in cadence there. And could you walk us through the workers\u2019 comp and the way it impacts you going forward and just how you're thinking about that in the quarters ahead.","Martin Mucci","I would say on the PEO side, both existing client growth, and work site employees, and the new sales have been very strong. As I mentioned, we're double digit without the Oasis acquisition and of course, with that even stronger in the double digit side. So, we're showing very good strength in work site employees. We now across PEO ASO, all of our products, we serve more work site employees than anyone else. And we're showing great solid growth there.","As I mentioned, the need for HR and the benefits is so much -- so significant these days with the unemployment rate so low, particularly for small and mid-sized businesses, if they're going to attract and retain people, they really need the benefit of good benefits plans and good HR, which includes training and developing their people, data analytics, all the things that we're providing now, learning management systems that give them free training modules that they can use or develop their own. ","So I think we're going to see continued good strong growth in the PEO side, in particular, and of course, our ASO side as well, if they don't necessarily want the PEO or don't qualify under underwriting. We take them through the insurance agency, of which we\u2019re the 20th largest in the country. And that gives us a great out that even many other PEO competitors do not have in their favor.","Would you want to talk about workers\u2019 comp?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so just to add some color on that James, two of the strongest quarters from a bookings perspective in the entire company were PEO, which was very strong and then mid market, which was very strong too. So we had two parts of business that had very, very strong growth from a bookings perspective. On the workers\u2019 comp side, it was, as we called it, a soft quarter. We think that's going to persist for at least two or three quarters that's built into our guidance. Rates have softened pretty significantly. It tempers the growth of PEO. You can't see it as much because our PEO growth in the fourth quarter organically was in the upper teens. And so it's tempered a bit by the cyclical nature of the workers\u2019 comp market, which currently is soft, but we will see where we end up at the beginning of next year. So there's a couple of things that mask what is very, very strong performance on the PEO side and we were very heartened also by strong performance in mid market HCM.","James Berkley","That's good to hear. Just two more quick things I wanted to touch on. Something that you guys mentioned, you talked about SurePayroll briefly, just saying, you had a great year there and you expect them to do well going forward I think. Can you just expand on that a little bit? And then secondly, the duration comment you made, I think your portfolio is around like 3.1 years or so, like, what can you bring that to? And how would that impact the 3 million to 4 million you referenced? Just a little more color on how we should think about that. ","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I'll lead with the SurePayroll. Yeah, I think, we have really mastered the [indiscernible] demand generation, we've put a lot of investment in that from both SurePayroll and Flex and Paychex Flex. And I think we've really done a great job as far as the investments in improving demand generation and nurturing, meaning including nurturing leads, that were weaker leads in the past that we may have lost because we didn't -- they didn't -- weren't ready to buy it. But we've got a quite complex nurturing process now where we can reach out and continue to build the leads, and get them when they're ready. ","SurePayroll, I think has been, not only priced effectively, but also through the demand generation, getting a lot more leads and been able to close them and also allowing some self service options. So allowing clients to kind of onboard themselves if they wish, which was a lot more self service options that prospects want now. They can go in, they can start. If they need help, we\u2019ll jump in and help them. But that whole self service part of it is also another way of capturing a lead that was looking to get started right away and may have been difficult to reach if we call them back. ","So the whole change, the number of changes we've made in demand generation and handling telephonic sales, both here at Paychex and through SurePayroll have been very strong and we expect that growth to continue. I think the product, the service and the positioning of how we sell online and telephonically has become much stronger this year. ","Efrain, you want to take the\u2026?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so, yeah, you're right, James. So the duration of the portfolio is in the low 3s. We could stretch that up to about 3.75 years of duration if we wanted to. We're obviously playing a number of those different variables across different scenarios. So that's why, I think in response to Jason's question, actually, maybe Ramsey, and Jason\u2019s question, what we feel comfortable with is by setting the range where we are, we will just see where the fed ends up from a rate cut perspective and then we can adjust the portfolio accordingly to not have a major impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Keane","Just a couple of clarifications, on the payroll client growth of 3%, was that in line with expectations and how is that tracking historically? And should we just kind of model that same amount of growth going forward?","Efrain Rivera","Every year is a little bit different, Brian. So, I would say that what we say is that expect payroll client growth to be in the 1% to 3% range. Last year, we didn't hit that target. This year, we were solidly within that. I would say that going forward, we expect to be within that range. ","Brian Keane","And then thinking about the PEO insurance revenue growth, I know in the back half, we're talking about 11% to 14% growth. I'm guessing the fourth quarter will be the strongest quarter, though as some of the worker comp issues lap and then kind of growth rate should be a more normalized growth rate there once we get through the worker comp issue.","Efrain Rivera","I am going to hold off talking about it specifically, because there's, by the time we get to Q4, there'll be lots of specific issues that are going to affect -- could affect that growth number. So I hope, but I think what we're comfortable with is saying where we are at the second half, we\u2019ll update as we go through the year. ","Brian Keane","But the drag, primarily the drag out there in kind of the second half, is that workers\u2019 comp growth rate or just any other puts and takes? I know, the business obviously outperformed, growing 18, I think it was 18 to 20 was the guide for fiscal year \u201819 originally, and then. And now that's a little bit of a lower growth rate, ex that, so just trying to make the delta change.","Efrain Rivera","So I get where you're going, but I guess Brian, what I'd say is that we should have anniversaried a lot of the impacts by fourth quarter, but I have no idea of what the growth rate and the existing growth rate we\u2019ll be in at that point in market growth rate I should say, not ours, I know exactly what ours is. So I can\u2019t call that specifically. I think the fourth quarter will depend in large measure on how strong we exit the year, next year with PEO, with Oasis in the fold. So I think it's going to depend on that and also where we are with the workers\u2019 comp market. So they're still miles and miles to go before we get to Q4 of next year. But those will be the factors that will drive Q4 growth.","Brian Keane","[Technical Difficulty] continues to move and improve, how much room is there still to go that you can improve client retention?","Martin Mucci","Hi, Brian. You cut out just at the very beginning of that. Could you just say that again?","Brian Keane","Yeah, just was asking about client retention. That seems like it's continued to improve and move the right direction, just trying to figure out how much more room is there for that improve as you guys go forward here?","Martin Mucci","Okay. Yeah, I think we're very pleased with what we've done. We're at historic highs. So we'll always try to make that a little bit stronger. I think we're finding ways to service clients differently now, as they want to be serviced a little bit differently. It's not all -- it's probably half of them that want that necessarily telephonic payroll, dedicated payroll specialist, so many more are calling in, so many more are using the app, the chatbots and that we're doing for self service. ","So, it's putting us in a place that we haven't been before, that could drive a little bit of more improvement. But given the number of losses in small business, which is still a large majority of the clients, I'd have to say, I'd like to say, I do see some improvement, but it probably has some top level, it can get to when you just have a large number, half of them or more, a little bit more than that are just out of business. So it'll depend a little bit on, obviously, the economy as well. But those leaving for service, price and those things, I think and still get a little bit more of improvement out of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Just had a couple of modeling related questions, I know you typically don't guide to free cash flow. Is there anything going on differently next year or should we just kind of assume this typical conversion rate from EBITDA?","Efrain Rivera","I think it's probably typical, Jeff. We also gave, I think, in the investor slides, we give you an update on the D&A for next year versus this year. So, you can calculate the incremental amount. I know you're big on those two numbers. So as and, they're important, so they're in the slides there. But, there should be no significant changes in terms of conversion.","Jeff Silber","You caught me on that, Efrain. Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","You caught me so.","Jeff Silber","And then also just a minor one, you gave us some color on the cadence quarterly? I do appreciate that. Is there any specific impact from a margin perspective quarterly and also from a tax perspective quarterly?","Efrain Rivera","Well, I mean, from a net perspective, there's some impact. When you work through the model of what I said, where the first half is 3%, and I called out Q1, 1% to 2%, and then in the back half, so from a net perspective, obviously, in the back half, what you're seeing is higher margins. But part of it is too that, partly due to ASC 606, we have more -- we're more heavily back half weighted than we used to be before. And so if you look at our expenses, and you assume that there's not big changes quarter over quarter in our expenses, what you see is that the flow through of the incremental revenue drives higher income in the back half of the year. That's what you're seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta","Marty, I wanted to ask a little bit about the PEO business. I know, Oasis, you talked about investment both in sales and technology. And I'm wondering, what kind of growth you are anticipating next year for the Oasis sales force? And just from a technology standpoint, is that just that you're going to have a more robust mobile offering or are there other investments that you're making in the business?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think Kartik, what you'll see and we've already been doing some of this is linking them to our products. So, Oasis already now is linked to our time and attendance products. They are linked better to our interfacing with our 401(k) in our retirement services product. These are things that that salesforce has not had before. They also have the opportunity to use our insurance agency, which they didn't have before. So if they didn't, if it is a PEO, if the underwriting didn't fit primarily, they couldn't necessarily take them for insurance, for the insurance products. And now they can run those through our insurance agency. ","We're just kind of working through all of the sales teams, but we have all of the leadership team now in place for a number of months, for probably a quarter and they're working through combining all of the sales processes and compensation plans and directions. And so they'll have more products to offer. They'll have insurance, the insurance agencies to support them. And they'll certainly have all of the tools with salesforce and the level of technology that we use for our sales teams to track leads and referrals, et cetera. So, we're feeling that we're pretty solid coming into this fiscal year as we start this month with Oasis and our PEO teams really combined -- and underwriting as well, all kind of combined and streamlined, so that they're going to have a lot more to offer. ","Kartik Mehta","And then Marty, I think you talked about maybe changing of how you're obtaining clients in the sense that I don't know if you use this word or not, but inside sales, and has that, I guess how has over the last 6 to 12 months, changed as to how you're obtaining clients versus just sales force that knocks on doors versus somebody that's inside.","Martin Mucci ","Yeah, the inside sales or telephonic sales, from a Paychex standpoint, has continued to increase their production, their double digit growth over last year. We're also introducing, in trialing some self service and really through SurePayroll who has had that now for most of this year, now, you're seeing that, one, the leads come in, and they can either be addressed immediately by either the field or telephonically, depending kind of on the size and what they're looking for, if they're directly referred to by a CPA, who is tied to our field sales rep, we\u2019ll get them right to the field sales rep immediately. And they'll address it, if they'd rather just deal with something on the phone, do a demo over online, and then close on the sale right there and have it, implemented it, we\u2019ll do that. And now we're moving, you're going to see us moving toward a self service option as well that SurePayroll has, and has been working very effectively. ","One of the biggest issues with telephonic sales and leads frankly coming in is that once you have the lead where someone's been interested, they fill out a form, you can't get back a hold of the prospect, because nobody answers their phone anymore. So, what we're doing is, we're -- by allowing self service where the client can actually get started and set themselves up, if they have an issue, then we can talk to them. But they've already started by almost completing the sale by starting to set up themselves, which they'd like to do immediately. So that has also really turned out very well for us and we're seeing a lot of good leads there for sure. The field is still very important to us, particularly from a channel development, we still continue to be a leader, I think in the CPA referral market, incurring client referrals. And that's done very strongly by the field. And they'll continue to concentrate on that. But as more of the small, the brand new businesses start up and they come in through the web, the deal is how fast can you handle them and they're certainly fine with handling it over the phone or setting it up themselves.","Kartik Mehta","And then just one last question, Efrain, obviously the balance sheet, other acquisition opportunities that happen to come up, what's the comfort level in terms of leverage for the company today?","Efrain Rivera","Well, right now, we end the year, we're at zero net debt. So, we certainly have the ability to get more leverage, be more levered if we want to. Yeah. I don't think there's a specific number, we're going to be conservative about it obviously, a turn and a half of EBITDA that starts to get a little bit higher than, a little bit higher in the range, would we go higher, it would really depend on whether we thought an acquisition was strategic or not. So I think it depends on the, it depends on the opportunity. Oasis, we used cash on hand, we borrowed $800 million. Oasis is going to be cash accretive. We have the capability of doing the right kind of targeted acquisitions to be more acquisitive and it will depend on, it will depend on whether, what\u2019s the size of the acquisition and how strategic the opportunity is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel.","David Grossman","Just wanted to go back to the growth of the PEO, but I guess I'm just having a little trouble following the math. So perhaps you can go back and reconcile the organic growth of the PEO in the fourth quarter, which I think you said was about 10%, with the high teens growth for the year, and then the guide of 11 to 14 in the back half of the year, next year, which presumably is an organic number when you lap the comparison. I know workers\u2019 comp is a little bit of that. So if you could just maybe deconstruct that for us.","Efrain Rivera","So now, you started with a faulty premise, you said that PEO was 10%. PEO was not 10%. PEO and Insurance was 10% in the quarter. PEO, as I mentioned before, if we isolate it, was upper teens, number one. Work site growth, work site employee growth was again double digit, we didn't disclose an exact number. But you can see from the growth in work site employs that Marty cited, we're up to 1.5 million of work site employees serviced across our ASO and our PEO that we had nice growth. So, we had really good bookings growth organically on the PEO, the PEO at the end of the year organically was growing in the upper teens. And then in the back half of next year, we're calling up 11% to 14%, once we anniversary Oasis and what's going on there is that there's a drag from workers\u2019 comp that's impacting that number. So if there were no workers\u2019 comp, the number would be higher, based on where we anticipate things will be as we get to the third and fourth quarter of next year. So hopefully that \u2013","David Grossman","Right, so I'm sorry. So you are high teens PEO growth in the fourth quarter, and you are high teens for the year. Is that it?","Efrain Rivera","I think it's called out either on one of the slides or in, I called it out in my comments. But our PEO growth for the year was 19%.","David Grossman","Thank you for that clarification.","Efrain Rivera","It's always important to remember that PEO and Insurance as the Paychex Insurance Agency, and we're battling a bit of a drag on the workers\u2019 comp side that we will battle into next year. But we're obviously showing some pretty good underlying growth.","David Grossman","Right, right. And then just, there was a comment, I think, Marty, you made about the integration with the carriers, as it relates to Oasis. So perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on kind of where you are in that process and how much incremental geographic reach you're getting as a result of that, as you try to convert the payroll installed base?","Martin Mucci","Sure, David, there's really two pieces of that. Well, first of all, I think we're in good shape. We're in the middle of that now, but have been already working through it, and particularly the last few months. So one, there's geographic growth, because they were in some states and areas that we weren't. So, they had relationships there and already had some clients that we could gain referrals from. From the carriers, they were a stronger -- they were stronger with one particular carrier that we have not been quite as strong with that gave us a little bit more leverage when you put ours together. Now we have more strength and more clout with all the carriers that we\u2019re involved with. ","So we think we've got very good plans between the two of us, going forward into fiscal \u201820. And those were allowed kind of through the year. And so that gives us a better, also, when you have more, more clout, I guess or more clients, obviously, we\u2019ll have better integration with those carriers as well. So I think we're set up well with the number of carriers, the plans and the integration with them. So it's going to give us an expansion into a little more, a few more states that we're not in, but better than that, a little bit stronger carrier relations for the best benefit plans, which is one of the most important things to have as you go out and compete.","David Grossman","Right. So as you look at kind of the geographic template with Oasis, do you think you've got pretty much solid coverage across the overlap with your installed base and payroll customers?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, we certainly do, particularly, I wouldn't say it covers the whole map by any means, but it covers those states that particularly have an interest in PEO and I don\u2019t mean just the Georgia, Florida, Texas, California kind of thing, it's going into more states as we expand it, but it definitely picked up. I think they were in 14 different states, so we definitely picked up more states and where there is more interest in PEO, so it expanded where we were from that standpoint. And again, as I mentioned earlier, we're already integrating them with some of our products that they didn't have to offer as well. So not only do you get caught with the carriers and the benefit plans that they can offer, but also now they can more easily sell time and attendance that's integrated, 401(k) that's integrated, and they have our insurance agency to back them up if there's a client we don't want to underwrite.","Efrain Rivera","Hey David, one other thing I would say, I want to make sure that it's not implicit in the assumption in your question, PEO is probably, is unique among the products that we sell in that a significant amount of the sales come from outside the Paychex client base. So if you take HROI and Oasis, you now have access to clients that are outside of the Paychex traditional base, client base. So our expectations about growth in PEO are not solely based on the upsell of existing Paychex clients. They're based on going out and getting new, brand new to Paychex clients and PEO. So, it's a mixture of both. So, and we talked geographic coverage, not just the base. It's also being in those geographies in a more concentrated way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson.","Lisa Ellis","Can you talk a little bit about the investment focus areas for 2020? I mean, you've had terrific success now with the digital marketing initiatives, sales initiatives, et cetera. You've got client base up, retention up. As you're looking out into 2020, what's the next wave of investment areas?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think it continues to be in the innovation of the products and adding every -- about every six weeks, we're adding additional feature and functionality to the payroll products, and particularly the HR side of the business, whether it's learning management, whether it's a partnership with, let me stick with the product for a second, I want to go to partnership. But with the products like learning management, data analytics, I think you'll see also, we're continuing to invest in the chatbot and artificial intelligence that we're using. We're seeing that to be a big help from the service perspective, and also on the mobile app. So we're continuing to make things simple for clients and their employees. ","70% of our mobile app usage is employees of our clients. And what we're finding is things like when we make it easy to enroll in 401(k), they can do it in four clicks now versus the paperwork and the passing of the paperwork to the client and to us and back and forth. That participant rate is already going up. And those who are signing up for the 401(k), that leads to better client retention, because they now pass all the compliance tests. And they have their employees that are happy with their retirement plans and gives them better retention. ","So the investment will be to continue to make things simple from the mobile app side, from the client employee side, self service is going to be \u2013 it just continues to be very important, right from initially signing up, right through to setting up everything for yourself, there's a whole wave these days of clients and their employees wanting to do things themselves when they want to do it. So you've got to make everything simple. Luckily, our investments very long ago started to be, our development was mobile first, meaning everything is made, designed simple for the mobile app, and then can expand for your desktop, as you need it. ","So a big thing there. Partnerships will be again, for, we have the only large partnership that's been announced with Indeed. We are out there, providing a connection directly to Flex with basically the push of a tile or a button that will get you to Indeed and help you post a job, critically important right now in this low unemployment area. These are partnerships that we haven't necessarily done before and we're being much more aggressive in trying to partner with what the needs of the client have been. ","So, we're very pleased with the investments in artificial intelligence and chatbots. What that also, I didn't even mention, has done for service. Now we're taking, I mean, 60% of the service requests coming in on a chatbot are handled by that or coming in online are being handled by that chatbot. That's freeing up our personnel for much more complicated questions and for more clients that they can handle. So, it's really helping us from a service perspective as well.","Lisa Ellis","Efrain, I have a, just my follow up, a sort of back to basics question on the PEO and ASO business, because you've mentioned a few times now, your insurance agency, can you just remind us when and what types of clients you will take on the underlying actuarial risk? And then I guess I thought that you reinsure that. So can you just clarify, sort of in what situations does the client end up entering the PEO versus end up using your insurance agency potentially? And like what differentiates those two and sort of how does it impact your economics?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so just the 122nd flyover, on workers\u2019 comp, I'm going to say between 60% and 65% of all clients in PEO end up being underwritten by Paychex and then we set reserves and have reinsurance above certain levels, have been doing that for more than two decades without any issues. We look at that very, very closely. So then you say, well, what happens to the other third? Well, there's certain clients that you don't want to underwrite workers\u2019 comp or we have the unique advantage of having a insurance agency right next door. So we will place those clients with Paychex Insurance Agency. And one of the things that we found this year that was really a help was that by creating more of a tight linkage between the PEO and the insurance agency, it's now much more seamless to say to a client that otherwise we would not do workers\u2019 comp for, to simply refer them to the agency to see if they can get a policy place, that's been a big plus and a big hit with our sales force too.","On the healthcare side, it's primarily a state of Florida issue, there's a little bit of other risk we take. And that's just a function of the concentration of clients that we have in Florida, we have an MPP plan, we do insurance with the blues of Florida that gives access to a much broader network or to a broader network of healthcare providers. And again, we look at the projected MLRs or medical loss ratios for the pool, we adjust reserves appropriately and above a certain amount, we reinsure that risk. So that's basically what we're doing, more limited risk taking on the healthcare side, we take some risk on workers\u2019 comp, reinsure it, and then are very strict about who we let into the pool in either case, and refer other clients. By the way, I said, workers\u2019 comp in terms of insurance referrals, we also refer for healthcare to our agency. So we've got flexibility and this helps us kind of protect the quality of the pool and workers\u2019 comp in healthcare.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse.","Kevin McVeigh","Hey, so I know you mentioned a couple of times on the retention that you're bumping up against historical levels. So if you think about the investments you've made, kind of diversification into PEO, is it, what's the probability we enter a new range on that? And I guess, Marty, can you remind us kind of where we are, where that number is today? And if it is in fact the case, so we can kind of reset that range, what's a better way to think about that? And then just, what's the sensitivity to 100 basis points in terms of revenue?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I'll start with -- it's a little stronger than 82% on the client retention, the way we look at it. I think it's a little bit better than that from a revenue perspective, we don't typically give that but it's better than that. So our historic high has been right around that 82%. Now, when you think about, as I said Kevin earlier, when you think about losses for the small business side, it's pretty tough to get a lot better than that, because small businesses just start up and go out of business. And obviously, we've been able to handle that very effectively and profitably, but I think, we'll look through the investments that I just talked about, on Lisa's question, when you think about the investments in chatbots and artificial intelligence and responding to clients even quicker, is there something there not to mention, we've done a lot of investment in data analytics, and knowing models of which clients are, which clients are most likely to leave us and then we approach them kind of proactively through a retention team. ","I think all of those have that and the great service, which we are at historic highs for our net promoter score as well. I think are all benefiting that, getting us to the best. So do I think we can do a little bit better than that? I think so. But I just think it does have a top limit because of just the number of out of businesses that happened in the small business market.","Kevin McVeigh","And then just real quick, obviously, we've taken about 200 basis points investment, put it back into the business. But you've shifted a lot of the capacity of the cloud. So just trying to get a sense, where are we in that cloud evolution, number one, and then just obviously, there's certain amount of margin benefit from that as well. I guess, twofold, when do some of those investments run off? And then what's the uplift on the margin, as the capacity is done through the cloud as opposed to the traditional service?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think, pretty much, you can say everything is pretty much in the cloud now, the way the clients approach us and where our services are. I mean, everything is software as a service, and everything is built as I said, mobile first, everything is available that way. I think some of the additional investments that we've made and talked about will start to run off at the end of this year. We made an investment and a very deliberate investment, to speed up some of the product development that we could see ourselves doing in the future, instead, to take advantage of the tax savings, to instead of just run it off of the bottom line in a one-time kind of fashion. ","Hey, let's put some of this to accelerate the product development, we've been very happy with that. Obviously, it's driven the best client satisfaction and retention scores; it's improved our sales overall, our part growth is the best that's been in three years from a sales perspective. So we're feeling like the right investments were put in place for sales, for telephonic sales, for demand generation through marketing, and through IT, but some of that through the IT will start to come off towards the back of the year. I don't think we've given, hey, what that will do necessarily, the margins are probably will. But at this point, but it will roll off, some of that will go back down to a little bit less investment, normalized investment toward the end of this fiscal year. ","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Kevin, one other thing to answer that question qualitatively. As Marty said, the investments start to roll off as we exit this year, which is what we had said before. At that point, in the absence of any change in the mix of the business, you would expect operating margins now to start to float back up. The only caveat that I've said when I get asked on that question is what is the growth of the PEO, because the PEO has a moderating impact on margins. Now, the offset to that would be faster revenue growth potentially, but I would say as we go through the year, we'll have better sense of kind of what the overall margin of -- the underlying margin uplift excluding PEO is going to go up. PEO will have an impact, though, overall, depending on mix.","Kevin McVeigh","And Efrain if I could real quick, are you kind of where you are from a headcount perspective? Or would there be some more optimization based on kind of how the capacity sits?","Martin Mucci","You mean, just I in general, or are you specific to anything? ","Kevin McVeigh","I would say just the, either, however you want to answer that.","Martin Mucci","I think, look, we're always -- we've got a history of being very profitable and making sure that we keep our costs low. I think we continue to always look for leverage. As Efrain said, the change in the margins have been mostly because of the PEO business, and the way that that hits your financials drives a lot of revenue, but also has higher expenses and brings the kind of margin percent down. But I think we're always looking for ways to continue to leverage and I think the investments we've made, but again, back to when you think about artificial intelligence to chatbots, and so forth, answering 60%, 70% of the questions, we certainly are looking to continue to drive some headcount down where it's not needed. ","But we've also been very good at then reinvesting that headcount where it is needed. So for years, we've taken headcount out of operations, where we got more efficient and put it into technology, where we knew the market was going. So, I'm not sure head count itself, it will all depend on where the growth is. And of course, we've grown headcount, really because of the growth in the business, not necessarily we haven't -- we've never really de-leveraged from a headcount perspective in my, at least 15 years, we've always driven head count down, but may have invested that somewhere else.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Just a quick question on retention, you had a lot of good questions there already. But just on Oasis specifically, do you have pretty good line of sight now on the retention there in the initial period, I can't remember if you said that there's an opportunity to maybe improve retention there, once you apply the, maybe the Paychex lay there or not?","Efrain Rivera","We really haven't broken that out. I think we have a pretty good line of sight that it's been pretty solid. We had no surprises whatsoever, which is always good. And on acquisition, I think they've done a good job on the service side and selling to the right clients. We have not seen any fallout from insurance plan changes or anything else at this point. So I think the retention has been solid. And, there's always -- we're always looking for ways to improve it. But we certainly did not have any surprises and we're very satisfied with where they are on retention.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies.","Samad Samana","So Marty, based in your commentary, it looks like retention was up 100 basis points to 81% on last year's 10-K, you mentioned it's over 82% this fiscal year that just ended. So I'm curious, why did gross new customer adds grow in \u2013 or in fiscal \u201819 versus fiscal \u201818. I'm just trying to parse how much of that 3.1% total customer growth was driven by the improvement in gross retention versus new customer adds?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, it's a mix of both. We don't break it out and we don't give that level of detail. But certainly, the overall growth of clients was a benefit of both good sales results and a little bit better retention. Just that improvement and retention alone on the payroll side would not have made that total difference there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird.","Mark Marcon","I was wondering, you mentioned that in the mid market, you ended up seeing good growth. And I'm wondering specifically, were there some new additions to the overall bundle that\u2019s driving that? What's the primary driver do you think of the improvement there? And I'll leave it there for now.","Efrain Rivera","I think a couple of things. One, I think, certainly the product adjustments that were or the product enhancements that we've made, so adding data analytics, adding a new HR centre, what we call HR centre gives performance management support. Also, I did mention the learning management. So everything that's needed this year from a recruiting, training, the personnel development that clients have been looking for, prospects are looking for, we have added and made it much stronger. And so I think from a product set, that's very good. ","From a sales perspective, I think the approach of going totally with HR and the HR need has been very strong as well. So I think the approach of selling HR and approaching the client from their total HR needs has been strong and sales are up, probably the best growth we've seen again in three years in the mid market. And we seem to be on a good path to start the new fiscal year as well. ","Mark Marcon","That's great. And then any change in terms of the profile of those mid market clients in terms of who you're winning them from, or what sort of systems they had in place previously?","Efrain Rivera","No, I don't think so. I think from any of the competitors, I think we're doing pretty well, it's been pretty consistent. I think we're obviously winning a few more I think than we were. And I think that's again, the sales execution is stronger, the sales training is stronger, and the product itself is stronger. So we're pretty pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the mid market. And I wouldn't say it's from any one competitor. I think we're doing pretty well against all of them when you compare it historically.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then with regards to the improvements that you've made, it's been a very short period of time that you've already ramped up in terms of the chatbots, and the ability to answer questions, and you're getting the 60% to 70% of them now, where do you think that goes in a couple of years?","Efrain Rivera","See, I think, I mean, based on the improvement so far, and what I read, when you research this kind of around the country, I would think you could get up to 75%, maybe even 80%. And it's so easy. Well, I think it's easy, but our development team might not, but it's so -- you can be so responsive to the feedback of seeing if the question was answered or not that you get so much better about refining the questions that they're being able to read the questions or asking and respond to that, but I definitely think it could get up into the 75% range anyway, maybe even 80%.","Mark Marcon","And you're directly tying the improvement in terms of the client retention and the client satisfaction scores to people who utilize the chatbot or being serviced?","Efrain Rivera","I wouldn't say if that direct yet. I don't have it, that\u2019s specific, but I think it certainly is part of it. I mean, we really ramped that up this year. And obviously, we've seen good satisfaction and we get good results. We always ask the client, after they've received their answers to dissatisfy what you were looking for. And we're getting very good feedback on that and very good results. So it certainly I think has helped on the client satisfaction, but I think primarily, the satisfaction has been on the product, the ability of the product to serve the client, the ease of use of the product and the great service, personalized service that we're providing.","Mark Marcon","And then with regards to the self implementation on the small end, I know it's really early days, but are you seeing any sort of, maybe too early to tell, but is there any difference in terms of the client retention level that you see from clients that are willing to self implement?","Efrain Rivera","I think it's a little early to really have enough data there. But, what you do see is typically clients who set themselves up historically, even in a small sample, are more likely to be retained, because they feel like it was their fault that there was a problem because they set themselves up. And therefore, they own it a little bit more and they're a little more tolerant of giving us a chance to help fix the issue that they may have created.","Mark Marcon","And then lastly, just workers\u2019 comp for next year, and how we should think about Insurance Services. I'm not talking about the next fiscal year beyond the one that you've already guided for. But for the second half, when we go into the new calendar year, are you assuming that workers\u2019 comp rates are going to be down 15% to 25% in terms of your overall assumption, and then within PEO and insurance, were you expecting the insurance part to be down?","Efrain Rivera","Okay, so that's a compound question, you\u2019ve got two pieces to it. So let me just parse them. So with respect to workers\u2019 comp, workers, the workers\u2019 comp I'm talking about is not workers\u2019 comp that has anything to do with a PEO. So, take that out of your mind. So it\u2019s purely the workers\u2019 comp, yeah, Paychex\u2019s workers comp. So I would say, Mark, I don't know in the back half specifically, how much we have is down. But certainly in the first half, where we declined pretty significantly versus first half of last year and then it starts to moderate, the decline starts to moderate in the back half of the year, because we started to experience the declines in workers\u2019 comp heavily in third and fourth quarters. So I think it moderates as we go through the year. I would not expect the 15% to 20% down in fourth quarter, again, that's -- way too much. I would think we're getting closer to kind of flat or maybe even slightly above by the time we get to purchase, because we're anniversarying some sharp declines in the back half of the year.","Mark Marcon","And then just for the Insurance Services revenue?","Efrain Rivera","So insurance in total? No, because health and benefits is growing nicely, actually had a good quarter revenue wise for health and benefits. This is again, health insurance is to Paychex\u2019s clients. That's growing nicely at upper single digits. And, we'd expect that to continue to grow and grow nicely through the balance of the year.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.","Steven Wald","It\u2019s Steven Wald on for James. Just maybe one quick one, following up on the margin discussion, I think you said all else equal past sort of 2020, results with Oasis, expect the margin to sort of float up. I think on the last call, you have talked about expecting year-over-year EBITDA margin improvement in 2021. Can you speak to whether that's still your expectation? And also, maybe sort of, if the okay times are good times however you want to call it continue, what the sort of upper limit is on the EBITDA or operating margin?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, I'll answer the first and can\u2019t answer yet the second. I think we need to have a full year of Oasis under our belt to understand what the behavior of costs is in the business, we understand it will be in 21. We would expect EBITDA margin to float up in \u201821. There's many reasons for that. But, I think that we should see some improvement on EBITDA margin. What is the ceiling of that? A little bit early to say at this point? We'll have a better sense as we go through the year.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019ll now return the call to Mr. Mucci for any additional or closing remarks.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. And at this point, we\u2019ll close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast, the conference call will be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our fourth quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

Now I'd like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of Paychex's second quarter fiscal 2013 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday afternoon, after the market closed, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2012, and filed our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter. These are available by accessing our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This conference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.","On today's call, I will review the highlights for the second quarter in our operations, sales and product development areas, and Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for your questions.","Our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 reflect solid progress. We are focused on driving growth in revenue and profits while providing industry-leading service and technology solutions to our clients and their employees. Our client base, checks per payroll and client retention demonstrated continued positive growth. In fact, the growth in payroll service revenue and HR service revenue over the previous year's quarter accelerated in the second quarter versus first quarter.","Efrain will go into more detail on the financial results and comparisons. However, I would like to provide you with some highlights for the quarter. Payroll revenue grew by 1.4%, impacted by loss  revenue as a result of the impact of Hurricane Sandy. HRS revenue grew double digits for the second quarter as we continued to experience success in selling 401(k) and HR outsourcing and other value-added solutions to our clients. Total service revenue grew 5% versus 3% in the first quarter.","Checks per payroll has improved for 11 consecutive quarters, with second quarter growth at 1.2% compared to 1.8% for the prior year second quarter. Checks per payroll were impacted by Hurricane Sandy as well, and without Sandy, we believe checks per payroll would have only moderated slightly from our experience in the first quarter, which was 2%.","Client retention remains at near historic highs. Our first 6 months has us on track for another strong year and possibly historic year of retention. Execution in operations remains solid as evidenced by our exceptionally strong client satisfaction results. It is our exceptional client service along with our technology, I believe, that sets us apart from our competition.","We are seeing good results from our sales execution in the small business market and are well positioned for our peak selling season. As planned, we have added a number of territories and have placed new focus on franchise and banking opportunities. In addition, we have seen the core sales force turnover return to lower levels. We expect to see additional penetration of our products and services within our client base with the goal of increasing our share of revenue from our clients. Our SurePayroll business continues to perform well, with revenue growing at double digits.","From a technology perspective, progress continues on integrating our leading technology and mobility platform with our world-class customer service through the Paychex Next Generation suite. In October, we introduced the new best-in-class web-based Report Center for our clients and CPAs and have already received glowing reviews. We launched the newly designed Paychex Account Knowledge Center, which is a free online resource available to accountants through our website that brings valuable information and time-saving online tools to accounting professionals.","In addition, we also launched the new and improved BuildMyBiz.com. It now includes a number of new features that provide enhanced resources for entrepreneurs and small-business owners.","At the end of November, we acquired ExpenseWire, an online expense management solution for small to medium-sized businesses. We previously partnered with ExpenseWire to power our Paychex Expense Management, a web-based solution that provides clients with tools to manage and control their expense reporting process. This acquisition gives us the ability to further enhance and integrate our Paychex One-Source Solutions for major markets and provide even greater value to our clients.","As you're aware, Hurricane Sandy resulted in devastation in several areas on the East Coast. We are grateful that all of our employees are safe and though not all were untouched by this event. Sandy, resulted in the most significant test of our business continuity plan to date, involving 90% of our branch network either being impacted or covering those branches that were impacted. The effort was extremely successful. I'm extremely proud of the employees at Paychex, and this was a testament to the commitment of our employees across the nation to ensure that all clients still had exceptional service even during a devastating event. In addition, our employees demonstrated a commitment to their fellow colleagues, donating time and money to help them get back on their feet. The storm did have an impact on many of our clients. We estimate that there was approximately 0.5% impact to our payroll service revenue growth during the quarter.","In summary, fiscal 2013 reflects continued progress in growth metrics. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our CFO, to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty. Let me start with our standard legal disclaimer. You should be aware that certain written and oral statements made by us constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements should be evaluated in light of certain risk factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. Please refer to our press release for our discussion of forward-looking statements and the related risk factors.","As Marty indicated, our second quarter financial results for fiscal 2013 represented sequential improvement from the first quarter. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter and 6 months. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of the 2013 outlook.","Total service revenue grew 5% in second quarter and 4% for the 6 months. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 8% for both the second quarter and 6 months to $10 million and $20 million, respectively. This result was a byproduct of the current low interest rate environment. Expenses increased moderately, 4% for the second quarter and 3% for the 6 months. We continue to invest at a higher rate in product development and supporting technology, but this was partially offset by increased productivity within operations, which allowed us to maintain solid operating margins at 39.3%.","Operating income net of certain items increased 6% to $220 million for the first -- for the second quarter and 5% to $448 million for the 6 months. Operating income, net of certain items as a percentage of the service revenue, is expected to be lower in the remainder of fiscal 2013. As you know, expenses tend to be higher in the third quarter due to cost to support our calendar year end operations and sales season activity. In addition, we continue to invest in innovation. Net income increased 5% to $148 million for the second quarter and 4% to $301 million for the 6 months. Diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $0.41 per share for the second quarter and 4% to $0.83 per share for the 6 months.","Now let me turn to payroll service revenue. It increased 1% for both the second quarter and for the 6 months. We benefited from modest increase in checks per payroll and revenue per check. As Marty already mentioned, our checks per payroll continued to advance, increasing 1.2%, compared to the same period last year. This result reflects a moderation in last year's rate of growth in the second quarter, which was 1.8%. Revenue per check grew modestly as a result of price increases, partially offset by discounting. And as mentioned previously, payroll revenue growth was impacted by approximately 0.5% by loss revenue from Hurricane Sandy. Just to put what Marty said in perspective, we believe that approximately 20% of our branches were in the -- 20% of our clients were in the path of the storm and 15% of them were significantly impacted by the storm.","Now let me turn to HRS revenue. It increased 12% to $182 million for the second quarter and 10% to $365 million for the first 6 months. We were up significantly from the first quarter's 7% growth rate. HRS revenue growth reflects favorable trends in checks per payroll, price increases and also client growth.","Some highlights of the contributions to HRS revenue growth include Retirement Services revenue, which benefited from client growth and an increase in average asset value of Retirement Services client employees' funds. This was partially offset by the impact from a shift in the mix of assets within these funds to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers. And just a note to say that we believe that our segmentation results in the 401(k) area, which we talked about both at the Investor Day and on prior calls, is showing some good early results.","Paychex HR Solutions revenue was positively impacted by price increases and growth in both clients and client employees. The rate of growth was tempered by fewer client employees within our PEO compared to the previous quarter. Insurance services revenue benefited from strong growth, driven by an increase in the number of applicants, while workers' comp insurance delivered increases in both clients and in premium.","HRS revenue quarterly growth can vary due to the volume of clients, PEO workers' comp, and fees on our Retirement Services clients' employees' funds. These fees change due to fluctuations in the financial market and the asset value of funds invested. PEO net service revenue also exhibits greater variability between quarters due to a number of factors, which include changes in workers' compensation claims experienced.","Let me turn now to our investment portfolio. As you know we maintain a fairly conservative investment policy, and our goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity so that we can ensure that all of the cash commitments we've made with clients can be met. On the short-term side, our primary investment vehicle is high-quality variable rate demand notes and FDIC-insured deposit accounts. In the quarter, we had more VRDN investments than FDIC-insured deposits, and you can see that in the statement of cash flow.","In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds. Interest rate environment remains at historically low levels. Our combined portfolios have an average rate of return of 1.2% for both the second quarter and for the 6 months compared to 1.3% for the same periods last year.","Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% for both the second quarter and the 6 months to $10 million and $20 million, respectively. The decrease was driven by the decline in the average rate of return on this portfolio to 1.2% for both the second quarter and 6 months from 1.4% last year. This was partially offset by increases in average balances of 4% and 3% for the quarter and 6 months, respectively.","Our average rate of return was also impacted by our allocation of investments to a greater percentage in tax-exempt securities within the short-term portfolio. As our interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income are reported before taxes, the return appears lower on average when we have a greater mix of tax-exempt investments.","The increase in average investment balance was the result of favorable trends in checks per payroll, wage inflation, payroll tax administration clients and calendar impact. Last year reflected strong growth in average balances due to the inclusion of SurePayroll client fund and favorable impacts from State Unemployment Insurance and checks per payroll, resulting in a difficult year-over-year comparison on this metric.","Our investment income increased 22% to $2 million for the second quarter and 26% to $4 million for the 6 months. This result was mainly due to higher average investment balances resulting from investing the cash generated from operations. We anticipate that growth in investment income will be lower in the second half of the year due to lower average balances and lower interest rates than planned in the second half of the year.","Now let me talk about our financial position and walk you through some key highlights. It remains strong. Cash and total corporate investments were $806 million as of November 30, 2012, and we had no debt. Funds held for clients as of November 30, 2012 were $3.7 billion compared to $4.5 billion as of May 31, 2012. As you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.3 billion for the 6 months, a year-over-year increase of 3%. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $63 million as of November 30, 2012, compared with net unrealized gains of $60 million as of the end of May 2012. Total stockholders' equity was $1.7 billion as of the end of November, reflecting $236 million in dividends paid during the first 6 months. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 34%.","Cash flows from operations were $326 million for the first 6 months, a 10% increase compared to prior year. The increase was driven by timing related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and also higher net income.","Now let me turn to our guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2013. I'd like to remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic interest rate conditions -- economic and interest rate conditions, I should say, continuing with no significant changes. Payroll revenue growth of 2% to 3% is based on anticipated client base growth and modest increases in revenue per check, offset by some moderation in growth in checks per payroll. We expect payroll revenue growth for the third quarter to be comparable to results in the second quarter and then increase in the fourth quarter. And let me just repeat that. We're expecting that payroll revenue growth for the third quarter is going to be comparable with the second quarter and then increase in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that fourth quarter will be stronger than Q3. That's a bit of a difference than what you saw last year.","Our HRS revenue growth is expected to be in line with recent historical experience. For the third quarter, HRS revenue growth is anticipated to fall within the range of guidance we've given for the full year, but at the lower end of that range. In total, service revenue was anticipated to be at the low end of our full year range of guidance of 5% to 6%.","We anticipate minimal impact from the acquisitions we have made or prior acquisitions, and our operating margin for the year is anticipated to be approximately 37%. This is lower than the margin experienced in the first half of fiscal 2013. As previously discussed, our margins are historically lower in the second half of the fiscal year. We do anticipate an increase in the percentage of tax-exempt investments in our short-term portfolio. And investment income, net, was revised down to the range of 0% to 5%, to reflect the impact of anticipated lower interest rates and average cash balances.","I'll turn it back over to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Operator, we'll now open the meeting to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question now is from Paul Thomas of Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you comment first on new business growth and how that trend is compared with your expectations during the quarter?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think what we've seen is the sales from new businesses are still a little bit behind where we'd like them to be. I think we're feeling good about the peak season as we're going into it -- we're into it right now -- and selling. And the fact that a lot of things are in place on the sales team, the market segmentation and the focus on franchise and banking channels, and that the sales rep turnover is back to normal and -- but we've seen still kind of a lagging business environment. It's getting better, but it's not changing a lot. It's still pretty gradual, but it just makes us work harder to get the clients.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then looking at 3Q and 4Q, the impact from Sandy, is that expected to persist at all into 3Q or is that pretty much limited to 2Q?","Efrain Rivera","Look, we quantified as best as we could what we thought the impact of the storm is. At this point, we don't anticipate it will be significant, but we're still quantifying some of the impact.","Operator","Our next request now, from George Mihalos, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just to follow up on the prior question now, for the third quarter payroll services growth, where you said it would be in line with 2Q. Is that adjusting for the impact of Sandy? So should we be looking at like a 2% type number?","Efrain Rivera","I can't get into the exact number, but the impact of what we saw in Q2 has a follow-through impact on Q3. And the other thing that I would mention is that the Q3 compare is difficult because we had an extra day of processing there because it was a leap year.","Georgios Mihalos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just on pricing, has pricing held from first quarter levels or have we seen a little bit more deterioration on a net basis?","Efrain Rivera","No, I think pricing has held. I think when you factor in checks and the impact that we saw from the storm, it probably caused a little bit of disruption in the quarter. So you can't look at the data and say that there's been a change in pricing. The effect of the storm and the impact it had on clients who didn't run payrolls is going to have a little bit of effect on the revenue per client.","Martin Mucci","But it does seem to be holding pretty well. We don't see really a big change there.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Just last question for me. Just the outlook for the PEO. When do you think that the business starts to stabilize?","Martin Mucci","I think we've already seen we're starting to come back, and so we're feeling pretty good about that. We're anxious to see where we are for the -- after the selling season. That really will tell the difference. But we feel good about the client retention and the sales at this point being improved over last year.","Operator","Our next request now, David Togut, Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you provide more insight perhaps to the rate of growth you're seeing in terms of new business signing on a year-over-year basis in the payroll service business?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think from -- it's fairly -- we're still seeing it fairly flat-to-down a little bit because there are not that many new businesses additionally starting up. And so from a sales perspective, I think it's still pretty tough out there and just gradually improving. But I think we're doing about the same as a percentage of the new business starts, but it's not getting that much stronger. Anything you want to add to that, Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","No, I'd just say that focusing on new businesses is only part of the equation. And what I'd add is that in the last 2 months, we've had some of the best back-to-back sales months that we've had in a while. And it's a focus -- it's a product of focusing on the issues that Marty mentioned earlier on all the other channels that we put an emphasis on execution, better execution. And so I think although Marty's correct in terms of the constraints that we're having with new business formation, it's not impacting at this point significantly our new business sales because we're seeing good results in terms of early results on sales.","Martin Mucci","Yes, kind of across-the-board, I mean, we usually don't get into too much on the sales until after the end of the third quarter, so we see the selling season. But we will say we feel we're off to a very good start. I think this is the best in a long time that I've seen. I think the sales team is doing a great job, and particularly the core team, on bringing in new business. And revenue per client is feeling very good. I think it's the focus, as Efrain said, on execution, the sales rep turnover coming back down to normal levels, a focus on segmentation, so we're really focusing the teams on their various market segments. And I think the technology and the addition of the mobility platforms and our new payroll Report Center is all adding up to very positive at this point.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","What percentage of your bookings in Q2 and Q1 were sole sourced versus competitive in payroll services?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, we don't disclose that information. So it's -- let's put it this way. Given our increasing sales year-over-year, what we're seeing, we're winning our fair share.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","In other words, what are you seeing in terms of head-to-head bookings, competition versus ADP and the RUN product? Can you give us some insight there?","Martin Mucci","I guess -- because we don't break it down, but I guess I would repeat \u2013 I'd kind of reemphasize what Efrain just said, which is we're feeling very good about it in comparison year-over-year. I think head-to-head, we're competing very well. And both on a retention, by the way, standpoint and on a sales standpoint, I think we're doing very well.","Operator","Our next question now, Jason Kupferberg, Jeffries.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I just wanted to put some of the payroll numbers in context here. I guess, over the past 3 quarters now, the core payroll revenue growth has averaged I think a hair under 2%, and sounds like that's going to continue into your Q3 here. So that, over that time period, it would seem to imply slightly negative volume growth. And so I just was hoping you could give us a sense of what gives you guys the comfort that that's kind of temporary rather than something more than temporary, just as we think about longer-term growth trends for Paychex in payroll services?","Efrain Rivera","Okay. So David (sic) [Jason], we know what our price increase which we didn't disclose was, and our average realized price on the price increase was higher last year than it is currently. So that's one factor. And second, we do have a window into where we see the year ending and feel good about where we think we'll end. We've ramped a little slower than perhaps our plan anticipated, but we are ramping through the year. And that's the way we constructed the plan.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I think one of the areas you had talked about in the press release and the 10-Q was some impact from changing mix within the mid-market clients having an impact on payroll services revenue. Can you just elaborate on what you mean by that? And is that impact expected to continue in the second half?","Efrain Rivera","Don't expect it to continue in the second half. But if you go back to 2010, and we don't disclose the information, but it did have an impact on payroll service revenue. We had seen an increase in the amount of employees per payroll in our mid-market segment. And while it did increase in Q2, it just -- the growth rate moderated a bit.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just finally, you guys have mentioned in the past, the U.S. economy obviously needs to recover more fully in order for your revenue growth to accelerate up to the high single digit range that you talked about as long-term guidance back at the July Analyst Meeting. Is there any more specifics you can give us in terms of key economic measures, where they need to recover to in order for that long-term guidance to be realized? In order words, does unemployment have to fall to X percent or X thousands of new businesses need to be created? Just any color that we can use to gauge the potential benefits to Paychex from improvements in the macro environment over time?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, thanks, Jason. I'll start and I'll let Marty add some comments to it. So if you look at where we were when we were posting high single-digit growth in payroll, you were in an environment where new business starts we're 850,000-plus. The last readout we got was 758,000. That was then revised upwards by 23,000 to 781,000. So we're not even at 800,000. We get a question from time to time around whether we're losing share, and we can peg what our new sales are to that number of new business starts pretty closely. And we don't vary too much, not more than 1% in a given year. So obviously, we're not in that kind of environment, but I would say that as unemployment drops and as new business formations start to increase because people are more -- have less uncertainty and have more certainty about committing capital, we think certainly that the business will start to -- business revenue will start to pick up.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I wouldn't add much to that except I think what we've seen is we start to see an improvement kind of in the feeling in the economy, and then it gets back to kind of standing on the sidelines. And I think in the last couple of months, in this quarter, besides Hurricane Sandy, we've also seen because of the election and now the fiscal cliff discussion, a lot of businesses, the NFIB Index, being a pretty low number right now, consumer confidence dropping after it was starting to pick up again. I just think that we need to see not only new business starts but a little bit more investment and consumer confidence, buying things, then people will open up. But we're not seeing that necessarily that opening up that second branch, that next location, that kind of thing for our clients. So I think hopefully, new business starts and with just some more confidence that there's consumer demand, we'll start to see the growth that'll help push us up into the high-single digit.","Operator","Our next question now, Joseph Foresi, Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess my first question here is just based on the conversation that you guys were kind of just addressing in the last question. Have you put any thought to the fact that maybe unemployment is structurally going to be higher than some of the levels we've seen in the past? And if that's the case, how do you structure or address the demand environment if we're sitting at this unemployment rate for an extending period of time and\/or if the unemployment rate remains at a higher level for a longer period?","Efrain Rivera","Sure. So 2 things there, so one kind of a micro issue and the second, a macro. So we mentioned the sequential change in checks per payroll from 1.8% to 1.2%. We think that was a blip in the quarter. What we have seen is just very, very gradual moderation, which we're assuming in the plan. So in terms of the segment of customers we have, at this point, it looks like the bias is towards more hiring rather than lower. To the extent that unemployment remains high, the challenge you've got is that, that creates an environment of where sentiment for small business owners is not really good and they don't hire the additional employee, or as Marty mentioned, they don't hire -- they don't open the additional location. It becomes more difficult. I just want to reiterate that neither Marty nor I are saying that this environment is an excuse for not growing. We believe we can grow, and I think that we have early signs that we're doing a good job in terms of core payroll. But obviously it creates a bit of a dampening effect.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think the only other thing I'd add is on the positive side, you are starting to see housing starts and home pricing start to pick up, and that has continued. So some mixed signals. But with that picking up, then additional businesses do tend to start up, small businesses, around that housing market. So we're not expecting that long term, I mean there's certainly going to be a level of unemployment, but I do think it'll start to pick up once things starts to settle down a little bit from a government standpoint.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just kind of moving on to a different part of the business. You did a, it looks like a small acquisition, and the focus has been technology, which was put forward at the Analyst Day. How are you thinking about your investments there and how competitive you are? And how comfortable are you going forward? And I think that leads into sort of the second question there. What can we expect from an investment perspective on the margin side?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I've got to tell you, I've never felt better. I think we've really now -- the investments that we've been doing the last 3 or 4 years have been really coming to fruition now. So rolling out the tablet product, the mobility platform with tablets and smartphones, the Report Center we just did in October, everything has been right on schedule. You've got to wait a couple years to get all that pulled together, but I've never felt better about the execution of the work that's being done there. And we have some great releases coming in the next calendar year that are planned out and right on time, and more for even the middle market, the major market side of the business. So I feel very good about that. I feel good about the investment that even with that level of investment, we've been able to produce our industry-leading margin. And so that's going to continue. It will moderate to some degree because we had kind of a peak there. But it's still going to be a double-digit increase in expense, and we're making up for it in the productivity in other areas. So I feel good about the execution. I feel good about the client response and CPA responses. And I feel good about the continued growth in that technology. To us, it's always been a service model and a mix of technology. And I really feel good about the technology piece that we've been able to release, particularly in the last 18 months.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last one for me. I mean, the sales force has been selling into a difficult market here for a while, with new sales growth kind of being stagnant, but yet the attrition came down. Maybe you could just give us some insight into how you're keeping the sales force incentivized? And when there are new sales taking place, are those market share gains or are those new clients?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think there's -- it's a combination. I would say, we're definitely I think doing well on the market share. I think we're doing well head to head and because you've got to make up for some of the new businesses not starting up. I think it's a lot about execution and leadership. As you know, I've brought in a new head of sales a little over a year ago now, Mark Bottini. I think he's done a nice job, he and his team, across the company in getting the group pumped up. They're feeling good about the product. They've always felt good about the service, and they've now seen a lot of product technology come out. And then, I think you're also seeing a focus on segmentation, so we split our core -- our payroll sales team to, say, focus on really under 50 and over 50, made a clear segmentation there. We focused on new channels, with franchises, won a big one with Subway, the largest franchise in, really, the world and certainly in the country, and getting a partnership there. I think they're feeling like their hey, their company's doing a lot of things to support them, and certainly I think that's showing up in why the turnover is down and I think, their successful increase.","Operator","Our next request now, Sara Gubins, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Given that the payroll service revenue isn't coming in where you originally thought it would, is there any change to your sales force plans or other costs?","Martin Mucci","Go ahead.","Efrain Rivera","No changes, Sara. I just would qualify that slightly. I think what we said was the ramp was a little bit slower than we had anticipated. But in terms of what we expected, how we expected the year to unfold, we're pleased with where things are heading, yes?","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Sorry, I just meant within the payroll service revenue, the revenue growth expectation being slightly lower than it was before?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, yes. Yes, I understand -- I understood the question. So the way we constructed the plan was that, as we talked about last year, was we anticipated Q1 would be a challenging quarter, difficult compare, and that we'd build from there. And when you subtract some noise that I've mentioned from it, we think that we're on track to get to where we wanted to be at the end of the year.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on a separate note, you recently announced a new share repurchase authorization. How do we think about the plans for that?","Efrain Rivera","I think what I've seen said is that we'll repurchase shares opportunistically. Haven't planned and I can't give you a specific dollar amount, but we do intend to go into market when we think the opportunity is there.","Operator","And now, Kartik Mehta, North Coast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Marty, any changes you're making this year on the selling season versus last year? It seems like you seem to be more confident about what's going to happen this year. And is that the result of just an improving economy or is that the result of the changes you've made? Anything you can talk about on the sales side that could lead to better results?","Martin Mucci","I think -- yes, one, I think it's the momentum. You can feel with the team and the positive feeling that they're winning, they're driving more revenue per client, they're having success out there, they like the technology and the service combination that is there for them to sell the value. I think it's the leadership and the execution. When you look at, again, the franchise and the banking channel, I think there's this feeling like we're  -- there's a lot of things going there. We've got various promotions and I think the incentive plan is working well for them. So I think it's all those things together. It's a momentum that you feel. Now we're usually pretty cautious until we get through January and February and get through that quarter. But at least going in at this peak time, we're feeling pretty good about all those things showing through the turnover and, in a general positive sense of the sales team.","Efrain Rivera","I think, Kartik, the other thing I'd add is that I think Marty has brought a real emphasis on execution again, specific segments of the market, and I think we're earlier in identifying where we thought we could gain business, and those programs that have been in place, and in some cases tested. And we feel pretty good about the results that we think we're going to get.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then on the HRS growth, that segment has continued to show some really strong growth. Are you getting to the point where maybe the law of large numbers becomes an issue and it's harder to keep this momentum going over the next 12 to 18 months? Or are there other products you could put in there that allow you to keep this momentum?","Martin Mucci","Well, yes. I don't think so -- I don't -- the numbers aren't large enough for us yet. I think that particularly like if you look at 401(k), we've been in it a long time, and yet we found kind of a different way to go to really focus and execute this year, focused on the financial advisors. We've tried it before. This year, I think, we went after the financial advisors to work with them directly to go after the larger clients, larger 401(k) plans as well. And we've had some nice success. Just starting it up, we've had some nice success. So I think there's always new ways to kind of go at even a mature -- something that's mature for us but still has to of potential. When you think about the penetration levels into our client base, we still have a lot of room to grow.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just one last question, Efrain, I just want to make sure on the guidance you gave for payroll revenue in 3Q being similar to 2Q. Is that mostly just the aftereffects of Sandy? Or are there anything else pressuring that revenue line for 3Q?","Efrain Rivera","So I'll mention it one more time. So it's twofold. There is a lingering impact, and this also goes back to Sara's question. So when we impacted a bit of the growth rate in Q2 that has a follow-on effect, obviously, through the next  -- ripples through the next 3 quarters. So there's some impact from that. And we think we've quantified, but I'd say it's at least 0.5%. It could be more based on what we've seen. So that's part 1. But part 2 is that in Q3 of last year, we knew this when we planned the business out. We had an additional day of processing because it was a leap year that doesn't recur this year. So this is the year where we don't benefit from that day. And so both of those are factors there. So the Q4 compare is going to get easier, and we are anticipating a good quarter-over-quarter comparison in that quarter for payroll. And we're anticipating that Q4 sequentially is going to be a stronger quarter than Q3 is.","Operator","Our next request now, Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just because it's important, I want to go back to the payroll services again. Obviously, Sandy, if you add that back, you guys have kind of suggested the ramp is still slower than you guys expected. What exactly has been causing that slowness? Is it just economy? Or what is causing the slowness compared to what you guys thought?","Efrain Rivera","I think, Brian, we -- as we comment every planned season, we assume this is a year that we start to see an acceleration in improvement, particularly around new business starts. And what we have ended up seeing, and now obviously for 2 to 3 years having the same conversation, it's just going to be gradual. We've incorporated that in our thinking. I think there also was a significant amount of uncertainty in the first half of the year that impacted how people thought about whether they wanted to start a business and whether they wanted to add employees. So a combination of those 2 factors from a macro perspective. I think on the other hand, we're executing better, and we think that's an offset to those negatives.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, because it doesn't seem like you guys are suggesting you're losing share or you're disappointed in the sales growth. So I guess we're just left with the macro as the assumption that maybe was off.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, that's correct. We obviously don't -- we don't disclose where we ended up in terms of sales growth for the quarter, but we feel positive about where we ended up.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just the lack of a leap year in the third quarter, can you quantify that impact? Is it like 0.5% or is it less?","Efrain Rivera","It's between 0.5% and 1%.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the pickup in the fourth quarter, is that just because sales start to pick up or do you need a little bit of new business starts to pick up as well in order to get that ramp up back in the fourth quarter?","Efrain Rivera","Well, with the absence of 3 quarters where we had just unusual negatives, that's part of it. And then the Q4 compare is just easier.","Martin Mucci","And the sales ramp.","Efrain Rivera","And the ramp -- sales ramp, all those.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for me. Just how big is ExpenseWire and how much should we add to our -- to think about it adding to the growth rate?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, it's very, very modest, so it's probably a rounding error. But here's the issue. So our strategy in terms of acquisitions is get the technology and push it through the distribution channel. So it is not one of those acquisitions, where we are acquiring a big base of business together with the technology. Here it's more technology driven and some base of business. The opportunity for us is to drive a really world-class expense management solution through our distribution channel, right?","Martin Mucci","It's something we've been selling for a number of years in partnership, and again, brought it, bring it in, get it integrated, and it will build over time. So as Efrain said, a small base coming in but a lot of potential in that -- particularly in the major market business.","Operator","Our next request now from Jim Mac Donald, First Analysis.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I'd like to get a little deeper in the HR revenue acceleration. You talked about a price increase impact. Can you talk about where -- what particular segment that was in and whether that caused the acceleration or whether the acceleration was caused by better client growth?","Efrain Rivera","Actually, it was a little bit of all of those. So we had some price increases really kind of across the board. I would characterize them as modest. The second is we did have increases in clients quarter-over-quarter. But if you're looking at it sequentially, Jim, it was the absence of some negatives in Q1 that didn't appear. As every quarter goes on, for example, our PEO comparisons get better so that becomes less of a drag. In the Q1 of 2 years ago compared to Q1 of this year, we had higher basis point fees in that quarter that caused the comparison issue in Q1. We're -- as Marty said, we're executing well on the 401(k) business. We've got higher assets. And although base fees on average are down, we did well in the quarter. So it's really an execution against all of the 3 segments of the business and then the absence of some negatives that occurred in Q1.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then looking at your change in the corporate interest guidance, is that due to assumed repurchase or something else?","Efrain Rivera","No, we haven't necessarily baked that in. If we do that, and we'd have to figure out what that EPS impact is. No, what's happening there is we made assumptions about interest rates in the back half of the year that have turned out to be lower. And also average investment balances because of the acceleration of the dividend, end up creating lower average balances. By year end, we'll be at the exact same point, or probably higher than we were in December. But the average balance will be lower.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","But just a follow-up quickly. I mean, to you get to 0% to 5% when you've had good growth for 6 months already this fiscal year, that almost -- that implies almost a decline or something?","Efrain Rivera","No, no. it won't decline. It's just not going to increase quite as much as we thought for the year.","Operator","Our next request now is from Tim McHugh, William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to ask from a high level. Given your commentary about the various factors, how would you describe the overall demand environment and kind of selling environment? Has it gotten tougher in the second half of this calendar year? Or has the kind of the overall environment that you're selling into not changed much?","Martin Mucci","I think it's been pretty consistent. I don't -- we've seen gradual improvement. I think there was some improvement in the first couple of months of this fiscal year and then it seemed to kind of stall again because of the election coming out. And so I think the new business formations we've talked a lot about, that really hasn't recovered. I think then just businesses opening up those additional locations, adding employees, has kind of stagnated a little bit. It's been pretty flat this quarter because of the election and then the fiscal cliff discussion and so forth. So I would say, it's not worse. It just hasn't gotten a lot better. So I think it's tough out there, but I think we're executing better. And I think we're giving more things in the tool bag for the sales group to sell as well.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And the Q4 growth rate picking up, is that reliant on you have a real strong finish to the selling season? Or is it based more so on things you have in hand, I guess?","Efrain Rivera","I think it's half and half. I wouldn't call it real strong and say executing where we think we can for the quarter based on what we're seeing. And Q4 is just simply, for the number of the reasons I mentioned, an easier compare than Q2 -- Q3, I should say.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And last, if I could. Healthcare reform, it's now kind of post-election, how are you thinking about it and what are you hearing from your clients both as it relates, I guess, to the insurance business and then broadly small -- the small business environment out there?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think the main word would be confusion. I think there's still confusion as, what do I have to do? Do I really have to do this? What am I -- should I take a penalty or should I get the insurance? Am I going to be able to go to an exchange and what does that look like for my employees? I think all that generally bodes pretty well for us from the standpoint that we've got a good health insurance business that has been selling near 20% or over, and I think that we'll continue to be that expert for them. So we see it as fairly positive at this point. While there'll be pressure on the commission rates from the carriers to us for selling, and the exchanges, I do think we're positioning ourselves to continue to be an expert for them to come to as a small business and help decide what they're going to do, and we're looking to capitalize on that. So I think the major thing is just confusion, just not sure how it's all going to pan out. And I do think that's part of why they're not expanding either in employees. They just don't know what their health costs are going to be, what their tax rates are going to be, if there's going to be credits, and things like that. So I think that's how I'd categorize it.","Operator","Our next request now, Tim Willi, Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had 2 questions. The first, maybe just a follow-up on what Tim was asking about the healthcare. So we see a lot of small businesses that talk about maybe part-time employees as opposed to crossing over the full-time, I guess, it's 50-person cutoff. If that were to be something that truly is, at least a stop-gap for a couple of years as employers try to hold off on the mandatory health coverage, would your -- would the correct thought process be more potential part-time employees where a payroll is processed but smaller average check sizes? Or would you envision staffing companies helping out with what that part-time requirement? How should we think about that dynamic in terms of just headcount at companies?","Martin Mucci","I think that plays well, kind of from a public relations, very interesting kind of anecdote, but I don't think that we're \u2013 well, we're not seeing much of that at this point, and I don't know if you're really going to see a business go and transition everybody to part time just to avoid or change their healthcare costs. It sounds good, but when think about changing your business and the way you're structuring your employees and risking that they're going to leave because they're part-time versus full-time, I don't think you're -- I honestly don't think we're going to see that much of that. What I do think you'll see is more employers may go to a set dollar amount. They may change the structure of how they're paying for healthcare and go to, \"Hey I'll give you a set dollar amount and then help you pick individual insurance.\" And again, we're trying to structure ourselves and our product set and salespeople to say, \"Hey, we'll help you that.\" It's a combination of health spending accounts and reimbursements and so forth as opposed to just straight old, \"I'll pay 75% of the premium\" type of thing. So I think you're going to see more of those changes and products than you will people necessarily shifting to part-time. If it does happen or that it happens, I don't think that would have a big impact on us. It's just, frankly, it might be more checks if you have more part-timers versus full-timers. But I really don't see most -- many businesses shifting. That is too risky from a business standpoint.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Okay. That makes sense. Appreciate that. My follow-up was, I guess thinking about customer acquisition to the extent that there are new businesses formed and then ongoing penetration of businesses that are existing, so maybe I could draw a bit of an analogy. We've seen in the payments world sort of models like companies like Square and Intuit GoPay, where effectively a very small business is going out and getting the capabilities to accept cards on their own, sort of eschewing or finding a way around the traditional feet-on-the-street, merchant-acquiring model, sort of self-service, through e-mail, text, chat, et cetera. And again, while that in itself is a niche market, it's shown that small businesses will go out and get something like this, whereas traditionally that was sold through sales forces on the street with quotas and service, et cetera. Do you think that there's a point in time, is it evolving? How would you think about the payroll world, especially for smaller businesses, evolving into that kind of model to the extent that it's going on now and where it could go and how you guys think about your position to the extent that it's something you think you need to address at a point?","Martin Mucci","Well, one of the reasons we acquired SurePayroll, now almost a couple years ago, we really felt that they positioned well for that market, that small businesses, particularly smaller business in the 5- to 7-employee range or less, wanted to use technology to save costs or just do it themselves and control it themselves. That market, that we thought SurePayroll was a very good alternative for that. And so we acquired them, and we're seeing them with double-digit growth, as I said. So I don't think it's necessarily taking from us at this point from a full outsourced model because what we haven't seen, and I think our competitors have said the same thing, I don't -- there doesn't seem to be, at this point, a shift in those who want to do it themselves and those who want to outsource. But I do think that more will go from manual writing checks to an online product that'll make them more productive as a small business and as they get more comfortable with technology, like Square is to merchant processing. So I think we'll see more in SurePayroll. That seems to have happened. It doesn't seem to come at an expense of a full outsourcer because you're kind of in one mindset or another. And as far as the sales force, I think we're always ready to say, yes, there's going to be -- we've even gotten more sales from web leads. So I think there'll be more search, more online going out and for something. But I think we've positioned ourselves very well to take those web leads and send someone else to sell it or sell it over the phone. Both have increased pretty well from a sales sourcing perspective.","Operator","Our next request now, Gary Bisbee of Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I hate to go back to the payroll service revenue, but I can't resist one question there. You said 2 things that I wanted to ask about. One was that while it may be a little slower, the year's generally building the way you'd planned. And the second was that you're seeing early signs of better execution or better job internally on payroll. I'm sure you can understand why we're all asking questions because we don't really see it in the numbers. Can you give us either quantitatively or qualitatively just what are these signs that things are getting better? How do you see it building? Because when we add back the adjustments, the timing issue last quarter and Hurricane Sandy, it actually looks like payroll revenue growth decelerated from 2.4% to 1.9%. And I guess, I think that's why we're all asking the question. So what\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yes. No, I understand that, but the factor you can't add in your numbers because we deliberately did not disclose the exact amount for the price increases, what's the price increase this year versus last. And I can say that the net price is lower this year than last year. So that's the factor that you're not equating. And part of the reason, the way we built the plan was, we said we chose not to create a higher revenue number based on greater amount of pricing and thought that we could get greater revenue through greater clients and also pricing within the clients that we got, and that was the plan or that was our approach in the way that we constructed the plan in the year. So what we're seeing when we look at our plan through the quarter is it's building in a way that will get us to where we want to be in terms of the growth rate in Q4. There are anomalies in each quarter that frankly would waste too much time going through. I mention in Q1 the timing differences. Now we got hit with Sandy in Q2. And then we've got the additional payroll date in -- payroll processing date in Q3. So those were all things that created lumpiness in the quarter. One other thing, Gary, I'd mention is that when we said we thought HRS would accelerate from Q1 to Q2, I know there was justifiably by some people skepticism around there, and you saw what happened in Q2 with respect to HRS. So we could see the numbers and think we're building the way we want to.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay great. And then just one more on that. If we were to back out pricing because I understand we don't have that detail, and if we even ignored also the some moderation and the checks per client, and just looked at growth year-over-year, number of net clients, new ones versus loss, is that doing better in the first half of '13 than it did in the first half of '12 or has that moderate as well?","Efrain Rivera","Okay. We don't talk about it, but I'll just say, it's positive.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just one clarification. I'm trying to understand how the leap year plays in. How much of the revenue was charged on a per-day basis? I was under the understanding that for the payroll business, most of it was done per paycheck processed, so that wouldn't really come into play.","Efrain Rivera","It does. It depends on -- every day has its own unique characteristic. It's going to depend on what day of the week it falls and what payrolls tend to be processed on that day; weekly, semi or 2-weeklies and monthly.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then just one last one, which is you've mentioned several times the sales segmentation, and you obviously went over that this summer a lot. What's the timeline for that to really take hold and start to impact the business? Is that big enough that it helps the selling season? Or should we think that, that can become a lot more important, maybe as we exit this year and get into the next fiscal year?","Martin Mucci","No, I think it's -- yes, I think it's already been -- it rolled in very quickly, and I think it's already impacting this year. I think it's just a clear definition. It's just another thing that Mark has done that I think to provide very clear direction who's selling to what groups, that on top of the focus on other markets, expanded some territories, seeing the turnover come back down. I mean all these things are giving us some good momentum going into the peak season.","Operator","Our next request now, Rod Bourgeois at Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So let's \u2013 we'll talk about a different topic here. Paychex has historically been strong in the CPA channel, and it seems the bank channel should be an increased opportunity. And also my check suggests Paychex has been making a push into the bank channel. So I guess the question here is, do you view the bank channel as a significant opportunity to tap in the future? And if you see it that way, can you give us some thoughts on your progress -- the progress that you're making in that bank channel?","Efrain Rivera","Rod, good intelligence. I'll let Marty talk to it.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think it's always been something that we've been involved in but have not put a dedicated effort to. And this year, we decided that we really thought there was an opportunity there. So I think you'll see it gradually improve. We're already feeling pretty good about the folks that we have running that channel, very specific focus, and in tying that support back to the overall sales team. So just feel good about that. I think it's going to ramp up over time as opportunities come up. I also would tell you that when you look at SurePayroll, what they've done there is offer that white-label product and they've been very successful at going into banks and offering kind of the other side of this. And now as Paychex comes to the banking community, they offer both sides. We're one of the very few, I think, if anyone, who can say, if want to be a white-label product and build it into your online suite of services as a bank, SurePayroll is kind of your behind-the-scenes player. If you want -- if you have a client that wants to be referred out to an outsourced payroll provider, that's Paychex. And so you have one person to really deal with and can provide a suite of products for the bank channel. And we think that's going to be very successful. We've had a nice start to it, but I think it'll ramp up gradually over time.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right, so is it maybe something that helps your bookings during this fiscal year but maybe then becomes a more meaningful contributor to revenues in the next fiscal year?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think that's very fair, yes.","Operator","Our next question now, Jeff Silber, BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I know it's late. I'll just ask one. Based on your guidance for the second half of the year, it looks like you're not looking for much operating expense leverage, like you'd seen in the first half of the year. Is there any specific reason for that or are you just being conservative?","Efrain Rivera","That's a good one, Jeff. No, no, we call out -- so the operating model is that Q3 is a big sales and ops activity quarter, so we just naturally have more expense in those quarters. And then Q4 is a bit of a carryover from Q3. So our expenses tend to be higher in the second half. So we're just calling that out. We obviously will look at trying to leverage wherever we can and have done a good job. And part of our expense base is variable, so we have an opportunity to do that.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I guess what I'm asking, is the second of this year different than the second half of last year?","Efrain Rivera","I guess from an expenses -- directionally, I'd say no.","Operator","Our next now, Mark Marcon, RW Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you just talk a little -- just to follow up on Jeff's question, just the leverage on the direct expenses has been impressive for quite some time as you've put in the new platform. How much longer can that keep going for?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think as we -- it's not something that you put in and you kind of leave stagnant. So as we continue to add more functionality to that, I think the productivity will continue to offset. It certainly has moderated some. And so I think while we have it, it'll continue to moderate over time. But we keep adding more functionality to it and keep looking for other ways to increase our productivity and then really use that to continue to fuel the IT and product development. So I think you'll see a continuation of it, but it'll probably moderate at some point. But always looking for leverage. You know that. That's where we come from. And we'll continue to grow the top line and try to increase the bottom as well and gain leverage on everything we do.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's been impressive. Can you talk a little bit about what the Reporting (sic) [Report] Center, what sort of impact you would expect that to have in terms of that rollout?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it's -- I think what we'll see is one on retention. I think clients will -- I think will stay more. We have some. The one thing we would hear about that clients always want is more flexibility in reporting. And so they always want easier to get to their reports and more flexibility to custom-design what they want and download it into their own spreadsheets and so forth. We believe this does that. It pulls all of their services together in one Report Center, makes it very easy to use and very flexible to the client and to the CPA. So I think, one, it'll help the CPA relationships. I think it'll help retention. Can't tell you exactly how much that will at this point, but we certainly think it'll help us get to historic bests on retention, even better than we've been at our best. And I think it'll drive some sales. It puts another thing in the -- again in the tool bag of a salesperson to say, \"Look, what we have is not only great service and good technology, but also all your reporting is even that much better.\"","Efrain Rivera","And Mark, it also continues to put pressure on the local and regional players who just really just can't match the technology. And if you look at our results, we see we keep gaining share against them.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then just along those lines, can you talk, just to piece together some of the questions that have been on the call and just put them all together. It sounds like what you're saying is the sale season's off to a good start, you're pretty encouraged by that. In fact, the last 2 months have actually been pretty good. You're -- we do have the headwind in terms of the processing periods in the first quarter, and that's going to be a headwind. But even if we adjust for that, the growth rate is probably going to be a little bit below what we would have expected partially because the net price is actually lower. So we're going to see an increase in terms of overall -- there's going to be a positive increase in terms of the total number of clients, but the net pricing actually declined. Is that correct?","Efrain Rivera","It's not net pricing actually declined. It's the -- that the price increase we chose to take was lower on a net basis from last year. Because, Mark, as you understand, there's a trade-off between how you price and what units you get. And we just called it at a certain point. And we'll see -- could have called it incorrectly, but doubt that. We think we're positioned where we should be.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So net pricing across the board is still up year-over-year. It's the rate of increase is much lower?","Martin Mucci","It's not much lower but it's lower, yes.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And can you talk a bit about mid-market? Just what are you seeing there? How has the competitive set evolved? And can you just talk a little bit more about what you meant by the mix shift?","Martin Mucci","I'll just start and then I'll let Efrain jump in on mix shift. I think that -- I think it continues to be very competitive. And I think we've done pretty well there. I think we're seeing continual product enhancements and functionality coming to that market, particularly over the next year. And what we've done is continue to add other products in. Adding -- acquiring ExpenseWire is part of the plan of being able to own that -- a product like that even though it starts out small but building it into the suite of products in a single sign-on that we have so that a client has a full base of experience. We have HR online, time and attendance online, ExpenseWire. And we're always -- and of course, we have recruiting partnerships and so forth on the front end of it on the whole thing. So I think it's just continuing -- that market is going to continue to evolve and continue to be very competitive. But I think we're well positioned to compete there.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Mark, and the other thing I'd say, as I mentioned earlier, that if you go back to 2010, we didn't disclose this, but we've been seeing increases in employees per client. And in this quarter that trend moderated a bit.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And with regards to SurePayroll, you did some incremental marketing behind that. Did the growth rate increase?","Martin Mucci","I wouldn't say it increased, but it continued to be pretty strong. We feel good that they're right on track, if not slightly above what our expectations were, so we're feeling good about what they're doing. I think it's been a combination. They do a great job of marketing. You may have heard them on satellite radio. They're testing out things there and they're doing a number of things to drive in that web-based search for someone who wants to control it and set it up themselves and have the flexibility. So I think they're doing very well.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And one last detail question. Is there any difference in terms of, a year ago, you used to talk about checks per client. Now you're talking about checks per payroll. Is there...","Efrain Rivera","No, no. No difference. It's just a more precise definition of what we were talking about.","Operator","Our last request today is from Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess one question I have is for every dollar of payroll service revenue, what is the potential value of HRS revenue that you can generate eventually? Because obviously, if you look at the 5, 6, 7, 8-year track record, it's been pretty good. And then the clients that do not take those additional services, what do they tell you is the reason? Are they getting these services elsewhere? What's going on?","Efrain Rivera","I'll let Marty take the second part and I'll handle the first.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think what we see is not so much that they're going elsewhere, although that sometimes on 401(k), it's more that they don't need the service or feel like they need the service at this point. So we're not losing too much in our client base. Obviously, our team on the HRS side, both HR outsourcing, 401(k), et cetera, go into the base. And typically, we're selling them on those products for the first time. So it's not typically -- it's not normal that they're going to someone else, it's more that we're teaching them the value -- we're helping them understand the value of needing the service, and they may just decide not to take it at that time. So we don't lose too much head-to-head. Now retention, after they've had the product, is we then have to work to be sure that we're staying competitive with the value that they're receiving, but it's more not losing it head-to-head. It's more teaching them or helping them understand the value of having it. I'll let Efrain take the first part.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, the first part, Ashwin, is that if you take a core payroll customer, and they had at least some participation on all 3 of the suite of services that we provide, insurance, 401(k) record, keeping and also HR Solutions, that revenue becomes -- can get up to 4x to 5x the original amount they're paying for payroll.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And one last question, sort of going back to Tim Willi's comparison with the payment market, the small end of the payment market. I wanted to explore the pricing aspect because one of the things that happens with the SaaS model is price transparency and lowering of price points generally for smaller clients. And you've had SurePayroll for a couple of years. Do you see the lower pricing in that channel begin to affect pricing in the main business? And if not, why not, because it's open choice for clients, right?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it is open choice. But we have found, as I mentioned, that we don't see based on our research, and I think some competitors have said the same thing, that there hasn't been a big shift between wanting to do it themselves or wanting to outsource. And the pricing difference roughly would be 2.5x -- 2.25x to 2.5x. So where SurePayroll might be around $800, our average client might be around a couple thousand dollars. So you don't see a shift just because of price necessarily to say that on an annual basis. It's more what your preference is, and we haven't seen those preferences change. So you either want to control it or you don't. And I think with -- even with -- while people are getting more comfortable with technology, the shift seems to come more from manual to someone like SurePayroll or Intuit, not necessarily going from full outsource to doing it themselves. That's based on what we've seen. We haven't seen a big shift in that market.","Efrain Rivera","The other thing, Ashwin, I'd say is that there frequently is an underestimation of the regulatory complexity implications of getting it wrong for -- particularly for clients that are bigger than just 2, 3, 4 employees. Once you're up at that 10-employee range, which a lot of our clients are, there you're getting into a level of complexity that on the surface doesn't seem like much, but when you start adding in all of the changes coming in from the federal government and also at the state and local level, for a larger client, it just doesn't make sense for them to spend the time doing that themselves.","Operator","As I have no further questions in queue, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Mucci for any closing remarks.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.

You may now begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of Paychex's Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2017. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days; you can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage.","This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on the website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review the business highlights for the second quarter and Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss full-year guidance. And then we'll open it up to your questions.","Well we're halfway through fiscal 2018 and we have continued to deliver solid results across all of our major human capital management product lines with growth of 7% in total service revenue for the second quarter. In particular our HR outsourcing services, retirement services and time and attendance solutions have continued to perform very well. On August 21, we announced our acquisition of HR Outsourcing Holdings Inc or HROI. HROI is a national PEO that serves small and mid-sized businesses in more than 35 states. The integration of HROI is progressed favorably.","Combining the HROI team with our experienced PEO sales and service operations teams has further strengthened our presence in the PEO market. This is particularly relevant during a time of regulatory change like we're seeing now. This expansion along with our certification by the IRS under the Small Business Efficiency Act positions us for accelerated growth in our comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions.","Small business job growth continue to moderate slightly during the second quarter after the sharper up tick experienced last year following the conclusion of the Presidential Election by contrast our early earnings have improved to an annual increase of nearly 3% based on our data. The combination of this level of wage growth and consistent moderate small business job growth are indicators of a healthy small business sector.","We believe these promising indicators will continue to create opportunities for new sales in the small business market. At HR Tech in October, we introduced our new product bundles that are now in the market. These bundles include new simplified pricing and included in two of the mid level HCM bundles at no extra cost are Paychex Flex onboarding essentials providing a paperless employee onboarding experience and do-it-yourself handbooks.","In addition, we introduced a retina scan InVision time clock. We are excited about these new offerings that respond to the evolving needs of our clients and we are pleased with the initial response from our clients and prospects.","We are committed to delivering best-in-class technology solutions for our clients and business partners. We recently announced a release of Same Day ACH Debits functionality for our clients using direct deposit. With Same Day ACH, employers have the ability to reverse a payroll and have money debited from employee bank accounts on the same day, avoiding the costly time lag associated with payroll reversals. This enhances our position as a leader in this payments industry.","We also announced real-time integration between Paychex General Ledger services and Sage Intacct. Paychex and Intacct are certainly two key service providers to the accounting industry and our CPA partners are important to our business and this integration provides better tools which allow them to gain inside into their data and their clients data in a real time basis.","We also introduced Accountant HQ, a website for accounting professionals to help them service their Paychex clients even more effectively with a comprehensive online dashboard that provides a single source of immediate service access to authorized Paychex's client data robust reporting capabilities and variable accountant resources. We consistently evolve our service offerings to meet the needs the of clients base and example as we just had a recent announcement that Millennium Trust Company and Paychex have teamed up to offer a simple IRA to employers with a 100 or fewer employees with innovative features including auto enrollment and investment fiduciary services. This is becoming a popular offering, or be a popular requirement from some states across the U.S.","We are proud of the recognition we have received regarding our solutions for our clients and our leading Hedge Technology Inc, recently recognized Paychex is the best HR outsourcing for small business overall. They noted that Paychex Flex our product offers a full range of services for HR outsourcing including payroll tax, payment benefits, recruiting and training and we do so without requiring a long-term contract.","More uniquely Paychex also offers onsite assistance program that puts HR professionals, our HR generalist, our HR Gs in the office with customers when they need more help. We are proud that Paychex Flex was recently awarded a gold excellence in technology award for best advance in HR or workforce management technology for small and mid-sized businesses from Brandon Hall Group.","In previous years we won the bronze award, this year moving up to the gold standard and we appreciate that this evidence is, this evidence is the strength of our technology as well as our service performance. As I noted last quarter, the seven, this is the 7th consecutive year, we were ranked the largest 401(k) recordkeeper by total number of defined contribution plans by PLANSPONSOR magazine and our Paychex Insurance Agency hit the rank of 21st, that to 21st largest agency from business insurance magazines.","And we are very proud of all of this recognition because, it comes from and really it is deserved by the - deserved of the 14,000 employees who make it happen from sales to services to technology, innovation teams here at Paychex. We're very proud of them and the results that they have achieved.","Providing excellent service to our clients remains a top priority of course and we've completed the realignment of our service organization at the end of last fiscal year and our investment in this service realignment was an important strategy to help support long-term growth as well as an example of our priority and commitment to providing the best service possible to our clients. With the realignment completed we are seeing benefits from this change.","One last comment before I turn the call over to Efrain, yesterday of course Congress voted in the favor of tax reform legislation. We are currently reviewing the terms of the bill and analyzing the impact that we could have at the Paychex, Efrain will talk more about this later on. Tax reform will provide a great benefit to us and a lower effective tax rate. We do expect that a portion of the potential benefit will be reinvested to drive future growth for the company and our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Marty, and good morning. I would like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements referred to the customary disclosures. I'll start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter, provide greater detail in certain areas and then wrap up with a review of the 2018 outlook.","Service revenue, as you saw, grew 7% for the quarter to $813 approximately 3% little lesser that growth was attributable to HROI. Interest on funds held for clients increased 23% for the second quarter to $14 million as a result of higher average interest rates earned, you're starting to see the benefits of all these cumulative increases in interest rates.","Expenses increased 7% for the quarter HROI though contributed about 5% of this growth. So we have very good growth expense control in the quarter, comp-related cost were up modestly and continued investment in technology and growth in the PEO also contributed to the slight up tick in expenses.","Our effective income tax rate was 35% for the second quarter compared to 35.2% for the prior year's second quarter, both periods reflected net discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation. This impact to the second quarter was $0.01 accounting $0.01 of EPS and must be material in the prior year quarter.","Let's talk about payroll service revenue, increased 1% in the second quarter to $445 million, the growth was driven by an increase in revenue per check and then it was tempered by the impact of client size mix from the same quarter a year ago, recall it as we ended the year we had a slight drop in client size and that's reflected in the payroll service revenue growth.","On the HRS side, we grew 15% to $368 million for the second quarter, it reflected strong growth in the client base across major HCM services including comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement, time and attendance and insurance all saw a good growth in the quarter.","Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see the strong demand which along with the acquisition of HROI reflected in continued solid growth in the number of client work side employee served. So we're seeing growth there and we are seeing growth in other areas of the PEO.","Insurance services benefited from continued growth in the number of health and benefit applicants in higher average premiums within workers comp insurance offering. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue and earned on the value of purchase have been fund. So all of those are contributing to the positive results in HRS.","Year-to-date let me just say that total service revenue growth was 5% of which about 1%, 1.5% approximately was attributable both to HROI recall that Q1 was a lower quarter end we built from there. Operating income growth was 7% with margins of 41.2% up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Net income diluted earnings per share grew 6% on a GAAP basis to $445 million in a $1.23 respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are both up 8%, and that just takes up the benefit of the discrete tax items that we recognized in both years.","Investments and income, as you know we, our goal is to protect principle and optimized liquidity on the short-term side, primarily short-term investment vehicles are bank demand deposits and variable rate demand notes. In the longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities, the long-term portfolio as an average yield of 1.8%, an average duration currently at 3.3 years.","The combined portfolio has earned an average rate of return of 1.5% for the second quarter up from 1.2% last year. We are starting to realize the benefit of gradually increasing interest rates as I mentioned earlier. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients was relatively flat for the second quarter primarily the impact of wage inflation was offset by client mix.","Now let's look at our financial position remain strong. Cash and total corporate investments were $820 million as of November 30, 2017. Funds held for clients as of the same date were $4.9 billion compared to $4.3 billion; funds held for clients very widely as you know and averaged $3.7 billion for the quarter.","Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $14 million as of November 30, compared with net unrealized gains of $32 million as of May 31 and that's just a reflection of rising interest rates. Our longer term portfolio seen an increase in the unrealized losses for this reason.","Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of November 30, 2017 reflecting $359 million in dividends paid and 94 million of shares repurchased during the first half of fiscal 2018, our return on equity for the past 12 months was a stellar 43%, now we just point out that was only a few years ago when return on equity is 34%. So, we have really worked hard on driving that number.","Our cash flows from operations were $519 million for the first six months and I just also point out that we had a very strong cash flow quarter. The increase was 26%, although there is some timing in that also a function of our cash generating power.","Let's look at the guidance for 2018. It's unchanged from what we've provided last quarter. This guidance doesn't reflect any impact from tax reform legislation. What we try to do in both the press release and you will hear in a second is supreme, what we think the ongoing benefit from tax reform will be for us. I would caveat heavily. That we don't know the exact details of the legislation and there will be regulations written that interpret the legislation that could have some impacts and changes to what we are discussing. We obviously were anxious to see the final bill just like everyone else, but we recognized that it will have an important impact to us.","Payroll revenue was anticipated to grow in a range of 1% to 2%. Overall, we anticipate full year growth now will be at the lower end of the range with growth for the second half of 2018 comparable to the growth in the first half of the year.","HRS revenue by contrast is anticipated to increase in the range of 12% to 14% for the full year incorporating HRI. We were below the low-end of the range for interest growth of first quarter at 7%. And we were above the range for the second quarter 15% now anticipate being above the range for the second half of the year.","Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 6%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to grow in the mid to upper teens which doesn't include the most recent increase in the fed funds rate that we made earlier this month and the reason for this is, it's comprehended within that range and we think by the time the increases roll through, the impact for this year will be modest obviously will be beneficial to next year, but impact at this point is going to be modest.","Operating income margin is anticipated to be in the range of 39% to 40%, effective income tax rate excluding any potential impact from tax reform legislation is expected to be in the range of 35%, 35.5%. Let me just add a note of explanation here. If you recall our guidance when we started the year, our guidance was that our tax rate would be between 35.5% and 36% that's what we consider our normalized tax rate currently when we don't include discrete tax benefit. The discrete tax benefit that we recognized year-to-date relating to stock-comp expense drive that rate down. So, when we say 10% to 12% benefit, we are working of at a normalized rate between 35.5% and 36%. And at this point, I would anticipate that we will provide more guidance but it could be anywhere along that spectrum at this point, if I had to peg it, I would say it's at the low end of the range rather than higher.","Investment income net anticipated to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million. Adjusted net income is expected to increase approximately 7%. Adjusted net income excludes the impact of a discrete tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2017, in the first half of fiscal 2018 relating to employee stock-based compensation payments. We currently don't plan any additional discrete tax benefits for the remainder of the year. We simply don't know whether we will realize any. Please refer to our non-GAAP financial measures, discussion in our press release and in our investor presentation for reconciliation of non-GAAP measured to the GAAP basis net income for the second quarter in six months of the year.","GAAP basis net income is anticipated to increase approximately 5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is anticipated to increase in the range of 7% to 8% and again, we laid this out in the presentation that we've posted in Web site and this measure as I have mentioned now about 3x excludes the impact of a discrete tax benefits recognized.","And then, finally, as I mentioned before we haven't recognized any benefit of tax reform in our guidance. We anticipated to be in the range of 10% to 12% on our annualized effective income tax rate I mentioned how we measure that that is before we include any discrete tax amounts related to employee stock-based compensation thing. And again, one more caveat, this is based on our current understanding of the legislation maybe subject to change upon further review of the final law and interpreted guidance that maybe issued.","As discussed previously, we said this, Marty said, and we said in the press release, when you have an opportunity we expect that a portion of the benefits will be used to be reinvested in the business to drive future growth and we will provide additional guidance in upcoming quarters.","One final comment on that and I suspect that this will be true for many companies, although that the statutory rate will drop to 21% that won't be the effective rate because there will be puts and takes in terms of benefits and deductions that no longer allowed under the law and that's the analysis that we are undergoing.","Other thing that I would say is that we are undergoing an analysis for the opportunities that we have to reinvest, some of that benefit to drive growth and efficiency and enhance our customer experience and we are actively working on that as we speak.","And with all of that, I will turn it back to Martin.","Martin Mucci","Great. Thank you, Efrain. And we will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question.","Danyal Hussain","Hi. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Good morning.","Danyal Hussain","Just on the tax rate, I know Efrain you talked about this being very preliminary at this point, could you just walk us through where there are offset at this point, it's your understanding versus the federal rate decrease? So, like how you are losing for example the domestic production\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yes. That's one. That's an important one. Danyal there is changes and deductibility of executive stock comp and then there is other deductions to which we avail ourselves. So, the combination of all of those will drive itself from the 21% range.","Danyal Hussain","Got it. So, what is it that gets you, I guess from 10% to 12%, it's just an understanding of\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yes. It's really is an understanding of the range. There is some complexity on a number of items in the bill that we are looking at. There also maybe some tax planning opportunities that we think we might be able to take advantage of and we are in that discussion.","Danyal Hussain","Okay. And just to clarify, you said the low-end of the range, you are referring to that 10 to 12 -- build low end of the\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yes. That's correct. Yes. I said if I had to peg it. I peg it at 10 around and 12.","Danyal Hussain","Okay. And then, just a one follow-up, I know you offer caveat at this, but the reinvestment, could you just talk a bit about what mean to the sales product maybe incremental M&A and to the extent you can quantify this at all?","Martin Mucci","Yes, Danyal. It's Marty. I think it's all of those. We are taking a look at the opportunities once we have a sense of the size of this. I mean there is some technology, what we are feeling good about the technology investments that we are making in the level that we are making. There are some things that are always there that we would like to accelerate. We would rather not mention those yet because we are kind of going through those and we want to talk to the Board about them as well in an upcoming meeting this quarter.","But, it's a number of technology investments that could accelerate and we just think that it's a great opportunity to focus, it obviously take some to the bottom line, but also to take the opportunity to invest and sustaining long-term growth both top line and profitability.","Danyal Hussain","Okay. Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. James Berkley of Barclays. You may now proceed.","James Berkley","Thanks. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Just wanted to touch on -- did you see any potential impact from Hurricanes in the quarter, if you could size that potential -- size that if you could? And then, if you did see an impact, are you certain to see a rebound at all or somewhere to what you saw with Sandy?","Efrain Rivera","You want to go ahead?","Martin Mucci","We have seen I think there has been some not as big of a rebound as Sandy. But, I don't think particularly when you look at Florida; it wasn't quite as while it was widespread it wasn't quite as catastrophic damage. We are definitely seeing some small business improvement there coming back as you will see particularly what you would expect, roofers and contractors and things like that. I wouldn't say it's been significant yet, but I think it will be a small increase, but a longer period of time because it appears that the work is kind of go on for a while for the repair. So they are not as catastrophic, so you don't see a big huge change, but you see an increased number of small businesses in those areas of improvement. And then, I think they will probably hang around a little bit longer. I wouldn't say a significant or any, certainly not making any significant change to the results. Is there something you to want add Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","No. It's just that, modest.","James Berkley","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. Any detail around the size or timing of some of the synergies you guys are expecting or seeing, starting to see with HROI acquisition on both revenue and cost side would be helpful.","Martin Mucci","Well, one thing we are seeing is, much faster than I think we have even expected by at least a quarter or so. The integration is going extremely well. The plan was to move -- to kind of combine -- a lot of the sales teams, not all of it, but a lot of the PEO sales teams across the country with HROI and we have got a very experienced sales and operations teams that we had in PEO and their leadership. And that seems to have really picked up the pace of the PEO at a great time for PEO sales anyway. And so, I wouldn't say we could quantify the benefit yet but it certainly right at the level that we expected and probably a little bit better from a sales and not a profit per se, but certainly integration of cost perspective both very positive in this first quarter with them.","James Berkley","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","Welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. You may now proceed.","Jim Schneider","Good morning, Martin and Efrain. It's good to hear to you and I guess I wanted to start out maybe talking about the -- what you are seeing in terms of mid-market sentiments, clearly with ACA, uncertainty in calendar 2017 there was a lot of questions about that was kind of stalled decision-making which we talked about many times. Can you maybe talk about looking forward now that there appears to be the kind of repeal the individual mandate, whether you have seen any kind of improvement in terms of clarity of decision-making or increase decision-making in the mid-market segment?","Martin Mucci","I think it's a little bit early, we are right in selling season now and while we feel there is some momentum out there. I think that mid-market is very competitive as it has been, no real change to that and the number of competitors or anything. I don't see at this stage a lot more decision-making. I think we are still kind of as we said we are kind of -- we had a lot of decisions made because of ACA and we certainly aren't seeing it back to that level and if anything, I think it's a little slower, because people made those decisions for a fully integrated HCM model that included payroll and insurances and everything else.","So, we're feeling good about selling season for mid-market, but I wouldn't say it's any, nothing like a big pop in demand like we saw when there was ACA. And ACA I think still very confusing, while the individual mandate is lifted, there is still, it's not clear what the reporting requirements are going to be and in fact that they don't seem to be, they are not eliminated yet, a lot of reporting requirements that will have to be done. And so we're seeing good retention on our ACA products and some interest in new clients and still taking those products to be sure that they can monitor, record and track and report or we can report for them their insurance.","Jim Schneider","Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess if you look forward, you talked about reinvestment, you talked about I believe potential M&A as one aspect of that reinvest of the benefits from the tax reform. So if you may be just kind of update or refresh your thoughts on overall M&A beyond the kind of tuck-in you've done before, are you considering potentially something of bigger scale that would be little bit more transformative to the business or not?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think that's always a possibility we're looking at a number of opportunities in M&A and there is a lot of opportunity out there. Valuations are still pretty high, so we're being very selective, I'm very proud of the fact that we've, while we've looked at 100s of opportunities over the years. We've picked very few and we've been very selective which have turned out to be very good like advance partners like HROI, just recently SurePayroll, et cetera. So, we're going to be very selective about what we pick, the good opportunities out there, I would say that, we look at this as an opportunity to possibly invest a little bit more. I would say transformational is always out there, but it has to be really something that we're comfortable with it, if that is to happen.","Jim Schneider","Okay. Thank you. And happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. Same to you.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. David Togut, Evercore ISI. You may now proceed.","David Togut","Thank you, good morning.","Martin Mucci","Hi David.","Efrain Rivera","Good morning.","David Togut","You talked, Marty about the beginning of the critical year-end holiday selling seasons particularly the mid-market, but I'm wondering if you could broaden your comments to talk about the small business payroll outsourcing and HR services market. And in particular, does the passage of tax legislation particularly the reduction of the statutory tax rate impact the propensity of the small business owner to buy your services?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it's obviously very early just passed, but I certainly think there is increased opportunity with anything whenever there is more complication and change, there is more opportunity for them to outsource right and say to go to someone. Look this is going to be a huge compliance workload in the next month to 45 days that makes take all the changes, the IRS getting through all this, everyone are understanding and getting back into forms and explaining it to clients. I think that's good for us, obviously could be, because the more complexity from that standpoint is not necessarily and typically complexity can stop new businesses from forming, I don't see that happening here in case and in fact some maybe encouraged as I think you are saying given the tax changes. And I think existing clients will find that the value of Paychex is really, they can really see even increased value of Paychex going through all of this change. So, I think there is some real opportunity there.","From a selling season perspective overall, it's pretty early and you know we saw some momentum in November on the small business side, that we're hopeful we'll continue and we'll see, a lot of things are shifting. So, the go-to-market strategy that we put into effect which put more on the web, new changes in our website, putting adding chat to our website, making it easier for clients to search. Paychex understand what Paychex is and then buy either online or really buy, through telesales, it looks like it's really starting to pick up, but its early Dave, we'll have to kind of see, we need to get to the end of January to really see what the big impact is on the small business.","HR, by the way HR services as we've noted and you've seen, growing very strong, very strong market for PEO retirement services and time and attendance for example, all growing well.","David Togut","Understood, and then, I'm curious if you saw anything during ADP is proxified with Pershing Square particularly their greater disclosure about their innovation strategy with their new ended back-end payroll engine and tax filing engine, whether any of that disclosure impacts the way you think about your own innovation tax, particularly given the excess cash you'll have under the new tax bill?","Martin Mucci","No I don't think so, I mean I think we've, they've ADP has always been a good competitor, I think we feel very comfortable with the technology investments that we've made in Flex and you know just introduced our new product bundles in October, our express product, payroll product on the low end. SurePayroll's investment, I think we feel good about the investments, but there is always some things that you'd like to do a little bit more in a quicker period of time and that's really from a technology side what we're reviewing is can we do that. It really hasn't, wouldn't haven't been influenced by ADP, they continue to be a good competitor and, and we feel very comfortable with competing against them.","David Togut","Thanks and just a quick final one from me. As you contemplate use of proceeds from, the tax cut, you mentioned particularly higher R&D, but what about dividend payout. I mean you have a terrific payout ratio around 80%, should we expect accelerating dividend growth once the tax cuts come through and would the payout ratio stay at approximately the same level?","Martin Mucci","Well I think, obviously that's a board decision, and so as we approach the next board meeting in the next month, that will be a good decision to have, I think the board has been very consistent with paying out a generous dividend, from when you look at others. But I think this, how big of a change that this is, I think they will continue to evaluate whether that's the proper level. But I don't have any doubt that we'll continue to be a leader in the way we pay out and it will be somewhat consistent certainly with what we've done in the past.","David Togut","Understood, thanks and happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, same to you.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. You may now proceed","Bryan Keane","Hi guys, just want to ask about payroll services growth, I think Marty or Efrain you suggested that the growth would be towards the low end of the range. Just trying to think a little bit about maybe the causes of that, I think you did mention client mix, so I just want to make sure I understand it?","Efrain Rivera","I think, Bryan the two biggest impacts of that and then there is one additional factor that could impact it in the back-half of the year. But if I go through the first six months of the year, what you're seeing are the impacts are going from an average client size in the upper 16s to about 16 and we disclosed that. So, we get that drag in the first half of the year and that's impacting us. On the pricing side, we, our pricing range is about 2 to 4 and we're netting around in that 2% range. So the combination of those two is driving us to where we are in the back-half of the year the wildcard will be how strong the selling season is, so we have a strong selling season we could start to build up from that number. And we are anticipating and hoping that we will.","Bryan Keane","So as client size gets smaller then you get the revenue yield is lower?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, yes.","Bryan Keane","Okay, and then just my question on the tax reform, so it sounds like some of that benefit then you are suggesting, might have reinvested so it would potentially go into investments which would lower margins, therefore we wouldn't see the full 100% impact to the bottom-line of the, I just want to make sure I got that correct?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, let me just add some new ones to that Bryan. So, the concept here is not that we simply reinvest and up the amount of expenses we have in the business. The idea is that we reinvest over a period of time over the next couple of years say, and that those investments pay out in future growth of the company in two forms. Number one, top-line growth, and number two could be earnings growth by becoming more effective and more efficient. So that's our thought process here, now that we think the current rate of spend needs to be upped and we have an opportunity, but instead that we have as Marty suggested earlier, the opportunity to take a look at a range of different projects both on the operation side and on the technology side to see if we can accelerate them.","And if they were on a roadmap let's say it was three to four years could we do that into and can we start to pull some of those projects forward and we have a robust list of things that we are looking at.","Bryan Keane","Okay, very helpful. Happy holidays guys.","Martin Mucci","Same to you.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And for the next question is from the line of Mr. Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. You may now proceed.","Gary Bisbee","I'll start by following up on this client mix shift. So in your, your 10-K for fiscal 2017 you said total clients, payroll clients I guess that it was flatted 605,000, so if the mix is, does this mean the mid-market clients or larger clients actually declined, but it was offset by growth in small clients?","Martin Mucci","Well, I mean, no, Gary, I think that the growth that we saw was on the lower end of our client base. We didn't see declines in the mid-market in the terms of number of clients. But as a percentage of the client base, because the rest of the client base shifted down to lower size clients. We've been seeing over the less, I would say certainly last couple of years more growth on the low end of the client base than on the higher end of the client base.","Gary Bisbee","And so, let me ask you about that metric, that 605,000 and I know that's rounded and everything else right, but the number u put in the 10-K every year is that just payroll and so is the number bigger if you have some segment that are doing HRS but not buying payroll or is that practice?","Efrain Rivera","No that includes clients that run payroll. So, that would capture, so some of those clients have additional ancillaries, but we count them if they run payroll less payroll clients.","Gary Bisbee","Yes, right, okay, all right. And so, I guess the next question then, continuing on the theme, so you've talked about the new bundles and the simpler pricing and adding some things there, I know its early, but what's the, how is that being received in the market as you people are out ahead of the key selling season, is that helping competitively or is that, are there any feedback you have at this point?","Martin Mucci","Yes, Gary. It's positive feedback from a couple of different standpoints one is the bundles being a little more competitive by adding things that others competitors don't have, like paperless onboarding, the two mid-level bundles have paperless onboarding and there is new do-it-yourself handbook, we've always had a handbook product, but we is very expensive and so we give information to the client that we work with them, kind of personally over the phone or in person to put that together. We found that the new do-it-yourself online handbook that is a little simpler and its more self-directed by the client is getting very good feedback in that bundle. So, and then express on the low end is getting good feedback.","So far its good feedback, it's early in selling season you really can't see it until January, particularly in small business and it's harder to predict. But we're doing positive feedback on it from what's in the bundle we think we kind of hit it right. So, we'll see how the selling season comes out.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, great. And then just the final one from me, each of you said in your remarks, alluded to PEO being poised for PEO and ASO maybe it was being poised for some acceleration over time and was that comment aimed at the comment you made about integrating the sales force HROI with your own and that going well or where there some other reason that you are optimistic about the positioning of the combined business there?","Martin Mucci","I think both, one the integration is going very well, so we added good leadership at HROI and there experienced with a very experienced team on the Paychex side across the country. So I think that's been very, that's been positive and I think is helping the growth in PEO. But overall I would say there right now PEO is, really is doing well, HR outsourcing in general, but PEO is doing well. I think it's just because of all the changing regulations, and it's been very positive from that standpoint. When you think about it, if you just take just think about minimum wage changes and how many are in different states, what we're finding and I have mentioned this before, what these businesses are going through now is even before tax reform changes was the fact that well federal regulations are trying to be reduced and are being reduced to some degree, state regulations are making it even more complex if you are multi-state employer. Different minimum wage changes, Paid Family Leave Act is different in New York than New Jersey different from other states. And now, lot of rules are even coming out and scheduling employees. And so, I think it's just that a shared employer is getting a lot of attention right now.","Gary Bisbee","That makes sense. Thanks. Happy holidays and Merry Christmas.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, same to you.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. You may now proceed.","Kartik Mehta","Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Hi, Kartik.","Kartik Mehta","Marty as you looked at the selling season and you kind of compared to what you've seen in the last couple of years and the changes that are going on maybe more people going to the internet to look for payroll. Is that at all changed in how you are managing the sales process and what you are investing in and ultimately could some of the investments you are talking about as a result of tax reform would be related to that?","Martin Mucci","Well certainly and you know we've already started those investments, Kartik we talked about how we really up the investment in digital marketing and in getting more leads we've invested in the website. We've now rolled out chat different forms of live chat on the website, because definitely what you are saying, small business micro in particular let's say less than five employees, there is 60% of the way through the sales process just in the search online by themselves and they are ready to buy. So the change that we made beginning of this fiscal year, where we added more sales reps and the virtual teams or telesales, has really started to pay off. And we're learning and tweaking on the leads and how to get more leads and how to do that and how to do in the most efficient way. But that certainly could be part of the investment.","Now if you go back to what Efrain said though on top there to be clear, this is not just about saying okay we're going to raise the level of ongoing expense, but we're looking for some, is there some technology investments that could be made over the next, this fiscal, next fiscal, that while you're getting the biggest benefit of tax reform that we could accelerate those investments to maybe speed that up. So, no more feeling pretty good, selling season again, I won't comment, because it's too early particularly for small business, but I were very bullish on how the virtual sales is going to take off. The field that also gets very focused on, kind of the five plus and larger clients and has more time for that in the, when clients want to call in and buy telesales is ready to do it.","Kartik Mehta","And Marty, in the past I know you focus on acquiring companies there may be private and bolting on those companies, as you look at this tax reform do you think there is any change in evaluation, I know evaluations kind of kept you on the sidelines, but do you think there is any change in evaluation, because of the tax reform, could that have any impact on what you look at or what happens to evaluations?","Martin Mucci","I suppose it depends certainly on the company and their profitability, right if its, if many of these companies at least if they are depending on their size and profitability whether the tax reform will even impact them or not or whether they have carry losses and forwards and things like that. So, I think it could have some impact, I don't think we're seeing that right now, but that certainly would measure into things that we're looking at.","Efrain Rivera","I think the other thing I would add Kartik, the inability to deduct interest expense above certain caps makes certain targets more attractive than they otherwise would be at the margin. Now I just want to caveat that I'm not saying that we have a target in mind, but that those opportunities will be there, it's not a great place to be if you have a significant amount of that in your capital structure and companies like Paychex that don't operate that way can bring value in those situation. So, I would say at the margin those opportunities will be more attractive.","Kartik Mehta","And then Efrain just one last question, the interest on clients' funds does the rate change and\/or the tax reform change at all, how you will invest these funds?","Efrain Rivera","Yes it actually, it actually could have an impact. So, I was reticent or we were reticent, we had a discussion internally about attempting the modified guidance with all of these changes going on. But, it's certainly could impact the composition of the portfolio which in turn could impact the effective tax rate. And the point I'm making is that, you may end up in a world where corporates are more, corporate taxable bonds or more favorable investment vehicles which would drive your effective tax rate up, but won't have much with a change in the bottom-line and we're looking at the composition of the portfolio to understand if it makes sense over time to change the shift from almost all municipals and some corporates to more corporates and fewer municipals. So, that's all part of the raft of considerations that we need to think about.","Kartik Mehta","All right, thank you, Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Kartik.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. You may now proceed.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Hi Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Good morning, Martin. Good morning, Efrain. I wanted to go once more to sort of the derivative impact of tax reform, now you addressed the propensity to outsource might go up because these are complex. But what are your SME clients saying to you about potential higher employment and things like that. Can that down the road effect, that client makes metric that's hurting payroll process?","Martin Mucci","Frankly, Ashwin, at this point they are not saying anything, because I think they are still trying to figure it all out. But I think that, they will certainly, if to the degree that a small business, gains or benefit on tax reform, they some, many in small businesses aren't that profitable, so they might not, pick up that much gain. But they will certainly I think the overall feeling is, hey they will have an opportunity to invest in their business hire more people and they will do it that way. So that they can expand, so that's certainly should be another positive opportunity for us to, even existing clients be able to add more employees which will help us with more checks. And they may now say okay, I can spend on a 401(k) and make a contribution. So I'll take a 401(k) and we're looking at all of our marketing to our clients and prospects to say, you may, this may be the time that you want to invest in health insurance, invest in 401(k) retirement plans or IROA, or something else that Paychex can provide to you and make it easy form as they see their benefit.","Efrain Rivera","And so the other thing Ashwin to build on what Marty says, our thinking as we go through, go forward is that, the tilt will be in the future towards comprehensive outsourcing solutions. So, bundling benefits, bundling other ancillaries that if there was a trend to do that in the past there is more and we think we have made, we have shown by our investment dollars that we think the PEOs going to be a beneficiary. But to Marty's point, we think there is going to be other areas of the business on the ancillary side that will benefit from more available cash in the hands of small business owner, small, medium size business owners.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Understood. And is it for the near-term possible to quantify or have you put in your forward expectations here. So the strength of any one-time reporting noted if there is complexity in the next one to two quarters?","Efrain Rivera","I think it's early and I think where you would see and where it would be easier to do is really on the PEO side more than anything else. But, I think we're early in the process to see what's going on.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. One more along those lines, lower withholding because of this less effective investment plan?","Efrain Rivera","So, the impact we think will be between $200 million to $300 million on client funds, at the margin we think that's about a penny EPS going forward, I'm sorry on an annualized basis; I don't want to close an estimate revision at this point. This is yet another kind of guessed earlier about the portfolio, client funds will decline as a result of this, it's a modest impact given the portfolio, but it will have an impact on where we're rolling through all of those impacts to be able to speak with more certainty as we go forward.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And one question not related to any of these, cash flow for the last six months been quite good, how much of that is timing and what's sustainable for the course of the year and if you could kind of\u2026","Efrain Rivera","No, I think 26 was high, I don't have an exact percentage obviously 26 through the first half of the year, there were some unique items that occurred we had fourth quarter was artificially low and the per six months are probably a little artificially high. But we, I think double-digit certainly is where we're going, I think, I just add one other point on that, our cash generation has been tremendously strong. So, we continue to deliver high quality earnings.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Thanks. And happy holidays both of you.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. Same to you.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Ashwin. You too.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. You may now proceed.","Rick Eskelsen","Hi, good morning, Marty, how are you. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one again following on the tax reform theme. You guys are talking about reinvesting, I assume some of your competitors would probably look at similar things, so in terms of overall market competition or in what you see, what impact do you think you could see from tax reform on the competitiveness of the market?","Efrain Rivera","Well, I'd say this Rick, and then Marty can also build up on it. Hey if you got more in your award chest you are in a better position. So, I would say those who have in the award chest or in a better position to be able to compete in a landscape where resources matter. So, I would say we're that's one reason why as we looked at the opportunity we said there are, there are opportunities to accelerate some high value projects and opportunities and this is the time to start thinking about doing that over the next couple of years.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think you know as Efrain said, it's an interesting point when you think about there is companies that are going to gain from this, in our competitive environment and there is others that won't because, they don't have the profitability and the tax reduction that we're going to have and we will be able to invest more where others aren't going to gain that much. So, I think it will continue to put companies who are already profitable and who have been paying a high tax and now will pay lower that should help us to be, if we plan this right and invest correctly, this will make us even more competitive than we are today with some others who can't do the same level of increased investment.","Rick Eskelsen","Thanks, that's helpful. And just sort of building on that a little bit, two questions on the CapEx, I know this is a little bit higher this quarter, I think based on your disclosure due to the campus build out. So I guess the question\u2026","Martin Mucci","Yes, look on the presentation we posted on the website it's a, CapEx it can be, I think we said 180 to 190 for the year, I think it's going to be come in a little bit lower, you can see what we spent in the quarter on the campus, one thing I would, I think it's very important to emphasize, I keep saying this the build out on the campus permits us to consolidate leases and save expenses on an operating basis going forward. So that's why we did not, no reason other than that. It gets efficiencies, but I should say from a financial standpoint, it was a very attractive deal for us.","Rick Eskelsen","And is that primarily the campus build out, is that primarily going to happen this year and then thinking about CapEx and the investments you guys have talked about, how should we think about, some of those investments being, the technology and CapEx side moving forward?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so it's primarily this year Rick. So, we may have some spill over capital into next year, but most of it occurs this year.","Rick Eskelsen","And the longer term, I mean is there what you're accelerating from investments should we look for that CapEx number to maybe dripped up slightly in the next coming year?","Efrain Rivera","It could, so if you look at what we've been standing we're in that, call it 3.5% of revenue range somewhere in that sometimes we bounce up a little bit higher to closer to 4%. You know that's sort of our normalized CapEx, I'm sorry, capital expense amount. We could bounce a little higher, if we saw projects that made sense. It's not going to - I wouldn't anticipate at this point that it would bounce up to the level that we're spending this year, because of the building.","Rick Eskelsen","Great. Thank you very much. Happy holidays.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks. You too.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may now proceed.","Jason Kupferberg","Great. How are you guys doing?","Martin Mucci","Good. Thanks.","Jason Kupferberg","Good, good. So, just one more on tax, I just wanted to push a little bit on the reinvestments, I know it's premature to have kind of precise numbers, and as far as how much you may reinvest. But can you just, maybe roughly dimension it for us, I mean we're talking about, 10% of the benefit 40%, just some rough order of magnitude to give investors a sense of how you guys are thinking about the reinvestment opportunities?","Efrain Rivera","So here is our precise, about as precise that could be, I would say its half or less.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. I'll take it. Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","But the reason why, I don't mean to be flipping and that wasn't a flipped commented it actually is a serious comment. The process when you are doing this, is that you collect a lot of opportunities and Marty will sit down and management team will sit down and say what do we think are the things that really move the needle, as oppose to or just opportunities to spend and give us a bit of an incremental bump. And then we are going to go through a conversation at the board level to discuss what their comfort level is and then we're going to look at it all together and does it make sense, but from both and investor standpoint and from a business standpoint. And so, we're in any one and a half to two of that process it will accelerate certainly over the next month or so, but it is a little bit early. We know the opportunities there, we certainly would drop all of it into the opportunities, but we think we do have opportunities to spend and we're going to rank order them and then do that.","Jason Kupferberg","All right. So you think by the time to the next earnings call we'll have.","Efrain Rivera","Oh, yes. Definitely, yes.","Jason Kupferberg","Yes, okay, okay great. I don't think I heard much just about kind of bookings and retention in the quarter, I mean these qualitatively and I know you don't give hard numbers, but you are facing some easier comparisons, I know you are targeting for bookings to be positive on a full year-over-year basis for 2018 that still on track and are you seeing further up ticks in retention post the implementation of a new client service model.","Martin Mucci","I think retention has been very consistent through the year, so I think that's been positive, it's near all time highs that we had and we are rebounding back from last year where we dropped of just a little bit. So, I think it's been pretty consistent, pretty positive there. And again, we will have a good -- the best sense after January and certainly the same for sales. We don't normally Jason talk about it, until after we get through the selling season. But, we had some momentum in November and so it's always hard to tell exactly but we are feeling pretty good about it. And we will see how we come out with the new bundles for the service model changed with the sales, go to market stuff that we have done with the virtual team inside and the increase in web investment. We are feeling good, it's just early in, little tough to talk about until we know.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And just a last one on core payroll, I guess we have a slight tweak here to the low-end of 1% to 2% for the year. So, I guess what around the edges kind of changed in your guys mind over the last three months. Because it doesn't sound like the hurricane impacts were any worse than you'd feared and I think we had talked about the smaller client sizes last quarter. But, just wanted to see if there was anything discernible that led you to the lower end?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Jason, I think the thing that beyond the things that I mentioned, the speed and the pace of ramp always impacts payroll revenue growth. And so, we tweaked it based on what we are seeing in terms of the pace of the ramp through the year. That I think it's our -- the reason we tweaked at this point.","Jason Kupferberg","Just a ramp of the metrics itself, you mean like in other words, now you are taking a truck point halfway through the year and just feel like the low end is more likely? Okay. Got it. All right. Have a great holiday. Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks. You too.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Tim McHugh of William Blair Company. You may now proceed.","Tim McHugh","Yes. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the comments you referenced I guess once or twice on November, is that related to macro data or your -- I guess company's specific comment, and if it's company specific, can you elaborate on what the momentum was that you are referring to that that makes you feel better?","Martin Mucci","I mean just generally you are starting to head into that selling season. And it, we had some momentum there. That was specific to us, Tim. So, not in the macro sense but more specific to us. Just as you getting into this year end time, we felt pretty good about. The first part of the quarter was okay, it was kind of like, I'm sorry, first part of the second quarter, it was kind of like the first quarter. And then, November, seem to had a little bit of an up tick. But, it doesn't make the selling season. So, we hate the comment much more than that, just that if you are pretty good empirically, if you look at the HRS side of it, we certainly saw a nice up tick in the PEO side. So, I think we are feeling pretty -- I'm feeling pretty positive coming out of November. But, again, I could tell you a lot more after this next quarter.","Tim McHugh","Okay. One other question, just HROI, I guess when I do the math on the revenue and contribution and the expense impacted it, looks like it was breakeven even maybe slightly worse than that?","Efrain Rivera","It was modestly negative Tim, but, really not a significant impact.","Tim McHugh","Can you -- why, was that integration expense or\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Deal, you always have integration cost. So there is the -- when we do a deal, we are assuming that we got to do a number of investments. And then, there is the amortization associated with the deal itself that had expense and that starts to lessen as the quarter grow -- as we go through the quarter.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. David Grossman of Stifel Financial. You may now proceed.","David Grossman","Thank you. Good morning. I wonder, if I can just go back to the unit growth question that has been coming up in terms of and the impact of mix on that number. I mean, my recollection is that a typical economic cycle is that, is it mature as you have the tendency to be adding new business creations improves and our mix naturally skews to smaller companies or smaller clients than the average. And so that's a natural phenomenon, so in fact that pressuring perhaps payroll growth for the low? And are there other dynamics maybe that are really have work that really are driving that number down, because typically you will get volume in terms of total units that were offset that decline. And I'm just wondering is this cycle different or is it anything else going on in the business that maybe impacting the growth of that number?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I think it really boils down, you could kind of summarize it by saying last year we didn't have a fine growth. We talked a bit about why that was at the end of the year and a lot of that related to service disruptions and the spike and retention, I'm sorry, spike and attrition that we had, we dropped by a point. When you put that together with the result -- the sales results and the mix shift that we are seeing you are driving client -- I'm sorry, you are driving payroll service revenue to the rate that we are experiencing. So, I think was a little idiosyncratic now is that we are anniversarying some of that retention issue that we had last year and it's driving payroll service revenue down.","David Grossman","Right. So, I guess this question was asked in a different context, so then the difference if we knew about the retention and the headwind that we would have going into this year, is the difference primarily related to a pricing dynamic or what is it that specifically is\u2026","Efrain Rivera","It's not a pricing dynamic. I would say at the margin pricing is a little bit more competitive in small market payroll under 50 than it was last year. So, we are realizing about 2%. But, again, I'm comparing against growth against last year, where I experienced -- started to experience some of the defects in the back half of that year. So the front half is a little more challenge than the back half will be.","David Grossman","I got it. Okay. And then, the second question I had relates to the PEO, when you back out the distortion from HROI, can you give us a sense of at least organically what work side employees, how that growth is trending?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I don't know that I've got the exact number. We haven't disclosed it. But, I would say this David, it's pretty solid, it can certainly -- upper single digits, maybe double digits, I have to go back. But, I would say that's the range, I won't be more specific than that. But, I would say that's the range, I won't be more specific than that. But, I think the point if I can think about the point beyond your question, we have had obviously very good work side employee growth. But, its not all because of HROI, we think have work side employee growth on our PEO also.","Martin Mucci","Yes. It's been pretty consistent. We went over a million work side employees that we serve and that was -- that's without that was before HROI. So, I think that numbers are in that range. That's the range.","David Grossman","And any thoughts on just at a high level how [indiscernible] are impacting revenues this year, is there any noticeable difference in terms of insurance past service and how that maybe impacting revenue growth?","Efrain Rivera","Not really David. I think there is a little bit more impact, by the way, I just looked it up, so the best that I will say, our organic work side play growth was double-digit. So we are seeing nice performance, Marty alluded to that. I didn't have the numbers in front of me, I looked it up.","So, past service are not -- that past, I should say that, there is at the margin more pass through because of the addition of HROI. It's not significantly distorting the growth numbers. I would say as the percentage of business that we are deriving from PEO growth, you will see more. One of the thing I would say because -- advice as to whether we report it more regularly through that every single year, it's been 10k pass through. So, we look at whether we had that disclosure.","David Grossman","Right. And then, just one last thing on the PEO. You made this acquisition, I don't remember what your historical exposure was to blue-gray segment. So, yes, just curious, you made this acquisition, how do you see the market evolving over the next couple of years, vis-\u00e0-vis [indiscernible] historical perspective was, let's say two or three years prior to this.","Martin Mucci","You mean, in general for the PEO, I think we are stilling looking at it consistently as we've always had. That's one of the things we liked about HROI. They were very consistent from a way they went after clients selected clients. We had a very good way to compliance wave there to look at it in underwriting and I think they were very consistent with that as well. So, I don't think we are increasing risk as we take on these PEOs as we taken on a company like HROI, because they are very consistent with the way we looked at it. And I don't see us getting more risky we don't see it that way. We have always been pretty careful on that and actually had a very strong PEO because of that we have to grow without taking and really additional risk over the parameters that we have always had in the past.","Efrain Rivera","We think that segment in the market David also continued to grow. And particularly growth in areas where HROI is strong and we are strong.","David Grossman","Right. Okay, guys. Thanks very much. Have a great holiday.","Martin Mucci","Thank you too.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Mark Marcon of Baird. You may now proceed sir.","Mark Marcon","Hey, Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Hey, Mark.","Mark Marcon","With regards to HROI, was the contribution in this past quarter, somewhere around $20 million?","Efrain Rivera","I think you can derive that, Mark. It's in that range.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And then, with regards to the effective yield for the back off of this year, just given with the recent rate, increase, how should we think about that in terms of -- think about the flow balance coming down by 200 to 300\u2026.","Efrain Rivera","All in the back half of the year, Mark. I just cautioned you to --","Mark Marcon","Yes. I know with the duration and everything. That's why I was asking the question.","Efrain Rivera","So, I think we still feel comfortable with the guidance that we've given. So, that's where we peg it at. The reason why I'm not, I can't more specific in that that market, we are looking at the composition of portfolio and over the next three, four, five months it could change. So, but we are comfortable with where we are right.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And then, with regards to -- this small business formation, there has been a lot of discussion about just the way pass throughs are going to work, don't you think that there is going to ultimately end being a little bit more in terms of small business formations that could end up occurring because of this change in and this so, how would you take advantage of that?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think -- I do think that you would expect that given the reform that you are seeing in that would drive some of that. We obviously, haven't seen it yet. But, you certainly get that feeling that will happen. We would take advantage of it by being out there and marketing to the fact that, if you are going to incorporate it as a small business for the first time in particular, you would best have someone like Paychex there to support you. So, I would think we are already looking at how can marketing take advantage of anything that comes out of tax reform and that is certainly one of them.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then, just with regards to the capital expensing provisions and the ability to deduct all of that related to over the next five years. To what extent, would you end up really taking advantage of that, I mean could you -- do you have other ways to take advantage of it to a greater extent than just marginally increasing your CapEx?","Efrain Rivera","There maybe Mark. And I would just say its early in the process, so we are going to take a look at that.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And then, in terms of just very short-term one-time impact, to what extent are you going to have to spend more in a very short-term just to get the systems into compliance. It sounds like the IRS is basically not going to give the new withholding tables until February, so you are going to have to -- it's going to be a bit of a scramble here in terms of calendar Q1?","Martin Mucci","No. I don't think, we are ready, we are dealing working with the IRS almost daily on what's happening in and how we will be able to support them and that's the strength of a company of our size and our compliance team and tax team that they are ready -- they know it's going to be a scramble, they are expecting it. And we work very closely with the IRS to help them and work with them, so that everything is up and running as quickly as possible. I don't think it's not going to cost us additional expense in the quarter or something like that. I mean, truly there is going to be a lot of extra work, but our teams will be ready to do it. I don't see a big -- any big investment or change because of it.","Mark Marcon","Okay, great. And anything to think about with regards to your deferred income tax liability?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. There will be a reval, we will and it will produce a benefit, looking through that.","Mark Marcon","Yes. Okay. I mean obviously everybody will know to look through it but I just brought it up just\u2026","Efrain Rivera","No. I know. I appreciate it, Mark. But, yes, we are not ready to quantify it yet. But there will be some benefit one-time.","Mark Marcon","Okay, great. Happy, happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Same to you Mark.","Mark Marcon","All right. Take care.","Efrain Rivera","Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO. You may now proceed.","Henry Chien","Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain.","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Jeff.","Henry Chien","Hey, it is actually Henry Chien.","Efrain Rivera","Oh, Henry, sorry.","Henry Chien","Hey, guys. Thanks for speaking to me. Just I wanted to ask a more high level just competitive kind of positioning question. There does seem to be a ton of investment going into the HR services and HR bundles from both ADP and software providers. I was just wondering if you could share any updated thoughts on how Paychex is doing this season in terms of HR sales and where Paychex is doing better or just how you are thinking about positioning in general? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","I think -- Henry, I think the -- competitive environment is pretty much the same, everybody is investing, we feel very good about the investments we have made, in fact, we've really taken it to -- we have taken our entire development team really a year or more ago over to really agile teams. We develop and roll out changes much faster now. We rolled up to new bundles in October that include, so it's not just payroll bundles, they are bundles with HR components to them like paperless handboarding for our clients, so that you can basically recruit, post recruit, hire bring them on up in a paperless fashion in part of one of our bundles that they can buy or do it yourself handbook because we found instead of the more complicated handbook and more thorough handbook that needs personal interaction, more clients want to do it themselves and have a scale down, when they can complete at their own pace, and when they want to do it. And all that innovation has been quick and rolls and rolls out very successfully. And we haven't even talked on the call at all about mobile. Our mobile adoption and the use of our mobile app has picked up dramatically and it's been by -- more by the employees of the clients versus the employer.","So, these innovations have been very good. We see tax reforms and opportunities, we have said a number of times to possibly accelerate a few things that are on the outskirts of what we wanted to do and bring them forward a little bit. But, we are very comfortable with our level of innovation and competitiveness in the market. And I don't -- I think it's been pretty consistent. We expect, you got to innovate, you got to have a great service, you got to deliver and I think Paychex and our folks are doing that.","Henry Chien","Got it. Okay. That's great. And just in terms of the kind of macro environment, it sounded like that the smaller client sizes, it's a number of I guess business formations has been picking up from your view. Is that sort of a normal kind of pattern that you've seen from your experience over cycles and is there anything that we should watch out for, that you are watching for to just to be careful in terms of the macro environment?","Martin Mucci","I don't -- we haven't talked too much about formation itself. But, it's kind of flattened out, it's kind of back to the levels, pretty close to the levels that it was in the previous session. I think the big thing on this after this recession was how long it took. It didn't pop right back. It took a lot longer. But, it was sustained longer. The thing I mentioned earlier is, on our monthly employment report, what we are seeing is that job growth -- the small business job growth under 50 employees has moderated, but there is still job growth and consistent job growth. But, it moderated down as you would expect as we are around full employment. But, the wage increases are now picking up and part of that is scarcity of the resource because of full employment. So the wage increases are now getting up from that 2% and getting closer to 3% and running around 2.8% or so. And I think, so you are seeing pretty good wage increase, and then, you are seeing the moderate small business job growth that's all pretty positive.","The thing to look out for maybe what was mentioned couple of questions ago, which is with the pass throughs and the tax reform, does that generate new business formation for someone who was not going to formulate a business before now it may make sense for them. We may see a pick-up in that just a little bit early to tell.","Henry Chien","Okay. Thanks so much for the color.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. You may now proceed.","Tien-tsin Huang","Real quick. Just on the -- I wanted to clarify on the pricing side, just with all the bundling and pricing and simplification, any change in pricing in the quarter and sort of your outlook, I didn't think so, but just wanted to make sure.","Martin Mucci","No. Really the product, the bundles were more since you are combining the features, making the pricing simpler in a way that we present it to the client. We don't see that is changing the revenue per client or what we are getting from in price. We haven't seen it yet. It's early, but didn't expect it, and haven't seen it yet.","Tien-tsin Huang","All right. That's great. Thank you. Have a safe holiday.","Martin Mucci","Great. Thanks. You too.","Efrain Rivera","Bye-bye","Martin Mucci","Anymore calls operator?","Operator","I'm sorry, sir. At this time, there are no further questions on queue.","Martin Mucci","Great. At this point we will close the call. If you are interesting in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 30 days.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","I'll now turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Great, thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2015, and our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be made available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.","On today\u2019s call, I'll review highlights for the first quarter in relation to operations, sales and product innovation. Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance, and then we'll open it up for your questions.","We're off to a good start in fiscal 2016 with positive results across our major product lines. We've continued our momentum in both sales and new product enhancements. Client satisfaction and client retention also remain at high levels.","Payroll service revenue growth of 5% was in line with our expectations and we also continue to see strong demand for our human resource outsourcing solutions including double-digit growth in client work site employees served. Total service revenue grew 8% in the first quarter.","I want to mention very important to us that Paychex was recognized as a leader in the July 2015 Gartner Magic Quadrant for payroll business outsourcing services advancing from our challenger position in 2014.","The 2015 Magic Quadrant evaluates the capabilities of 12 key providers of payroll BPO services across the globe and I would like to read to you some of the facts that came out of Gartner's release. Paychex ranked highest of all participating providers in overall satisfaction across payroll functions, technology, provider customer relationship and payroll BPO service outcomes.","Our strengths according to Gartner and our clients -- the survey of our clients, was a clear focus on our target market, ease of implementation and use, and investment and innovation, Paychex's integrated HCM platform, Paychex Flex, better aligned to the technologies internally and the company has demonstrated significant innovation in mobile phone and tablet apps.","We're very proud of this and the fact that the leader designation by Gartner means that we execute well against current vision and are well positioned for the future.","So we're very proud of that and I am very proud of the entire Paychex team that was instrumental in achieving this designation. It fits a lot of what we've been talking about over the last few years about our significant increased investment in innovation and product.","The launch last year of Paychex Flex, our cloud-based integrated human capital management platform, provides us the ability to deliver a streamlined and integrated workforce management solution to a broad range of clients.","This platform gives our clients the features and functionality they need today and also allows them to easily add services as their needs change and the Gartner designation as an innovation leader is the result of our commitment to that investment in both technology and client service, focusing on the clients and the total value proposition to them.","At our Investor Day in July, many of you have the opportunity to learn more about Paychex's Flex and our integrated software-as-a-service solution suite of HCM products. We're very proud of our leading edge technology and the strength of Paychex's Flex is at the single platform utilizing the single employee record in addition to a number of client service options.","We recently launched our Paychex Flex hiring module, which gives employers access to paperless recruiting and employee screening, along with a robust onboarding model for a seamless flow of information and data access.","At HR Tech, we plan to announce additional enhancements to Flex with the integration of employee benefits and time and attendance functionality, which will round out the HCM suite.","We now have the most robust mobility offerings for both administrative users and employee self service that allow access to all of our HCM suite from a single mobile application.","Last fiscal year, we launched our full service Paychex's Employer Shared Responsibility Service to assist clients navigating the Affordable Care Act. Our ESR product includes a monthly monitoring service with automatic alerts as well as yearend reporting on Forms 1094 and Forms 1095. We're pleased with the level of continued client acceptance that we've experienced.","The positive momentum we saw in fiscal 2015 in sales execution has continued solidly into 2016. Our integrated team selling approach continues to produce strong results by introducing a full suite of product value that Paychex can offer our clients upfront.","Our execution and service operations has continued its standard of excellence, demonstrated by strong client satisfaction results and client retention levels that remain consistent with recent highs.","Our innovative leading edge technology, coupled with this exceptional client service makes us different in the market and that\u2019s what we focus on.","We\u2019ve also continued to take steps to add additional value to our shareholders. In July, we increased our quarterly dividend 11% to $0.42 a share maintaining a very competitive dividend yield, one of the highest in our industry.","We've also continued to repurchase Paychex's stock and acquired another 1.3 million shares of common stock in the first quarter of '16 -- fiscal '16.","In summary, we\u2019re off to a solid start for sales, service, product strength and financial performance for fiscal 2016 and I appreciate the great work of the 13,000 Paychex employee team across the country.","I'll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Marty. Good morning to all of you.","I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk referred to the usual disclaimers.","As Marty indicated our first quarter financial results for fiscal 2016 show we're off to a solid start for the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2016 outlook.","Total service revenue grew 8% for the first quarter to $712 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 6% for the first quarter to $11 million. Now we\u2019ve had a number of quarters in a row where we've strung together increases on funds held for clients. So that part of the P&L is starting to bounce back. This was driven in part by 2% increase in average investment balances.","Expenses increased 7% for the first quarter, primarily driven by higher compensation related cost and growth in our PEO. The increase in compensation related cost was driven by higher wages and performance-based comp cost.","Operating income, net of certain items, increased 11% to $285 million for the quarter. We achieved operating margins of 40% up from 39% in the prior year quarter. Remember that our operating margins typically are higher in the first half of the year.","At this stage in the year, we anticipate our full year operating margin will fall within the guidance we have provided. We'll update again of course in Q2.","Our effective income tax rate was 29.7% for the first quarter compared to 36.3% last year. This change is due to the recognition of a net tax benefit on income derived in prior years from customer facing software we produced.","During the past quarter, we engaged a leading specialist in the area to assess the qualification on our software for the federal qualified production activities deduction. Based on this assessment, we concluded that certain of our software offerings qualified for this tax deduction in prior years and therefore recognized the tax benefits and related tax reserves as a discrete item during the period.","This action dovetails with Marty\u2019s comments. We're a technology enabled service provider and our spending, our cost reflect this, as does the recognition we're receiving in the marketplace.","Net income increased 22% to $209 million and diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $0.58 per share. The net tax benefit I just mentioned resulted in an increase in diluted EPS of $0.06. Let me emphasize again that the impacted diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.06, that's what we expect it will be through the year as you look at your models. Obviously that was not contemplated in the guidance we gave.","Excluding this net tax benefit, both net income and diluted earnings per share would have increased 11%. Payroll service revenue increased 5% for the first quarter to $433 million. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base.","In addition we have one additional payroll processing day in the first quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. Revenue per check as a result of pricing -- I am sorry, revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting.","And on the payroll service revenue, I'll just remind you what we said last quarter that we think that the addition of extra days would result in approximately one half of a percent to the growth in payroll service revenue for the year. We won\u2019t break it down by quarters.","HRS revenue grew 15% to $280 million for the first quarter. This increase reflect strong growth in both clients and work site employees at Paychex HR services, which includes our ASO and PEO products.","Insurance services benefited from continuing growth of our full service ESR product assisting clients with healthcare reform and increase in health and benefits applicants and higher average premiums and clients in our Worker\u2019s Compensation Insurance product.","Our HR Administration and time and attendance products contributed to the growth through sales of success of these solutions and as I mentioned at the Investor Day, these products are typically sold as part of the bundle in our payroll packages.","Retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in the number of plans and an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value participants funds.","Turning to our investment portfolio, our goal is to predict, protect principal and optimize liquidity, on the short term side primary short term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts, high quality commercial paper and variable rate demand notes.","In our longer term portfolio, we continue to invest primarily in high credit quality and municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. Government securities. Our long term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and average duration of 3.3 years.","Our combined portfolio is an average rate of return of 1% for the first quarter and as I mentioned again, in last year's quarter, we have not factored into our guidance any changes in the interest rate environment although it\u2019s looking like that will happen in either Q2 or Q3.","Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during first quarter, primarily driven by growth in our client base.","I'll now walk you through the results of our financial position. We remain strong with cash and total corporate investments of $954 million as of August 2015 and we have no debt. Funds held for clients as of August were $3.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015.","However funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.8 billion for the quarter a year-over-year increase of 2% and it\u2019s the average that counts.","Our total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $24 million as of the end of August, compared with a net unrealized gain of [$40] [ph] million as of the end of May.","Total stockholder's equity was $1.8 billion as of August, reflecting a $152 million in dividends paid during the first quarter and 63 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 38%.","Our cash flows from operations were $278 million for the first quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. This change is primarily a result of higher net income partially offset by fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities.","The fluctuation in operating assets and liabilities were primarily related to the timing and collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll and income taxes, working capital was what created the change there in our cash flows.","I'd like to remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes and I just mentioned we\u2019re anticipated at some point during the year that the federal raise rates.","With that proviso, our guidance for fiscal 2016 is as followed: Payroll service revenue continues to be anticipated in the range of 4% to 5%, HRS revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 10% to 13%, although we we're higher. Obviously in Q1, we think that there will be a moderation in growth rates as the year progresses.","Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 7% to 8% and net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Remember please that I called out the change in the discrete tax item which was $0.06. So our range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter.","Our effective tax rate for the year excluding the impact of the net tax benefit discussed will be approximately 36%. Our interest on funds held for clients and operating income net of certain items as a percentage of service revenue are expected to be consistent with prior guidance and all other aspects of guidance that we discussed on the Q4 call are unchanged.","I will now turn it back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Efrain, and now operator, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. SK Prasad Borra from Goldman Sachs. Sir, you line is open.","SK Prasad","Thanks for taking my question, two if I may. Help me, to start off, Marty to what extent the full year guidance is just being more conservative and given you have such a strong stock through the year, are you expecting second and third quarters to slow down and if that's going to be related to more processing days or something more to think about?","Efrain Rivera","SK, this is Efrain. I\u2019ll take that. So we're always glad to have a strong start to the year that helps and increases our confidence in the guidance for the year, but one quarter doesn\u2019t make a year.","I will say also that we called out that Q3 was going to be somewhat weaker than the other quarter. So there probably is an element of conservatism in our guidance, but at this point, we're not going to peg it any higher. We\u2019ll update in Q2 as we see results for the year come in.","SK Prasad","Okay. That\u2019s great. Probably just second question, with regards to what you guys were talking about at the Investor Day. The focus clearly seems to be on generating more revenue per client, but client growth also is something we should probably benefit from sales and marketing investments.","Are you seeing any progress on that or would say that from your end, it\u2019s very clearly going to be just revenue per client and client per growth should stay at 2% to 3% levels at best.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, SK, I think \u2013 no, I think we're seeing progress on both. We don\u2019t give the client growth until the end of the year once a year, but it's very consistent, I think we're showing consistency in both where the team is selling the integrated selling upfront is doing well on the revenue side from the packages and of course the new products that we're rolling out, but it's also driving more interest in more clients and selling more clients.","We\u2019d always like it as strong as it could be and it\u2019s early and selling season will tell us a lot more here in the next quarter or so, but no, we're pushing hard for both and we're making progress on both.","SK Prasad","Probably, just last one on competitive landscape, have you seen any changes at all given the acceleration in investments by a lot of the newer start ups, especially in the payroll space?","Martin Mucci","Not really. I think we continue to see good results from a selling perspective and so while they're out there, I don\u2019t think anyone has -- no one has the sales team that we have, the distribution model and the number of sales people and the effectiveness.","And so on the low end I think they sell very effectively and the low end being size, and then certainly the mid market, I think we're at the strongest -- we continue to be at the strongest position we've ever been in from a product and service perspective.","So we really haven\u2019t seen a lot of changes. If anything I would say we\u2019re in a better position than we were last year at this time.","SK Prasad","That\u2019s great. Thanks Marty, thanks Efrain.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you, SK.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. David Togut of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning, Marty and Efrain.","Efrain Rivera","Hi David.","David Togut","Could you gauge net price increases that you're realizing both in the payroll services and human resources services business this year?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. A little bit different on HRS and we typically don\u2019t get real specific about how much we take. That\u2019s a little bit different typically from payroll service, some day, some years I should say. We don\u2019t increase certain product lines, but I would say on payroll services, we're solidly within the 2% to 4% guideline and don\u2019t appear to be having any problem holding that -- those price increases.","David Togut","Got it. And could you ballpark for us what the bookings growth was in the quarter?","Efrain Rivera","No, we won\u2019t do that. It was strong, we feel pretty good about it. I would just say this David, not to be too coy because I get that question all the time, what really matters is how we did in the selling season and so much -- you're going to have a good quarter and we've had good quarters in the past first and second and not had a good selling season in third quarter.","So we feel pretty encouraged about where we started the year. We think it bodes well for selling season, but we're not in selling season yet and we'll update when we get there.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think that's very -- very consistently we feel very good about it as we did at the end of the year and didn\u2019t have any bumps getting off to a good start, but as Efrain said, the selling season makes the difference for us.","David Togut","Understood. Thank you very much.","Efrain Rivera","Okay. Thanks David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Smitti Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley. Sir your line is open.","Smitti Srethapramote","Great, thank you. First question is on the PEO space, one of your competitors has recently seen higher medical claim cost and even though you guys haven\u2019t experienced those given you're exposed to different states, can you talk about whether or not that's impacted your view on taking insurance risk?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, good question. So we saw the same, excuse me, saw the same things that have been seen in the market. We saw the results I should say.","Our experience is very different. We employ teams of actuaries and set our -- set our premium expense very, very conservatively. So there is no guarantee you can have a hiccup, but we do a lot to minimize it. We also have pretty low -- we have pretty conservative ceilings for reinsurance and I think all of that is great.","But I think the most critical part of the entire equation is what you do from an underwriting standpoint when a client is presented to you? One of the things that we did, this was before I got here and one of the things that Marty instituted was a very clear line between the authority that underwriters have and sales have.","While they operate cooperatively, we task our underwriters with protecting the quality of the pool and that has served us very well. So there is inherent risk in that area, but I think we manage it very well. When we looked at what others were doing and how they had structured their approach to risk, it was a bit different from what we do.","Smitti Srethapramote","Okay. Thanks. And maybe continuing on the PEO side, can you provide more details on the growth rate of your worksite employee count and whether that's still in the 20s?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. We won\u2019t update the worksite employee count to give you specific numbers. We'll eventually release all of that information, but I would say it is fair to say that part of the reason why Q1 results were strong was that PEO was an element of strength in the quarter. So we continue to do very well in that area.","Smitti Srethapramote","Okay. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi Jason.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey there. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to just pick on the PEO topic as well here to start, the momentum that you're seeing there to what extent do you think it\u2019s coming from share gains versus the general rising tide lifting a lot of boats just given the catalyst of the Affordable Care Act?","Martin Mucci","I think obviously a lot of it is coming from the Affordable Care Act. I think there is just a lot of interest in the market, but I think at the same time, because we're kind of a proven leader in the space and I've a very good sales team on this, I think we're picking up more share of what\u2019s now becoming a PEO sale.","So I\u2019d say, Jason, it\u2019s a bit of both because there is such an interest now particularly as it's getting closer and closer to respond to the Affordable Care Act from a PEO standpoint frankly and an insurance standpoint and because of our positioning of our product and our success, we're picking up more share.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And then just switching gears over to Flex hiring, if we try and just get a bead on magnitude of contribution, obviously it's an important offering, is there material revenue baked into this year's guidance for it or should we think of it as more of a potentially material contributor in fiscal '17?","Martin Mucci","I\u2019d say probably more of a contributor in '17 because it's going to take a while to build up, but it's adding a lot of strength to the packages that we\u2019re providing.","Not only is it giving them full recruiting and hiring, but we\u2019re selling -- you can -- we sell onboarding as even a separate offering, which is a paperless onboarding that doesn\u2019t have to be a mid-market sale. It can be a 20 person that hires a lot and it\u2019s all paperless from an onboarding perspective.","So I\u2019d say this year it\u2019s kind of getting started and you\u2019ll see a start to it, but the bigger magnitude of it will come in future years and starting in '17.","Jason Kupferberg","And just last one for me. I wanted to catch-up on the M&A pipeline, because it felt -- appeared at a time like you guys had sort of opened the aperture a little bit in terms of opportunities you were willing to consider.","Obviously you're staying disciplined in evaluating those opportunities, but would you say there\u2019s been any directional move in the pipeline in terms of it being closer to bearing fruit versus not in recent months?","Martin Mucci ","Yeah, I\u2019d say so, although you never know till you get to the finish line, but we certainly have been very active in a number of fronts on it and -- but as you said, we're still being very disciplined. So we've a pretty wide funnel at the beginning.","We bring it down pretty tightly to where we think it\u2019s a reasonable valuation that's going to add a lot of value to us, but we\u2019ve got -- there\u2019s a few things in a hopper now that we\u2019re evaluating. Did they get over the finish line, you never know till we\u2019re ready to announce, but we\u2019re very active in it, that's for sure.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. We\u2019ll stay tuned. Thank you.","Martin Mucci ","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Sir, your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Hey good morning Marty and Efrain. Marty, I wanted to ask you about the Paychex's Flex and the percentage of customers that have converted to that particular version of Payroll processing?","Martin Mucci","It\u2019s hard -- the basic product that we have what was Paychex's Next Generation, all clients are on Paychex's Next Gen, then Flex adds kind of a another full product suite to that. So we\u2019re in the process of moving some of the clients over.","But there is a number of clients that are already on what I would say is the foundation of it. So a lot of clients are not going to see -- the majority of our clients are not going to see any movement. They\u2019re not being moved to anything unless they drive -- this is more of a mid-market product suite that they are going to see more and they\u2019re being offered that.","We\u2019re still offering the old product suite. What we\u2019re saying is, hey, if you want to come over to a fully -- a full suite for human capital management that is fully integrated within a single employee record, we will move you over.","So we\u2019re kind of in the early stages of that, but it\u2019s not a big push to force everybody over. It\u2019s more -- hey if you want these additional enhancements come over and it\u2019s really targeted more in that mid-market space. The majority of our clients won\u2019t see a move. So there\u2019s not going to be any disruption that we expect there at all.","Kartik Mehta","I guess, I was getting to Marty -- is there -- have you see a -- are we experiencing greater sales of products as people have moved over to Flex especially in the mid market, concerning there will probably be more demand for some of your products?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it\u2019s early, but I think yes. That\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re excited with the Gartner change to put us as a leader because that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for is that full suite of products, fully integrated single employee record and data base and we\u2019re seeing an increased demand there.","And I think if you were to talk to the sales team, particularly in the mid market, we just left the sales conference of our top performers a few weeks ago and extreme excitement about selling the product and being very competitive in the marketplace. So, I think, it\u2019s early, but you\u2019ll start to see that really pick up at it will add as we talked about a little bit earlier, much more product per client.","Kartik Mehta","And then Efrain, just any change in philosophy in how you manage a flow portfolio considering there might be interest rate increases going forward here?","Efrain Rivera","Not yet, but it\u2019s on my list of objectives. So, Kartik, what we need to know is when they\u2019re going to raise and then what the increase in the -- the rate of increase will be. And I think that that\u2019s been signaling as directly is I\u2019ve ever heard it, signal when it\u2019s going to happen?","And I expect that when they signal or when they implement their first increase, they\u2019ll give some direction as to what we can expect then in subsequent increases. That will permit you to decide how to position duration of the portfolio.","So I\u2019m waiting for all of that information to get a better sense of how we sit down and strategize around the best way to position the portfolio. So that\u2019s coming in the -- probably in the second half of the year.","Kartik Mehta","Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Martin Mucci","Thanks Kartik.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open.","Rick Eskelsen","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The first question is just, you said you just came from a sales conference. I was curious, what feedback you heard from your sales people on any potential changes to client behavior, given the financial market weakness and also some of the concerns about the global economy?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think generally, when we release for monthly small business index and in fact I was just in New York City yesterday because we\u2019ve expanded it now for different industries, we're seeing continued -- particularly in the small business under 50, we\u2019re seeing continued better employment growth than prerecession levels of 2004 and so -- and it\u2019s down a little bit from last year, but it\u2019s consistently above that level.","So we\u2019re feeling like a steady improvement in small business formation and employment hiring and I would say the sales folks certainly felt that way.","I think the bigger excitement at the Sales Conference was just about the products that we're rolling out in the full feature in the strength of the competitive offering along with the service options, now 7\/24 service and a lot of different options that more self-service that clients can provide.","So they were pretty excited first to be there. Obviously their top performers and second, that they got a good year in front of them they feel.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you. And then on the ESR offering, do you have -- just wondering if you could give an update on how that's progressing, what percentage of the clients that you think might take it have taken it so far? And does it feel like it\u2019s going to be down to the wire type of offering where people take it at the very end? Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, sure. I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t really release I don't think how many are taking it from yet at this point. I would say it\u2019s very active and I think it will be active down to end. We continue to provide it to our clients. I know some competitors have stopped providing it.","If there is a lot of work involved then we're making sure that the clients upfront understand that there is a lot of information needed from the client for us to do this successfully for them, but I think we\u2019re handling it very well.","We\u2019ve increased the resources who are selling it. We've increased the resources who are supporting it because we're continuing to offer it and I think this will be -- yeah I think this will be pretty active right through the end of the year and I think then there will be another surge probably after people who realize -- clients who realize, hey I should have had this when it comes time to file and now I need it.","So I think we'll have kind of another resurgence of sales probably in the end of the first or second calendar quarter of next year, but it\u2019s going very well, it\u2019s going very well.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, good morning.","Martin Mucci","Hi Gary.","Gary Bisbee","First question, you talked a lot about the success in selling bundled offerings in recent years, but one thing I don\u2019t think we've heard as much commentary on is just how you approach up-selling additional components of products into the basin and what the success has been in doing so and any commentary you can provide on that?","Martin Mucci","Yes, sure. Gary one of the points I've tried to make is one of the things we shifted, typically our model was sell payroll and then the other sales forces with the other products come in kind of after that pretty much on a timetable basis.","You get someone comfortable with payroll then you come in and talk to them about the value of 401-K record keeping about the value of HR outsourcing, insurances etcetera.","Now what we found is certain client sizes and complexity of the client, we come into that client with an integrated team selling approach over the last, I would say year, year and half now, and it's been very successful.","So what we found was we were not selling the full value of what the client was looking for many times in our old approach and so if we see a client that's a certain number of employees, has a certain hiring pattern, has a certain complexity to their business, we'll go in with multiple sales forces or multiple sales of products and sell them all at the same time and that's been going very well.","I think once we got the sales teams comfortable with it, they've been more successful and we're getting a nice track record as we get this -- as we get some real momentum going.","Efrain Rivera","Let me build on that, what Marty said so that's the team selling approach. On the other side of it, we've done a lot of data analysis, a lot of modeling based on predictive behavior modeling and we have models that basically predict what your -- the next best offering will be when you don\u2019t take a bundle.","So that science keeps getting better and better. So we know at certain stages of your lifecycle and based on what products you\u2019re doing and the characteristics -- your client characteristics, your customer characteristics, what offering is likely to be the most successful.","So we deploy those models out to the sales force too. So both of those have -- approaches have helped us become more efficient.","Gary Bisbee","Is that a telesales -- the selling of more stuff to existing customers or is it your feet on the street?","Martin Mucci","No, it\u2019s -- actually it\u2019s more of the feet on the street. It\u2019s -- I think we\u2019re much more effective on the telesales side as well, but that\u2019s been really more for the single product sale or a follow-up sale.","But the feet on the street have been much more on the integrated team selling approach, because we have many offices, but obviously have multiple sales teams, but they're just kind of approach the client at different stages and now if the client is the right -- looks like the right fit for multiple products they\u2019ll go out and sell as a team and we\u2019re finding some good success in that.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. And then just the 15% HRS growth obviously continue to be really good but is that a clean like-for-like number or was there a little bit of benefit still from the mix with the minimum premium health plan or is that really\u2026","Efrain Rivera","No, there is always going to be a little bit of benefit from MPP, but that wasn\u2019t a significant part of what happened actually because you were -- we have the same product mix in the quarter, but MPP really did not dramatically impact that number.","It really was strength of PEO, strength of VSR and frankly across a lot of other HRS products.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. And then just a last one, I know you talked about M&A, but you\u2019re going to do things only if you can get the right pricing and what not. How should we think about just the cash build from here? Are you likely -- I think you've indicated special dividend, didn't seem of real interest, I know you\u2019ve been doing some buybacks but a lot less than your cash flow.","Should we think that the likely approach is just continuing to build cash until you do find the M&A or are there any other options that you\u2019re\u2026","Martin Mucci","Yeah, Gary I get this question a lot and what\u2019s difficult and my answer always is the same, what\u2019s difficult for the street to evaluate what we\u2019re doing is you don\u2019t have insight into the pipeline and the probability of our pulling the trigger on deals.","I would say that most -- you can assume that most of the deals that occur in the Fin Tech space of any reasonable size we've looked at and that for whatever reason we've decided on evaluation that didn\u2019t permit us to get to the finish line, because we\u2019re pretty disciplined about how we go about it.","Having said all of that, the pipeline as Marty said is pretty robust and so we see a number of opportunities that we\u2019d like and we\u2019d prefer to simply have the cash to move quickly and deploy it in first instance.","To the extent that we got to a point where really the pipeline looked -- didn\u2019t look as robust and I think that we\u2019d start looking at other ways to deploy cash to shareholders. But part of the way we do that and part of our confidence in the future is that, in this summer we boosted dividend pretty significantly and we've been buying back shares.","If you look at our share count vis-\u00e0-vis the last quarter you see the bias is downward, which is something that we started a couple of years. So all three of those are elements to how we\u2019re looking at cash. But in terms of large cash outlay beyond dividends, we think the pipeline, there\u2019s opportunities there in the space.","And we think that valuations have come down to a point where there\u2019s a number of things -- opportunities that seem reasonable now that maybe weren\u2019t reasonable 18 to 24 months ago.","Gary Bisbee","Great. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay. You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ms. Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ma\u2019am your line is open.","Sara Gubins","Hi thanks, good morning. It sounds like your margins outperformed in the first quarter versus your internal plans, is that fair and if we ask you to talk about what drove the upside?","Martin Mucci","Boy Sara, that's a pretty interesting deduction. Yes, they were a little bit stronger than we had anticipated. However, I would say this. So there is two elements that always typically in the first quarter, we're trying to peg how quickly we go out of the gate in spending and so it\u2019s typically the case that we're a little bit slower.","So some of that is timing I would say and then we did well in sales and we feel pretty positive about that.","We still don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough throughout. We're still not confident enough throughout the remainder of the year to call it as an upside to where we are, but we certainly had a strong start to the quarter -- to the year I should say.","Sara Gubins","Okay. Great, and then switching gears back to healthcare reform and the ACA product, it sounds like it continues to grow strong and you think that that could continue for a couple of more quarters. How much of a lift is it to the average revenue per client?","Efrain Rivera","I don\u2019t think we've really from a competitive standpoint we haven\u2019t given out all the pricing and so forth. So to be careful and I don\u2019t want to say too much, but I would say it\u2019s a significant increase, it\u2019s a pretty significant it's I don't know for a\u2026","Martin Mucci","Good uplift and you see it in HRS. So\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yes, yes.","Martin Mucci","And we're seeing a lot of success for that. I am not trying to be clear about it, but I just want to be careful how I am talking about the pricing of it because there is just a lot of discussion about pricing of Affordable Care Act and there is a lot of different plans out there right now that people are saying they're doing certain things and I think clients got to look very carefully at pricing and what they're getting for the product that they're buying.","Because some are giving them a lot, I think we're giving them a very full valued service and others are kind of giving them a form to fill in and I think that\u2019s what may shake out here towards the end as clients are going to be little surprised may be at what they bought and what they didn\u2019t buy.","But it continues to have really nice momentum for us. Sales are doing well with it. A number of sales teams are selling it and as Efrain said, you're really seeing it in the HRS revenue uplift.","Efrain Rivera","But one thing I would add to that Sara is that PEO was strong, ASO was strong, HR outsourcing in general was strong.","So what ESR has done is it\u2019s had a bit of a Halo effect on a number of other products. Even when you don\u2019t sell the product it permits you to get in the door to have a conversation.","I think there are very few clients that won\u2019t entertain a call about what they're doing with respect to ACA compliance because there is so much confusion in the market about it.","Sara Gubins","Okay. Great and then last quarter you had said that you're about a quarter to a third and have penetrated for a potential client that might take it. Is that as high now as half? Is it going that rapidly?","Efrain Rivera","I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable range in terms of where we are at here. Where we end up is something that we're just monitoring to see.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think that's fair.","Sara Gubins","Thanks a lot.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Sir, your line is open.","Jim MacDonald","Yes, good morning guys.","Martin Mucci","Good morning.","Jim MacDonald","Just a couple more on the ACA, so I think you mentioned is sorry, that's an HRS revenue, HR revenue, not payroll.","Efrain Rivera","Correct, yes that\u2019s reported in HRS.","Jim MacDonald","And have you recognized much revenue from that or does it get recognized as you kind of bring the clients on Board or how about like ramp up how to be show we think about that?","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, so what\u2019s you're seeing now is we really started building in the back half of last year. So you start to see the benefit of that in this quarter.","So you're starting to see the pickup from the number of clients that we signed on in that. We'll watch through as we go through the year and by the time we're at the end of the year pretty close to having recognized most of it, most of the increase I should say.","Jim MacDonald","By yearend and just on a different part of ACA with a number of the public exchange you're seeing pretty high price increases for their health products and they're eliminating products.","Any impact -- can you talk about the impact of that on you guys in this fall enrollment type season?","Efrain Rivera","I think it\u2019s kind of couple of different impacts. One, we're not seeing it impact this much on the pure insurance sales basis too much yet because they haven\u2019t seen all of those increases aren\u2019t all out yet there.","You'll see it probably all of it into this next couple of weeks actually as they roll up.","The only thing I would say is that because of the work in the PEO and the MPP plan, we've seen a very competitive low increases there for our products and I think that\u2019s helped us a lot.","That\u2019s part of the reason when you took on a little bit more risk in that because we felt we could manage that very well and it's been very good for us on much I would say much lower increases to our clients under those plans than the national averages certainly that we're seeing the regional averages.","So I think it\u2019s going to -- it's benefitting and we'll continue to be a benefit for us particularly in the PEO side where we have an MPP and on the health insurance side, I haven\u2019t quite seen it yet, but Jim our clients aren\u2019t going to have a lot of choice there if they don\u2019t have in more cities they're going to have carriers that are all going double-digit increases unfortunately -- but we haven\u2019t seen a big impact to slow anything down from an insurance standpoint.","Jim MacDonald","Great, thanks a lot.","Martin Mucci","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Sir your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much, kind of an obscure question here about a month or so ago, the National Labor Relations Board had a ruling that people believe could in fact affect the franchise business where unions are going to be able to negotiate with the franchise ors.","If I remember correctly, you do a lot of work in the franchise area, please correct me if I am wrong, but if you do, have you heard or seen any impact -- potential impact on your business accordingly thanks?","Martin Mucci","Yes sure. We've not seen it yet. I do think that it\u2019s one of those things that's just another negative that's out there that it makes people little bit slower on maybe hiring or starting up an additional franchise let's say. If I own a couple of franchises, I might be just a little more cautious on whether I start another one or not based on the ruling.","I think a lot of that still got to shake out, but it certainly adds more confusion and concern to those. We don\u2019t have a ton of franchise sales. When you look at in the scheme of our sales and our client base, but it's certainly increasing because we've done a lot of work in selling the franchise side, but that's been picking up.","So I would say we don\u2019t have an impact yet, but I do think it may generally put a little bit of damp around whether I open up a second franchise or not.","Jeff Silber","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Is your franchise exposure on the payroll side, the HRS side, or mix?","Martin Mucci","Mix, mix. We sell all products to the franchises.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Great. Appreciate the color, thanks.","Martin Mucci","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Tim McHugh from William Blair. Sir, your line is open.","Stephen Sheldon","Hi, it\u2019s Stephen Sheldon in for Tim. Most of my questions have been answered, but just want to ask as we get a little closer to the key selling season, can you may be talk generally about the where the sales works currently stand and have you been doing hiring? How are recent hires been ramping in terms of productivity just any color on how you're positioned there would be appreciated.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think we're in good shape going in from first of all from just being very -- we got all the hires in. Training is done, I think Mark Bottini and the leadership team did a great job in getting everyone in kicking of the year really well.","We've sales kicks offs, lot of training during the first quarter and so forth on new products. I think we're at a great positioning of training for example. We do an awful lot now of web training and so forth and from a client -- from a growth of sales I would say we are up about normal like we normally add to the sales force.","We had our ads and we were pretty much right on track. The good news is everybody is in the seats, well trained and particularly with all the product changes they're well versed in the product and we could feel that in the momentum of it at the Sales Award Conference.","Stephen Sheldon","Okay. Great thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Sir, your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning, Marty and Efrain.","Martin Mucci","Good morning.","Mark Marcon","You got a really nice start to the year.","Martin Mucci","Yes, thank you.","Mark Marcon","Could we drill down just a little bit with regards to just the core payroll, the acceleration we saw this quarter? Did you say there was like one extra processing period in this\u2026","Martin Mucci","Yes. One extra processing day.","Mark Marcon","And how much of an impact did that have?","Martin Mucci","Yes. Good question, Mark. I won\u2019t say specifically for the quarter, but we're going to have two of them this year and we think that the impact will be half a percent. So if you use arithmetic averages you can figure out what the impact was.","Mark Marcon","Just to be specific the 0.5% is for the total year.","Martin Mucci","Correct.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And the other quarter that it will -- we\u2019ll see this impact will be.","Martin Mucci","Is it the fourth quarter?","Efrain Rivera","The fourth.","Martin Mucci","Fourth sorry","Mark Marcon","The fourth quarter.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I am sorry.","Mark Marcon","Okay. Great. And then you also mentioned that we should be cognizant on the third quarter.","Martin Mucci","Yes.","Mark Marcon","Can you remind this?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, so I quote that out, I would just refer back to my comments in Q4, I quote out, at this point we think that that quarter will be just -- it\u2019s more timing and will go into a long amount of detailed update in Q2, but that will be weakest of the quarters. It\u2019s mostly about timing of different revenue flows within that quarter and I quote that HRS is potentially being below the range of the full year guidance.","I said that in Q4. We\u2019ll update in Q2, but we expect Q3 will be relatively speaking the weaker of the four quarters in the year.","Mark Marcon","And then with regards to this -- for the quarter that we just had on the core side, even when we strip out the impact of the processing there, we\u2019re still doing well. Can you talk about the biggest single driver behind that in terms of -- you certainly saw pricing stick through, you've had good bookings, but what would you say would be the primary driver?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think it\u2019s a combination of holding the price and retention. When you look at that immediate quarter sales were obviously -- we\u2019re very comfortable and positive on sales, but the impact is when you retain the clients and as I mentioned we continue to be at our best client retention levels.","And on top of that, we\u2019re holding the price increase in the range that Efrain gave. So it was a good start to the year, that\u2019s when you see kind of that first quarter you see what happened with the price, indeed we have to take more discounting and so forth and we felt good about holding the price and felt very good about the client retention as well, good job on the service team.","Mark Marcon","And did the retention ramp up at all?","Martin Mucci","Since we don\u2019t give it, I would say it\u2019s very consistent with where we ended the year, which was a record high.","Mark Marcon","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","The other thing Mark that I\u2019d call out is we didn\u2019t say anything about checks per client. Obviously there is a lot of things to talk about that were positives. But checks per client were flat to down in the quarter and so when you compare one quarter over another, we still were seeing positive results in checks per client through much of last year.","We didn\u2019t see that benefit, that\u2019s a mix issue that I had called out in the past. So we feel pretty good about where we were from a field service revenue standpoint.","Mark Marcon","Absolutely and then with regards to just the client segments that you\u2019re seeing the strongest growth from, is it -- would it typically be in that six employee to a 11 or maybe a little bit slightly higher?","Martin Mucci","I would say it\u2019s across the Board. It\u2019s not like the quarter that we\u2019re seeing any one segment pick up better. The good news to us is we\u2019re doing well in the let\u2019s say our typical under 20 segment and we\u2019re also doing well and better I think even because of the product and the service options in the mid market. So I would say it\u2019s across the Board.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And exclusive of that kind of the really small one the former or share payroll plays?","Efrain Rivera","No, that's included, so it\u2019s both.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And then congrats on the upper quadrant that\u2019s relatively early, any sense for the ability of the sales force to leverage the improved recognition?","Martin Mucci","I think we\u2019re just \u2013 it\u2019s pretty recent, but we\u2019ll certainly find any way we can. They\u2019re certainly very excited about it because it\u2019s always exciting to see third party particularly like Gartner puts you into that leadership position and that it\u2019s based on our clients being surveyed.","And our client saying hey this is a great product and a great service and then Gartner coming out of it saying, hey not only is it good now, but you\u2019re leader because you're positioned well for the future. So we\u2019ll definitely be looking to capitalize on it.","And knowing the sales team they\u2019re well trained and well versed in the things that are happening with Paychex's they will be able to capitalize on it well.","Efrain Rivera","And the other thing Mark I\u2019d add to that is that, Marty's strategy really started seven years ago about investing in IT and I want to reiterate two things. One is that, this is part of the strategy of how we move Paychex from where we were prerecession to where we are right now.","And I think it's been a long time in the making number one and second, I think that external validation is a lot better and more powerful than simply trumpeting what you think, what you believe about yourself.","So I would say there is a lot of smack talk by competition about how good they are? We don\u2019t talk that way, except right now and we prefer to let third parties validate how good we are and let our customers validate how good we are.","We could not have had that honor unless our customers thought very highly about what we do, that\u2019s the second point.","Then the third point is that a lot of our spending now our increases in spending have been around IT and it helped us from the standpoint of being able to go to and might build a credible case that we were entitled to certain treatment of the expenses we were making based on the strategy that we employed. So I think it validates a lot of different things that the Management Team has put in place.","Mark Marcon","Great to hear. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay Mark, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Ms. Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Ma\u2019am your line is open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning guys. A good question on the team selling approaches you\u2019ve implemented that over the last year, year and half, can you dimensionalize the range, the upside you\u2019re seeing in revenue per client, when you\u2019re able to sell in the fuller suite of services?","Martin Mucci","I think, it's pretty significant when you sell it upfront. It's also a timing thing remember because I would assume that we're -- normally we\u2019re selling those other products but a little bit farther down the road, but we\u2019re finding one, we\u2019re selling more of it upfront. Two, I think by offering the total package, we're selling more of it because we're hitting the client at a time that they see the full value more than just selling them payroll and coming back later.","I don\u2019t know if we give the exact percentage or anything, but it\u2019s certainly double digit increase in over the kind of the revenue per client that we would normally see upfront.","We just want to get more of that over time, but then I do think we\u2019re having more success, we may have -- we thought we may have been missing some opportunities actually by selling kind of a payroll-only and then coming back later when the client upfront may have felt better particularly today in saying I really wanted HR outsourcing altogether.","I wanted a PEO or an ASO offering and that\u2019s what I really needed. I needed and that\u2019s what we\u2019re finding because that's come down a lot in employee size and so it fit the team selling very, very well.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Good, and then just one quick follow-up on retention, I think you said, I just wanted to confirm you said retention is kind of holding at -- holding relatively stable?","Martin Mucci","Yes, that's right.","Lisa Ellis","Perfect. Thanks guys.","Martin Mucci","All right.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Tian Jing Wang from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","Tian Jing Wang","Great, thanks. Good morning, good quarter here. Just on the HRS side, I heard that it was little bit better the PEO, the moderation comment for the rest of the year, is there anything specific there that we should be aware or it was just the previous comments on conservatism?","Martin Mucci","Well first of all, there is some conservatism, so we'll come back in Q2 and update, but the other thing Tian Jing is we had really strong -- we had really strong HRS growth in the back half of the year led by PEO.","And when you start anniversarying some tougher compares and there is some revenue shifts going on within quarters particularly in Q3. So we want to get a little bit more of a sense how the year is building before we do anything to guidance.","Tian Jing Wang","Okay. Just wanted to make sure and then just on the -- just one more, just on the back of the minimum premium concept here, I know it's -- on the earlier side for you, but have you given any sense of what the mix now is of minimum premium versus the fully insured plans in terms of what you\u2019re selling, what's taking and what's not?","Martin Mucci","It\u2019s still less than 50% of what we sell in the PEO and remember the reason why I say that is that it's only in the State of Florida. So we have our PEO business in Texas and California and a number of other important states.","And for the -- at least for the near future, that\u2019s where it will remain, but Marty mentioned earlier and I think it was in response to a question about what's happening with healthcare premium increases, we're very, very competitively positioned.","So we\u2019ll see and monitor how we do throughout the remainder of the year. We feel really good about both our underwriting standards and also what we've been able to do with that plan. So that could change as time goes on.","Tian Jing Wang","Okay, good to know. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Sir, your line is open.","David Grossman","Thank you. Good morning.","Efrain Rivera","Hey David.","David Grossman","I was just hoping to follow-up on a portion I think that's been asked in several different ways over the course of the call and that\u2019s really getting into this whole concept of unit versus revenue per client growth and how we should think about how that's evolving.","And I think you've given us several data points on what\u2019s driving revenue per client, but show your details on exactly how to think about that specifically in terms of percentages and how to think about your model longer term in terms of how that could impact the growth rate?","So perhaps, I know that\u2019s a long winded question, but perhaps you could give us some more information or insight into how that should evolve and the impact to growth rate?","Martin Mucci","I think, first of all, it\u2019s still very balanced. We're going after both and I think we've been -- obviously I think we probably went on the side of much more revenue per client growth the last few years as we added additional product.","And so that makes the sales team very successful and we did well on raising the revenue per client, excuse me, but that\u2019s because we had so much more product and product bundles and we were very successful with that.","That kind of shifted us back to hey how do you balance that and so I think what you're finding is the sales team much more focused and compensation plans etcetera in training on both.","Hey we want to increase the units and we've talked about where we wanted to be in unit growth in the past in that client growth and we're continuing to push to get there and we've seen very consistency through the first quarter. We're trying to continue to balance both of those.","We're feeling really good about the revenue per unit continuing to increase because of the fuller product set and the offerings that we have and the success in selling it and then -- and retaining it by the way.","And then the unit peace is we're finding other ways to do that not only with the sales on the street, but from a more of a digital marketing and web based product or web based service or more, people coming in that way buying more payroll-only kind of thing and doing that with telesales. So I just want to make sure it's clear.","Hey we're looking to balance both. I think we're going to have success in both, but I would say that revenue per unit is what's been stronger the last couple of years and that seems to continue. Efrain, anything you want to add to it.","Efrain Rivera","That's right.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","David Grossman","And so should we think of the unit growth being driven more if you will on the smaller client size who are perhaps using one product like payroll or is that over simplification?","Martin Mucci","I think that\u2019s over simplification. I think we're pushing -- like I would just -- well I would that's typically obviously where we see most of the growth because 80% of the clients are still under 20, and half of our sales come from brand new businesses, so that certainly is fair to say.","But I would say we're feeling much better about the mid market strength given the product suite that human capital management full suite of products. So I think units are going to come from there as well.","It\u2019s a little bit -- it's obviously a little bit longer sales cycle and so forth. So I would -- I think it's fair to say that since half of the sales still come pretty much from brand new businesses that the units are going to come from at least half of them are coming from smaller payroll-only generally, but I think you're going to continue to see the growth in the mid market better than it has in the last few years because of the product suite.","David Grossman","Right. And then just one other follow-up question is again related to a question that's been asked several times, just about the Affordable Care Act and how it's impacting the overall business.","Could you just give us a sense, I think you said Marty, that you saw surge and then you're seeing -- you're expecting and want to get into calendar '16, people may recognize they didn\u2019t do enough, if I understood your comments correctly, is that the way to think about it in terms of just very simple out about in terms of the timing of when it could affect your business differently than it has in the last several quarters?","Martin Mucci","I think so. I think it\u2019s referenced and I think as the sales come in now and they're I think for this stage, they\u2019ll peak probably in the October, November, the sales will, then you\u2019ll start to get the full revenue of that on a monthly basis right after that.","And the clients, I think clients will see because we talked about kind of the percentage that are taking it of the ones we think it applies to, I think clients will see in the March, April, probably even May timeframe because the filings are in March, they\u2019ll start to see gee, I should have done more or it did apply to me and I didn\u2019t think so or I just didn\u2019t take the time to address it. I think sales will pick back up then.","I\u2019m not sure that will have a big impact in Q4 for us because it will be a little bit late in that process, but I do think sales will pick back up in April and May for those who didn\u2019t take it, that\u2019s my guess at this point based on what we\u2019re seeing.","Because some clients are just -- some are great, they\u2019re all over it. They\u2019re taken it. Others are waiting kind of late in the game, but I think we\u2019ll see that and then I think you\u2019re going to see a number of them that say I still don't get it. I\u2019m not going to do anything until I have to and then they\u2019re going to have to react in April.","David Grossman","Okay. And then just one last question just on the impact of potentially of higher rates Efrain, so it would appear at least in this fiscal year given higher position it would have a nominal impact and then we would just factor in that you\u2019re going to stay short on the curve at least for the time being or perhaps should we think about this a little bit differently if we do get an increase in rate over the next six months.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, David I think you\u2019re right until I get a better sense of how that develops it's really tough to figure out what the duration is, whether we should barbell the duration whether -- what the best value on the curve is.","You could do a lot of modeling. We\u2019ve looked at it looking at forward rates, so it doesn\u2019t really give you a sense of what\u2019s the best strategy to employ. So since we get a sense of when they\u2019re going to raise and get better insight because I think the fed should tell us and what the pace of change is going to be then I think we can figure out what makes more sense in terms of configuring the portfolio.","David Grossman","Okay. Very good and congratulations on a great quarter.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks David.","Operator","Our last question comes from Mr. Phil Stiller of Citigroup. Sir your line is open.","Efrain Rivera","Hi Phil.","Phil Stiller","Hi guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to ask about M&A further on that topic. So maybe you guys talked about the pipeline being busy. Perhaps maybe give us a little more color in terms of what types of opportunities you\u2019re considering whether it\u2019s market expansionary, new products and then also perhaps some commentary on the size might be helpful in terms of how big the targets are considered?","Martin Mucci","I think -- I'll start with a size standpoint; it's been anything from small to pretty large that hasn\u2019t concerned us too much at all. The second thing is not as much about product now adding product because I think we\u2019ve really done that well over the acquisitions we've done over the last few years and frankly that's what's exciting now as when you see recruiting.","We don\u2019t even mention this, but when you see recruiting and onboarding roll into the Flex products suite, that's myStaffingPro, one of the best recruiting packages in the industry that we acquired few years ago and now have built into our package in integrated single database kind of thing.","So I think we\u2019re pretty solid on product, might be something there, but we\u2019re very solid on the full suite of products and now it\u2019s expanding into other things that I guess either adding more client base. So that's payroll companies, PEOs, etcetera, it\u2019s adding more and maybe a little bit of an off-suite of that, but not too far.","So it goes small to large, it\u2019s not as much product as it is, I think expanding our market share and maybe going off a little bit different than what we are, but not too much.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. And just to build on what Marty said, so we typically have done smaller tuck-ins. Our largest acquisition certainly in past five years was Sure and that was a little bit over $100 million.","So when we say large, we\u2019re not talking about transformational opportunities. We\u2019re certainly looking at opportunities that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but not transformational and there is a wide range of assets on the market that are of interest to us that are forward in that range.","Phil Stiller","Would you guys consider taking on debt to fund an acquisition or is that off the table?","Efrain Rivera","We\u2019ve addressed that. The answer is that if it was the right opportunity, we would consider it. So that's not off the table. We haven't seen too many of those. There have been some that were of interest to us.","But again one of the things that investors should expect when they invest in Paychex is we're not going to grow -- buy things to grow the company in that way, we think we have a pretty solid business model with good organic growth characteristics.","And we think there are some assets out there that are of value they can help, but our strategy isn\u2019t to grow by acquisition. Our strategy is to buy things and grow then.","Phil Stiller","Great. Makes sense Thanks guys.","Efrain Rivera","Okay. Any more questions","Operator","There are no more questions sir","Martin Mucci","All right. Thank you, At this point, we'll close the call.

And thank you for joining us for a discussion of the Paychex's fiscal 2013 year-end earnings. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday afternoon, after the market closed, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. We also filed an 8-K filing, which includes preliminary discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial position. This preliminary discussion and analysis is not a complete management's discussion and analysis. Our complete MD&A will be included in our Form 10-K, which we expect to file by the end of July. These documents are available by accessing our Investor Relations page at www.paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet as well and will be archived and available on the website for about 1 month.","On today's call, I will review the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 highlights in our operations, sales and product development. And Efrain will review our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 financial results in more detail and discuss our fiscal 2014 guidance. Then we'll open it up for your questions.","Let me start by saying I feel we had a strong fourth quarter and a solid financial performance for fiscal 2013 as a whole. Efrain will go into, again, more detail. However, I'd like to provide you with some of the highlights. Our checks per payroll have improved for 13 consecutive quarters. Growth in checks per payroll have been consistently positive this year. We did see some moderation in the rate of growth in the fourth quarter. Our execution in operations has been excellent, demonstrated by achievement of the highest client satisfaction scores in our history. It is our exceptional client service, along with our leading-edge technology, that really sets us apart at Paychex. The dedication of our employees has also resulted in our best year ever in client retention, exceeding 81% of our beginning payroll client base.","Over the past few years, we have increased our focus on sales execution and expansion opportunities, and we are pleased with the results for fiscal 2013. We opened new territories, focused on market segmentation in payroll as well as 401(k). We also increased our involvement in franchise and banking referral opportunities, creating new expanded relationships with Subway and Tim Hortons on the franchise side, as well as Citizens and Union Bank, to name a few on the banking side.","From a sales perspective, we had a strong fourth quarter. And we are particularly pleased with the new sales revenue generated from our core payroll sales, retirement services, HR outsourcing and SurePayroll teams.","Our client base in payroll finished the year at 570,000 payroll clients, an increase of approximately 1%. This growth is consistent with the prior year. Revenue per client was another positive factor in our payroll revenue growth.","From a technology perspective, we are integrating our leading technology and mobility platform with our world-class customer service through the Paychex Next Generation suite. This technology creates an integrated workforce management tool for our mid-market clients by bringing together the services those clients need, including our small and mid-market payroll products and various human resource and employee benefit management services. We have been positioning Paychex to capture the opportunity arising from an increase in shift to the online SaaS solutions. We have market-leading SaaS solutions leveraging the latest technologies and continue to invest heavily in product development relating to our SaaS and online capabilities in mobile applications.","Our recent acquisitions of ExpenseWire and mystaffingpro.com have SaaS-oriented business models. And in addition, our SurePayroll product continues to do well, with strong sales and revenue growth.","We enhanced our online and mobile offerings during the fiscal year by adding greater value and convenience for our clients. We introduced a best-in-class online report center and builder in the fall and most recently added flexible spending account in health and benefit employee and employer information to our mobility apps. And we will continue to add more capabilities in the future.","In retirement services, we have also experienced success in driving more sales to our approach to enhance our relationship with financial advisors.","As we move into fiscal 2014, health care reform is one of our most important initiatives. This legislation has far-reaching impacts to businesses across the country. And we will see changes in the way businesses handle not only insurance, but also payroll reporting, administration, monitoring and employee benefit offerings.","We are excited about the opportunity to assist our clients as they navigate the complexity of health care reform by providing them with information and support, as well as new, comprehensive solutions for their businesses and their employees.","Our new Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility Service makes it easier for business owners to determine if the employer shared responsibility provision applies to them and what actions they may need to take. We also offer our new Employer Shared Responsibility Complete Analysis and Monitoring Services for those clients who want a more robust solution as well.","The Paychex Benefit Account products will allow employers to offer flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements on a single platform, with 1 debit card for their flexibility. And we will give employers access to a Paychex Private Exchange in conjunction with this product. We have launched the new health care reform section on our website designated to provide answers, information and solutions that will help our clients and employers who need to prepare and take action on health care reform.","In summary, I am very proud of the efforts of all of our employees at Paychex on behalf of our clients and our shareholders. We have a solid leadership team that is clearly focused on sales and service execution, technology innovation and product expansion to drive our plans in fiscal 2014.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty. Let me start with the customary legal disclosures. You should be aware that certain written and oral statements made by us constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","As Marty indicated, Paychex delivered solid results in fiscal 2013 with improving metrics. Here's some of the key highlights for the quarter and fiscal 2013. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2014 outlook.","Total service revenue grew 6% for the fourth quarter and 5% for the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 7% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the fiscal year to $10 million and $41 million, respectively. This result was a byproduct of the low interest rate environment that prevailed during the year and was partially offset by increase in average investment balances.","Expenses increased by 5% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the fiscal year. We continue to invest at a higher rate in leading-edge technology. For the full year period, this was partially offset by increased productivity within operations. Operating margin was 35.1% for the fourth quarter and 37.8% for fiscal 2013. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 9% to $202 million for the fourth quarter and 7% to $864 million for fiscal 2013.","In the fourth quarter, we increased our tax provision for the settlement of a state income tax matter for the fiscal years 2004 to 2011. This additional provision reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per share for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. We do not expect this to have an impact on our effective tax rate going forward.","Net income growth, due to factors just discussed, was flat at $124 million for the fourth quarter and grew 4% to $569 million for the fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share were again flat at $0.34 per share for the fourth quarter, including the tax matter we just discussed, and increased 3% to $1.56 per share for fiscal 2013, including the effect of the increased tax provision.","Payroll revenue. Payroll service revenue increased 4% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check. Checks per payroll increased about 1% for the fourth quarter and 1.6% for the fiscal year, moderating from their respective prior year periods. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounting. We have been experiencing positive growth in revenue per check through the pricing of our core products and related ancillary.","Fiscal 2013 payroll growth was modestly affected by events from earlier quarters, including the impact of Hurricane Sandy and 1 less payroll processing day overall due to the leap year in the prior year.","HRS. HRS revenue increased 13% to $193 million for the fourth quarter and 10% to $746 million for the fiscal year. HRS revenue growth reflects favorable trends in client growth and price increases. Some highlights of the contributions to HRS revenue growth include: Retirement services revenue, which benefited from growth in clients, price increases and an increase in the average asset value of retirement services client employees' funds.","Paychex's HR Solutions revenue was positively impacted by growth in client and client employees and price increases. The rate of growth was tempered by lower average client employees within our PEO. During the second half of fiscal 2013, our PEO business stabilized and improved as the year progressed.","Insurance services revenue continues to improve as a result of growth in health and benefit services applicants, though at moderating rates, and higher revenue from other insurance policies. Growth also resulted from increases in premiums in workers' compensation insurance services. We expect that health care reform will impact our insurance service revenue in the form of rate pressure. However, we see a number of opportunities in assisting our clients in navigating the complexities of the Health Care Act.","Our eServices revenues were positively impacted by client growth and price increases, particularly as we continue to focus on adding SaaS-based solutions through product development and acquisition.","Now let's look at investments and income. We maintain a fairly conservative investment policy. As you know, our goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, our primary investment vehicles are high-quality variable rate demand notes, VRDNs, and bank demand deposit accounts. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds.","The interest rate environment remained at historically low levels for much of the year, despite the recent uptick. Our combined portfolios have earned an average return of 0.9% for the fourth quarter compared to 1% for the same period last year and 1% for fiscal 2013 compared to 1.1% for the same period last year.","Our average rate of return was also impacted by our allocation of investments to a greater percentage in tax-exempt securities within the short-term portfolio.","Investment income decreased 20% to $1 million for the fourth quarter and increased 4% to $7 million for the fiscal year. The increase for the quarter was due to lower average interest rates earned. This was due to a change in mix in the corporate portfolio, with more invested in short-term securities compared to the prior year.","I would now walk you through our -- the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. Cash and total corporate investments totaled $875 million as of May 31, 2013, and of course, we had no debt.","Funds held for clients as of May 31 were $4.1 billion compared to $4.5 billion as of the same period last year. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of 4%.","Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $35 million as of May 31, compared to $60 million in the prior period. The decline in net unrealized gain position was driven by the recent uptick in market yields.","Total stockholders' equity was $1.8 billion as of the end of the year, reflecting $477 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Return on equity was 34%.","Cash flows from operations were $675 million for the fiscal year, a modest decrease compared to the prior year. The decrease was driven mainly by fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for noncash items. Fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax and other liabilities. Settlement of the state tax matter had a related effect on our federal tax liability, which had an impact on accrued income taxes at fiscal year end.","Now turning to 2014 guidance. I'd like to remind you that our outlook for fiscal year ending May 31, 2014 is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing without significant changes. Our guidance is as follows: Payroll services revenue projected to increase in the range of 3% to 4% compared to fiscal 2013. This projected growth rate is based on anticipated client base growth and increases in revenue per check. HRS revenue is expected to be in the range of 9% to 10% in line with recent experience. Total service revenue expected to increase in the range of 5% to 6%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to decrease in the range of 7% to 9%. Based on projected rates, we will revisit this assumption during the year.","Operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of service revenue is expected to be approximately 38% for fiscal 2014. Investment income net is projected to increase in the range of 0% to 5%. And net income is expected to increase in the range of 8% to 9%. This growth assumes and incorporates the impact of the settlement of the state income tax matter in fiscal 2013.","The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 is expected to be in the range of 36% to 37%, as we don't expect the state income tax matter to impact our future effective income tax rate.","As you know, we don't provide guidance on a quarterly basis. However, we do anticipate that payroll revenue growth in the first quarter of 2014 will be at the low end of our full year guidance due to timing of payroll processing in that quarter. From an earnings perspective, we anticipate that the first half and the second half earnings in fiscal 2014 will be comparable.","Martin Mucci","Okay. Thank you, Efrain. And we'll now open up the meeting to your questions. Stacy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could first start with the underlying assumptions you had for payroll services growth going into '14, kind of thinking through sort of the net customer growth, revenue per check, maybe some of the ancillary whatnot. Maybe just sort of help us walk through the high level thinking to get to the 3% to 4%.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So as you know, we ended the year at 2%. And so we're expecting that to improve. We see pricing a little bit better than we had this year. We expect net client growth to improve a bit. And we expect checks per payroll to moderate from where we are. So in the quarter, we saw moderation. We think that we're reaching -- we're moving down in terms of what we expect the contribution for checks per payroll to include, and we expect some modest upticks both on client growth and on pricing.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And on the pricing, is it kind of reasonable to think that the net pricing was kind of in the 1%, 2% range, and you're kind of suggesting a little bit of an uptick going into '14? Is that the right way to think about it?","Efrain Rivera","That's probably a little bit low, Glenn. I think we're more towards the 2% range. And we're expecting it to tick up a bit from there.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then just one more, and I'll jump back in the queue. But I'm sort of thinking through the 570,000 customers, which you grew directionally close to 1%. Is there any way to sort of parse how much of that was SurePayroll customer growth versus the core payroll growth?","Efrain Rivera","Well, core payroll growth was modest. We have about 5 different customer bases in there. Some were up. Some were down. Core was modestly up. Sure was up. And then there were some other older platforms that were down.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Was Sure kind of like what it's been doing, mid-teens or so kind of growth?","Efrain Rivera","Double digit, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Of your payroll services clients, I'm wondering if you could parse out the clients that have around 10 employees or fewer. Did that grow slower or faster than your overall business?","Efrain Rivera","I don't think it changed that dramatically. What I will say, Sara, is if you look at sales now in the back half of the year versus the first half, we saw an uptick in the size of core clients. So I don't think it's enough yet to affect the base as a whole. But we did see an increase that was notable in terms of size of clients.","Martin Mucci","Yes. And what we think of as the small market, kind of the under 50, but really under 20, I think you could say.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on the margin front, it looks like next year you're expecting less margin leverage in operating income as a percent of service revenue than you got in fiscal '13. Is that fair? And can you talk a little bit about why?","Efrain Rivera","No, I don't think it's fair. So we always go through this discussion around how precisely we're going to guide. So let me just review what has happened, right? So if you look at what happened over the past 2 years, and actually I would go back 3 years. We were at 36.3%, 37.1% and 37.8%. So when we guided last year, we guided in similar fashion. We expected to be north of 38%, but we don't expect it to reach 39%. So we said approximately 38%. So we do expect some margin. I wouldn't book precisely the amount that we got this year. But we'll -- we're going to continue during the year to produce some leverage. So the approximately 38% just simply is to say, we didn't want to call it closer to 39%.","Martin Mucci","Yes, we're always looking -- as we have said in past calls, we're always looking for additional margin and different additional leverage as we grow so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about HR Services revenue. It increased 13% for the fourth quarter. So it looked like it had pretty good momentum, although the guidance tempers that a little bit back down to 9% to 10%. So I just want to make sure I understand that.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Brian. We had -- if you look at what happened particularly in the back half of the year, and Marty mentioned early, we had really good sales results in the second half of the year. We had a really strong back half in the PEO and really good sales performance and very good retention performance. Part of what our guidance incorporates is, we don't see it being quite that strong in next year. But we are exiting the year with very good momentum on the HRS side.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And that's just -- it's not quite as strong just because of the pipeline you see through the sales channel or I just...","Efrain Rivera","That's it. And we were rebounding off an easy compare, so the combination of both of those.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we -- as Efrain said, we are real pleased with where the sales are. We're just -- one quarter doesn't always make a year. So as we see a strong quarter, we're very pleased. But when we look at the whole year, we'll be very consistent in that range that we gave, I think, for the year. But we are pleased with the second half of the year and particularly the fourth quarter on PEO sales, HR outsourcing in general, ASO, 401(k). All had a really good fourth quarter in the sales front.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I was a little surprised that checks per payroll only increased 0.9% But it sounds like you expect -- do you expect that to be at similar levels and just any high-level thoughts on why that seems to be moderating, even though I guess people are hoping for a stronger economy?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I think we've been expecting moderation. And I think when we look at the data, we're realizing that quarter ends when they end. The day can sometimes influence that number. I'll just say that going into the beginning of the year looks like we're a little bit stronger than that. But the trend is definitely towards moderation, and that's what we're assuming for next year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, last question for me. I know we talked about new client growth being about 1% to 3%. It sounds like you expect that to get a little bit better this year. I'm just curious what gives you that confidence because it's been around that 1%, 0.5% for the last couple of years.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think a couple of things. I think, one, as we stated, the sales in the small market into the second half of the year are stronger. We came out of the fourth quarter strong. So we feel like that's a good signal. I think when you look at some of the economic indicators, housing starts are up, prices are up on housing. I think housing is a really important measure for us because we have a lot of jobs around that. A lot of contracting roofers, et cetera, around that. All of that is positive. And so we're feeling like we're coming off the end of the year with some momentum and that that will certainly help us. We also came out with the best client retention in our history this year on the core -- on the payroll side. And so we feel very good about the retention work that we're doing. And you put that with the sales, we think that the client growth is going to start to pick up.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What did retention actually end up at?","Martin Mucci","I think we said over 81%, which is a historic best.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wonder if I could ask a question just on the interest rate side of things. I know it affects your business. And I'm wondering if you could answer in 2 ways. First of all, what are you thinking, not just 1 year out, but maybe 2 or 3 years out from the actual impact to the numbers? And then the second part, have you seen any changes? You mentioned construction. But if interest rates should slow the -- or a tick up in interest rates should slow the pace of investments, are you seeing any changes on the demand front? So I guess interest rates from a numerical perspective within the model and then on the demand front?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Joe. So 2 things on that. And I saw a couple of notes on this that I wanted to clarify. In a typical year, we're repricing 20% to 25% of the portfolio. And so we will see the benefit of longer -- the higher rates, I should say, in our longer-term portfolio as we go through the year if we stay at current rate level. And I just want to caution, we've seen spikes above 2% before only to have them come down again. But if we continue at these levels, we'll get some benefit, some upticks. Some people were asking why we didn't call out a higher number on our portfolio. We need to see when we invest, whether these interest rates prevail. I believe they will.","With respect to the impact of interest rates on our clients at this point, it's really kind of early to tell. Marty said we've been seeing some uptick on the clients in the construction industry. So that's a positive. It remains to be seen whether a bump of this magnitude, which is still modest by historical standards, will really have a dampening effect on businesses and business formation.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last quick question for me. On the margin side, you've obviously been clear on the earlier questions about what you're expecting for margins. But I think the historical thought process there was that you're gaining efficiencies in the business and then reinvesting that on the technology front. Can you just give us some idea of where you stand with that schedule and what could be the potential delta in the upcoming years as oppose to the past on the margin front?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think -- yes, we've continued to invest -- and as you said, we've taken the efficiencies much from the field operations in the centralized service operations that we've gained and poured them back into the technology. And we really feel good about that. It's really come to fruition the last 2 years, in particular on all of the products that we rolled out, and the success we've had on the technology front. I think that where we used to talk about maybe the 100 to 200 basis point range, we've been much more in the 50 to 100 basis point range is where we've talked about. Always looking for leverage. Always will be part of our DNA to look for it. But we certainly understood that we had to pour more back into technology. And we'll continue to do that, although it is at a decelerating rate now. We're getting to a level of technology spend where I don't think you'll see as big of an increase in that. But I think when you look at our leverage, it will -- we'll continue to look for the 50 to 100 basis points as we grow. As we grow more, now you got to kind of -- I'm sure Efrain would tell you. If you put that into a different perspective, when interest rates go up, that's a very different equation. This is more on the flat interest rate and no movement in the interest rates.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. So 50 to 100 is the new normal, excluding interest rates? Just so we're clear.","Martin Mucci","Right. Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Marty, you highlighted the major new product enhancements that have been made recently, particularly on the mobile front. Of those enhancements, which do you believe most differentiate you from your primary national competitor?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think on the mobility front, the biggest thing is we went after making sure that -- one, that any device you use was optimized. So whether you're on an iPad or whether you're on a tablet or whether you're on a phone, that the screen is optimized. And I think we were ahead of the game on that one. We were a little behind in getting to the mobility. But when we went -- when we got to it 1 year or so ago, 1.5 years ago, we were optimizing, first of all, the device. Second, we focused very much on information to the client. So as opposed to necessarily on the phone, allowing for payroll, you actually -- to do your payroll, which we didn't find much research that said a lot of people were doing that, either from our general research or at looking at SurePayroll's experience. What we found is they want to get to the information and how do they get to it in the easiest possible way with fewest clicks, for example. And that's what we focused on. So if you look at our application on the iPhone, for example, you can get to your employer or employee information very easily. And we're continuing to add to that in a very thorough, but yet easy way to get -- to access the information. It will allow you to do payroll -- to actually do the payroll on the device in the August timeframe this year, but we found it was more important for the simplicity and amount of information. And I think we're the only ones that give the health and benefit information to the detail that we have in the industry, I think. So we really feel it's a leader out there.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And in terms of product enhancements, what's next from Paychex?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think the most exciting thing for us is the health care reform. We're very excited about the opportunity to help our clients navigate through one of the biggest changes in their business in years, whether they're small or large, because they're going to have to react somehow in most cases to help their employees or comply with the law, if they're over the 50. And we're really excited about the products that we'll be rolling out in the fall that not only help them take the information and use it to determine whether they have to comply and how they comply and help them comply. But also then to help them even get to an exchange, if they want to go that way, to combine a lot of complicated health spending, health reimbursement and accounts -- and health spending accounts that can kind of come all, combine to 1 debit card. So that's probably the -- I mean, we're excited about all our products. But I think the response to health care reform that the team has done here is really extraordinary. And I think it's going to be ahead of the game in the fall.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And when do you expect the new health care reform product to become material to revenue or earnings for Paychex?","Martin Mucci","Well, it's hard to say because we're just starting out. I think there's going to be so much confusion over it. But I think when you get into the second half of fiscal '14 and then you get into the kind of the second half of the calendar year, which is early '15, I think it starts to pick up speed, and frankly from there on in. Because I think there'll still be changes. People will be catching up with everything from a client perspective. I would say the next calendar year and into the following one.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just finally, did you quantify year-over-year bookings growth for the May quarter?","Efrain Rivera","No, we didn't. We don't do it on a quarterly basis.","Martin Mucci","Yes, but we felt good about -- as Efrain said, the second half was stronger than the first. And we really felt -- and not just in one area. The small payroll side was good, the 401(k) was strong in par and in our new business revenue and so was HR outsourcing and SurePayroll.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Did bookings growth improve from the February quarter?","Efrain Rivera","It was comparable, both were very good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Thomas of Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Following up on the health care reform, you mentioned you expect some rate pressure in insurance from reform. But it sounds like there might be some opportunities. I mean, are you thinking about it as a net positive or net negative at this point within your FY '14 guidance?","Efrain Rivera","It's net positive, Paul. So referring back to the previous question, it's tough to peg when some of these initiatives will become material to growth because we're walking through it the first time. But we think it's definitely a net plus. When we call out rate pressure, what we're describing there specifically is, we see a migration from smaller clients to larger clients in our base health and benefits business. We see rates there coming under some pressure for that segment of the market. But that is going to be dwarfed by other opportunities within the market that really extend across the entirety of our client base. So the products that Marty just mentioned, we think, will have the potential to be an important contributor in the future.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And have you seen any change in client behavior yet? I think last quarter you talked about you hadn't seen much yet because it's still ways off. But it sounds like you're getting products ready for the change. And what are you seeing on the client side?","Martin Mucci","What we're seeing at this stage is a lot of request for information. So it's getting us in front of clients. But I don't think they're -- they're not making -- one of -- well, first of all, the products aren't there yet. But I don't think they're making their decisions yet. I think the summer and the fall is really where it's going to hit as they get into benefit enrollment. That's where they're going to really feel it. At this stage, they're still gathering information. But the information gathering has ticked up, but not in anything necessarily in making decisions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I just wanted to follow up on the question that I had initially asked last quarter, as far as the longer-term guidance for core payroll revenue growth, the mid-single-digit figure that you had given last summer. And at the time, you had said that that seemed too high. And now obviously, we're into fiscal '14. We have the guidance for this year. It's still below mid-single digits. So is now the right time to kind of give us a reset on that longer-term guidance? I mean, where do you guys think, over that 3-year forecast period, you'll actually come out in core payroll?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, hey, Jason, so when you go back to the presentation, there were 2 parts of it. One was the long term thought process, which was contrasted by the next section of the presentation, which was 2013 through 2015. So in 2013 through '15, this is what we said specifically. Organic client base growth was going to be 1% to 3%, pricing would be 2% to 4% and checks would be 0% to 1%. That's what we said about 2013 to '15. To get to mid-single digits, and I think that we've been saying this pretty consistently, you need a slightly different environment in terms of new business formation than the one we have. If you look at the data that we've got at this point, based on the most recent BLS data, which has a lag, basically shows no growth whatsoever in new business formation. Now we're not using that as an excuse. We think that we can grow the business. We need a little bit better environment to kind of push us solidly into the mid-single-digits category. But we think as a long-term proposition, meaning beyond the 2015 range, that's not a unreasonable expectation or target to set. Now, will we make it? It depends on those 3: organic client base growth, pricing and checks. We think at this point, there's a path to get there.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, just it gets pushed out a bit because of the macro, it sounds like.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, yes.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. Now I was also curious if there's been any changes in your win rate in terms of going after new clients as opposed to renewals. The reason I ask is, obviously the retention is trending very well at record levels, yet the total client base is only up about 1% in aggregate over the last 2 years. So anything you can share there?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think it's pretty consistent. I think that we focused a lot on revenue this year with the sales team in the last fiscal year. And so we did a really good job of driving higher revenue per client. And they focused a lot on that. I think, frankly, that took a little bit of the focus off of units, of selling every client. So it's a little bit of hard to tell in the numbers when we compare year-to-year. But I think we're doing pretty well. I think from a -- like when you look at from a revenue, new business revenue standpoint, some of our old favorites in CPA referrals, bank referrals are trending up. So I'd say overall, it's probably about the same. And I think we definitely will see an uptick this year as we did in the fourth quarter. I think when we did some incentives more toward balance of unit and revenue, we saw the fourth quarter really pick up, so.","Efrain Rivera","But one other thing I'd add to what Marty said is that, if we look at it from a revenue retention standpoint, we typically don't give that number, we're at historic highs, above our client retention rate. So we've got a number of things working in our favor. And Marty's just reiterated, I think we put a lot more emphasis on revenue per client. We saw, as the year exited, that we were selling a little bit bigger client. That probably affected units a bit. And we probably need to be a little bit more balanced next year.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the float. I mean, I think based on investor conversations we've had since the last night, it seems like there was a little disappointment that the float income is going to be down more in fiscal '14, a little bit more than it was in fiscal '13. So can you just clarify which part of the yield curve actually matters most to your float income right now, based on the current composition of portfolio and the historical rule of thumb, in terms of the 25 bps change in short-term rates impacting EPS by a little north of $0.01 over the forward 12 months, does that still hold based on your current duration in the rate environment?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So, I guess, Jason, let me answer that in 2 ways. So we're a little bit north of 50% on the portfolio as a whole. And on average, we're about $4 billion. We're north, I'd say, of 50% in terms of our long-term portfolio. We're about a little over 3 in terms of duration. The impact of higher rates will be seen in that portfolio, we just did not going to reprice immediately. So -- and as you can imagine, we've got a group of treasury professionals who are trying to figure this out. In a rising rate environment, you go longer, do you say intermediate? So we're figuring that part out of it. The -- with respect to the shorter-term portfolio, we're getting 8 to 10 basis points on a little bit under $2 billion worth of client funds. So the immediate impact would be much more -- would be felt much more quickly on a short-term rate boost, which we haven't seen, which may be the long-term augers are the short-term rate boost. But I think the 25 bps and $0.01 is about right, that's about the right number. So I would just caution that if you don't see it right away, it's simply because as we were putting our plan together, we made an assumption about rates that probably was a bit conservative in this environment. We'll see as we go through the year. If rates continue to rise, we should have a bit of upside on the client funds portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question on the client retention. I noticed it's -- or you mentioned it's at historical highs at over 81%. Looking into fiscal '14, is that sustainable? And kind of what's the retention assumption that you built in for the year?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think we never look to go backward. So I think -- we certainly feel it's sustainable, and we're always trying to improve it. I think we've done a really good job with -- first of all, I think the quality of the products and the service is very important to clients. I think the pricing is right, and I think we've done a really good job on maximizing both of those things, really, the combined performance and the pricing. So yes, I think it is. And we would expect -- always expect from our team a little bit better performance. So now, how far can it go when you have losses, and if sales pick up again, everyone knows it is more sales pick up, new businesses -- more businesses start. If we have that kind of pickup, it may cause some losses because you have more businesses starting up. But I think you could expect -- we certainly expect that it's going to be the same or a little better.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. But the net new client growth for next year, that's going to be much more a function of new sales coming through for '14 relative to '13. That's a fair way to look at it?","Martin Mucci","That's a fair way to look at it, yes.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question for me. I think you had mentioned about feeling more comfortable about pricing heading into the year. Is that just a function of being able to bundle more products or is there something else going on in the environment related to pricing?","Martin Mucci","No, I think it's just -- I think we found a good place where -- and we've always said that the competitive environment is about the same, and I don't think it has changed much. I think we've got very strong products that compete very effectively, and I think our pricing is a good place. I think, as Efrain said earlier, we don't give out the pricing exactly, but I think you can kind of guess in the range that we're in, we feel that that price will hold, as it has in the past. And when you see the pricing that we've done in the past and record retention, we certainly feel good about the level of pricing that we're doing. So I think there's no big change there, except that I think we're able to hold the price well. And I think the environment is going to get any -- is get nothing but better from an overall environment -- business environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess, just a bit curious why you didn't do a buyback? If you addressed it, I might have missed it.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so authorization lasts through the end of next year. We wanted to see where we ended up from a share count perspective. We'll buy back to offset dilution, and then we'll see where the stock settles out in terms of price and buy when we think market conditions are right. I guess I wouldn't say anything more direct than that.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then on -- what trends are you seeing with regards to new business creation? And within sort of the new businesses that do get created that commerce have a conversation with you, are you seeing maybe a greater tendency to use SurePayroll or maybe a disaggregated product, or is it conversation sort of bundled product?","Efrain Rivera","With respect to the environment, it's -- one of the things that if you went back 2 years and asked what our assumption was, we would've simply thought that the environment was going to bounce back in terms of business formation more quickly than it has. It simply hasn't, thus far, as we can tell. With respect to businesses, preferring SurePayroll versus core payroll, it's really more attitudinal than it is its size. So we see 7-person payroll companies that want an outsourced solution, fully outsourced solution, and we see a lot of 7-person payrolls that prefer the SurePayroll credit. It really depends on the type of customer and what their interest is in terms of the way they want to process payroll. One thing that I'd mentioned to a number of you that I think is important, we don't constrain the customer or tell them that one solution is better when they search on the web. If you go on the web, you'll see both solutions pop up, and SurePayroll competes against our core product in the same payroll services ecosystem. We think we want to get the customer, then we're going to offer them a range of additional services that, whether they're on SurePayroll or not, they would be interested in. So it's really more attitudinal than anything else.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then just a clarification on the file incented (k) [ph] client count. Does that exclude or include SurePayroll? Just want to make sure.","Efrain Rivera","Includes.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It includes, right?","Efrain Rivera","It does.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And so do you break that out? I think this question may have been asked before.","Efrain Rivera","No, we don't. And part of the reason for that is there's a number of client bases within our client base. To get -- to provide an accurate perspective, we'd have to give you 4 or 5 client bases that are in there. And at that point, we're giving you proprietary information that we just -- we're not going to do.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. No, but I was just thinking because they are very different business models. And one of the things I was trying to potentially back into was as the SaaS-based solution sort of increases in size relative to the total, what kind of relative margin assumptions should we be making over time? Is there a margin improvement that you're seeing in that business? To what extent, things like that?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, well, I think it's still very early stage. There may come a point at which we decide to split it out because it's material to our results. Right now, it's not, Ashwin. And it would -- at current rates, we have a long way to go before it becomes that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I'd like to go back a couple of questions on healthcare. Could you give me your thinking on setting up a private exchange, kind of how it will work and what type of customer you expect might use it?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think on the private exchange side, what -- it'll be, for us, it's going to be a partnership. We haven't announced who that is yet, but we'll have a partnership that -- what we're trying to do is help the small client, in particular, who wants to provide health insurance to their employees. They don't necessarily have to, but they want to provide an opportunity for them by giving them, let's say, a pretax -- let's say, I want to give you just $200 a month toward -- in insurance toward paying your insurance. And you're a small business, I want to help my employees, I give them a pretax amount and they can go and give them away to go to an exchange and help buy that product. So what we'll get more there is a share of the kind of what the carrier is giving, which carrier they go to. And it will be multiple carriers that the exchange uses, obviously, insurance carriers. We'll get a piece of that carrier commission and then probably some administrative fees as well. And so what you got is a small business who doesn't have to provide the insurance under the law, but wants to help their clients -- wants to help their employees and wants to give them a pretax option as well. So we can give the pretax process and we can help them kind of channel their employee to an exchange to help them select what's the best plan for them.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","So do you think your effective brokerage commission will be similar on the exchange versus your traditional methods?","Martin Mucci","I think it would probably be a little bit less because there's a middle person there in the exchange that'll take a piece of that as well. That's not quite worked out yet, but I think you can expect that it'd be slightly less because there's someone in the middle that's going to work the exchange.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And just one more follow-up. You talked about the expecting rate pressure. Any kind of general views of kind of their price increases, healthcare price increases you're expecting to see next year?","Efrain Rivera","Well, it's interesting. When we speak about rate pressure, Jim, we're really referring to commissions that we receive, not to the rate increases we're going to see for insurers. What we have seen so far is that there's going to be fairly sizable insurance increases, price increases.","Martin Mucci","Coming from all carriers and all clients.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, all carriers.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And that's sort of where I was going. So how do you expect that to impact you when everyone is getting large increases?","Efrain Rivera","Well, here's the answer to that, and it requires us to think a little bit about the PEO. So when we go to a client, we've got 2 options. We can go in an ASO model and sell them a one-off insurance policy based on their particular characteristics. They may be good or bad, depending on their history and their -- the type of business they have. Or the same person can go in and sell them a PEO alternative. We think the PEO is going to be favored, at least for a period of time, because the PEO will be able to underwrite those risks and they will have an advantage, we think, early on versus the exchanges. So it could be a potential win for the PEO. But we need to walk through that to get a better sense of that.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up, sorry. So will you be taking more risk view or just be passing along insurance rates of the PEO, you'll be taking on more self-insurance there?","Efrain Rivera","There's a number of different models. We haven't finalized that. You can -- we could do both. So haven't finalized that. And you can just -- you can be sure that if we go down that route, we bound that risk pretty tight with, yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Condra of BMO.","Paul Condra","I have just basically, kind of a basic question. This is probably best for Efrain, but the funds held for client balance were up in the fourth quarter -- or sorry, dropped a bit and I'm just curious, what makes that move -- just if you compare it to the third quarter, what kind of makes it...","Efrain Rivera","Yes, what we basically -- Paul, it really just depends on literally, the day on which we close, how much in client funds we are -- the day we close the quarter, how much in funds we're holding. And how much in funds we're holding depends on how much we're remitting in -- it could be anything from payroll to income taxes. So it varies so widely that there's really kind of no rule of thumb that says if it's a Thursday, it's this, and if it's a Friday, it's that. But basically, what's happening is where are we in the stage of remitting the different funds to the end recipients.","Paul Condra","Okay, that's clear enough. And then I don't know if you can shed any light on this, but when you look at your client base, and I'm just trying to figure out what percent of the other are just doing the core payroll, and then how far you are long in getting them to add additional services and how that penetration is looking?","Efrain Rivera","Sure. Yes, well, we disclosed a fair amount of that information. And I think if you take HRS in the aggregate, the penetration into the base from a client perspective is less than 10%. So we -- and we've got that pretty detailed in the MD&A, and I think it's also in the press release. So you can get a sense of that. We're still in the early stages of product penetration into the rest of the base.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, I want to -- first of all, I want to ask a quick question on a comment you made. I thought you said EPS earnings would be fairly even in the first half versus the second half?","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Are we talking growth rates or on an absolute basis?","Efrain Rivera","On an absolute basis.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Can you elaborate on why -- is there something about the expense growth throughout the year? Because that's unusual relative to your...","Efrain Rivera","No, not really, Tim. I guess what I'm saying is -- let me just make it explicit. So I'm saying it's, let's say your assessment is that we're going to be at $1.69. We're saying the first half, split it down the middle, that's what the year looks like at this point. So just gives some more color on what the quarters end up looking like. This year was -- I'm contrasting that, Tim, to 2 years ago. If you look at it, we were heavily front-end loaded 2 years ago. And this year, we return to kind of a more normal distribution.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And if we think about the client -- the interest income from client funds, if it's -- are you expecting the balances could grow roughly in line with payroll growth? Is that a fair assumption as we think for this one?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I think so. So last year, we grew about, I think the final number is 4%, 5%. It will grow with that number.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then last -- quick one for me. Just you mentioned the revenue -- I'm sorry, the checks per client moderating a bit in the fourth quarter. Can you talk at all about, I mean, the reason for that? Was there any -- is there a conclusion as to -- is it reflective of actual hiring trends or just mix, or a return to...","Martin Mucci","I think it's not mix. I think, Tim, what we saw was a little bit lower check growth in larger clients and a little bit faster growth in smaller clients. When the mix came out, it ended up at about 1%. I caution until we've had a couple more quarters -- we get a lot of volatility that -- this year, if you remember. So we went from 2%, first quarter, 1.2%, 2.3%, 0.9%. So we just saw some volatility in the numbers that may have been a result of mix issues and also kind of where we ended a particular quarter. So we'll get a better beat on where we're at next quarter. I do think the trend is down though. I mean, the trend is moderating downward.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","It doesn't change -- you actually sound a little more positive on the macro because of construction than before, though. Is that...","Efrain Rivera","I think we're a little bit more positive on the macro because at some point, you have to stop using the macro as an excuse and you just got -- get down to business with growing. We don't think the environment is that much better. We think that it's good for the businesses that are, in business, they seem to be within our base. They seem to be healthy and doing well. We'd like a better environment in terms of business formation, but at this point, we're not going to keep banging that drum.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think what we've seen -- we haven't seen the new business starts reflect the things that you can see coming -- that appear to be coming, which is the new housing starts and so forth. We think that we'll start to catch up and it'll start to pick up a little bit. But remember that sometimes that new business is starting as opposed to others hiring. And so there's a mix in there. But I think, as Efrain said, we want to look at a couple of quarters of this because it has bounced around quite a bit this year. So the fact is it's still up 13 quarters in a row, which we've never really seen before, so that's still very positive. The hiring is just more gradual, but continuous. And we expect it to moderate. This might have been a little quicker than we thought, but again, as Efrain said, I think there's timing in there and mix and other things, and we watch that for 1 quarter or 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm wondering, what are the plans for sales force growth for this coming year?","Martin Mucci","There was a -- there's a slight increase. We did a pretty good expansion last year in the 2% to 3% for more territories, and also went after different teams on franchises, banking and so forth. So I think we feel pretty good about where they were. We did some adjustments. But it was, I would say, it's below 3%, so within the 2% range.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So basically, just slightly below what the rate of expansion from last year?","Martin Mucci","Yes.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I'm a little confused with regards to the new sales commentary from the perspective that, in the press release, we cite how well we did with the small businesses. But yet, it sounds like the average size of a client actually ended up increasing.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So, Mark, the commentary there is just to say that within core, as we went through the year, the average size of clients sold as we got into fourth quarter was a little bit higher than we began in the year. It actually was higher.","Martin Mucci","50 in them.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, but it's in the 50 and understates that we were talking about.","Martin Mucci","Yes. So this might be the difference between looking at it, Mark. Small, to us, when we talk about small, we're talking about core and that's under 50. What we did see is we saw -- as we said earlier, the revenue go up, focus on revenue and a little bit larger client. But that's the difference between going after the under 10s, let's say, and the under 20s. And that brought us up a little bit.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And does that include the commentary around SurePayroll?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, it does.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So even with...","Efrain Rivera","So I'm sorry, I apologize, Mark. No, that's primarily core.","Martin Mucci","Yes, that's our core Paychex.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's within -- okay, so within core Paychex, we ended up seeing a bit of an increase. But if you include SurePayroll into the mix, then the average client size probably went down since SurePayroll was growing at a faster rate.","Efrain Rivera","We'll disclose that. We didn't -- we haven't looked at...","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Is there anything wrong that I'm seeing with the logic?","Efrain Rivera","There's no material difference, Mark. There's no material difference because at this point, they don't influence the client base so much, yes.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And with regards to the revenue of the clients, the annualized contract value of the clients that you signed, it sounds like that did increase more than the 0.5% to 1% kind of unit increase that we ended up seeing.","Efrain Rivera","That's correct, yes.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So that's going all right. And then with regards to kind of more of the mid market, and particularly with regards to the new platform that's coming out, in terms of your Next Generation platform for the mid market, when is that coming out? When -- how much of an impact should that have?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think we're already seeing some -- we've already rolled out some of that, but some major changes come out in the next 6 months, frankly in the next few months, and then, again, in the December -- November, December timeframe. So I think it's just -- we're continuing to roll out releases about every 5, 6 months. And the biggest impact there will come in the next month or so, and then in the last part of the calendar year. So that will -- that's when more product and functionality is on that application, on the Paychex Next Generation application. And -- but we're also, of course, acquiring other products that kind of roll in and support that team. The ExpenseWire, the mystaffingpro, those SaaS-based solutions also support the existing application and the existing client base, as well as new ones. So we expect to see a lot of opportunity for the mid market space this year.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right. And then with regards to healthcare reform, any -- of your 570,000 clients, any rough approximation with regards to how many would be in that, say, 45 and above range? Because even companies that are below the limit probably are going to be sensitive to where they need to be.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. The way we look at it, Mark, is we think it's really around the 30-employee mark that you start to worry about the Act. And you're probably a quarter or more of the base at that point.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And why do you think it's going to be next -- second half of the fiscal year, when it's going to kick in in terms of having an impact when the reality of the situation is that the deadline goes into effect on January 1, and you would think that some companies would start shifting to whatever new platforms they needed ahead of time?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I guess I would just say when you think about the absolute -- one, to make a final decision is it's going to happen for a lot of companies with January 1, when they change their -- when the requirements go into effect. I think a lot of companies, particularly small and midsize businesses, don't make a decision on that until the October, November timeframe when they get into benefit enrollment. They're starting now to ask for a lot of information about it, and I think that's going to heat up over the summer. And then I think we'll start to see a lot of activity in the September, October, November timeframe. And when you start to think, \"When does that really start to have any impact on us,\" that's more into the first half of next calendar year. That's past January.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, that's when the revenue rolls in. But in terms of the sales and the sales pipeline, that would actually be in the fall and...","Martin Mucci","Yes. Yes, I think that would start more in the fall as they get into benefit enrollment. Yes, I'm just -- I -- the question was more about when do we start to see an impact. I think we'll see an impact in sales. We're starting to see activity now and more in the fall, and then I think it'll start to have an impact. But our revenue and you think of the revenue per client, that's going to take a while to make an impact. That will start more in '14.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So you saw better bookings activity last quarter. It seems like that continued into the May quarter as well. And you just posted 6.1% revenue growth for the May quarter. So it seems that the overall revenue growth trends are, I guess what I would say, is slowly improving. That said, your guidance for fiscal '14 is 5% to 6%. In some years, you've added some buffer into the guidance. So really, my question here is, is it feasible that your revenue growth could actually improve some from the 6.1% pace as we progress through fiscal '14? If it has the ability to do that, what would be the likely source of upside? Or are you feeling right now that that north of 6% growth for fiscal '14 is just unlikely?","Efrain Rivera","I think it's unlikely. I think you could see 1 quarter or 2 where we went above that, Rod. I just think we're being -- we're going to be cautious about it. I think the likely source would be strong results from healthcare. That's where we think upside could come. It's a little bit tough to call it at this point. So we got, as Marty mentioned, a number of products out there. We think not only are they -- some of those products applicable to the 30 and above segment of the base, but also, frankly, below 30. But we need to get 1 quarter or 2 under our belt to get a sense of what opportunity is there. Internally, we would love to see more and hope that we do. It's tough to plan on it at this point.","Martin Mucci","Yes, yes. In this economic environment, as Efrain went over a lot of the numbers, that new business starts still aren't really picking up. So we're feeling, honestly, pretty good about the growth in the sales we're seeing in this kind of environment. We're always pushing on every different piece we can to push it even higher, and maybe there's some opportunity, but we feel the guidance is pretty solid where it is.","Efrain Rivera","And one other thing I'd say, Rod, is I called out, so I hope everyone was listening still on, that in the first quarter, in particular due to timing, we start the quarter -- the year again a little slowly and then build. So that has a little bit of impact on the year as a whole.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it, okay. And you've added some conservatism, it seems, in your interest rate assumption as you give the float guidance.","Efrain Rivera","That's correct.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And that makes a lot of sense because I know we had head fakes before on the interest rates. But if you were to take that conservatism out, is that the difference between 0% float income growth next year and then the growth that you guided -- to the negative growth that you guided to? Or how sensitive is your outlook to the conservatism assumption that you've made?","Efrain Rivera","Okay, that was a really great question, which deserves some thought. Yes, you're pretty close.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Williams of UBS.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So 2 quick questions. First was, related to the payout ratio, looks like it's sort of trended in the mid-80s for the last year or 2. And is that a level that you're still comfortable with or do you expect that might trend a little bit differently over the next few years as we sort of see some sort of recovery in the small business environment?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I think we're comfortable in that 80% range. I think that off of the full year EPS, which was $1.56, when you look at it, we were up in the 84% range. But on a more normalized basis, if we -- you can take out the tax effects, we were down in the lower 80s. But we're comfortable in that range. And we -- and the reason for that is that we have pretty predictable cash flows and predictable results.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess the logic we'll follow on to that is just that if -- just capital allocation related, if the fundamentals don't get back to a point that you guys would consider to be robust at any point soon, would you consider potentially adding some debt to the capital structure or getting a little bit more aggressive on buybacks to do that? Is that something that would potentially be completely ruled out?","Efrain Rivera","I wouldn't completely rule it out. So -- and I don't think we have a religious objection to having debt. It just would have to be for the right reasons. And I think, John, we have to couple that with the fact that we -- we're not seeing anything from a pipeline perspective relating to acquisitions that we thought was good. The opposite is true. There's-- there are interesting opportunities out there that we continue to evaluate, very disciplined in the price we'll pay. So we'd have to get to a point where we just didn't even see opportunities for acquisition. And right now, we think there's some attractive opportunities out there, but we're patient and we're disciplined in the terms of the way we approach it.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Just one quick follow-up. I know you guys usually put this in the Q or the K, but just as it relates to rate sensitivity, just an update on where you stand. You said 25 bps. I'm sure the medium is about $0.02 in the past and basically, the duration, 3 years. Are those still pretty close to where...","Efrain Rivera","Yes, 25 bps on the short end is going to get you about $5 million. So yes, that's about $0.01, actually, after you -- a little bit -- $0.015, to be precise.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And 3 years on the duration?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. We'll be probably a little north of that, maybe 3, 2 or so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMC.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess on the referral bank question, I think, Marty, you mentioned Citizens and Union Bank, a little bit bigger than usual. I'm curious if that's replacing an incumbent or is this a new product referral for them?","Martin Mucci","Some was -- some were new, some we're keeping and some we're taking a little bit more -- some were shared, and so we've done a number of these now. So there are some that are new. We haven't -- I didn't list them all. We picked some that were new, some that we kept and some that we -- they were sharing before and we got it.","Efrain Rivera","And one of those was a displacement of our good friend.","Martin Mucci","Yes.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, good. Because I know that's an important -- could be an important channel. So that -- my next question then was just on the gross client adds. Any sort of change in -- or surprise in how those clients are being sourced? For example, are they coming from different channels or is it just your sales force being more productive? Just trying to understand the change -- any change in dynamic there.","Martin Mucci","No, I think we're still doing a really good job with GPAs [ph]. We've reached our kind of -- we're in the 10th year now of our referral relationship with the CPAs where they refer us. That's been going on for 10 years. That continues very strong. I think you're going to see the banks have picked up already and will continue to pick up. Web search is obviously picking up some. And I think the only thing that was a little bit slower was current clients. And I think a lot of that is because there wasn't the new business growth. When you trace that back, it's really that a current client didn't necessarily open up a second location or a third location. And so that hurt us a little bit. But the activity of the sales force is very good, and I think most of the dynamics are pretty much running the same.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I just wanted to make sure. Just 2 quick clarifications, I hope. Just the Insurance Services clients, up 1% in the 8-K filing. I think you mentioned PEO, Efrain. Can you just elaborate again what exactly drove that?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so 2 separate ideas. The insurance clients really are separate from the PEO. So I think there was probably some offset between those 2 numbers. But I think more importantly, Tien-Tsin, what happened was that as the year started, we made a conscious decision to go upstream because we knew that in the under 10 space, that was most likely to be affected by healthcare reform. We pivoted upstream, paid the price, to some extent, on a number of clients. Applications were up, you saw 8%, so we've got good results. We like the platform for being a little bit more upmarket than we were 1 year or 2 ago.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. So it was just a change in direction. Okay, I got it. This is the last clarification at the -- I don't know if you mentioned this, the acquisition of what was HR Services and mystaffingpro, how meaningful was that in terms of size?","Martin Mucci","It's pretty small to start, but we think they have a fantastic product that has won a lot of awards from a SaaS-based model for talent acquisition. And I think it fits in really well with our mid market plans. And so it's really small to start, but I think it's going to take off for us and help us with not only new sales, but retention in the mid market space.","Operator","Our last question comes from Matt Lipton of Autonomous Research.","Matthew Lipton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mine is just a really simple clarification as well. I was hoping you might be able to give us a little more granularity on the offsets to core payroll revenue? You called out Hurricane Sandy and the leap year. I guess just thinking about -- you said pricing earlier, in response to an earlier question, was above 1%, 2% client growth and checks were both positive. So when you add all these up, you could envision revenue being -- coming in more than 4%?","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Matthew Lipton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So am I thinking about it the wrong way or were those just really material headwinds?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I think you are in the sense that if you called out -- if you normalized the year, the growth rate would not have been that high. We called out Hurricane Sandy. We called out the extra day, the extra leap year. We didn't necessarily talk about in the press release, again, the fact that the frequency of payroll costs in Q1 was down from the prior year. One thing to be aware of is that client base growth. If we say it's 1%, we don't get 1% growth necessarily in the year because that is -- that's got a weighted average effect. You start at 0, you end at 1. You get some fraction of that. And then checks, in particular, typically, if we've got a 1% or 2% check number, it -- the contribution to revenue is going to be typically 50% or less of that. So you have to kind of weigh those to kind of get to the right number.","Martin Mucci","Is that the last question, Stacy?","Operator","Yes, sir. There are no further questions.","Martin Mucci","All right, thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, it will be archived until about July 29. Thank you for your interest in Paychex and your participation in this call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Efrain Rivera","Have a great summer.","Operator","This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","And now I will turn the meeting over to your host Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","All right. Thank you and thank you for joining us on our discussion of Paychex\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. You can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.","On today\u2019s call, I will update you on the results of our business in the second quarter and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail and discuss our full-year guidance. After that, we\u2019ll open it up for your questions.","Our results for the second quarter reflected good progress. We continue to see positive results across our major product lines and service revenue for the second quarter grew by 7% year-over-year. We achieved a new milestone this quarter as we obtained 1 million client worksite employees, served by our Paychex HR Services.","Paychex HR Services is our comprehensive outsourcing services product line and that includes our ASO or Administrative Services Organization and our PEO, our Professional Employer Organization as well. Our cloud-based HCM services, in particular, time and attendance continue to show strong growth in the quarter.","Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance has been an excellent addition to the Paychex family. We\u2019re very pleased with the leadership and the team\u2019s contribution to our financial results and the future opportunities for growth we see in that business particularly timely as the staffing business is picking up some expanded growth today.","With the success of our of HCM solutions, we have continued to invest in operations personnel as we\u2019ve expanded our multiproduct service centers, including our time and attendance support and our ACA product compliance and service teams. Client retention remains at consistent high levels.","We have also invested in our service \u2013 in our sales organization over the last year adding headcount across all sales teams and we are well-positioned going into our third quarter. We will have a better idea of overall sales performance and the impact of the fiscal year next quarter after the end of our peak sales season.","We continue to make it a priority to provide robust HCM solutions that may be \u2013 the evolving needs of our client base. At the recent HR Technology Conference and Exposition in October, we showcased enhancements to Paychex Flex that addressed two of the biggest trends in the HR industry; mobile user experience and HR analytics. Attendees at the conference were able to view a demo of Paychex Flex, which included these enhancements.","We also announced that we shifted to a mobile-first design of our HCM suite. This approach allows Paychex Flex users to have full functionality of all application components regardless of device or screen size. The growing trend for both HR leaders and employees is the use of a mobile device. Shifting to a mobile-first design demonstrates our commitment to putting the needs of our clients and their employees first, so that they can accomplish their HR test, where they want, when they want, and on whatever device they want.","We continue to receive positive recognition of our Flex platform in November. We were honored to be recognized as a leader in the 2016 NelsonHall Payroll Outsourcing NEAT, a component of the firm\u2019s speed-to-source initiative. NEAT stands for NelsonHall\u2019s evaluation and assessment tool and is a vendor evaluation report tool that can be utilized by managers to evaluate outsourcing vendors.","This was the first time we had participated in this initiative and we were placed in the leader quadrant for three areas; technology and user experience, analytics and reporting, and HR cloud integration. The client feedback that goes into this ranking makes a center even more important to us and reinforces our commitment to delivering the best and most robust solutions in the market today with our Paychex Flex platform.","This has been a transition period in the U.S. with the presidential election and the move to the Trump administration. We have been asked a few times how we anticipate the new administration will impact the economy overall and more specifically the payroll and human capital management outsourcing industry?","In this transition time, many business owners could be hesitant to make longer-term decisions. We see this as being more likely to impact the mid to large-sized businesses rather than small businesses. President-elect Trump is indicated that he intends to lower taxes and create less regulation. This would be a positive for small businesses. It would lower the cost and allow them to invest and higher more.","Paychex would benefit as our clients expand and add employees and potentially see value in our HCM services. While complex regulations tend to drive companies to an outsourcing solution, we believe any change in regulation is good for Paychex. We remained informed about what is happening in the regulatory environment and are well-positioned to continue to educate our clients and assist them with their compliance needs through our technology and service support.","Over the last year, the Affordable Care Act has been a tailwind for payroll outsourcing companies, including ourselves. Any rollback of Obamacare or Affordable Care Act or a reduction in compliance and administration requirements will impact the HCM outsourcing industry. Given our target market of small to medium-sized businesses, a large portion of our client base is not \u2013 has not been impacted by ACA.","In November, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the Department of Labor\u2019s final overtime rule that would have become effect of December 1. This rule would expand overtime for millions of workers. As a result of this injunction, employers did not have to be in compliance with the new rules as of December 1. The ruling is temporary, but creates substantial uncertainty for businesses.","The proposed rules created an enhanced awareness for the need for time and attendance solutions, particularly to those integrated within their \u2013 with the clients HCM product suite. This brought an increased demand for our products that we don\u2019t see diminishing with the delay in the rules. We will continue to monitor the status of these regulations and ensure our clients remain informed as to how any changes may affect them.","Shifting the discussion from clients to shareholders, we continued with shareholder-friendly actions. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166 million, and we will continue to maintain an industry leading dividend yield of over 3% with a quarterly dividend up $0.46 per share.","In summary, we have made solid progress in growth in our financial performance during the past quarter, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex\u2019s employees and management team.","And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve risks, refer to the customary disclosures.","As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results fiscal 2017 showed continued progress and growth. I\u2019ll cover some of the key highlights for the second quarter and the six months, provide greater detail in certain areas, and warp with a review of the 2017 outlook.","Total service revenue grew 7% for the second quarter to $760 million, and 8% for the six months to $1.5 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the second quarter and 6% for the six months to a $11 million and $23 million, respectively. These changes were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. The growth was tempered by a slight decrease in the average investment balances by approximately 1% for both periods. This is really a timing issue that we call out in the press release.","Expenses increased to 8% for both the second quarter and six months, with Advance Partners contributing approximately 1.5% to this growth for both periods. Expense growth was impacted by higher wages and related expenses due to growth in headcount in our operations area.","Selling expenses have shown modest growth, reflecting strong sales performance in the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin was approximately 40.3% for the second quarter and 40.7% year-to-date comparable with the prior-year periods. We continue to maintain industry-leading margins, while investing in our operations.","Our effective income tax rate was 35.2% for the second quarter and 34.1% for the six months, compared to 36% and 32.9% for the respective periods last year. As we discussed on our last quarterly call, we had several discrete items \u2013 tax items in the first quarter both years that have impacted the year-to-date effective income tax rates.","In fiscal 2017, we implemented new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation, which has resulted in discrete tax benefits now being recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. The impact of this in the second quarter was immaterial, but had a larger impact in the first quarter.","Last year in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produced, because there have been ins and outs refer to the press release and you\u2019ll see we provide a non-GAAP EBITDA comparison, I should say, non-GAAP EPS comparison with and without these items.","Net income increased 7% to $202 million for the second quarter and 5% to $420 million for the six months. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 5% to $1.16 per share for the six months. On a non-GAAP basis, as I mentioned, just a second ago, adjusted net income increased 6% to $201 million for the second quarter and 7% to $405 million for the six months.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 8% to $1.12 per share for the six months. Note that these two non-GAAP measures, exclude certain discrete tax items previously discussed, refer to the tables if you have any questions about that.","Payroll service revenue increased 3% for the second quarter to $441 million and 4% to $892 million for the six months. Advance Partners contributed 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check, revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting.","Payroll client size impacted revenue, as average client size trended modestly lower. We discussed that in the first quarter. We saw a continuation of that trend in the second quarter. While we continue to present payroll service revenue and HRS revenue, I want to emphasize one important point. With the evolving nature of our businesses to an HCM provider, we now offer more product bundles that are bundled with payroll revenue from these bundles as allocated among payroll and HRS.","The payroll growth remained steady, but HRS growth reflects the sale of more services to clients in greater revenue per client. And I call out specifically that we have another strong quarter in time and attendance sales. HRS revenue increased 12% to $319 million for the second quarter, 14% to $642 million for the six months. This increase reflects continued growth across our client base and all HCM services, including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and HR administration.","Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth in the number of client worksite employees served. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our SR services, as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants.","Our workers comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds, as well as an increase in the number of plans served.","Last, Advance Partners contributed a little bit less than 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for both the second quarter and the six months. Investments in income. Turning to our portfolio, our goal is, as you know, to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term vehicles remain bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, some corporate bonds and U.S. government securities long-term portfolio has now as an average yield of 1.7%, and an average duration of 3.3 years.","Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for the second quarter and six months, up from 1.1% last year. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% year-over-year. As the impact from growth in client base was offset by timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities, we expect that in the second-half of the year that will change and we\u2019ll \u2013 we expect client base, client growth \u2013 clients funds growth, I should say, sorry, to grow about 1%.","I\u2019ll now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $725 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of November 30 were $3.2 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients very widely, as you know, and they average $3.7 billion for both the quarter and the six months.","Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments in funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $16 million as of November 30, compared with a net unrealized gain of $48 million as of May 31.","Recently interest rates for intermediate term investors, investments, I should say, have rallied resulting in a decrease in the market value of our portfolio. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $1.8 billion as of November 30, 2016, reflecting $331 million in dividends and $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock, a return on equity for the past 12 months was 40%.","Cash flows from operations were $413 million for the first six months, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. This decrease was a result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and non-cash adjustments.","Now, let me turn to guidance. We remind you that the outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions. And what I mean by that is, we do factor in the recent Fed rate raise, but we don\u2019t factor in any continuing raises beyond that. We\u2019ll update as we see those. We obviously expect that there will be some, but they\u2019re not baked into this guidance.","Payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. We anticipate payroll revenue growth in the third quarter will be below the range of full-year guidance as we discussed on last quarter\u2019s call. We now expect that it will be approximately 2%. Remember that the third quarter is impacted by one less processing day.","HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is anticipated to remain in the range of 7% to 8%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in the upper single digits. The impact of the recent increase in short-term rates will be modest, but we be more accretive as we enter into 2018.","Operating margins are anticipated to be consistent with the guidance previously provided. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%. GAAP basis net income growth is expected to be approximately 7%. We said that last quarter, adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that exclude certain discrete tax items is anticipated to grow approximately 8% consistent with the guidance that we gave in June.","I turn it back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Efrain. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. We will now have the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first one is from Mr. Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks. Good morning, guys. happy holidays to you.","Martin Mucci","Same to you.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks. I just want to start with a question on the Core Payroll segment, just trying to do the math in the back of the more precise outlook on Q3 at the 2% level. I mean, I guess, to get to the midpoint of the full-year 3% to 4% range, it seems lick you\u2019d have to be about 4.5% growth in Q4. So just so we\u2019ve got our models aligned properly, I mean, should we be thinking about the lower-end 3% to 4% [more effectively,] [ph] or are there some real accelerators in Q4, I know you\u2019re not going to have the benefit of Advance anymore, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re disadvantaged in terms of processing days either there?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Jason, I think to call it precisely, it\u2019s a little bit tough, because we need to get through selling. But I think at this point, we\u2019d anticipate we\u2019re towards the lower-end of that range.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, all right, understood. And then just wanted to check on pricing as well, that\u2019s an area to continue to always get questions on. I know you talked about there being some lift from pricing. If it is still in that historical 2% to 4% range, I guess, that would imply that on an organic basis that volumes in core payroll were kind of flat to down, are we thinking about that right? Is 2% to 4% still the right range that you\u2019re seeing on price?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So let me talk about that. So, yes, it is 2% to 4%. This year, it\u2019s probably closer to the lower-end. We\u2019ve been trending somewhere between the low and the mid part of that range. So we still are getting price. We still are getting volume. So our client base is up over last year. And we\u2019ve said, we would be between 1% to 3%, last year we were 2%, we\u2019re in that range.","So what accounts for the difference, it is accounted for by the fact that our client \u2013 average client size is a little bit smaller, so to put this in context. If you go back 10 years, go back to 2007, our average client size is 17. But some years, it\u2019s 17.1. Last year we ended at 16.73. And at this point, we are trending slightly down from that number. And so that the effect of that mix is basically taking payroll service revenues down.","This happens from time to time. It happens more when two things are present. The first is that, we start to see a flattening in checks for payroll, which is what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last three to four quarters. Actually this quarter, our checks for payroll went negative.","So what that means is that and by the way that\u2019s on a same-store basis, I want to clarify that. What that means is that, particularly, our clients in the under 50 space simply aren\u2019t adding a lot of employees at this stage. Will that continue? We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s been bouncing around quarter-to-quarter, and if you look at our index that we publish each month, you\u2019ll see that reflected in the numbers. But that\u2019s part A.","And then part B is that, as we sell clients that are a little bit lower than those that we lose, we have this drag effect. In most years that basically is offset by some client checks for payroll growth. This is a year where we\u2019re not seeing that. So we\u2019re monitoring that and saw some of it in Q1 and we\u2019ll see if it continues into Q2 It can bounce around, I would just caution not to assume that that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re going to see through the balance of the year. But we\u2019re assuming at this point some drag in checks for payroll as we go through the year.","Martin Mucci","We\u2019re not \u2013 just to add to that a little bit. We\u2019re not \u2013 when you look at last year\u2019s second quarter, there was kind of a push because of the Affordable Care Act, particularly in the mid-market clients. And to get in and buy those services and therefore it got you in the door a lot more sales, and that kind of ticked up the size of the average client, because we sold a little bit more in the mid-market. So it\u2019s an interesting time with the election to see how much the Affordable Care Act last year versus this year had an impact. And because we sold those clients pretty much who needed it.","Now, the retention has been very strong on that product even with the uncertainty. But that was higher last year. It got you in the door a lot more in the mid-market, because they were interested in not only the Affordable Care Act, but how you integrated with the payroll services. And so that may have been an impact.","And then as Efrain mentioned on our small business index, we\u2019ve seen a flattening out of hiring in the small business sector, the under 50 employees sector, and for a couple of months now, and that could be around the election or not. So it\u2019s kind of an interesting quarter because of the election and the possible changes coming up as well.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just one last one for me. I think in the quarter, you bought back more than twice as many shares as you had bought all of last fiscal year. So wanted to get a sense of whether that\u2019s indicative of any change in the M&A pipeline in terms of the prospects there, either in terms of size of the prospects or potential timing on the prospects?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So the short answer is no. The share repurchase itself was really simply an attempt to get back down to average share count. And if you look at it, we actually were still a little bit high compared to where we were last year. So we\u2019ll do a little bit of \u2013 on an year-to-date basis, we\u2019ll do a little bit more buying just to get back to flat. Now actually, Marty can talk a little bit more about the M&A pipeline, but it\u2019s pretty robust.","Martin Mucci","Yes, still pretty active, not always finding exactly what we want, but it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been probably more active from a pipeline standpoint. It\u2019s just whether you get to the final deal or not based on the value and what we find in diligence, but been very active on that front and it hasn\u2019t slowed down at all.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Thanks, again, guys.","Martin Mucci","All right. Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from James Berkley with Barclays. Your line is open.","James Berkley","Hi, guys. Hi, guys, thanks a lot for taking my questions here. Just want to get a better handle on how to think about new revenue growth for 2017. I know you touched on a little bit on the payroll side just now. But through the first-half of the year, you\u2019re near the high-end of your guided ranges on payroll and HRS growth.","But this quarter did see the low-end of those ranges, you\u2019ve got Advance Partners lapping one less day in fiscal third quarter questions around the Affordable Care Act and time and attendance, given the delay with the Department of Labor. How do we think about all those moving parts in the back-half of the year, in particular, and what do you think about the ACA and time and attendance, the aspect \u2013 that aspect post-Trump versus previously?","Efrain Rivera","Okay, wow, that\u2019s a compound question. So, I\u2019d say, let me just say broadly and then I\u2019ll come back to ACA and other regulatory changes, Marty obviously will have some thoughts on that. But our guidance contemplates all of those issues. Obviously, we just answered a question on payroll services, revenue growth, HRS has remained unchanged.","So from that standpoint, we feel comfortable with where we are for the remainder of the year and for the full-year. We don\u2019t focus necessarily on quarters unless there\u2019s some \u2013 something unusual in the quarter that we want to call out like Q3, which has one less day. I feel comfortable about where we are in terms of margins and expenses. So that outlook that we\u2019re providing basically encompasses what we understand the environment to be, don\u2019t anticipate it will change significantly.","Now, with respect to ACA and with respect to other changes in regulation, it\u2019s a little bit early to call those. The overtime rules change, at this point don\u2019t see a lot of impact on the balance of the year. It could impact next year and then on what exactly happens with ACA, that\u2019s a question to be answered at this point.","What I would say is, if we were to see some sort of a significant movement to repeal starting sometime in late Spring, our anticipation of is that were to rollout over a, let\u2019s say, call it a two to three-year period is that we would see about an impact of 1% on EPS per year. If it was more accelerated, it might be more, but we\u2019re still waiting, that that by the way is more of a worse case scenario, 1% to 1.5% EPS.","We think we have other options to replace that revenue. But at this point, we would frame sort of the risk if the ACA got repealed in an orderly fashion. If it got replaced and repealed immediately, that would be a different conversation, we\u2019ll have to wait and see where we end up.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think the expectation, at least, at this point would be, it\u2019s going to take sometime, it\u2019s pretty complicated, as you know, and to change it. So and we\u2019re seeing very solid retention. Of course, clients are looking for us to file in March now for them, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see much movement, at least, through that filing period.","And I think it\u2019s going to be a longer thing, which as Efrain mentioned, we\u2019re looking at depending on what happens a number of products. My guess is, clients are still going to have to do something and they\u2019re going to need some support for that. So we feel pretty good that we will be able to adapt to that, might not make up all of the revenue, but it certainly has some opportunity there.","From a time and attendance, it\u2019s been interesting that we\u2019ve had very strong sales of our time and attendance solutions. And we\u2019ve introduced the new one that is Flex Essentials, that is a no clock, all web, or mobile punch, much simpler to set up, and we\u2019ve seen an acceleration there.","So I think the whole overtime rule issue even though it\u2019s now been delayed and may end up never being enacted who knows has driven a lot of interest in time and attendance. And so that\u2019s driven sales that I don\u2019t think somebody is going to necessarily get rid of that product, and in fact, it may keep kind of a heightened demand now. So I think that\u2019s how we feel about it is pretty good at this point and see what happens next.","James Berkley","That makes a lot of sense and thanks for the color on the ACA there. Those numbers are really helpful. Just one more quick follow-up here, more of a high-level question. Just correct me if I\u2019m wrong. I believe about 10% of your company\u2019s revenue is driven by the PEO business, another 10% from the ASO side. I think you got PEO growing more quickly over the last few years. Just curious if you could talk about how fast each is growing the trends that you\u2019ve seen, whether there has been an acceleration recently versus past quarters or past years and just going into more detail on each of those and what\u2019s driving the gap between the two growth rates?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So what we\u2019ve said about the HR outsourcing business is that, it\u2019s about half of HRS revenue and within that half about half is PEO and half is ASO. So that\u2019s what we said and we update that year. our PEO has been growing more quickly than ASO, but both have been growing double-digits. I guess, that\u2019s what we\u2019d say.","The only other thing I would add to that is that, because of the PEO, we report healthcare attachment as part of the revenues of the PEO when we get better healthcare attachment in the quarter than you have better PEO growth that really doesn\u2019t have much of an impact on margins. In this quarter, we did not have as significant healthcare attachments we had in the quarter before, but that bounces around every single quarter. So in Q3, we\u2019ll see where we end up.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we feel pretty good, obviously, reaching the new, the milestone of over a million worksite employees that we\u2019re servicing between our service \u2013 between the ASO and PEO. We feel good. We\u2019re very well-positioned. There\u2019s a lot of demand for the HR support. And I think PEO, while it\u2019s been strong in certain states and we sell it across the pretty much all states, it is starting to continue \u2013 it\u2019s continuing to pick up more demand and we feel good about the future of it.","As Efrain said, the attachment of the help can swing from kind of quarter-to-quarter or even month-to-month. But and again, I think, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see kind of what comes out of. Now, you had a quarter, where a lot of discussion about healthcare and you may have a number of clients deciding to kind of hold, wait and see what\u2019s going to happen, but we see good growth. We\u2019ve been doing well in both PEO and ASO, well-positioned to have both products.","So if you want co-employment, you have it. If you don\u2019t, we have the insurance agency that\u2019s a top agency and plenty of plans to offer. So feel good about both products right now.","James Berkley","Thanks a lot for your color and your time, and happy holidays.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks. Same to you.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Rayna Kumar","Good morning. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. In the first quarter, you really highlighted the strength in the mid-market and that seems to have slowed down a bit in the second quarter. I guess, what\u2019s changed there? And maybe if you can just highlight your expectations for the remainder of the year in the mid-market?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I think in the second quarter, we had a very, very strong quarter a year ago and compares were tougher. We expect that \u2013 we\u2019re expecting a good quarter in the third quarter. And I think, Marty pointed out something that\u2019s important. Last year, there was a drive by many mid-market companies to find integrated solutions that included an ACA compliance solution. A lot of those clients have now selected their solution and the game now is a bit more of competitive takeaway as opposed to selling them on a new solution. There obviously was some of that going on. So we go into third quarter then assuming that we\u2019ll pick up from where we were in Q2.","Martin Mucci","Yes, certainly feel great about the product and ever expanding functionality of the product. And I think, as Efrain said, last year was kind of a heightened second quarter with the Affordable Care Act sales, and this year, it\u2019s almost a little bit of the reverse. I think people are being a little careful to make any changes until they see what the rules come out, how it changes, and they\u2019re probably concerned about their filing and making a change and not getting everything filed.","So we saw a little bit probably unexpected a little bit slower there, and we expect though once we get past the filing date. So expect a good selling season here, but it may still continue to be a little bit slow through the third quarter until we get past the filing date. We\u2019ll have to see kind of how that shakes out. But we feel certainly good about the product, the competitiveness and going head-to-head with any of the competitors in the market.","Rayna Kumar","I guess, besides client behavior, are you seeing any change in the competitive landscape at all?","Martin Mucci","No, not really. No, there\u2019s no real new competitors there. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of change in their approach or product. And I think we\u2019ve, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve continued to add new options to our product and more self-service, more analytics that we\u2019ve talked about HR analytics and providing more there mobile-first design, so an increased use of mobile. So we\u2019re feeling very good, very competitive. We have not really seen any change from a competitive marketplace.","Rayna Kumar","Great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful, happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. Same to you.","Efrain Rivera","Same to you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi, Jim.","Jim Schneider","Good morning. Thanks. Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. As many \u2013 as I\u2019m sure, you saw the FIB put up some small business confidence indicators for the month of November, which were essentially stronger after the election than before. I guess, it sounds like from your overall kind of qualitative client commentary that people are still cautious pending any changes in the regulation. Can you give us any kind of additional color on what you\u2019ve been hearing from clients over the last month or month-and-a-half in terms of their optimism on overall business levels and how that kind of matches with your commentary on the rest of the business?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I think it\u2019s exactly, I think it\u2019s optimism, pending action. So I think it\u2019s a lot of optimism on lower corporate tax rates could drive a lot of less expense and more to what they could invest and more employees and so forth. Affordable Care Act looks like those costs could come down for a lot of companies and not forcing them to have the product, but we\u2019ll see. Time and attendance rules, although, it\u2019s a little bit separate, but less regulation, I think overall it\u2019s a very optimistic attitude from the clients, but not necessarily turning that into action yet, because they got to see it.","So they\u2019re feeling good about the fact that it looks like there\u2019s going to be a better business environment, consumer confidence is also up and FIB was one of the biggest increases we\u2019ve seen in over the 42-year average for one of the three times, I think, in the last to almost 10 years. So there\u2019s a lot of optimism.","But I don\u2019t think, again, they\u2019re turning that into action hiring and so forth, at least, yet until they see kind of what the first few months of the new administration brings. That\u2019s what we\u2019re kind of getting great optimism, but the small business index, at least, for November our last one would show still not a big uptick in hiring kind of at the same growth rate it was last year for, at least, small business. So very positive, but kind of waiting to see what happens.","Jim Schneider","That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, I think last quarter you cited the traction you\u2019re seeing in the 100 to 200 plus kind of segment and the new incremental sales spend you\u2019ve been putting against that. Can you talk about first of all whether there\u2019s any change or in that traction whether you\u2019re seeing continued momentum there? And whether you think the incremental sales spend you put against that is actually adequate at this point, such that, you don\u2019t have to increase it more in the coming quarters?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I don\u2019t think, I think we\u2019re adequate. We\u2019re fully staffed and feel very good about being fully staffed and out there. I think the only surprise in the quarter we\u2019ve kind of already mentioned, which is a little bit more in activity to make a change than we saw last year at this time. And I think that would be the only difference, and I think that\u2019s kind of more of a macro kind of issue.","And so I think that would be the only change. Certainly feel good about, as I mentioned, the competitiveness. No change really in the competitive environment, and we\u2019re fully staffed and gaining more and more experience on the newer reps that we added at the beginning of the fiscal year. So we\u2019ll be able to talk more about it after the selling season. The only real difference from first quarter, I would say is, with the election, which really change quite rapidly, at least, the view of the election and who won, I think that just put people in a little bit more cautious period for switching anything or making buying decisions in the second quarter.","Jim Schneider","That\u2019s fair. And just a quick clarification, if I could. In the quarter itself relative to the plan you had heading into the quarter, would you say that the DOL lack of bookings or the ACA shortfall was kind of the bigger contributor there?","Martin Mucci","Well, I don\u2019t \u2013 I think the ACA, I think just the election, if I\u2019m getting your question right, Jim, I think the question or the what happened was with the changes in ACA, with the President, with Trump getting in and probably a little bit more unexpected until second quarter as it got closer to the election, I think people know changes are going to happen. And so they\u2019re a little bit less, they\u2019re a little bit more reluctant to make a change until they see kind of what happens. They\u2019re optimistic, but they\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going to happen yet. And so if that answers your question of the deal.","If you\u2019re talking about the overtime rules, I think that was very helpful from an over \u2013 from a selling of our Flex Time and Flex Essentials and our Time clocks, and I think that\u2019s sticking. So the good thing there is, it brought a lot of attention to, you\u2019re to be tracking time, look at the options that are out there now from a technology standpoint, punching in and out on a mobile phone, things that have not been available generally until the last year or so.","And I think that\u2019s going to stick, so that actually helped drive some sales that are recorded in our HRS services revenue. And I think that\u2019s going to continue and it\u2019s going to stick no matter what happens with overtime rules.","Jim Schneider","Great. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, guys, good morning.","Martin Mucci","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Bisbee","There\u2019s quite a bit of demand about, how much you\u2019ll actually benefit in the short-term float? So I wanted to ask a two-part question to help frame that. The first one, as you think about the float, how you manage the float, is it still right, I know there\u2019s some seasonality, but to think that roughly half of the float balance is short-term stuff, whether it\u2019s money-markets, the variable demand rate notes et cetera, and you target about half in intermediate term bonds?","And the second question, if we look at that bond portfolio, I think, you said 3.3-year duration\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Yep.","Gary Bisbee","Is the stuff that\u2019s maturing in the next 12 months, are the interest rates that you would likely reinvest that in today above the rates of the stuff that\u2019s maturing, or is that still a negative at this point? Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Okay. Hey, good question. So, yes, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s \u2013 short-term is about 45%, can be sometimes 50, but we keep it between 45 and 50. So that reprices immediately or very quickly, I shouldn\u2019t say \u2013 should say. Let me just be careful, that\u2019s an overstatement. It doesn\u2019t reprice immediately. It typically reprices somewhere between 45 to 60 days. So the answer to the first question portfolio composition is yes. That\u2019s correct.","And then the second is yes, also. Yes, the bonds that we would invest in going forward currently have yields that are significantly higher than the ones that are rolling off. So if I were to call it today and I\u2019m not doing that, but if I were to call it today, and I assume no more Fed increases other than what we have gotten to this point, the portfolio would be about $8 million higher in value than it is today.","I just caution anyone from taking that to the bank, because we\u2019ll have much more granular information once we get through the next couple of quarters and see what the Fed actually does. And the reason why I say that is, we look at and we could give you a big forecast based on yield curves.","I distrust that approach. I\u2019d rather tell you what we think our portfolios will do based on what I know at the time I\u2019m saying it, but you can do some math. And the numbers start to get pretty significant, if the Fed does what it says it\u2019s going to do and the final qualification, I\u2019d add to that is the steepness of the yield curve also impacts how we invest.","So right now, they do nothing. I\u2019d call it at about $8 million next year, that\u2019s annualized, and we\u2019ll see where we go through the remainder of the year.","Gary Bisbee","And just to clarify that that\u2019s very helpful by the way. So the $8 million, that is annualizing and getting the full benefit from the Fed funds rate increase recently and also the benefit from reinvesting bonds at what the current yield curve is, is that correct?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, correct.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. And then just one other question. The \u2013 and maybe this is just getting too nitpicking on my end, but the buyback was pretty significant no increase in the guidance for earnings, it feels like there\u2019s a couple of pennies there, is that just conservatism or is there some other thing we should think about with that? Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I guess, I\u2019d say this, Gary. There\u2019s always pluses and minuses, so you have to look at what you think are potential upsides but potential downsides. And I think it\u2019s realistic, I wouldn\u2019t call it aggressive and I wouldn\u2019t call it conservative.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. And then just actually one other one. Have you done the analysis and maybe it\u2019s just, we don\u2019t know enough, but about what kind of risk you might face in terms of potential declines in the float portfolio balance is based on some of the personnel income tax changes that Trump and the Republican Congress have been floating? Should we think of that as a potential offset to some of this is the withholding might be less for a significant portion your customers? Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. We haven\u2019t started doing modeling at this point, because at that point the benefit, okay. So that\u2019s coupled with a more bigger a discussion about whether corporate tax rates go down. If that happens then even if we face some drag from personnel income taxes. The corporate tax impact simply dwarfs everything else.","So that that we\u2019d look at both. So if tax reform occurs, it\u2019s pretty obvious that we would be a pretty significant beneficiary by significant, I mean, very significant. So we\u2019re waiting to hear like everyone else is waiting to hear. So that\u2019s a partial answer to your question.","Gary Bisbee","Yes, great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Happy Holidays.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Gary.","Martin Mucci","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Just wanted \u2013 a couple clarifications just on HR Services. I think the street was looking for more like 14% revenue growth. I know the guide is 12% to 14% and it came in a little bit towards the lower-end, was there just want to make sure the puts and takes there is what I\u2019m thinking about obviously as Advance Partners acquisition is anniversarying and that contributed two points to growth. So then I\u2019m thinking about the back-half of the year with that coming off, do we have enough in the pipe and in sales to actually increase that growth rate for the back-half?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so Bryan, our guidance obviously included Advance. We came out of the first quarter, I think, we\u2019re at 15% growth. I think I called out attach rates on healthcare in the PEO were a little bit lower than we had projected. That can reverse very, very quickly quarter-to-quarter, so we\u2019ll see where we are in Q3. But in terms of where we expect the year to be, we are not really far off from what we expected.","So I see where people might get to 14%. I don\u2019t think our internal plans suggest we be at 14%. And so we should be solidly in the year in the range of the guidance that we provided. And obviously, as you pointed out, the selling season will have an impact on where HRS growth ends up for the year, but we feel comfortable with the range as we\u2019ve given.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And then in the back-half since Advance will be now in the numbers that won\u2019t probably push that growth rate, should we think about more towards the lower-end then in that range of 12% to 14% for the back-half as a result of Advance anniversary?","Efrain Rivera","I would say, yes, subject to whatever we see in terms of sales in Q \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, in the third quarter, which is where the bulk of the selling season comes in. I would say that, although, I didn\u2019t call out where we end up in Q4, our guidance is for the year as a whole and we feel comfortable for the year as a whole that may not be that or that may be that some quarters aren\u2019t exactly in the range of the guidance. So if it\u2019s significant, we\u2019ll call it out.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. And then just time and attendance, how big is that and how fast has that been growing? I know it\u2019s been a \u2013 one of the catalyst that you guys have called out just how big is that as a percentage of revenue and maybe the growth rates you guys have been seeing there?","Efrain Rivera","So last time we updated it, it\u2019s about \u2013 it was about last year about 10%, I should say, online services, which includes HR Administration, which is also part of the equation back up a second. So it\u2019s clear the fundamental parts of the HCM platform include an HR Administration module with time and attendance module and obviously a payroll engine module. So about 10% of HRS revenue growth \u2013 revenue is online services. We don\u2019t break it out more than that. That\u2019s been growing at multiples with what payroll has been growing at.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Thanks so much and happy holidays, guys.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Bryan.","Martin Mucci","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Sir, your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Hey, good morning, Marty. Good morning, Efrain. Yes, Efrain, I just want to make sure I understood something you said about the float portfolio. I think you said, obviously, if the rates kin of \u2013 the Fed did nothing, it would be about $8 million. I seem to remember, I thought in the queue you said a 25 basis points would mean after-tax net income of $3.5 million to $4 million.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Kartik Mehta","And so that $8 million, is there some tax impact to that, that would be different, or did I \u2013 am I missing something that you might have said or misinterpreting?","Efrain Rivera","No, no, you\u2019re just missing some information, so which I didn\u2019t provide in my estimate. So our disclosure is that a 25 basis point rise impacts the portfolio immediately on an annualized basis to the tune of about $3.5 million, $3.7 million, I believe it is. But that doesn\u2019t end the conversation, because then the question you have to ask yourself is, what does it do to long-term rates?","If in the end, your reinvestment for long-term rates stays the same, it\u2019s done nothing. You\u2019ve gotten a benefit on the short-term portion of the portfolio, but very little else. The benefit we\u2019re getting right now and I \u2013 the reason why I caution about including any interest rate benefit in models yet is that the securities that we invest in intermediate term municipals have gone up pretty significantly since the election, so our reinvestment rate is higher than it is right now.","So if all we got was a 3.5 basis point, I\u2019m sorry, a 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate. You could expect that we would get roughly what we say we would get. But we\u2019re also getting a bit of a benefit on the long-term portion of the portfolio. And what I don\u2019t know now and I\u2019ll have a better sense is that, the Fed keeps raising interest rates. What\u2019s happening to the shape of that yield curve as I go out over the maturities that we have to reinvest.","So right now, if everything held, I\u2019d be about \u2013 on an annualized basis about $8 million higher. What it will end up being, I don\u2019t know until I get to the spring and I can digest the other Fed rate increases.","Kartik Mehta","Okay. That makes sense. So, I guess, Efrain, will you invest a little bit differently considering the Fed might do a couple of more rate increases, so will the philosophy change at all, or will you still continue to manage the portfolio like you have?","Efrain Rivera","That is a discussion that we\u2019re going to have as we get into the spring, because if the shape of the yield curve is steep around the long end, then maybe I have a less short-term cash, and I have more long. I haven\u2019t made that decision and we haven\u2019t had that discussion yet.","We\u2019ve had some preliminary conversations about how we would do that, but obviously that would be one way to get higher yield even than what I\u2019m talking about on the portfolio, those are decisions that we need to look at when we get into the spring. Obviously, competitors leverage 100%. We\u2019d never \u2013 we\u2019ve chosen not to do that. But between where we are and where other people in the market are, there is room to move if we chose to do so.","Kartik Mehta","And, Marty, as you\u2019re going into the selling season, how many payroll salespeople do you have compared to last year, is it same, less or more than you\u2019ve had last year at this time?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, up 2% or 3% from a headcount perspective and fully staffed. And I think just getting those reps up to speed, but we\u2019re up about 2% or 3%, which is fairly normal for us and it\u2019s kind of across both small and mid-market.","Kartik Mehta","And where do you stand in terms of salespeople attrition today compared to what it has been in the past?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, a very consistent, as some are better than others. Actually some of the mid-market, I think, tends to be a little bit better than it has been historically even, and core payroll tend to be very consistent with or it\u2019s been, no big uptick in turnover anything.","Kartik Mehta","And just one last question, Marty, you moved over to Flex, obviously, the transition seems to be going well. Have you seen an impact on cross sales because of customers moving to Flex either more or less in terms of product sales?","Martin Mucci","Yes. Well, obviously, from a Flex standpoint, you\u2019ve got a better integration there and we\u2019ve built everything to integrate into that and then continue to roll things out with Flex, so we\u2019re certainly seeing better pick up from a penetration. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s huge, but it certainly is a bigger pick up in penetration when you\u2019re selling the Flex platform, because everything is built around that, so and we still have a lot of room to grow there.","So when you think of the HR analytics that we just rolled out kind of at HR Tech and some of the other products like just rolling out Flex Essentials, which is that kind of lower-end time and attendance solution without clocks, all of that is around Flex. So we expect to have better penetration growth because of the Flex platform and the more we roll it out to clients.","Kartik Mehta","Okay. Hey, thank you very much Efrain and Marty.","Martin Mucci","Okay, thanks.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, happy holidays.","Kartik Mehta","Same to you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Tim McHugh with William Blair. Sir, your line is open.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. Hi, guys. Just want to ask digging back on to the comment about seeing, I guess, a trend towards a smaller average client size. You\u2019ve talked a little bit about various parts of this, but just to be clear, are you seeing, I guess, slower growth in the middle market and that\u2019s why the average is skewing down or faster growth in small, or I guess, peel back for us why the average is trending smaller than it was in the past?","Efrain Rivera","I\u2019d say this, Tim, that right now the relative growth between small is tilting a little bit more towards small versus mid and last year, it was tending a little bit more \u2013 trending a little bit more mid than small. So I think that\u2019s what it is.","Look, I could also talk about losses and sales, but when you net it all out, that\u2019s basically what you\u2019re seeing. And by the way, I just want to make it clear, our average client size has been 17 for the last 10 years, it\u2019s not a dramatic difference, but a 10 or 15 basis points there does make a difference.","Martin Mucci","Yes, not a huge change, but as Efrain said, it makes a difference. But I think the point we made earlier both Efrain and I think, last quarter, Tim, what we saw was, there was more movement in the mid-market because of Affordable Care Act and the need. That got people to change and sell more. This one has been compared to last quarter that need has kind of been satisfied by those who have it.","And while we\u2019re holding certainly the clients we have with Affordable Care Act products, we\u2019re not seeing the interest in saying, okay, I want to change, because I have to have something in place. So we saw a little bit of a shift second quarter over second quarter and again, it\u2019s not a huge number, but it did drop the average size a little bit.","Tim McHugh","Okay. So it\u2019s fair. It seems like middle market because of that comp issue isn\u2019t \u2013 probably isn\u2019t growing as fast, is small necessarily growing faster, or is it just it\u2019s growing at the same rate and you\u2019re not seeing quite as much growth in middle market and feel that average is, that brings the average down?","Efrain Rivera","Small is growing faster.","Tim McHugh","Faster than it was before?","Efrain Rivera","It\u2019s growing faster","Tim McHugh","Okay. Just when you say faster, sorry, just faster than middle market, or are you saying faster than in the past?","Efrain Rivera","It\u2019s growing faster than middle market. I would say, it\u2019s pretty comparable to where we were a year or so ago.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. What was the \u2013 last, can you give us \u2013 give remind us of the split between middle market and small, I guess, in that payroll part of it?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, we don\u2019t give the actual payroll dollars associated with it. It\u2019s complicated and the reason we all do that is a lot of ancillaries are primarily mid-market clients. Our client base in the mid-market is about a little bit over 6% of our total clients. And you can assume that the from a revenue standpoint, that\u2019s three to four times what our client base is, if that helps.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thank you.","Efrain Rivera","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I know it\u2019s late, I just have a quick one. Efrain, you mentioned that if corporate tax rates go down, you think you\u2019d be, I think you used the word significant beneficiary. Can you just remind us right now roughly what your federal tax rate is?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Our federal tax is about 33% and we obviously pay pretty close to the statutory rate. It depends on whose estimate you\u2019re looking at. And if you\u2019re down in 20% corporate tax rate, we are a significant beneficiary but even 5 to 10 point decrease would create significant benefits for us.","Jeff Silber","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much.","Efrain Rivera","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Glenn Greene","Thank you. Good morning. Just a few clarifications on previous commentary but maybe Marty going back to the sales activity, horning in on your comment little bit more inactivity or less slower mix, your buying decisions and switching, is that how you\u2019re contemplating the upcoming obviously key selling season, meaning the factor is that the new administration we are not going to know the new rules or and whatever they may do is not going to known really until the end of the selling season. So are you sort of preparing for a difficult sales season?","Martin Mucci","Well, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s difficult. I just say \u2013 this was compared really to last year, so we saw more activity. So we\u2019re \u2013 I mean, we\u2019re expecting a pretty good selling season, but it was certainly a little bit slower in Q2 than it was last year. Even though things are known, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 last year we had a lot of sales, we had more mid market sales in the second quarter because they had to get, they had to make some change to get the Affordable Care Act product.","By this point, most of those had bought it by November when you think about last year because they had to get in and actually many of us stopped selling it after November because we had to get them taking care for the calendar year. So I wouldn\u2019t say we are expecting a difficult sales season but they may be a little bit more inactivity than we saw last year. But I would expect most of that was in Q2 last year.","Glenn Greene","Okay. Efrain, on the buyback, I think it\u2019s pretty clear but the uptick in the buyback the 2.9 million shares this quarter, we shouldn\u2019t be thinking any change in your buyback mentality rest assure more just to get the share count closer to where it was a year ago is what I was hearing.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. That\u2019s right Glenn. That\u2019s where we are in.","Glenn Greene","And then just to clarify on the ACA obviously a risk and you sort of identified what the risk could be, but what\u2019s the order of magnitude? What percentage of revenue ACA is right now?","Efrain Rivera","I think I was asked this last year so I\u2019m going to call it direct ACA revenue is in a little bit above between 1% and 1.5% of revenue.","Glenn Greene","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open.","Rick Eskelsen","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one clarify from the release and your comments, I noticed you didn\u2019t mention anything about the operating income excluding float, have you changed how you\u2019re thinking about operating margin and operating income here?","Efrain Rivera","Not really. I think you can basically do much of the math yourselves and because float is no longer a drag. It\u2019s probably more useful to just look at it in totality.","Rick Eskelsen","Thanks. And then just the next one, Marty, you did mention about regulatory changes, do you see it as a benefit for the business overall? I guess if you could just talk about the components of your business and where you saw the most, from client perspective, where they did more on the regulatory driven work? Did it drive more people to do PEO or ASO? Did it drive more bundles? Was there any split within the business on the regulatory pressure and what it drove clients to do? Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Sure. I think first, I think I would say overtime \u2013 the overtime rules they have now of course been postponed at least temporarily. That drove certainly a lot more interest from clients in time and attendance solution. So that\u2019s been helpful to get in front of clients and offer them a great timing for us in the product suite that we have. So that drove a lot of interest and frankly still I think it geared up a lot of interest that whether the overtime rules going to affect or not I think it\u2019s going to be a plus for us.","When you start talking about overtime rules that also drags in HR, so whether it was ASO or PEO, that brought a lot of interest in HR support. So companies that would have said, hey, I\u2019m going to continue to try to deal with the HR myself internally, now said jeez I think with all these overtime rules who is exempted, who isn\u2019t a lot more discussion about moving people to exempt doing that based on the overtime rules brought in some HR sales as well both on the ASO and PEO platform. And then I think a little bit probably of a drag might have been the fact that okay, now the Affordable Care Act as we\u2019ve said is up in the air, but what\u2019s going to happen? Maybe I don\u2019t rush to buy as much from an insurance or a PEO side do I need it or not. So I think those were the major changes.","I think right now what we expect is less regulation based on the platforms of the Trump administration but I think there still going to be an enough change that those things will still help us. And in fact just the level of change makes people worry about can they keep up with everything. If the tax rates change, if the rules change and maybe when to file, if overtime is in or out, that all drives people to say, okay, I can\u2019t keep up with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to an outsourcer like Paychex who has over 200 people who just track compliance and realize what has to happen and so forth. So I think those have been the pluses and minuses.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Efrain Rivera","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.","David Ridley-Lane","Good morning. In the discussion around average client size, I didn\u2019t hear you mention should payroll, is that a piece that\u2019s also having a potential drag on the average client size?","Efrain Rivera","So payroll is part of the equation. It\u2019s been part of the equation in the last five years. They continue to do well. So that\u2019s part of the mix of what we sell. So we sell through payroll, we sell obviously through our Paychex\u2019s outsource service and we also sell midmarket, so that\u2019s part of the mix.","David Ridley-Lane","Understood. And then if you\u2019ve \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019ve fully staffed up on sales headcount. I assume you preset an operation, should we be expecting a bit stronger margin expansion in the second half of this fiscal year?","Efrain Rivera","No because the first part of the statement David is correct. So we are fully staffed and operations expenses year-over-year were up pretty significantly in the quarter, we called out some reasons for that, that compare gets a little bit easier as we go through the remainder of the year.","But remember that expenses in Q3 and in Q4 but Q3 particularly increased because of the volume of operations activity that we have and also the volume of sales activity that we have. So no in the back half of the year, you see our financials the margin actually goes down and that\u2019s typical of our pattern.","David Ridley-Lane","I guess I was thinking more of an margins on a year-over-year basis?","Efrain Rivera","On a year-over-year basis.","David Ridley-Lane","Yes, sorry.","Efrain Rivera","We feel comfortable with the guidance and obviously we\u2019re running actually little bit ahead of it in the first half but comfortable where we are in terms of margins at this point.","David Ridley-Lane","Understood. Thank you very much.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Sir, your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Happy holidays, Efrain and Marty.","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Mark.","Martin Mucci","Thanks, Mark. Same to you.","Mark Marcon","Couple of quick questions. First one, with regards to the general environment that you\u2019re seeing in the small business arena, what do you see in terms of new business start-ups in terms of trickling up from the field source of new clients? And then what are you seeing in terms of bankruptcies and how that seems to be trending?","Martin Mucci","On new business start-ups, I think they\u2019ve reached back to that level and that they were pre-recession. We\u2019ve seen that now for probably a year and I think they\u2019ve held everything that we\u2019ve seen would say, they\u2019re not growing tremendously more than that but they\u2019re right in that place where they were. Bankruptcies generally pretty consistent where they have been, maybe up a little at least what we\u2019ve seen. What we see is from our losses to bankruptcies and out of business, and that picked up slightly but again our overall retention is very consistent with where it\u2019s been, at pretty record high levels pretty consistent in that range.","So no big change there but a little bit tick up in the bankruptcies, which is interesting. It doesn\u2019t seem like that should happen but we\u2019ve seen a few more losses because of that, nothing that would change our overall number.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And then with regards to you had great improvement with regards to Flex as it relates to the smaller end of the market, from a technology perspective, can you lay out any additional improvements that we should expect out of the 50 to 1,000 range in terms of what you are offering there?","Martin Mucci","Okay. I think you will continue to see that level of integration and you\u2019ll see a big continued push on few things. One is the analytics piece that we just talked about at HR Tech much more on the analytics both in the way we report the data and in the flexibility the client has. The other will be continue to be a mobile first design and we are seeing a good uptick in mobile usage, as I\u2019ve mentioned before not only the client but from the employee standpoint.","So we are spending a lot of time adjusting our language and our display much more now \u2013 pretty much over 99% of the display is HTML5 so it\u2019s a much cleaner and easier use for the client, much more flexible for the client and the employees on mobile use but we\u2019ve stuck our long ways to go on mobile adoption so getting the client and their employees to download the app and use it. It\u2019s growing fast but we still got a long way to go and I think that\u2019s going to be big part of assisting in the value of our products and services. A full suite is there and we are constantly adding to it like the new Flex Time Essentials and you\u2019ll see a lot more paperless.","So everything pretty much can be paperless today right even PEO on boarding now is all paperless function. So I think you will continue to see us add to the functionality and even in time and attendance we are adding new modules all the time. So a budgeting module we just added where you will be able to track your time to your budget and so forth. So you\u2019re going to continue to see not only the products expand but the modules within each distinct product.","Mark Marcon","That\u2019s great. And I mean is there going to be a step function Marty in terms of by the end of calendar 2017 we should see, we did have step functions on the smaller side that were some real benchmarks that we ended up fitting. Do we see something similar to that coming up?","Martin Mucci","You mean a benchmark from a penetration standpoint or?","Mark Marcon","Right.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think so. Although it\u2019s much more gradual now like \u2013 the number of the clients are on Flex. I think we certainly have internal goals as to where we want that penetration to be including mobile adoption. So you will see more marketing push mobile adoption. You\u2019ll see more direct \u2013 I think trying to get the employees of the clients and more marketing from that standpoint.","So we don\u2019t really disclose it but we certainly internally have our steps that we want to get to our different goals by year for penetration of those products. And I think right now we are on track I think even a little ahead on time and attendance because of the overtime rules.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then on the PEO, you basically mentioned that that\u2019s going a little bit faster than ASO and it sounds like the momentum continue to be very good and at that same time we have a bit of a pause with regards to the regulatory uncertainty because of the administration change. But it didn\u2019t sound like your commentary would suggest that you would expect any sort of slow down on the just the core PEO, did I interpret that correctly?","Martin Mucci","I think so. Yes, we\u2019ve seen that pretty consistent growth from the PEO standpoint and I think we feel very good about the career plans we\u2019re offering now and the work with the careers. And so, yes, I don\u2019t think that will necessarily slow down.","We\u2019ve just seen that inactivity, a little bit of slowness in making a change in some clients who already have it but I think you\u2019ll see and even with more certification and things that are going on in that industry I think you could see a pick up there and there is no real change in competition. We haven\u2019t seen any real change from any of the competitors from the PEO standpoint. So if you have good plans, great HR service and support and good career plans, insurance plans, we should continue to see good double digit growth there.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then with regards to your sales people and particularly some of your eliminate who may have left, are you seeing some come back?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I guess some. I wouldn\u2019t say any major thing. We certainly have seen where people might jump to a competitor. We\u2019ve seen a few of those come back. I wouldn\u2019t say anything in large number but really with the attrition as I mentioned earlier, the turnover has been pretty consistent so we haven\u2019t seen any uptick in turnover and I think \u2013 there isn\u2019t many major exodus for anybody to come back. Yes, some come back but not too many.","Mark Marcon","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Happy holidays.","Martin Mucci","Thanks, Mark. Same to you.","Mark Marcon","Hey, could I ask one more, Marty? I forgot.","Martin Mucci","Sure.","Mark Marcon","Just on the tax filing float, to what percentage of the tax filing float is actually due to the tax withholdings for federal and state income taxes relative to things like SUTA and things of that nature?","Martin Mucci","Well, Mark, that\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s primarily federal and state, SUTA does have an impact, but the bigger impact is federal and state.","Mark Marcon","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Mr. Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Sir, your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you. Hi, Mark and Efrain, happy holidays from me as well.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Considering I\u2019m standing between you guys and the holiday party, let me hurry up with the questions. So M&A pipeline, you mentioned healthy M&A pipeline, is it possible to potentially qualify that? Is it going to be more what I\u2019d consider distribution, things like advance partners, staffing, outsourcing or more product?","Martin Mucci","I would say little bit of both, but probably less product these days and more expansion of what we have. So certainly payroll PEO, other off suites of what \u2013 we like the Advance Partners, obviously that\u2019s been very good acquisition for us, good team there and there is some opportunities there as well in that industry.","And so I would say across the board probably a little bit less product, but there is some product things we still want to do but we\u2019ve pretty much build those \u2013 the majority of those tuck in type opportunities, mostly what we are looking for now and different geographies obviously as well. We are always looking particularly in Western Europe for opportunities as well and so I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little bit across the board.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And then if taxes go down as they\u2019re expected to, would you expect to look for investment alternative other than you do a lot of treasury in muni, so the muni part\u2026","Martin Mucci","Right, Ashwin. Good point. Yes, so open the universe up to other class of assets that we wouldn\u2019t think about as much today.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Any initial thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about that?","Martin Mucci","Yes, obviously you look at taxables a lot more than we do today. So we begun to have some of those conversations without getting too presumptuous about what\u2019s going to happen with respect to taxes?","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay, got it. And some helpful clients have typically grown in the mid 20-ish type of range sequentially into the Feb quarter with bonuses and so on. Would you expect that to be fairly consistent this year?","Martin Mucci","I think the pattern should be fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in prior years.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. Last quick question, the DOL rule timing, what was the specific assumption you are already making in the outlook for this or whether it\u2019s not in the outlook so it doesn\u2019t matter?","Martin Mucci","There is no real specific assumption there.

I'd now like to turn today's meeting over to President and CEO, Martin Mucci. Thank you, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Melinda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of Paychex's first quarter fiscal 2013 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","Yesterday afternoon, after the market closed, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2012, and filed our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter. These are available by accessing our Investor Relations page at www.paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available for our website -- on our website for approximately 1 month.","Our today's call, I will review highlights for the first quarter in our operations, sales and product development areas, Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. Then we'll open it up to your questions.","We are focused on driving growth in revenue and profits while providing industry-leading service and technology solutions to our clients and their employees. We had a good start to fiscal '13, with the first quarter results meeting our expectations. Our client base, checks per client and client retention results all improved. Year-over-year growth metrics for Q1 were moderated by the volume and frequency of payroll processing. Efrain will go into more detail on the financial results and comparisons. However, I'd like to provide you with some highlights for the quarter.","Our checks per payroll has improved for 10 consecutive quarters, with the first quarter growth at 2%. As expected, this growth moderated from the 2.4% growth experienced in the prior year first quarter, but was still at a 2% rate in Q1. Payroll client retention remained strong. In fiscal 2012, we saw client retention return to near historic levels, and our first quarter has us on track to another strong year of retention and historic results.","Execution and operations remain solid as evidenced by exceptionally strong client satisfaction results. Moreover, we began measuring net promoter scores last year, and our initial results place us among industry leaders. It is our exceptional client service, breadth of products, along with our technology, that really sets us apart from our competitors.","We also continue to see improving sales execution in the quarter. As planned, we expanded the number of territories and have placed new focus on franchise and banking opportunities, among others. We expect to see additional penetration of our products and services within our client base with the goal of increasing our share of revenue from our clients. Our SurePayroll business also continued to do well in Q1.","During our July Investor Day, we reviewed our plans for sales channel segmentation. Those plans are well underway, and this month, we launched the wholesale 401(k) sales force solely focused on building relationships with financial advisors and plan sponsors. We will be helping financial advisors create client opportunities to build their retirement plan businesses and also provide quality retirement plan expertise.","In addition, in the Retirement Services area, we recently added Dimensional Fund Advisors to our Paychex's Open Fund Select and Advisor Select platforms. These funds are highly respected in the financial advisor community. We are pleased to be able to offer them to our clients as part of their 401(k) plans. We remain very proud of the fact that we are the leader in the 401(k) recordkeeping marketplace again this year.","Over the last year, we introduced enhancements to our Paychex online and mobile applications, with single sign-on to reach all product information efficiently and effectively on tablet, iPad and smartphone applications, smartphone just released last June. These applications have been well-received and continue to gain traction. They offer diverse capabilities for both employer and the employee on-the-go.","From a technology perspective, progress continues on integrating our leading technology in our world-class customer service through the Paychex Next Generation application suite. Next month, we will be introducing new, best-in-class online reporting services for our clients and CPAs.","In sum, we are off to a solid start for fiscal 2013. I'm pleased with all of the work of the Paychex employees across the country. And as Efrain will discuss next, we have reaffirmed our financial expectations and guidance for the full year.","I will now turn over the call to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Let me start out by saying that you should be aware that certain written and oral statements made by management constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements should be evaluated in light of certain risk factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. Please review the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements in the press release for our discussion of forward-looking statements and the related risk factors.","As Marty indicated, our first quarter results for fiscal 2013 met our expectations and represented a solid start to the year. As we previously indicated, we expected growth rates to moderate due to tough comparisons to the first quarter of last year.","In Q1 of fiscal 2012, we benefited from a number of factors, which included higher volume and frequency of payroll processing in the same period last year due primarily to timing. We estimate that this impacted our growth rate by approximately 1.5% in our payroll services business. We also had stronger checks per payroll.","In the HRS business, we had higher asset fees from Retirement Services funds held; higher worksite employees in the PEO business; and we had the ramp up of sales of our HR Essentials product, including some timing also of payroll processing in that business. The absence or moderation of these factors impacted our first quarter comparisons this year.","Now let me talk about some of the key highlights for the quarter, and I'll go into greater detail in certain of these areas. Total service revenue and total revenue grew 3% in the first quarter. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 9% to $10 million, impacted by the low interest rate environment. Expenses increased moderately for the first quarter as a result of excellent expense control. We continued to invest at a higher rate in product development and supporting technology, but this was partially offset by increased productivity within operations, which allowed us to maintain solid operating margins.","Our operating income, net of certain items, increased 4% to $228 million. Typically, our first quarter reflects the highest operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of total revenue in a given fiscal year. Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue over the remaining quarters is expected to be more consistent with our full year guidance as we continue planned investments during the balance of the year. Net income increased 3% to $153 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 2% to $0.42 per share.","Now let me talk about payroll revenue in a little bit more detail. It increased 1% for the first quarter to $386 million. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check. As Marty already mentioned, our checks per payroll continued to improve, increasing 2% compared to the same period last year. This reflects a moderation in last year's rate of growth in the first quarter, which was 2.4%.","Revenue per check increased as a result of price increases, partially offset by some discounting. Our growth rate, as I mentioned previously, was moderated by the impact of higher volume and frequency of payroll processing in the same period last year. This was due to timing. And as I mentioned previously, we estimate that this impacted our growth in payroll services by approximately 1.5%. This is a trend that tends to occur to us periodically based on how our clients' processing days, either weekly, biweekly or monthly, fall within the quarter-end calendar.","Let me turn to HRS. Human Resources Services revenue increased 7% to $182 million for the first quarter. Our first quarter HRS revenue growth reflected favorable trends in checks per payroll, price increases and client growth. Some highlights of the contributions to HRS revenue growth include the following.","HRS was positively impacted by checks per payroll, price increases and growth in both clients and client employees. The rate of growth was tempered by lower client employees within our PEO and some effect of HRS product mix. Insurance service revenue grew more than 20%, with continued advances in both workers' compensation insurance and health and benefit services during the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Health and benefit services revenue continued its strong growth, driven by an increase in the number of applicants, while workers' comp insurance delivered increases in both clients and in premium.","Retirement Services revenue benefited from client growth and an increase in the average asset value of Retirement Services client employees' funds. This was partially offset by the impact from a shift in the mix of assets within these funds to investments earning lower fees from external managers. HRS revenue quarterly growth can vary through the volume of clients, PEO workers' compensation and basis points earned on Retirement Services client employees' funds. Basis points change due to fluctuation in the financial markets and the asset value of funds invested. PEO net service revenue also did its greater variability between quarters due to a number of factors including changes in workers' compensation claims experienced.","Now turning to our investment portfolio, we maintained a fairly conservative investment policy. Our primary goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. Our priority has been and will continue to be to ensure that we can meet all of our cash commitments to clients.","On the short-term side of our -- on the short-term side, our primary investment vehicle is high-quality variable rate demand notes and FDIC-insured deposit accounts. In our longer-term portfolio, we continue to invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds. The interest rate environment remains at historically low levels, and our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for the first quarter compared to 1.3% for the same period last year.","Interest on funds held for clients decreased 9% to $10 million for the first quarter. And this decrease was driven by the decline in the average rate of return on this portfolio to 1.3%, partially offset by a 1% increase in average balances. Our average rate of return this quarter was also impacted by our allocation of investments to a greater percentage in tax-exempt securities within our short-term portfolio. As our interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income are reported before taxes, the return appears lower on average with a greater mix of tax-exempt investments.","Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased 1%. The increase was the result of favorable trends in checks per payroll and payroll tax administration clients, offset somewhat by calendar impacts. The first quarter last year reflected strong growth in average balances due to the inclusion of SurePayroll client funds and favorable impacts from State Unemployment Insurance and checks per payroll. Our investment income increased 30% to $1.9 million. This was mainly due to higher average investment balances resulting from investing the cash generated from operations.","I will now walk you through highlights of our financial position. Our financial position remains strong, with cash and total corporate investments of $871 million as of August 31 and no debt. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter is somewhat magnified due to the timing of quarterly income tax payments. And our first quarter payment was due September 15 for approximately $70 million.","Funds held for clients as of August were $3.7 billion compared to $4.5 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and average $3.3 billion for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 1%. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $59 million as of August 31, 2012, compared with net unrealized gains of $60 million as of the end of May 2012.","Total stockholder equity was $1.7 billion as of August 31, reflecting $160 million of dividends paid during the first quarter, a return on equity for the past 12 months was 34%. Cash flows from operations were $218 million for the first quarter, a 16% increase compared to prior year. The increase was driven primarily by timing related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities and also higher net income, net of noncash adjustments.","Let me talk a bit about guidance for the remainder of the year. As Marty indicated, we are reiterating guidance for fiscal 2013, which we presented to you in June. I'd like to remain -- remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our payroll revenue growth is based on anticipated client base growth and modest increases in revenue per check, offset by some moderation in growth in checks per payroll. Our HRS revenue growth is expected to be in line with recent historical experience. We anticipate minimal impact from prior acquisitions.","Operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 37%. This is obviously lower than what we achieved in the first quarter, but as I previously mentioned, our first quarter tends to be our highest-margin quarter for the year. We don't expect the expense leveraging realized in the first quarter to continue throughout fiscal 2013 as we continue planned investments in technology innovation. We do anticipate an increase in percentage of tax-exempt investment in our short-term portfolio.","Martin Mucci","Okay, thank you, Efrain. Operator, we'd now like to open the meeting to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Kartik Mehta, Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Marty, I wanted to ask you just about new sales and where they are in consideration to your expectations. And the second part of that, have you seen any change in channels where you're getting your new sales?","Martin Mucci","I think, Kartik, we feel good about the first quarter. We're off to a good start. We don't give a lot of detail until we get past the selling season. But I would say that we feel good about a good start, and I think we're driving more revenue per client. So not only getting good revenue from the clients coming in on payroll, but also driving more of the HRS services. So we're feeling good about that. Regarding the channels, we -- in the Investor Day, we talked about market segmentation and feel very good of the fact that we're well on our way. We've introduced all of the plans that we had put in place last year strategically for market segmentation. Market segmentation was about kind of refining our approach to all the different channels. In payroll, we went after very specific segment and split that up. That's going very well. In 401(k), it was going after larger. And the wholesale market, which we just introduced that sales force, they're now all getting licensed and is all been approved and they're out there. And we went after the franchise and banking business. And we signed one of the largest franchises in the country already to an agreement as a preferred provider of payroll. So we feel we're off to good start that'll keep us on with the guidance.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just a final question, Marty, Paychex has been amazingly good at controlling expenses where you don't let your expenses get out of control considering revenue growth. But do you think in this -- during this environment, is there a need to maybe invest more now so you can have greater revenue growth going forward? Or are you pretty happy with the way investments are and there's really no reason to increase those investments?","Martin Mucci","Well, yes, we feel very good about the investments we're making. As Efrain and I have talked about a number of times, the IT and the product development has been up double-digit percent for 2 or 3 years now, and we feel very good about that. That's been the right investments. And obviously, we've been bearing the fruits of that with the new technology and what you'll see next month as we roll out the new and probably, I think, the best in the industry online reporting suite. And so I think that investment has been good. And the productivity from the operations team has been important that, that continues to help us fuel the IT and development investment while still gaining great margins that we're known for. So I feel very good about the level of expense. Efrain, anything? No? Okay.","Operator","Next question from Joseph Foresi, Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","My first question is just taking a look at sort of your comments again, just revisiting about the new business growth, are you tracking in line with plan, ahead of plan? And then any impact at -- or any thoughts on what could take place here with the election on the demand front?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think on new business growth, I think, it's -- we've about met expectations. So I think we still see kind of a gradually improving economy, no great shakes, but it has met our expectations and we're pleased with that. And I think, where we feel really good is that the revenue we're driving per client has certainly met our expectations or even a little bit better. So we're feeling good about that first quarter start.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then on the elections, any change you think of the demand environment post or pre?","Martin Mucci","Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, I don't -- I think it has probably slowed some new business development, I think new growth. But that's just speculation. I think that whenever there's an election coming up and certainly the fiscal clip on taxes and health care reform changes, it is all kind of holding businesses back a little bit from investing if they're on the edge of whether to start their business or not. So and I think there's pluses and minuses to either way the election goes. With more regulation, our services are more in demand. But with more regulation and taxes, I think, fewer new businesses start up. So we'll make the best of it either way, and we feel good about the year at this point.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the margin outlook, obviously, you've given guidance there. Is it fair to say that margins are being held back a little bit here by some of the investment you're doing on the technology side? And can you give us some time frame for when you would expect them to sort of start to expand again?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So I guess, Joe, what I'd say is, first, the rate of spend on IT investment is what we planned. It's moderated a little bit from prior years. So it's not holding back margins. That's not the only area where we obviously spend money. So we'll see some expansion. We just didn't want to call it any higher than we did in the guidance as we go through the year. So I don't think we're being constrained in terms of margin expansion by the level of spend we're doing.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one for me. Just on the demand environment itself, are you seeing any shifts in market share win rates and any which way?","Martin Mucci","No, not really. We're seeing the competitive environment's about the same and including the pricing and so forth, think it's always been pretty healthy, and we haven't really seen any change plus or minus for that.","Operator","Next question from Glenn Greene, Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess, the first question, just going -- looking at the payroll services growth, and it sounded like there was 150-basis-point drag from the year-over-year comparison.","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","It might be helpful. So just to understand that, first of all and then there's a follow-up. But does that suggest that there were more processing days in the year-ago quarter?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, in my comments, what I said was that we have 3 principal frequencies of payroll processing: weekly, semimonthly\/biweekly and monthly. It looks like on the semiweekly -- semimonthly\/biweekly, we had -- we caught a little bit more activity in the prior-year quarter. That's basically what ended up. It will even out.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. So no changes to your confidence to deliver on the 3% to 4% for the year?","Efrain Rivera","Oh, no, no. I just want to reiterate something, Glenn, if Marty and I have not said it enough. Any plan, of course, involves risks. And there's a chance that you won't hit it. However, Q1 came in as we expected it to come in. So we planned -- we knew this. We knew it, frankly, 6 months ago. So there was no surprise to us.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a clarification on the relative -- the pricing commentary, the revenue per check and the pricing increase and then there was increase in discounts. So I guess what I'm getting at is the net pricing, net of the discounts, how is that tracking relative to recent quarters, even relative to a year ago?","Efrain Rivera","It's tracking pretty comparable to what our expectations were.","Martin Mucci","Yes. Yes, very close to what we've seen in the past. So that's why we don't really see where the -- the competition, that kind of thing, the pricing impact has not changed much at all. And still it's pretty much the same. It was as expected.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then just as a final one. Any change from a macro perspective in new business formation?","Efrain Rivera","It's interesting. If you look at the BLS data that was available in August for the full year 2011, you had 758,000 businesses formed versus 742,000 the year before. I mean, business formation is just dragging ahead slowly. It's getting a little bit better. It's certain we still are not in an optimal environment, that 758,000 still compares to 844,000 before the Great Recession started or the year had started. So it's gradually getting better, but it's almost imperceptibly better.","Martin Mucci","I think the good news is that as you may have seen today, consumer confidence is up. It seems strongest it's been since February, early in the year. And the housing starts are up a little bit. So at a macro level, those things, hopefully, will drive more to investment business. But again, as asked earlier, I think the elections could be holding it back a little bit, too.","Operator","Next question from Gary Bisbee, Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, I wondered, this is going on 2 years now that you've been getting really good productivity from the operations staff. And I think a big part of it that you've talked about is the payroll service folks are handling a lot more customers with the current technology than the prior technology. Can you give us a sense, what inning we're in there? Is there still more room for further improvement? Or are you going to need to find productivity elsewhere as we move forward over the next year or 2?","Martin Mucci","Yes, Gary, I think that it's certainly -- I think it's moderating some. Certainly, you get a big bang out of the technology when it first comes out. We've continued to improve that, and we find other ways to gain the productivity. The field operations team are just great at continuing to drive that productivity and, by the way, keep the client satisfaction rates at the highest satisfaction scores we've ever had. So we watch both of those very closely. We're certainly asking a lot from our operations team, but they just come through over and over again. I think it's moderated some. But we're always feeling that there's ways to leverage and find new ways to productivity. So I guess, I'd say, we're probably in the middle inning or later innings where it's moderating. But then, you know what, you find a new game so.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And I know you told us that you were going to stop providing all the HRS metrics, but it's always difficult when you first do. Can you give us any incremental color on any of those? And I guess what I'm most interested in is how bad is -- maybe that's the wrong word to use, but how bad is PEO? How difficult is that? How much of a drag is that relative to the other parts of the HRS revenue line?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, good question. So Gary what -- and at Jim McDonald's [ph] hearing, I did promise that I'd call out the changes. So our growth rates, some up a little bit, some down slightly. But if you look at fourth quarter growth rates in those clients, they basically are very, very similar to what you saw in the first quarter. So in other words, the growth rates coming out of first quarter were comparable to what we saw in fourth quarter. So you're comparing, in some ways, to more robust growth in that quarter. But -- in the first quarter of last year, but they were comparable to where we ended the year. The PEO, PEO has been a disappointment for us. And we are down in that business year-over-year. I called that out. And the positive on that, when I say we're down, and it's a disappointment relative to where we were a year ago, but I think we've taken a number of actions to stabilize that business. And we think it'll be a good story this year for us.","Martin Mucci","And I think we've seen some of that moderated by the ASO. So we've got that balance. The good thing about us, we have the PEO being sold by the same folks who sold the ASO, and so we've moderated some of that. But as Efrain said, we feel we've got a much better year ahead of us than certainly what we saw behind us.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And would it be safe to say that with the insurance pass through there that the impact on profits of maybe more customers moving to ASO and essentials and away from PEO isn't nearly as big as what we're seeing on the top line?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, that's correct. That's correct. It's a -- that's a fair assessment.","Operator","Next question from Glenn Fodor, Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Lipton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Matt Lipton in for Glenn this morning. Marty, you had commented -- congratulations on hitting kind of record highs on client retention side.","Martin Mucci","Yes.","Matthew Lipton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just curious how that plays out though in the kind of growth in the client base overall? I know it was kind of flat for the full year '12. As we look at the first quarter, was it flat up, down? Is the retention driving allowing you to increase the client base? Or are you still kind of muddling along at a flattish pace here?","Martin Mucci","Yes, we don't -- we only give client base once a year. But I would say, if you looked at fourth quarter, as Efrain said, on some of the other indicators, it's -- there's not much difference there. I think it met our expectations. And I don't think there was any surprises.","Matthew Lipton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. And then on the sales force, you commented that some of the segmentation plans are now being enacted. Are you guys going to have all of that finished before the selling season starts in December, January?","Martin Mucci","Yes. Matt, it's already pretty much all in place. The last piece really was this wholesale sales force for 401(k), and that's because we had to get approval, regulatory approval, for that and are getting everyone licensed. And already have a number of sales, I think, that are getting in the hopper for that. So yes, all the segmentation work that we said we were going to do and a few -- and the expansion territories are well underway.","Operator","Next question, Jim Kissane, Credit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Not to harp on the timing issues, but just want to make sure there's no shift in client behavior, maybe extending the payroll cycles at all going forward.","Efrain Rivera","No, not at all. I mean, we went back, Jim, and looked at 7 years' worth of data to make sure we have the number right. And we saw this 6 years ago, precisely the same thing. And it's just a function of calendar timing.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then just on pricing, is the net pricing sticking above your 2% target?","Efrain Rivera","Well, we didn't say 2%, although some clever people would figure that out. So I won't comment specifically on that. But yes, we're in that range.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just, Marty, any update on the performance of SurePayroll?","Martin Mucci","Yes, continue to do very well and certainly meeting our expectations and a little beyond. And we still feel that the clients going there are very different from those going to Paychex. So we're pleased with the results of the SurePayroll, the sales team and the operations team. They both are hitting our expectations on sales, as well as their performance on client satisfaction and retention.","Operator","Next question, Sara Gubins, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Another question about the timing issue. Did it -- does it have any impact on the second quarter or any other quarters this year?","Efrain Rivera","That timing issue, no, not really.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So it was a one-quarter thing.","Efrain Rivera","In other words, Sara, just want to clarify, what I mean is you're going to have clean -- relatively clean compares there quarter-over-quarter. It really was a first year issue. First quarter issue, sorry, not first year.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First quarter, right. Okay. Second question, you've talked about expecting deceleration in checks per payroll, and that's been a pretty common theme. But if I've got the numbers right, the comparison actually looks a bit easier during the rest of the year than it was in the first quarter. So could you talk about the assumptions that are going into thinking that you'll see that decelerate?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Well, I think we start with the idea that, historically, we've never seen a period where we had this level of checks per client increase for, now, 10 straight quarters. So we're being guided a bit by history. But I will concede that if you look at the history, we've been under a little bit in terms of what the trend's been. We've got the trend right. But it's moderated more slowly than we've expected. And I'll leave it at that.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question. Any update on thoughts around M&A, what the landscape is looking like, and how that may be influencing your views on share repurchase potential?","Martin Mucci","Yes, as far as M&A goes, we're very actively looking, always looking to kind of expand the product set here and to be able to generate more revenue per client. We have been pretty active in that. However, it's always a timing of finding the right valuation and the right fit for us. But we're very active and confident that there'll be some things out there that'll help us along. It doesn't -- our focus is on the organic growth, but we're always looking at opportunities from the M&A standpoint.","Operator","Jason Kupferberg, Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask a follow-up question from one earlier. So just to clarify, for the current year, the core payroll services growth at 3% to 4%, are we basically saying that that's almost all pricing with very little volume growth? Is that essentially the way to think about it?","Efrain Rivera","Not really. We assume some volume growth, Jason, but it builds through the year. And volume growth, you don't get it all in the year. We do expect some volume growth, especially build revenue to grow through the year, and we have some pricing in there, too. There are elements like product mix that play into it that are also a factor. But no, we expect some revenue to build through the year.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then do you need to see the core payroll revenue growth accelerate beyond this year to get any meaningful operating leverage in the business? Because, I mean, I know at the analyst meeting over the summer, you had talked about beyond fiscal '13 seeing some operating margin leverage in the business.","Efrain Rivera","Look, it helps. The more revenue you've got, the better you can leverage. But I think we've shown even on quarters like this one, where we're operating -- I'm sorry, revenue growth was pretty moderate, that we can get leverage. So I think if -- the thing about Paychex, unlike my previous experience, is that if we put our mind to get leverage, we get leverage. And generally, our mind is on getting leverage, yes.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on pricing. I know at the analyst meeting you had talked about longer-term target of 2% to 4% a year, net of discounts. So can you just talk about your confidence in being able to maintain that range beyond the current year? Just as people start to think about the degree of competition in the market and maybe some of the deflationary impact of the mix shift towards more of the SaaS-based solutions and maybe just as part of that, can you give us a sense of what the difference in average annual revenue is between a SurePayroll customer and a client on the traditional Paychex platform?","Efrain Rivera","Jason, I think you get the award for the best comp down question. Well, I'll take part of it and then Marty will do it. So I think we have good confidence on our ability to get that pay increase. One thing I'll mention to you, one way in which we know that is that we do -- before we start the plan process, we do sensitivity analysis around our customer base and can predict with fair degree of accuracy what our retention rates will be at different price levels because we know these customers, we know their behaviors. So when we go out and say 2% to 4%, we feel pretty comfortable that it'll be 2% to 4%, unless, obviously, as you're hinting, there's some sort of tectonic shift in the market, which we continue to say we're not seeing. And then I'll let Marty talk about the do-it-yourself payroll market versus outsourcing, what's happening there.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think the point is that, as Efrain said, we haven't seen any shift in the market to -- there's always been that group that wants to do it themselves and use a SurePayroll model, where they do it themselves and have service to back them up, and then those who want to outsource and have all of it come to someone like us. And I think our pricing and our continual growth in the client satisfaction as well as the technology support for the clients on the tablets and smartphones and now online reporting center, I think, all add that you can still get the price. So we've seen it consistently to be able to get the price that we've modeled out, and we don't see that changing. We always watch it close. I mean, that can change. But at this point, we still feel good about being able to have the pricing power to get that.","Operator","Next question, Jim Macdonald, First Analysis.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Maybe you can give some more color on MMS and SurePayroll. Are they -- kind of growth rates still in high single, double-digit-type growth rates? Or can -- any more color on their growth rates?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think we don't usually break those out. We're seeing -- we've been very positive on, from an MMS, the major market perspective, the addition of the other product set, the single sign-on, adding time and attendance and HR online and our BeneTrac offering. And so we've seen the revenue overall grow on a client basis, and the penetration of those services continue to do extremely well. So we feel good about the product offering, the integration. And that again, more of those clients will be given even more technology in the future, and they're all in our roadmap for Paychex Next Generation. So we feel good about the major market. On the SurePayroll side, as I said earlier, we feel very good about where they are. They met or exceeded expectations for the quarter on their sales as well as the retentions. So really feel that kind of all those markets are doing what we expected.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. And just a technical question as a follow-up. The -- can you talk a little bit about the VRDN rates you're seeing now and how that compares last?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, yes. So that was part of what I mentioned before. So last year compared to this year, last year we were predominantly doing FDIC-insured deposits. And not to get too much into the weeds, suffice it to say that the way that works is that you get a credit that you can use, and you get a rate that you're paid on a pretax basis and then a credit that you end up being able to use. You -- so you have impacts both on interest on funds held for clients. And so -- and you have below-the-line impacts on expense. When you net the 2, you end up at -- we were ending up somewhere around 8 to 10 basis points between the 2. VRDNs are a little bit better. It seems kind of funny to talk about this, but VRDNs now, at least to get typically higher than that, sometimes into the teens or 20 basis points, which is what the environment looks like. So we're doing a mix of both this year. So you may see a little bit lower interest on funds held for clients. But from a bottom line prospective, the impact is negligible.","Operator","Next question, Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple clarifications. The volume and frequency issue that impacted growth about, I think it was 1.5 points. Normally, when you see that, it's just a days thing or calendar thing. And then the second -- in this case, you would think the second quarter would then have a positive impact, but it doesn't seem to be the case. So I just want to make sure I understand that.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, well, it was just basically a quarter-over-quarter issue. So impacts where you saw it, if you remember last year's results, that's where you would have seen it. In the first quarter, our organic growth was 4.2% in payroll services. And in the second quarter, it was 2.8%. So you actually see it in 3 quarters. Not to muddy the waters any more, but you see it in Q4 of '11 some impact on Q2, and then sequentially, you saw some in, I'm sorry, Q1 and then Q2. So we went from 4.2% down to 2.8%. I got some questions on the call. Part of that was some processing revenue that changed, but this had an impact on that also.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And does this volume and frequency issue have any impact to the HRS revenue?","Efrain Rivera","A little bit, not -- we called out a little bit of an impact, but it's not significant, not as significant for core payroll.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So then in HRS, coming in at 7%, I know the guide I think is for 9% to 11%. So where will we see the pickup in HRS because it sounds like you guys are comfortable you get back in that range?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, first thing is basis points fees were just exceptionally strong in Q1. So we think that the compares get easier and we'll get reasonable growth. The second part was we normalize that -- the HR Essentials product launch effect that we had in Q1, and then we expect the PEO to -- the PEO effect to lessen as the year goes on.","Operator","Next question, Rod Bourgeois, Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So is there any evidence of late that deals with clients that Paychex would have traditionally won are actually now being won by lower-priced online players like SurePayroll or other players in that online, low-price market?","Martin Mucci","No, Rod, not seeing that at all. Again, it's in -- all the research that we've done and the feedback from the sales team and who they're seeing and who they're competing against and what deals we're getting out, there's no evidence that we've seen that kind of drop at all. And we're not seeing it -- having the SurePayroll side of it, we're not seeing it there. That's still clients going in who want to control, want to do it themselves, going on the web, search, find them and buy over the phone from them. So we haven't seen a shift there.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, let me ask you this on the SurePayroll side. I mean, are you getting more referrals into Paychex from SurePayroll or more referrals into SurePayroll from the Paychex side?","Martin Mucci","I would say both are pretty minimal. We're able to shift back and forth if there's not a good fit there. But that's one of the things I would say that we've seen for the last 1.5 years now with SurePayroll, that there has not been much referral back and forth. It's available there if the sales teams, both of them find that there's a client without a good fit and that they're a better fit for the other company. But we haven't seen -- we've seen very little activity on that at all.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right, great. And then at the risk of beating a dead horse on this timing of revenue growth topic, should we be assuming that we won't see a lumpy positive timing event over the next couple of quarters because that's already transpired? Or is there actually going to be a lumpy positive side to the negative timing that hit you in the August quarter?","Efrain Rivera","No, no, we saw the lumpiness last year. And what you should be expecting to see is a build through the year.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, I got it. And then hey, just on this topic. And I know that the practice is to not to give quarterly guidance, but in cases where there's a known timing issue that's meaningful, 1.5 points in this business is pretty meaningful, do you consider going forward of giving more specificity in the guidance for the next quarter when that's expected as an issue?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks for the advice. We stay away from quarterly guidance, and I think we did as reasonable a job as we could to tell people where we ended up. And I think if you look at consensus, say, revenue being off $6 million without having the guide directly to what the number was, I think it was reasonable especially also, people, I think, understood what the earnings compare was. So I hear you. I hear you. We'll consider it.","Operator","Next question, Jeff Silber, BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just wanted to shift back to your investment policy. You talked about the mix of taxable to tax-exempt securities. Can you tell us roughly percentage-wise where that is now, where you expect to go and how you think that'll impact both your interest rate and your portfolio tax rates?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, let me -- so the portfolio remains 50-50 at the moment, 50% being invested in short-term vehicles, 50% in longer term. We anticipate remaining long term in tax-free municipals. That's not going to change. But I would say on the short term, opportunistically, we'll look at VRDNs if we think they offer a superior return to FDIC-insured deposits, which is the next best option in terms of available investments. So I can't give you precise percentage. We'll do it opportunistically when we think that the VRDN market looks a little bit better.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Well, would it make sense at least to maybe, for modeling purposes, maybe to model the interest rate down a little bit and the tax rate down a little bit as well?","Efrain Rivera","I think a touch. I think a touch. But I don't think it'll be significant.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And then just one more modeling question. You talk about the investments in IT and product development. Which specific expense line item is that in?","Efrain Rivera","That would be in our G&A line.","Operator","Next question, Vishnu Lekraj, Morningstar.","Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just want to touch here on the payroll service growth, maybe beyond here, the next couple quarters. Let's assume that the small business environment gets back to normal. How should we view growth out of that division in terms of a gross dollar, not necessarily percentage, because that's going to change over time, but a gross dollar versus the historical norm?","Efrain Rivera","I guess I can't quantify it on a gross dollar. I would say that we get up to more normalized new business environment, we should be above certainly mid-single digits. Yes.","Vishnu Lekraj - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. Can you give a little color as to what the competitive environment's looking out like today not just with the SaaS or DIY products, but all around from -- specifically your payroll services basically, are you seeing more competition today versus a year ago or vice versa?","Martin Mucci","I'd say about the same. I think we've had a pretty stable competitive environment. I think there's always discounting going on. There's always pretty aggressive competition. But it hasn't -- I wouldn't say it's gotten any more difficult over the last 2 years or any more difficult or any less. It's about the same.","Operator","Next question, Michael Baker, Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The health insurers are starting to talk about potential impacts for 2014 as it relates to the exchanges, pointing out that they anticipate employers with 10 employees or less to kind of push workers onto the exchange. And I know there's been some softness in the PEO. I'm wondering, how much of that is attributed to you guys proactively adjusting your sales effort there? And what type of impacts do you guys expect? And I know that there are some offsets that you have as well.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think from -- first, from a PEO standpoint, that really hasn't been an impact on the PEO. The impact there was some higher -- an increase and higher insurance premiums than we had expected, and -- last year really and the year before. And that caused some issues with us retaining clients and selling. And we may -- moderated some of that with the ASO, but that was the issue. There wasn't anything proactive that we tried to do from the health reform standpoint. From the health reform standpoint, we feel pretty good that we're -- we play kind of that expert role that as this agency's gotten more and more traction, our insurance agency has gotten more and more traction, it's now the 28th largest in the country, that we're always going to be that expert. So whether clients -- it's really the fact the clients are going to be more probably confused and in need of help than ever to know whether to go to an exchange, whether to go off health insurance or whether to find other methods to -- or the best methods and most efficient methods as a small business. I think we're going to be well positioned to do that. Already with the tie with payroll, we're able to help them with immediate access to reports that we provide them that help if they qualify for the small business tax credit. If they're going to -- if you need to put the information on the W-2 like the greater than 250 employees, we can put that very easily. So I think there's been a nice -- there's a nice tie with health reform no matter which way it goes. Margins, commissions from the insurance carrier is certainly going to get squeezed a little bit, but I think we'll be very active in being the expert for the small business.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then I was looking for an update on workers' comp, how claims are shaping up relative to reserves. I would assume there was no major negative development there. But just in general, some commentary around workers' comp dynamics might be helpful.","Efrain Rivera","Yes, no significant issues. We -- I think on the workers' comp side related to the PEO, what -- the claims experience there was what we expected. And then on the sales side, this continues to be a good story for us.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think we do a very good job on the book and there's been no surprises. It's been right with our expectations.","Operator","Next question, David Grossman, Stifel, Nicolaus.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just kind of, I guess, a bigger picture question. I mean, you've got several initiatives under way to accelerate growth. It's new client growth, expanding the addressable market within flex SurePayroll and increasing revenue per client. And you've done a good job of writing some anecdotes on your progress there. However, can you provide any more specific metrics that help us benchmark your progress against these initiatives? And perhaps even more specifically, can you help us understand whether the aggregate of these efforts can actually impact the growth rates if the economy continues to stagnate or new business creation continues to be relatively moderate?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I guess I'd start by saying to have a guidance at 3% to 4% in this kind of economy, that this continues to kind of slowly improve, we're pretty happy with the fact that we're 3% to 4% there and we're 5% to 6% overall. Mid-single growth in this kind of economy we feel good about and the fact that also we're leveraging that and continuing to maintain a very high profitability and a good dividend. So I would say all these things kind of contribute to that. I would say also that like when you look at 401(k), no matter what's changed in that environment, and we've continued to add services that keep us #1. And I think so one of the things quantitatively is we're still #1. We have over 59,000 plans at the end of last year. We continue to provide more new plans than anyone else. I think that's because we're constantly innovating. And on the SurePayroll side, I think, as you mentioned it, we see good growth there as -- exactly as we expected and that being -- expanding into that market that does not really cannibalize, as we see at Paychex, is very good to help drive that growth, too, and drive client base and be able to sell the other products into it. So I guess we don't try to give too much specificity in each one until we're kind of done with the year. But I think the fact that we're reaffirming guidance, that we have mid-single-digit revenue growth expectations in this kind of economic environment, is all those things playing together.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So maybe asked another way, Marty, then, if we go into the next year without any real noticeable macro improvement, would you expect that mid-single-digit growth rate to improve based on your progress against all these different initiatives?","Martin Mucci","I think, David, it'd be comparable. I think to be able to continue to push mid-single-digit growth on the revenue side in this -- in kind of a slow economy is something that we'll still be able to do and continue to try to drive it incrementally better. But I think that's where it'll be. Long term, as the economy comes back, we ourselves, as we've said at the Investor Day, in the high single-digit growth revenue and still trying to drive a great profitability as well.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Marty, you mentioned this major bank that you signed as a channel. Can you help us better understand what that opportunity is and how that can play out?","Martin Mucci","Yes, that was -- and if it wasn't clear, it was a franchise. We're pushing both the franchise now and the banking. We've always gotten referrals from banks, but I think we really work together now with SurePayroll to provide both a white-label opportunity to the bank or in total outsource and we'll be able to go in there together and we come in much stronger, I think, that way. On the franchise side, what I was mentioning was that we had signed an agreement with Subway and -- in just the recent month or 2. And we have a good relationship with them to be the preferred provider of their payroll and they're, of course, the largest franchisee in the U.S. And so we feel good very good about that, winning that from a competitor. So I think the opportunity there is, you're the preferred provider, and it gives us great leads. Still early to tell, but we certainly feel good about that. And that's opened up a few other franchises that we're actively pursuing as well.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then finally, Efrain, I just wanted to make sure I understood your comment about the tax rate. Did you say you'd be in the 37% range or 36%? Or was that a function of where you fall out on the tax free, is it, over the course of the year?","Efrain Rivera","No, I think we said our tax rate would be around 36%. Actually, in the guidance, we said it would be comparable to first quarter. We're around 36%.","Operator","Next question, Tim McHugh, William Blair.","Stephen Sheldon","This is Stephen Sheldon in for Tim McHugh today. Just overall, I think you talked about growing your sales force 3% to 4% this year. I was just wondering if you guys can give an update on where you guys stand right now on that initiative.","Martin Mucci","Yes, we're in good shape. We've -- we went out. We're hiring. We're pretty well filled in all spots. We've expanded some of the territories, as we said we would. So we found additional territories based on our modeling. And that's one of the first years. In a few years, we've been able to -- we've done that, which is expand out into additional fringe territories, I guess I'd say, off of some of the areas we're already in. And we've achieved the increase in the sales number. And sales met our expectations in the first quarter and I think are doing a good job of setting us up for the guidance with driving more revenue per client.","Stephen Sheldon","Okay. And then kind of a follow-up questions, the segmentation. Specifically for the financial advisors segment, how -- can you maybe provide a little color there and how large that sales force may be?","Martin Mucci","Yes, the sales force is -- I wouldn't give necessarily a number because -- from a competitive standpoint, but it's a new team that is dedicated right to those financial advisors. Now in the past, as we're the largest 401(k) record keeper provider and have been, we're very good at going directly to clients and working with financial advisors. We've got a lot of relationships. But what we didn't have was necessarily a pure focus on going directly to the financial advisor, building the relationship with the large financial advisors and giving them a direct service, a dedicated service kind of process. And that's what we changed. So we have a sales force that is smaller, dedicated to building the relationships. Then they'll bring in and sell to the financial advisor to help them build their book of business and have a direct service line for them. So it's not just directly to clients, it's now directly to the financial advisors as well. And we think that'll help accelerate the growth of the business, which, by the way, is still growing to our expectations.","Operator","Next question, Paul Thomas, Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on new business formation from the comments earlier. Is your sense that new business formation is a little more positive? Or do you see it as weaker because of the election and maybe we might see some acceleration post-election?","Martin Mucci","I think based on Efrain, the numbers Efrain gave, it always lags a few quarters. I think it's still relatively flat. So I don't think we \u2013 we haven't -- certainly, haven't seen it gotten worse. But I think it's gradually improved. I guess the only point of color to it is a couple things. One, I think the election does slow that down a bit because those on the fringe of starting investing are not investing, are kind of waiting to see how things fall out. I also think it's still tough to get cash. Where they can get it from a home equity or friends or banks, it's still a little bit tough to get cash. And -- but the positive news is that consumer confidence is up this morning to the highest it's been in probably 7 or -- 6 or 7 months. And also, the housing starts. And when those things start to come back, that should drive some demand, which I think starts the businesses that support housing, et cetera. So I think some positive numbers today, but I don't think we've seen a major change yet or anything.","Operator","Next question, Mark Marcon, RW Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So just curious, can you talk a little bit about MMS and what you're seeing there? You did say that things are going well. But I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail just in terms of is the growth profile about the same as it used to be in terms of where the growth is coming from? How much of an expectation are you building in, in terms of continued growth particularly with the product improvements coming along? How should we think about that? And then I have a bigger picture.","Efrain Rivera","Mark, couple things on that. We certainly expect MMS to have growth rates that are in excess of our core business. So we certainly, when you consider all the services that are part of a typical MMS bundle, see that. What you see -- MMS is a little bit more complex sales than core because as an MMS client comes onto payroll, there are other services that typically are associated with that sale, online services that also help fuel that growth. So we've been seeing very, very good results on the online portion of the services that MMS customers get, and we've seen kind of steady growth in MMS sales themselves. So we expect it to grow faster than the rate of core. It is not as fast as it was probably 4 or 5 years ago but still pretty reasonable growth.","Martin Mucci","Yes, and I guess I'd just add, Mark, that the good thing we're seeing is much more package of all of our products and the full suite of products going to those clients. And we got a great sales force there that knows how to sell the combined product portfolio. And they're going to continue to see the technology integration of Paychex Next Generation. So we're very well primed for the future with that as well.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And are you seeing the same sort of wins in terms of both smaller clients graduating up to MMS as well as competitive wins? Or how should we think about that part of the equation?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think it's always been more, there's some movement up, but there's not a lot of movement up from one product to the other. Now that'll be easier in the future as we're all on one product suite. But we don't see a lot of movement there. It's more competitive wins. And I don't think, as I said earlier, that competition has changed much from a competitiveness, from a pricing or who is in there fighting with us. It's pretty much the same kind of pricing or same kind of competitive atmosphere. So not any big changes there. They're primed and ready to go and have met our expectations, and we'll keep pushing to see more growth there.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then can you -- free cash flow was very strong this quarter. It's been very good over the last 12 months. Cash balance continues to build. How are you thinking about that at this point?","Efrain Rivera","Well, what -- as that builds, I would just characterize it as our conversations about its return to shareholders intensifies. Yes.","Martin Mucci","Lots of options, I'm sure, that we always talk about. Obviously, a board decision in the end, but we always have those conversations, so.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And as you said before, we don't necessarily need to grow earnings in order to get to a 75% payout ratio. We can do it sooner than that, right? In order to boost the dividend?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. No, that's correct.","Operator","Next question, Rayna Kumar, Evercore Partners.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm calling in for David Togut. Could you please comment on your head-to-head win rates in small business payroll services against your principal competitors and particularly if you've seen any impact from ADP's new RUN product?","Martin Mucci","No. RUN's been out for some time and as well as Paychex Next Generation, our side of it. I think we haven't seen much change in the competitive environment. I think our -- the fact that we -- our service is so strong, our results. And the fact that we've rolled out a lot of technology and I think have been seen more as a technology leader in the past will help us, and has helped us, in what we're demonstrating to clients. But I have not seen and really don't give out the closing rates on the sales and never have. But we see the environment very similar to what it has been.","Operator","Our last question, from Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So a couple of questions. One, I guess you have, obviously, numerous initiatives, including the ongoing effort to use better segmentation. My question is which channels have you seen better client growth in? And which are not doing as well, both among the traditional channels and the newer initiatives?","Martin Mucci","Well, I don't -- I think what we've seen, as we've said, pretty much on our expectations for the first quarter, I think some of the segmentation is fairly new. We certainly feel good about the run rate for the 401(k) in particular. I think that organically, what we've already had is continuing to do well at good growth rates. And then the new -- I think this is not going to do anything but continue to propel us to be even stronger in 401(k). The HR outsourcing has done well with, we've kind of taken a hit from the PEO in the past, but I think we're well positioned in this selling season for that, along with the ASO and the HR Essentials product, which is the telephonic support. And on the payroll side, I mean, I really -- it felt that we've met expectations as to where we feel. And given this economy, I think we're well positioned. I think the segmentation has made it much cleaner for our sales teams, who are world-class, to say \"This is who I sell to this is who the other team sells to.\" And there's been a lot of good work there and feedback. And so I think that started off well. In addition, too, I think it's -- we've been driving more market growth thinking. So those payroll sales teams refer more clients -- refer our other sales team into those clients. And so things like workers' comp and health insurance are picking up as well from those referrals.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And are there areas where you think -- that need more sort of management attention where you haven't been doing as well in terms of channels?","Martin Mucci","I don't think so. I think we're -- I mean, we feel pretty good across-the-board, and I think we've got a great leadership team in sales that are very focused on revenue growth. I think that would be the other big thing this year, is we focused a lot of their incentive and is to driving revenue per client and selling additional services. And that, we feel, has started off very well in the first quarter.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I'm just trying to understand, obviously, in your -- in the traditional part of your business, cross-selling and up-selling is a terribly important part of what you do. What about for SurePayroll? Is there sort of a path up in terms of SurePayroll? Do they -- have you seen clients on SurePayroll as they grow bigger, maybe graduate to the traditional set, give you a better revenue opportunity? Is that an option for them?","Martin Mucci","We don't see that change that much. The clients don't -- usually, if they go to SurePayroll, it's a different type of client that wants to do it themselves so they stay on the product. But what they do -- what SurePayroll was doing and is working with us know to enhance that even more is selling additional services. So let's take workers' comp, for example, they had -- when you had SurePayroll, small company selling a lot of new payroll clients, they had a small team selling workers' comp. We've added them and directly linked them into our workers' comp team, which has been industry-leading in driving workers' comp penetration, I think, into our base. Now there's -- we're selling more workers' comp to their SurePayroll -- to the SurePayroll clients and health insurance and 401(k), et cetera. So we're -- they've had fewer resources to be able to do the additional products but had it set up and started. We've been able to enhance that, and we'll see higher revenue per client at SurePayroll but not necessarily by going to a different payroll product.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Last question, if I can. Just a clarification. And you've been asked a few questions about the elections and the impact. Are you actually making in your guidance any specific assumption on post-election trends for employment or pickup of business creation? Or are you not doing that?","Martin Mucci","No, no. We think that -- I'm not sure it'll have a biggest -- I think the biggest impact, we hope, will be that there's a drive for new business formation. But we haven't made any adjustments for either candidate or how the election comes out, no.","Wendy, that was our last question?","Operator","Thank you. That was our last question.","Martin Mucci","Okay. At this point, I'll close the call. And if you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it'll be archived until October 25. Our annual meeting of stockholders will be held October 23 at 10:00 a.m. in Rochester. That meeting will also be broadcast over the Internet.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer to begin.","Martin Mucci","Great, thank you, Laurie. Thank you for joining us for the discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2019. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review business highlights for the third quarter, Efrain will review the third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2019, and then we'll open it up for your questions.","Financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 reflected solid progress against our objectives and growth across our major product lines. Our total revenue growth was 14% for the third quarter, management solutions revenue grew 4%, and PEO and insurance services revenues grew a strong 65%, of course reflecting the inclusion of the Oasis Outsourcing Group acquisition. On December 20, 2018 we acquired Oasis, the largest privately held PEO in the U.S., and an industry leader in providing HR outsourcing services for approximately $1.2 billion. We financed this acquisition with $800 million of new long-term debt along with cash-on-hand.","Oasis is a great fit for our PEO growth strategy, adding to our scale, expanding relationships with new insurance partners, creating upsell opportunities into the existing Oasis customer base, and augmenting our talent with an addition of an experienced leadership team. Integration of Oasis is in the process with a combination of the Paychex and Oasis PEO leadership teams already complete. We're excited with the experience and talent that comprise this new team and we're confident in their ability to continue to expand our leadership position in the HR outsourcing industry. In fact, Paychex and Oasis, now combined, serve more than 1.4 million work-site employees through our various HR outsourcing services.","Execution and operations has been strong as reflected in our clients satisfaction scores and client retention. We continue to be pleased with current retention results, and are on-track to the end of the fiscal year - to end the fiscal year with retention in line with our historic all-time high. Our excellence in customer service was recently recognized as we earned a Stevie Award for Customer Service Department of the year for the third straight year. One of the reasons for this recognition was our use of technology to evolve and improve the clients and their employees service experience. Our strength and focus on technology including self-service options for our clients allows us to proactively respond to the changing preferences of our clients' needs, and thank you to the thousands of Paychex service givers who remain committed to responsiveness, reliability and serving as a trusted business partner to our clients.","We've made significant investments in our sales force this year, particularly in our inside sales and mid-market sales teams, and in lead or demand generation. We completed our selling season with improved performance led by our share payroll, HR solutions, PEO, and our inside payroll and insurance sales teams. Our internal sales teams continue to gain ground reflecting improved sales execution and productivity. Our Paychex IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch has recently showed that small business jobs growth remains pretty flat in this low unemployment economy, and hiring and retaining employees is a major challenge of businesses in this current environment. These factors along with growth and wages are evidence certainly of a tight labor market. Paychex is positioned to help small and mid-sized businesses recruit, hire and retain talent with a broad portfolio of service offerings that allows clients to provide an attractive compensation and benefits package along with opportunities for growth and development of their employees.","We continue to enhance Paychex Flex making significant investments designed to simplify the complexity of HR administration.

These features are all backed by self-service capabilities that empower employees and administrators to complete tasks from any location on any device. These significant technology product enhancements support our clients in recruiting, onboarding, training and developing their employees in a market where I mentioned it gets increasingly difficult to find and retain employees. In addition to our HR center offering, our broad product set allows our clients to provide competitive benefits including retirement and insurance options. Finally, our clients are supported by a team of over 500 Paychex HR specialists around the country who serve their growing HR needs as states have increasingly made it more challenging to run and grow their businesses without this expertise.","We continue to enhance our technology for efficiency through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the Flex Assistant, our AI chatbot conducts conversations with our clients and their employees in response to a number of service inquiries. We have seen an increasing adoption of our chatbot because of the immediate response and quick and easy-to-understand solutions to customer inquiries, as well as their employees enquiries.

Our Paychex Flex Assistant can cover topics across the human capital management suite, and guides users on how to self-serve if they prefer. The best AI chatbots function through natural language processing to interprete users language to understand and meet their needs.

Our employees make this combination successful with their hard work and commitment to our clients each and every day.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Martin and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such involve risks. Please refer to our earnings release that provides a disclosure on forward-looking statements and related risk factors. In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measures include certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release and the investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the third quarter to their related GAAP measures.","I will start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow with some greater detail in certain areas. I'll touch briefly on year-to-date results and wrap with a review of our fiscal 2019 outlook and a '20 framework; so look also at the investor presentation, we've got more detail there. Total revenue and total service revenue, both grew 14% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion and $1 billion respectively, our first $1 billion quarter, and hopefully the first of many to come. The acquisition of Oasis in December 2018 accounted for approximately one half of the growth in service revenue. Expenses increased 13% for the third quarter to $641 million and the acquisition of Oasis contributed approximately 12% to this growth.","Total expenses for the prior year three months ended February 28, 2018, included as you recall, a one-time bonus paid to non-management employees and a one-time charge following the termination of certain licensing agreements. Total expenses excluding Oasis and these one-time costs in their respective prior year periods increased approximately 9% compared to last year, this 9% growth was primarily driven by increased headcount to investment in the sales force technology resources and operations to support the growth in the business. In addition, an increase in PEO and insurance pass-through costs impacted the quarter.","Operating income increased 16% to $429 million. Operating margin was 40.1% for the third quarter comparing to 39.4% for the same period last year. Adjusted operating income which excludes the previously mentioned one-time charge in the prior year quarter increased 7%. I just keep referring you back to both, the presentations we've posted on the investor -- the investor presentation we've posted on the website, it goes through in extensive detail, all of the call outs. Our effective income tax rate was 23.7% for the third quarter compared to 1.1% for the same period last year. The enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act or tax reform in December 2017 resulted in a significant decline in the federal corporate statutory tax rate. In the third quarter last year, we've recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $79 million from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities at this lower rate or at the new lower rate.","In addition, during the third quarter last year, we've recognized the fiscal year-to-date catch-up for the lower blended effective tax rate applicable for the fiscal year. These two items resulted in the low 1.1% effective rate for the prior year quarter. we anticipate that the effective tax rate before any discrete tax items will be approximately 24% for the full year fiscal 2019; again I'll refer back to the investor presentation.","Net income decreased 12% to 325% for the third quarter, primarily due to significant tax impacts I just discussed, partially offset by the one-time charge following termination of certain licensing agreements, also recognized in last year's third quarter. Adjusted net income increased 3%, adjusted net income to non-GAAP measure that excludes the one-time charge related terminations of the licensing agreements, the tax benefit to revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, and excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based comp which we call out. However, this measure still incorporates the impact of the year-to-date catch-up for the lower blended federal corporate statutory rate recognized in the third quarter last year which is monitoring the growth for the current period.","Diluted earnings per share decreased 11% to $0.90 for the third quarter but adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3%. These growth trends reflect the same factors as discussed for net income, and again, I'd refer you back to the investor presentation which details it.","I will now provide some additional color in selected areas. Management Solutions revenue which includes payroll service revenue together with our HCM products included to many of our product bundles increased 4% to $802 million for the third quarter. Lessor contributed less than 1% to the growth, the remaining increase was driven primarily by growth in client bases across our HCM Services, and growth in revenue per check which improved as a result the price increases net of discounts.","PEO and insurance; it increased 65% to $246 million for the third quarter. Excluding Oasis PEO and insurance service revenue would have increased 17% for the third quarter, and this growth was primarily driven by the continued strong demand for our combined PEO services which along with WSE growth, the worksite employee growth in our existing client base has resulted in solid growth and client worksite employees served. Our insurance service revenue benefit from growth in the number of health and benefits applicants, the rate of growth for insurance services was moderated by softness in the workers comp market. As state insurance funds declined, we expect this trend in workers comp revenue to persist, and we expect it to persist into next year more to follow on that, it will have a modest impact.","Interest on funds held for clients; it increased 27% for the third quarter, $23 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held clients were down for the third quarter, primarily driven by the impacts of lower client employee tax withholdings resulting from tax reform and client base mix, partially offset by wage inflation. Investments and income; our goal as you know is to protect principle and optimize liquidity, we continue to invest in high credit quality securities, the long-term portfolio currently has an average yield of 2.1%, and an average duration of 3.1 years, our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2% for the third quarter, up from 1.5% last year.","Year-to-date results; let me briefly summarize where we've been for this nine month period. Management solutions revenue is up 4%, PEO and insurance revenue increased 40%, 23% without Oasis and 17% organic. Interest on funds held for clients increased 28% driven by interest rate increases, partially offset by the impact of a 2% decline in average invested balances. Total revenue; this includes obviously Oasis, up 10%. Operating margins were 37.8%, tempered by accelerated investments in the business and growth in PEO direct insurance costs. Net income increased 4% and adjusted net income increased 12%. Diluted earnings per share increased 3% but adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12%.","Let's go through the highlights of our financial position; it remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $886 million as of February 28, 2019. We had a strong cash flow quarter, even though we utilized part of our cash to pay for the Oasis acquisition. Funds held for clients as of the February 28, 2019 were $5.4 million compared to $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018. Funds held for clients, as you know, very widely on a day-to-day basis averaging $4.4 billion for the third quarter and $3.9 billion for the nine months. Total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $10 million compared with $38 million as of May 31, 2018. Total stockholders' equity was $2.6 billion as of Feb 28, 2019 reflecting $604 million in dividends paid and $33 million of shares repurchased during the last -- I'm sorry, the first nine months of fiscal 2019.","Our return-on-equity for the past 12 months was a formidable 42%. Cash flows from operations were $1 billion for the nine months, an increase of 3% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments, partially offset by working capital fluctuations, working capital fluctuations related to timing around collections and related tax payments for the combined PEO business, a decrease in accrued liability balances in connection with the termination of certain licensing agreements in fiscal 2018.","Now turning to 2019 guidance; I will discuss the guidance for full year fiscal 2019. I'd remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. We maintain our guidance as provided last quarter with including the overlay on Oasis which I'll talk about in a second. I will reiterate these guidance ranges and provide some color where applicable. And then, just finally to remind everyone; I'll give the guidance first excluding any anticipated impact from the Oasis acquisition then followed with the anticipated impact of Oasis on our results. And I would say this; some of you have updated your models for the inclusion of Oasis, some have not, and so we thought that it made more sense and was better to be very clear to say here is what our base guidance is, and then the overlay of Oasis; so just remember that as I walk through this.","So excluding Oasis, management solutions expected to grow approximately 4% PEO and insurance anticipated to grow in the range of 18% to 20%, interest on funds held for clients anticipated to grow 20% to 25%, total revenue anticipated to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, operating income as a percent of total revenue anticipated to be approximately 37%, interest income net anticipated to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 expected to be approximately 24%. Net income and diluted earnings per share anticipated to grow approximately 4%. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, are both expected to increase in the range of 11% to 12%. We give the guidance this way so there can be no confusion as the fact that we're tracking exactly to the plan that we set at the beginning of the year and don't blend or confuse the info on Oasis.","So now let's talk about it when we include Oasis. It's anticipated as we said previously, they have an incremental impact on total revenue in the range of $155 million to $175 million in fiscal 2019. As we refine these numbers, we think that that number is going to be on the lower end of that range, in the low $160 million. Excluding one-time costs related to the acquisition, Oasis is anticipated to have minimum impact on earnings per share; now when we include one-time acquisition and integration costs, we anticipate the impact on diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.03 per share for fiscal 2019. That's consistent with what we've said previously, a little more color on where we fall within that $155 million to $175 million, and that really has everything to do with the way we are looking at pass-through costs in that business.","I'll provide you with a little additional color for the last quarter of the year. Consistent with how we guided our last quarter's call, we anticipate that management solutions revenue growth in Q4 will be below the full year rate due to the anniversary, primarily among other things of the Lessor acquisition. We still think that management solutions will fall between 3% and 4%. Last quarter we indicated that for Q3 we anticipated PEO and insurance services revenue increase in the range of 15% to 17%, and for Q4 to be in the range of 10% to 13%. Growth in Q3 came in at the high-end of the guidance range we provided last quarter, and we now expect growth for Q4 to be approximately 9%, so below that range. There is two reasons for that, there was some timing of revenue that shifted between quarters on the insurance side; and despite this, we anticipate achieving our full year guidance range. We'll talk a little bit more about what we're saying as we talk about the '20 guidance but there is also a little bit of softness on the workers comp portion of our insurance revenue that pulls that revenue down a bit.","Now, let me talk about 2020 and I would just caveat everything I'm saying by saying that we haven't completed our planning process but we thought given the Oasis acquisition and the fact that you'll need to update models. We thought we'd give you some preview of what we're looking at for the year, including Oasis. We'll provide the detailed guidance during our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter call as we always do, but let me give you some high level commentary based on a preliminary look into next fiscal year. Management solutions revenue growth, we anticipate it to be comparable to the growth in 2019. PEO and insurance revenue excluding Oasis is anticipated to reflect low double-digit growth; so that means about in the range of around 10%. Including Oasis, PEO and insurance services revenue growth will be in the range of 30% to 35% with growth higher in the first half of the year until the anniversary of the Oasis acquisition.","Operating margins, at this stage we think will be in the range of 37% to 38%, we'll see where we end this year but that anticipates some improvement, some leverage on the base business. We anticipate Oasis will contribute revenue in the range of $355 million to $375 million next year, and is going to be largely neutral to earnings per share. With the significance of the interest expense and amortization expense associated with the Oasis acquisition, we introduced a discussion of EBITDA margins. Please refer to the investor presentation on our IR webpage for the calculation of EBITDA for the first nine months of fiscal 2019. We anticipate EBITDA for the full year fiscal 2019 will be approximately 41%, and we expect EBITDA as a percent of total revenue for fiscal 2020 to be consistent with fiscal 2019. And if you look at the way we calculate EBITDA, it's pretty simple and should be pretty easy to follow.","I reiterate, these comments are very preliminary and subject to revision as we finalize our plans for next year. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information.","By the way, I just wanted to clarify one thing that 37% to 38% is clear on the webpage would exclude -- that operating margin I cited would exclude Oasis. So look at the slide, I think it lays it out pretty clearly.","So with that, I'll end my comments and turn it back to Martin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, Efrain. And operator, now we'll open the call to questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays.","Damian Wille","This is Damien on for Ramsey, so thanks for taking the questions. I just -- I'm hoping you guys can talk a little bit about your long-term growth expectations for the PEO and insurance revenue. Obviously, you've provided that preliminary framework for 2020 which I really appreciate at the low double-digits but I think -- we're thinking about that more like a mid-teens type of a rate. Can you may be dissect what's going on in there and why the deceleration year-over-year?","Martin Mucci","The answer to that is, I gave you PEO and insurance; so our PEO business -- our base PEO business is growing in the teens, insurance pulls that growth rate down a little bit. I would just say that insurance revenue can vary from year to year, it could very well be by the back half of next year, growth in insurance revenue picks up again. So it oscillates. Our PEO growth, we expect it to be in the teens; so that's one thing. And then the second thing is, we'll have to see when we anniversary Oasis what our growth rate coming out of that will be because the numbers are larger. So I think that's the answer to the question.","Damian Wille","And on operating margin then for 2020, it's nice to see some of the leverage in the model there. Maybe if you could talk about some places that you guys are looking to invest next year or maybe even in Q4 here and then into next year. Like, what are the places that you guys are going to invest in and how that kind of plays into your operating margin expectations? Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","I would say that as we get into next year, we identified areas where we would invest this year as part of tax reform, and so there will be a continuation of those three broad buckets of investment; not at the same level that we invested this year certainly on a net basis, meaning we're getting some benefits from it so you don't -- you won't see the same level of net spend that you saw this year. But we will continue to invest in marketing and sales, I think a little bit less in sales. And on the marketing side, continue to invest in operational efficiencies and then continue to work on IP and products. Martin?","Martin Mucci","Yes. One of the other things as Efrain mentioned, those are the same things, you'll see a continuation of that and a little bit lower but the product acceleration would be the other one that -- to the ones that Efrain mentioned. So lead generation, demand generation has been our big focus for us, a lot more leads coming in over the web, and I really think we're hitting our stride through some of the programs we've put in place at the beginning of this fiscal year to drive more demand and nurture those leads because so many more are coming in that way, and then handling them is well through internal sales, so we really continue to invest there. Product acceleration, these were things that we were going to do; we accelerated particularly into this quarter a lot of product around HR, what we call our HR center and enhancing that with data analytics, learning management system to provide training for our employees and their clients, and performance management among other things. So product acceleration, lead generation and operating efficiencies, as well using some of the work we've done in our chatbots and chat and other self-service capabilities that our clients were looking for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Amit Singh","This is actually Amit Singh for Jason. You guys just went through your key selling season; so what were the key takeaways from there? Anything that stood out as being different this year versus the past couple of years in terms of competition, pricing, etcetera?","Martin Mucci","I think the competitive environment is about the same, we didn't see a big change there. We feel year-to-date we're really seeing the best-selling seasons selling, frankly, in [PAR] [ph] growth that we've had in a few years; so that was -- that continued. I think it was moderated a little bit in January -- in the December-January kind of timeframe with -- between the government shutdown, the market kind of dropping and then rebounding, and etcetera. So we saw a little moderation there but really when you look at the selling season overall, for [PAR] [ph] growth, it's been -- we don't really give the number but it's the best we've seen in 3 years and certainly year-to-date it's the same thing. So we're feeling great momentum, particularly on the HR Solutions and PEO side of the business, insurances -- health insurance, and our inside sales piece as well.","Amit Singh","And then just expanding on that competitive dynamics into your PEO market and especially as we look at your fiscal '20 guidance versus '19. There has been some strong growth for a while there, but is it now getting noticeably more crowded?","Martin Mucci","Actually, I think we're building even more strength with adding Oasis and now serving through the various -- not just PEO but our other HR outsourcing solutions of 1.4 million worksite employees, we've build a real strength and we expect to capitalize on that with carrier relations, the insurance carrier relations expanding into other states and selling our products into the Oasis base as well. So as Efrain said, I think if you look at the whole PEO and insurance segment, it's moderated a bit but a lot of that coming from the insurance side of it, and particularly, workers comp which -- I think you know cycles, were kind of in a down rate environment which has actually picked up pretty quickly, and so once those state funds lower their insurance rates and the impact on the overall workers comp rates have come down, that's really accelerated in the last couple of months and that's going to put some moderation on the PEO and insurance line. But the PEO itself, we expect still to be very strong and particularly with the recent acquisition with Oasis, of course, and HROI as well, we feel very good about the leadership teams there and the integration that's already underway.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can maybe go a little further on the selling season commentary you had a minute ago. Marty, just given what you've seen from Oasis thus far, what's been the reaction from clients with respect to the addition of that to your product portfolio? And I guess, more broadly speaking, heading into fiscal '20, do you feel kind of incrementally better or worse about the growth and that kind of the core payroll franchise revenue growth heading into next year?","Martin Mucci","I think starting with the PEO, I think we've gotten good positive feedback from clients. I think Oasis already had a strong feeling from their clients, and the leadership; Mark Perlberg, who has been running Oasis and is leading our PEO as we combine it. We're selling -- we're really designing a great balance of selling into new clients and selling into the base as well. Of course, we have a Top 20 insurance agency that now -- Oasis can use the strength of that, so where insurance is not a good fit on the PEO model, you can now add Oasis clients as -- in new sales like we've done, can now go to the insurance agency to be able to get insurance; so we're adding some strength there, of course, they had different carriers relationship levels than we did and so we're expanding into a new states. So I think the reaction has been good the opportunity is great, and I think the integration is going very well from that standpoint.","On the core payroll side, I think that competition has continued to be about the same, it's competitive; the pricing though hasn't changed a lot, I think we still have some pricing power there. We'd always like to see that growth a little stronger but it's also the way we're leading our sales now, we're leading much more with HR overall; so we're selling more bundles, we're selling more into the PEO and HR outsourcing, and you're not getting quite as much of the demand for payroll-only, and that's exactly how we expected it. So I think you're seeing price and level of competition the same there, it's okay, it's not as strong as we'd like but I think it's moving exactly the way we thought toward more HR.","Now in the SurePayroll side, for example, I mentioned that we just introduced an e-commerce option; we're seeing that that is helping not only accept more leads but gain more clients that way. It's early in the process but what you're finding is, if a client comes in and can complete the entire transaction on their own or get help from our internal sales teams if they needed, and kind of complete the whole thing on an e-commerce platform that's pretty strong as far as capturing the client when they're looking instead of getting a lead and then trying to reach the client who may have decided to go somewhere else because they couldn't talk to someone or complete the transaction.","So, I'm thinking we're seeing some positive growth there and we're -- and they're doing, and we're seeing some strong growth on the low end because of that.","James Schneider","And then maybe relative to the margin outlook you're providing for fiscal '20; it looks like on an apples-to-apples basis, you're calling for margin expansion of a little bit over 50 bips [ph] if I'm not mistaken. So I guess, could you maybe just kind of clarify relative to the reinvestments you've been making, do you feel like you have all the investment you need on the product side at this point to the extent you're going to get incremental leverage off of that investment from [indiscernible]? And then maybe Efrain, you can just clarify what the expected operating margin directly [ph] from Oasis will be for fiscal '20 roughly speaking?","Efrain Rivera","Jim, let me -- those are all interrelated; so you carefully parse what we said, as usual. We said that this year's guidance excluding Oasis, operating margins would be approximately $37, and then the preliminary framework we're saying is between $37 and $38, that would imply exactly what you said. I would caveat one thing Jim, that -- obviously, we could end up a little bit stronger than $37 in which case the leverage will be a little bit less but the premise to your question is valid. So what's happening is that when we invested in year one, you don't see the benefits or the results of that investment in the -- in year one. You get into year two, you're continuing to invest and you start to now get benefits from investments made in year one, that's why I carefully said the net spend that we have relative to the investments we made after tax reform goes down; so you're seeing that in the margin.","And the second thing before I turn it over to Marty to talk a little bit more about that is to say that 'when we think about what that spending has done and will do for us, it becomes a down payment for a roadmap to the future where we're additional opportunities for leverage exists.' Marty mentioned the investments we've made in things like chatbots using AI, NLP, machine learning; and not to be overlooked or things like the e-commerce developments we've put into SurePayroll. And again, we are the first publicly traded company that has created that platform. So all of those now have become things that we can leverage in the business to drive further efficiencies and in some cases, also in additional sales. So, we're getting benefits, it's opening up other pathways that we hadn't considered and that will be a benefit to us in the future.","Martin Mucci","Yes, So, I think everyone's pretty much covered. The investments we made kind of from the tax reform that we talked about starting really last year was that that would do that from a product standpoint. We accelerated the product. In fact, a lot of that rolled out in the first two quarters and then in this quarter from an HR center perspective, we're very happy with that, that we were able to accelerate that. And then on the efficiencies, a lot of it has also been done to create those operating efficiencies. And the chatbot, for example, someone who wants to chat or have a quick answer to a question, 40%, 45% now, I think this last month, are already being answered only by the chatbots. So it doesn't have to go to a live person to handle through chat or live talk. And that is creating some nice efficiencies. And we're able to increase the productivity of our payroll specialist and across the board actually.","So we're actually the chat bot staff in the work that's automated response is going much faster. And I said, given the millions of clients and employees, client employees that have using this, the machine learning is really creating things very quickly. Last month we had -- a month and a half ago, we had about 45 questions answered by the chatbot, different questions that it would accept. Now it's over 100 already because of the machine learning piece of that.","Efrain Rivera","And if I can build on that, it's part of it it's a productivity play, but another part is serving the client better. And so at the end of the day, when you combine that technology with our world-class service capability, you've got a pretty powerful service differentiator. So we're pretty excited about where we are.","James Schneider","Great. And can you just quickly clarify the drag from [indiscernible]?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. Hey, Jim. So, if you look at the page where I put the -- what we put on the IER presentation there, you can do the calculations to get there. You'll see what the impact is. I would say this, the drag year-over-year from an EBITDA perspective is modest and I would say also from an operating margin perspective back then when you go through the calculations, you can call me later on that to make sure you got it. It's not dramatic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley of Wolfe Research.","James Berkley","Thanks, guys. I guess just to start, if you could just help us understand the $20 million range, just what's keeping you from having a little more visibility, I guess, into the contribution from Oasis in the fourth quarter and then some thoughts on costs and revenue synergies over time. Any signs you may be able to accelerate the upselling part of your payroll days, just given the acquisition of Oasis and how much it will reinvest in port, not in the sales force.","Efrain Rivera","So, if you look at it, you have line of sight to what it was in Q3. I've given you a number that's pretty clear. I think it can get to where we think we're going to land. So, I'm reticent to keep changing guidance because we're falling within the range. And I think at this point I called out what I thought the contribution for the first or for the back half of the year is going to be, if you look in the presentation we've detailed what Oasis was for the quarter, about 70 million detailed what it is for Q4. I think we've given a pretty clear roadmap in terms of what we think it will be for the balance of the year.","James Berkley","Okay, understood. I just didn't want to change it there. Just commenting on the cost and revenue synergies over time if you don't mind. ","Efrain Rivera","I think from a cost standpoint, I think a lot of it actually we've already started. There were some synergies of duplication of people. Some of that's already been done and I think we're pretty much far down the road on that one. We also are looking at, obviously, from a cost standpoint, what can we do with the carriers to get better costs and plans in place. And we'll be working those through. It's a little bit early on that one, but we're working through that right now. Organization is in place and the product strategy is working through right now. I don't see a lot of needs of technology investment that needs to be done there right now. So, that should be pretty solid. Sales team is pretty clear on who's got what already that's in place. And I think the cost synergies will again be people, but pretty much done insurance carriers and rates there to lower our cost efficiency and frankly handling -- and I guess I'd say on the revenue side selling more obviously and being able to capture some retirement products in there and more insurance to the degree. We couldn't underwrite them. We drive them to our insurance agency like we do for our PEO. That's something that Oasis did not have before either and now we'll be able to use.","So, we haven't laid out all the quantification. I think in the guidance you see kind of overall where we think it's going to be and frankly, the short-term impact is pretty moderate to the EPS, so we feel pretty good about the margins and everything there. ","James Berkley","Okay, thanks. And then just more generally real quick, I mean, I know, your focus is obviously shifting towards PEO and it's become increasingly important given the ACA and the 50 employee insurance mandate, et cetera. Just could you give any numbers or just an idea just in how much white space you see out there and what percent of the adjustable market's unpenetrated right now and just kind of talk to your longer-term strategy in the space going forward, whether it's around M&A or organic growth, et cetera?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think it's going to be both. I mean primarily organic growth, but we'll continue to look for opportunities like Oasis and other PEOs. And really, it looks like more of an HR outsourcing opportunity because what's changed is a few years ago, the average client size, the needed HR needed retirement, those things, was I would say 25, 30 employees plus. That has come down pretty dramatically. You know, as you've seen the states increase their regulations, that may have come down a bit, but the states have really increased the enforcement and the regulations that they have on things like immigration and whether your workers are legit or not, the retirement plans, the need for retirement plans, all of that has been pushed up and a lot of requirements and the enforcement has picked up where they're looking for revenue from fees and enforcement.","So the need for HR has really grown. So I think there's a lot of white space there. There's a lot of opportunity and it's growing as well. And so you have to be someone who, through your technology and your service, can give that kind of a complete set. So not only are you helping in a tough and a low unemployment market, the first thing you hear constantly in our surveys is I need help recruiting and retaining employees because it's so tough out there to get them. So, you have to offer benefits of a large company, whether you're a smaller or mid, you have to offer benefits, you have to offer mobility options so people can do things. 70% of our clients employees expect that they should be able to do everything on their phone. They don't want to talk to anyone in HR. They don't want to go online. They want every -- or certainly not on paper. They want to do everything mobile. ","And that's all the products that we've been introducing and linking together for a total HR experience. So that helps you bring in employees and it helps you retain and develop your employees so that they stay. And that's exactly what we're responding to. Like retirement, signing up retirement used to be a heavy paper-intensive process for your employees. You want a retirement plan, you push it out there, it's all paper. It's tough to do. You now can have an employee set up their retirement in four clicks on a mobile app, on our mobile app. So, you're making the small and midsize business more competitive and helping them continue to retain those employees as well.","Efrain Rivera","The other thing, James, I'd say is maybe PAYX publishes some data on this, but if you look at the 20 and above space and the amount of worksite employees, which is probably the best way to dimension the opportunity, you're in the multiple tens of millions of worksite employees. If you take the top four PEOs, you barely get to 2 million worksite employees. Now, there are more worksite employees serviced by smaller PEOs. But when you compare that to the amount of worksite employees that exist in 20 and above, which is where now and may in the future be 10 and above, where the sweet spot PEO goes, you have a significant amount of white space and the penetration rates in the low-single is in the mid to low-single digits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I just wanted to continue the discussion on the PEO space. Are you going to market differently with your Oasis product versus your legacy Paychex product?","Martin Mucci","I would say in the short-term probably a little bit differently just because of the brand and so forth and we're working through that now. But the package is what you would say is Oasis has gone more into obviously brand-new clients that have not been on a PEO or any other service with our base, we're working through the client base as well. So we have a team that sells into the client base who has that need and can graduate, I guess I'd say to a PEO. And Oasis and some of the other rest of the team is selling brand new clients to the PEO or HR concept. So a little bit different there. We'll be fixing the brand as we work through what's the best way to approach that, but generally, they're both selling. This is an HR support package that is there. Whether you take the insurance through us or whether we underwrite it through the agency, you have full retirement and payroll and HR administration packages. And so, I would say at a high level, it certainly is being marketed the same way because that's the need of the client that we see out there.","Jeff Silber","Okay. I know during the last recession this was a relatively small piece of the business. I'm not even sure if Oasis was even around then, but can you give us your expectations of what you think might happen in this business if God forbid we go into any type of downturn in the U.S?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think, from an HR standpoint, sometimes in a recession you need HR support more than ever. Certainly, on the small business side that's only payroll for example, you have small businesses, more of them go out of business and fewer of them start up. So you always have some hits there. But I think by expanding and really becoming much more of an HR company and having retirement offerings, insurance offerings, and a much more complete package, that makes us much more resistant to a downturn in the economy. And that's the way we looked at it for the last few years is we've positioned the company to be much more of an HR outsourcing company than just payroll. That's because that is actually more in need in those difficult times. Now you need much more HR decisions to say, \"Hey, what do I do with pay increases? What do I do with insurance offerings? How do I cut costs but keep my people? That's when you need the personalized HR support that we get with over 500 HR generalist. At the same time, the technology, frankly, will make you more efficient as our clients are.","Our clients are becoming much more efficient because of our mobile app that they use now that they don't -- if a client employee now needs to change their address and the system [inaudible 00:52:42] the old days, they go to their HR person or their business owner, they'd have to call us. They would talk to us, they would change it. They don't do any of that now. Now they say to the employee, \"You can change it yourself. You can go in on your mobile app and do everything basically.\" So all those things, the technology changes, the HR focus, the total package that makes us really more resistant and stronger in a recession type era.","Efrain Rivera","So, just to build on what Marty said, if you look at it from a product standpoint, obviously that sticky from a client-side standpoint, you have more resilience because clients typically are larger in a PEO. So, in our payroll, if your payroll only attend to be smaller PEO clients are in a higher size package, which gives them a little bit more ability to withstand a downturn in the economy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. ","Lisa Ellis","Good morning, guys. My first question is related to the ecommerce capability describing for SurePayroll. Can you just talk a little bit more broadly? Is there a big like digital marketing push accompanying this? So, the concept being to get the small business owner over the weekend or whatever sort of Google searching and end up finding Paychex and SurePayroll and being able to onboard entirely independently. Is that sort of -- can you just give a little bit more color around like where this is headed?","Martin Mucci","Yes, it is. It's actually a continuation of -- what we saw was with lead generation, we're doing much stronger job with getting the leads and getting -- typically it's more of a form fill out and then we get back to them where the client context is somehow through the lead and says, \"Get back to me.\" Well, what's the hardest thing to do is get back to a client today, get anyone to answer the phone. So, what we found with ecommerce is not only is it responsive to a client the way they want to set themselves up when they want to do it, weekend nights or whatever, but also that you captured that lead because now you don't have to get back to them. The client will start themselves, they'll compare, they'll see the price, they'll see the product they decided to buy, they're in the mix. And even if they get halfway into it and need to help, that's fine. We have someone ready at all times to be able to just go to someone, either through chat or direct line and talk to them to help them through the process. But you've captured them now as opposed to trying to reach back to them. And that's what I've been, one of the strongest findings through the ecommerce is lead generation is great, but closing that lead at the time that the prospect wants to close it is huge. So that's been the biggest benefit of this thing.","Efrain Rivera","And I'd say that it's not in the future where we launched in Q2 and it's up and running.","Lisa Ellis","Okay. And then on a related note around the investments around technology you've been talking about, do you have initiatives underway that are leveraging your underlying database of employment related data? Meaning you can feed back things like benchmarks or give guidance and advice.","Martin Mucci","Yes, that's already been released. And given the size of our client base and employees of our clients, that can give great data. So we get data, for example, on turnover and there's -- obviously it's had a gross basis kind of pulled together, but it can do it by size as well, size of clients or size of your business and so forth. So yes, we're giving data analytics, something that's been very important to our clients to get data analytics. And most small to mid-size businesses could never get at that data or ever pay for that data in the market that we can give them very quickly using our very large client base. ","Lisa Ellis","Okay, great. And then just last one, Marty, can you just summarize, give really good color around the macroeconomic indicators you see in your business that give you a sense for the overall health of the economy? Can you just run through those meaning employment growth, wage growth and new business formation, etcetera?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think what we've seen, and the small business index is really focused on 50 employees and below, what we've seen is obviously job growth has kind of flattened out here the last few months. And most of that is because there aren't the people out there to hire. So we're still seeing job growth, but the change in job growth is really flattened out to last year down a little bit flat. And we're seeing it kind of across all sectors. You are seeing wage growth probably in the 2.5% to 2.7% range, which has been good. It's coming up. And of course, those earning the least are getting the biggest increases. So they're seeing and those earning minimum wage, etc. because of the minimum wage increases across the country are seeing 3.5% 4% wage increase, sometimes a little bit more where salaried or the higher wage earners are seeing 2% or below 2% is what we're seeing. And that's kind of averaging out.","Across all sectors in jobs, manufacturing kind of has been up and down, but it's down a bit now. Construction is still probably one of the better ones. Other services overall is the strongest, which is discretionary services. There are more part-time jobs. So again, you're seeing a little bit more growth there and a little bit more wage increases there because of a minimum wage changes. Overall, it feels steady, not necessarily heading it, it doesn't feel like it's heading into a recession, it's just job growth has kind of flattened out because it's tough to find people. What we are seeing also is hearing from our clients anecdotally that there is more of those on the fringe that maybe high school graduates instead of college that they're bringing in and training more. So again, for our products it's helpful because they're looking for more training, bring people on that may not have hired before but trying to train them because it's so difficult to find people. And we actually have heard on the negative side probably some businesses saying, \"Hey, I'm not taking some work because I can't find enough people to do it more in the trades and that kind of thing.\" And regionally it's in the south, it's still the strongest, energy has picked back up. So it's been used in tax and Dallas look better. And of course, the Florida, Georgia, generally that area is better for construction both residential and commercial.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the worker's comp part of the insurance. How big is that versus kind of health insurance in terms of importance for your insurance business? And can you elaborate a little bit more on the issue? Is it just a down pricing market or is there more happening there I guess?","Efrain Rivera","So, two parts, Tim. And I want to make sure that it's clear. When we say PEO and insurance and we call out softness and worker's comp, we're calling out specifically the worker's comp revenue in our insurance agency. We're not specifically referring to PEO worker's comp, which is separate conversation. That really is around that. That's a separate discussion. So, roughly, half of our insurance business is worker's comp premiums. And if you look at where we are this year and look at PEO and insurance is about 30% of that number, a little bit less than that it will go to 20% in terms of composition of that revenue. When you look at the insurance and desegregate that part about half worker's comp, half health and benefits, health and benefits is doing fine, you know upper single digit growing reasonably. And workers' comp is where we've seen softness really starting a couple of quarter or so ago and accelerating. And the worker's comp market goes through cycles. So if we had had this discussion a couple of years ago, we would've said, \"Hey, worker's comp is doing great. Premium are up and we're getting our share but the market is soft.\" And when it turns, who knows? But it goes through cycles. We're going through a bit of a softening cycle now.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Fair enough. And can I follow-up on the comments on the selling season? I guess it sounded like obviously it's good overall results, but it sounded much more about telling the broader bundle services than it didn't necessarily client growth. And in particular, I guess for the legacy payroll businesses. Is that accurate, I guess? And can you elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of the ability to grow the client base further for that core kind of payroll [indiscernible] services. ","Efrain Rivera","Hey, Tim Martin can provide color commentary on the selling season. I would just caution to infer that we weren't saying something about unit growth is not a correct assumption. And obviously we don't give the client base per se, but I would say generally we came into the year expecting that the client base would grow and we haven't been disappointed. So, that's what I'd say about unit growth. And Martin can talk a little bit about selling season.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think maybe what -- three off a little bit there. I mean, we had the solid sales growth across the board. In the first half of the year in the third quarter, there was some moderation on the payroll side, but we still had -- probably, when you look overall, we had our best part of growth in three years I'd say and certainly year to date and in that selling season overall. I think on the small business payroll side, I think it was impacted by some things that happened there, but I think we still had good sales, particularly on the inside sales piece and we would expect the see the HR piece stronger because that's what we're pushing the most even and the payroll side, even small business payroll sales folks are leading with the complete package now. We just found that what the clients were looking for. So I think it was a decent selling season and has continued where we've been through the year as good solid growth year-over-year in park.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Just ones up there, when you say inside sales team, is that mostly SurePayroll and the some worksite [ph] employee or what's the market that's served by that part of the sales force?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I'm sorry. Inside sales is not just SurePayroll, it's a pretty good size of sales team, which we've been increasing and they handle frankly, all products as well, but the way they saw everything inside. And they take a lot of the leads, particularly in the small end, they take a lot of the leads that come over the web, but will sell all products over the phone. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JP Morgan. ","Tien-tsin Huang","On the worksite employee front, is it fair to think that units are growing faster than the 17% given lower pass-through's and we see declines in some of the other pressures? It seems like WSE is growing at a good pace.","Martin Mucci","WSEs are growing -- I would say in the range, Tien-tsin. If we were in the quarter it's comparable, I would say. It's a little bit actually below, but in that range.","Tien-tsin Huang","Not strong nonetheless then, okay. Then secondly, just to ensure payroll, do you feel like you've narrowed the gap versus some of the call it the Silicon Valley guys on the distribution front, forget about the product and they talk a lot about product, which is of the distribution side. Do you feel like you've managed to get there?","Martin Mucci","I think the gap was wider and how much better we were then them, but I think we compete very effectively with the kind of the west coast that are out there. I think pricing wise we've come up with some new ways to price as well and to capture that client through things like ecommerce that we've been talking about. So yes, I think we're very competitive with them and frankly, I've seen excellent productivity in sales out of those teams, they've done very well. And the ecommerce, I think as Efrain mentioned as well is really taking off.","Efrain Rivera","Tie-tsin, meshing up your question with Tim's, increasingly to understand the business, you have to go at it in a multichannel approach. You have to figure out what the right blend of feed on the street is internal telesales and then web-based ecommerce sales. And I would say the third piece of that troika was with the ecommerce-based sales. SurePayroll was given that capability and it looks like that opportunity may be additive to the other channels, not necessarily substitute for the other channels. So, we're looking at the results. We got real time data showing us and increasingly in the future to be successful selling not just payroll but HR too. You've got to have a capability in all three of those channels, both over the web direct without a salesperson, field-based sales for the right kind of clients and internal telesales. And our competitors are also playing with that mix to try to figure out what makes sense. I think you need to have all three pieces. Then we have the pieces in place. Now we're in the process of fine-tuning each of those three pieces.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. ","Mark Marcon","What's the things that you're doing? I've got a ton of questions, but I'll limit it to a couple. With regards to just what you're doing on the ecom sales, what percentage of the SurePayroll sales are now coming through that channel?","Martin Mucci","Well, it's pretty small. We started in the last quarter, it was in second quarter and so it's still pretty small, but I think it's going to be growing pretty substantially. And as Efrain, I think Efrain made a very good point there that it we think in addition. So, it's capturing that lead that's coming in and somebody's ready to buy right at that time and doesn't want to call back. And so, I think we're expecting that this will be in addition to kind of the other channels that we've had. ","Mark Marcon","And so, I imagine you're going to end up expanding it across the board in terms of offering this...","Martin Mucci","That would be very likely. Yes.","Mark Marcon","And then with regards to micro segmenting the payroll and HCM market, can you describe the different dynamics when you're taking a look at the growth that you're seeing right now? We've traditionally talked about different sub segments whether it's truly small sub six employees versus six to 20 versus slightly higher and then getting into MMS, where are you seeing the strongest growth?","Efrain Rivera","So, I would say in part because of these technology advances, Mark, we're seeing strong growth in the micro segment. I think we're seeing a reasonable growth in the, I'm going to call it the 5 to 50 a segment, and then mid-market modest. I would say at this point largely due to the fact that the level of competition there is very high. I would add one thing though, if I now say, let's talk about client segment instead of by product and peril, but by client size, now what we see is that 20 and above is increasingly fragmenting into a MMS market and a PEO market. And then on the PEO side, we're doing very, very well. So, if you think about PEO as comprehensive outsourcing, you were just with an SP [ph], it's all your note. If you look at what's happening in that market it's pretty clear that there's a trend in the market towards comprehensive outsourcing and what we're seeing '20 and above is exactly the same thing.","So in our system we either are going to go with that client with potentially an MMS rep or in our mid-market rep or through PEO, and in some cases we've incentivize them to cross-pollinate and we're seeing a lot of success on the PEO side. So I think that's a bit of an overview, I think PEO increasingly needs to be overlaid with -- when you talk about mid-market because it's a solution that mid-market clients are interested in.","Mark Marcon","Totally makes sense. I have been covering the PEOs since the late 90s, so it's interesting to see the acceleration and the increased interest. When we factor in Oasis, just on the operating margin because our call backs a little bit later and so I hope you indulge me on this. But we're scratching it out and it looks to us like maybe the implication would be like around 30 -- so we were saying 37x to 38x; Oasis maybe 37-ish, and maybe that comes out to more like 35\/7, is that with Oasis, is that in the ballpark?","Efrain Rivera","You have a very sharp pencil. Overall, you can look at it. I won't call it out specifically but if you do the math, you're not incredibly far off. But I would caution one thing, it's Gregg and I; I would say increasingly, we think about the business also from an EBITDA margin perspective. So we've given you all the pieces there to calculate, we've also called out what we expect the margin to be next year, and there is not a lot of strange adjustments, it's pretty -- it will be very clear on the face of the cash flow statement, and net income to get to a margin number but that's what I'd say about that. And then this is from a longer range -- and from a really longer term perspective, there is two different dynamics that are occurring. One is you're early on in terms of the implementation of some of these efficiency measures as it relates to chatbot, and everything that that can end up doing from an efficiency in a service model perspective which would obviously increase margins. On the flipside we've got adding PEO which -- it's growing faster so from a mix perspective that's going to drive the margins down. How do we think about the balance of those two from a longer term investor expectation perspective?","Martin Mucci","So Mark, I guess I would say two things on that. One is assuming current mix when we get through the full year of Oasis, we would expect to come into 2021 and proving Mark margins off the '20 base; so that would be your expectation. Caveating it as I've been saying for 18 months, that if PEO growth accelerates even faster than we anticipate, which is still good -- teams growth, then that could impact that perspective. The other thing that could impact it is, I called out what management solutions; management solutions growth in that area because it carries a higher margin, it would be an offset but I think those are all the factors that as you plug in a model you'd have to evaluate.","Mark Marcon","And then Marty, one last one; the client scores with regards to the clients that are being serviced through the chatbots; how is that trending relative to more traditional?","Martin Mucci","Yes, very, very good. We look at it from a number of ways, we don't always get them to do enough client sat but you get to that early, getting at -- we're watches very closely is; we just had a meeting on this earlier this week. How much or how many of the questions are answered in the first question that they ask, how many are going to a service provider because they're not getting the answer; and that's being refined all the time. What we're seeing is that increase from 40% are being answered by the chatbot itself, now up to 45% in just a month. And I think if we look out three months or six months from now, I think that would be -- we're hoping that that is quite a bit higher. And that will be -- that's an indication to us that they're getting their answer you know. Now we also have other feedback channels and so far we're getting good feedback that the answer is being there. And again, you start with 30 questions, then it goes to 50; now we're over 100 because of the machine learning part of that of refining the question and understanding the natural language of what's the client asking for? What are they really asking for? And are we responding with the right answer.","So it's pretty early but if there is early stage they have 45% answered by the chatbot itself is very strong we think. So we're getting good positive feedback on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.","James Faucette","I wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions. First, on Oasis, you made it pretty clear that you're tracking pretty close to what you thought; what should we look at as the potential, most likely sources of variants either positively or negative things that you should -- that you're tracking that we should be aware of that could cause some variance there. And then just a follow-up question quickly on the chatbot comments from the last question; it sounds like you're improving the response rate pretty nicely, what's your sense and what are your systems; people telling you as kind of an ultimate feeling for the chatbots at least within a reasonable time frame. Thanks.","Martin Mucci","I'll start with that, when I think it's around -- it's still really pretty, early, you know get a lot of great data on this. But I think if we could get 70 in a long-term; if you could get 70% answered by the bot by itself, I think that's pretty strong based on today's standards; so having only been in it pretty early heading towards 50, we feel really good about it. And you do get an awful lot of data, you know big given our use of it, we're able to change it pretty quickly and enhance it based on the number of people that are using it. So I think it's heading towards you -- I think it would be good to add toward a 60% to 70% response because there's always nuances that people may want to talk to a live person but that is changing pretty rapidly. This is really in response to the way that client doesn't as you probably know, most younger clients, in particular, don't want to talk to somebody they just soon chat or and have -- and if it's a chatbot that gets the answer, and by the way this is going to expand pretty dramatically to taking you --- not only answering your question but saying do you want me to take you there? So, where do I find my checked stuff; it's here today, now it says it's here; go here, now next it that will be let me take you there by hitting this.","James Faucette","And if the question is how do I do something? It will evolve to video -- short streaming video that will show you in 30 seconds or less this is how you do it or you can contact somebody. So that will all continue to evolve the way the client needs it, first question.","Martin Mucci","On Oasis, I think that we have a pretty good handle now on both revenue and expenses in the business, there are targets that we have said internally in terms of cost savings that we're measuring against the business, they are comprehensive in at least the framework that we gave you. So we'll be looking at that and obviously, success winning clients is an important part of the equation as we head into next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neil [ph] of Autonomous Research.","Unidentified Analyst","Real quick housekeeping question on the preliminary outlook for fiscal 2020. What are your interest rate assumptions on the funds?","Martin Mucci","Interest rate assumptions in 20; interest rate assumptions -- we didn't include them in part because we needed to see where the Fed is at this point but we would assume that there really are not going to be rate increases there, so you'd see some modest increase on our client -- our interest on funds health for clients at this point that's what we think is more likely scenario, hopefully, we don't end up in a scenario where it goes the other way but we tend to doubt that that's what's going to happen.","Unidentified Analyst","I know you've been asked a bit about some of the sort of Silicon Valley start-up competitive dynamic already, and in previous calls you've been asked more pointedly about square, and I think just going there and well-known name, it comes up a lot in discussions; is that something that you're seeing more or hearing about more, is it still kind of a different market with respect to your kind of customer base and your targets and their true kind of micro merchant addressable market?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think Matt, some of the market is the same but we have not seen or heard much from that. They have like they announced, getting into the payroll was more a payroll mobile app but it was only for employers, for example, and I think it's still that way. There is not an employee mobile approximately, and that was -- and frankly, something like that. So it got a lot of press, I think that's as far as they went or at least the last that we've seen. And the employee piece is really the biggest piece of the mobile app and we feel like we have a very competitive mobile app with a 5-star kind of rating at this point, so we're feeling very good that that's very competitive and we have not seen any takeaways or any real feedback of people leaving to go to square. I think it rounds out their product set from the credit card processing standpoint but we have not seen it as someone who's going to go there necessarily for payroll in a mobile payroll approximately, that's only for the employer.","Unidentified Analyst","So, probably hunting more within their own existing merchant client base as opposed to the greenfield opportunities out there more broadly where you're a lot more established?","Martin Mucci","Yes, I think so. And that plus, I think anyone who would look at that, even though you may have your processing through them, I think if anybody was really looking for an app that provided a full feature employer and employee access and gave the full features of retirement and payroll and HR administration along the app, I don't think there be any comparison.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin [ph] of Citibank.","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to kind of get into your statement on introducing the discussion on EBITDA margins, as well as saying that you're now thinking of the business more on the EBITDA basis; is that a comment on future capital allocation, user cash, and should we sort of maybe combining that with the comment on low PEO penetration implies more Oasis type deals; how should I think of that?","Martin Mucci","I think to some degree as Efrain mentioned and he mentioned in his comments, that does make some sense to the fact that amortizations and so forth, we want to make sure that it's very clear where the margins really are because of the PEO business, and sometimes the impact on operating margins versus the margins from an acquisition type standpoint; so I think you're certainly right on that and Efrain I think mentioned that. But on a go-forward basis, we're certainly looking very much at organic growth and combining the strength, here we bought the largest private PEO in the business and we feel like that integration is going very well, and so will we continue -- part of Oasis's plans were to continue roll-ups of other PEOs to add more strength to their offerings and we'll look at continuing to do that, will it be the size of Oasis, not really because there is no one out there of that size but I think that their strategy of rolling up and was part of ours as well will probably continue.","Unidentified Analyst","And just switching gears a bit; as your existing client employees sort of go through the current tax filing process and tax season; are you beginning to maybe see a change in withholding? Is it potentially maybe surprised with their returns and so on or is it too early to tell? Any comment on future withholding patterns?","Martin Mucci","I think we haven't really seen it yet. I think it might be a little bit too early until the filing date of April even though people file early. I think they are -- you do get anecdotal evidence that certainly people are looking at it, and asking a lot of questions of their tax preparers like how do I avoid this next time, and so probably we would expect to see withholdings go up a little bit, and therefore, probably the cash balances up a little bit but it would -- it's a little bit early to see that just yet.","Unidentified Analyst","And last question. It's been asked a couple of different ways, the digital option that you spoke about -- and you mentioned that you might be seeing demand for this in other parts of your tech stack; can you talk about how you're thinking of the level of future tech investment, as well as whether this makes you rethink your -- sort of your conditional sales force process?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think you're talking more of the e-commerce but I mean, overall we're always looking -- as Efrain said, like even the sales -- while the sales process has definitely been changing, and I feel like we've been changing and to some degree a few years ago catching up, now I feel like we're in pretty good shape with the lead and demand-gen investment that we used from some of the tax reform money in the last year to 18 months. We really have found how to capture much more data on clients even searching for Paychex, how to get more of those leads, and also how to deal with leads that are not -- that need to be nurtured as we would say; so that aren't ready to buy yet but you don't just lose those, you put them in a process where they're nurtured, and I'm sure you're aware of this -- with papers -- white papers on HR and you build the credibility of Paychex, so when they are ready to buy they're right there. So the increase in the way we've handled this from a digital process and a much more defined data analytics is much stronger than ever, we've been very good on the data analytics for using our client data that say when someone might have an issue or might be ready to leave us or something like that but this lead generation has gotten a lot tighter.","And then, the next-generation, the further generation of that is this e-commerce platform, it's sure right now which -- we also found that the leads maybe great, we may be able to get a hold of a lot more prospects but it's hard -- but we may get a lot more prospects but it's really hard to reach them. And so e-commerce allows them to come in, decide, and select and start going down the process, and that is a much more powerful tool probably than we even expected as far as capturing new leads. So we're constantly looking at this, the data collection and data analytics is becoming such a bigger part of the service model and the sales model, and I feel like we've got the right people on it and the right tools in place.","Unidentified Analyst","And there was a part of that question on the absolute level of tax spent?","Martin Mucci","I think we're at a pretty good percentage of revenue and we kind of stick to that. I think we had obviously an enhancement to that last year but we feel like we can get back to a pretty levelized [ph] -- level of tax spending and we're doing pretty good with that. We've also find ways to be more productive in the tech side as well, and what our spend is by how we're doing some of that.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel.","David Grossman","First, can we -- if you look at organic PEO growth and fiscal '19; can you help to segregate the -- kind of WSE growth versus insurance and any other pricing dynamics that maybe impacting growth?","Martin Mucci","When you say impacting growth, what do you mean David? I'm not sure.","David Grossman","Well, I'm just trying to just segregate I think [indiscernible].","Martin Mucci","So we've seen teens growth in revenue, I called out on the script where we are in terms of PEO and insurance growth. When you look at the PEO again growing in the teens, worksite employees growing in the teens; some quarters we've been a little bit above, some quarters a little bit below but you're getting the contributions coming from the fact that you're getting good worksite employee growth, not necessarily because of pricing or add-ons from past-throughs; so I'd say that. When you do segregate a little bit of the change in the growth rate that I called out, it really is a function of the fact that the insurance portion of PEO and insurance is growing more slowly than the PEO. And then we've got this drag that really is more of a second half of the year event that will persist into next year, and it could change -- markets change. But if you look at the underlying PEO, we expect it to grow in the teens and we would expect our worksite employee growth to grow comparable, that's excluding Oasis. Including Oasis the growth rate comes down a little bit just simply because it's a larger business, you -- the law of large numbers starts to take place, and we expect to get a combination of both, worksite employee growth and new client growth to drive that, the growth that's embedded in the outlook that we gave.","David Grossman","And just following up in terms of the composition of the PEO; I mean obviously two significant acquisitions in the last 1.5 year or 2 years, can you give us just the sense of what that PEO looks like today excluding the ASO? For example, I know you report a combined WSE number, can you give us a sense for what the PEO is excluding the ASO? What your mix is between white, blue and grey [ph], and which are at-risk -- kind of percentage of insurance business?","Efrain Rivera","So, the first thing is look, our client base is blue-grey or grey-blue, less white and more grey-blue; and obviously, we want the composition of that base to moderate more grey overtime than simply blue. So we'll look at that, that has a lot of implications as you know because you know the industry very well in terms of rates of healthcare attachment and workers comp rates but we feel we're in a good place there. If you look at where we are from a worksite employee perspective, having disclosed it but if you look at number 1 and you know what that number is, and you know where number 3 is, we're number 2 right in the middle of the two; so that will give you a sense of where we are from a worksite employee standpoint. And so we think in that space that Oasis has and I'll come back to something Marty said earlier, in that space that the combination of the Paychex PEO and also HROA [ph] and Oasis occupied, there is a lot of opportunity there, and right now our at-risk insurance and others non-guaranteed cost insurance is primarily limited to the Florida market. And everything else that -- so the only thing that we are reporting as pass-through revenues is the minimum premium revenues largely, the minimum premium revenues that we're collecting in Florida which is a percentage, it's not half of the percent of what we sell on health insurance, it's pretty -- it's a pretty carefully controlled amount of risk that we're taking.","So if you look at everyone else in the industry, we occupy a middle ground between the position that the largest competitor takes which is all currently guaranteed costs, and others that are all at-risk; we carefully control the amount of that risk insurance that we have.","David Grossman","And then just finally, in the spirit of abusing that time limit here; workers comp comment, you know, I -- because of the blue-grey composition; why isn't that the workers comp dynamic in the insurance side of your business isn't impacting the PEO business as well? I would think more favorably [indiscernible] what's going on.","Efrain Rivera","In the PEO because you've got a bundle, you can offset the pieces of the of bundle that you're selling, so in a steady state you would have some impact but the reality is you're balancing that between the amount of healthcare insurance you're selling and the amount of workers comp that's attaching, and also the amount of admin fees you're charging. Our PEO is a little bit different probably than anyone else in the industry; when we underwrite a PEO customer, we do -- we make a determination; do we want you in our risk pool because if we don't want you in our risk pool, we're going to send you to our insurance agency and you're going to get priced that way. So we've got a little bit more control on the PEO side and through the extent that we don't like to risk, we basically offset -- we offload the risk to specialized carriers that don't mind dealing with that level of risk. So the net of what I just said is; it really doesn't have much of an impact on the on the PEO side.","Operator","Thank you. I will now return the call to Martin Mucci for any additional or closing remarks.","Martin Mucci","Great. Thank you. At this point we will close the call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn your call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Mr. Mucci, you may begin.","Martin Mucci","Thank you and thank you for joining us for the discussion of Paychex\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings results. Joining me today on the call is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning before the market opened we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2015. We will file our Form 10-Q which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter by the end of the day. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.","On today\u2019s call, I will update you on the highlights in our operations, sales and product development areas, Efrain will talk through our third quarter financial results and our guidance as we wrap up fiscal 2015, and then we will open it up for your questions.","We were pleased with our third quarter results as we continue to make good progress toward our key initiatives. Our selling season execution was very strong, producing double-digit growth in new annualized revenues sold, we\u2019re pleased with that. We also continued to our success in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements and increasing our web leads in addition to our CPA referral channel.","We remain focused on selling great value to our clients, helping them realize the full breadth of technology and service that Paychex has to offer. Demand for our HR outsourcing solutions continues to advance with gains in both clients and worksite employees. This has made a significant contribution to our double-digit growth in HRS revenue. Payroll service revenue continues to advance as a result of increases in revenue per check and client based growth.","Total service revenue increased 8% for the third quarter, 9% for the nine months. As we have expanded our portfolio of SaaS based bundled offerings. Paychex Flex, which includes online time and attendance in HR administration among many other capabilities, we\u2019ve also greatly enhanced our personalized dedicated service.","Paychex Flex offers powerful workforce management capabilities in a simple and streamlined user experience. Our new service initiative also offers clients the flexibility of choice for their service needs. This approach gives clients access to a variety of customer service options based on their size and complexity including our 7\/24 customer service.","Our mobility app continues to see a fast growing number of users both clients and their client employees. This app provides a single, easily accessed mobile source to all of the products and information that the client subscribes to from us. We have continued to add more functionality including last quarter\u2019s web time punch capability.","We\u2019re also gaining additional market acceptance of our new full service product to help clients navigate healthcare reform. We are uniquely positioned to leverage payroll data with our nationally recognized insurance agency and our clients assist and offer our clients assistance and value in understanding the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on their business and employees.","We help our clients navigate these complex requirements, avoid fines and penalties and reduce the administrative work necessary to remain in compliance with the law.","Our operations team let us through a good year in for our clients producing and distributing W2s ahead of schedule and continuing to keep our client service and retention at record levels.","We recently released the newest version of our Applicant Tracking system, myStaffingPro, which has expanded mobility and new features designed to enhance the job candidate experience by reducing data entry, improving completion rates and providing ability to create candidate differentiators. This improved candidate experience helps our clients increase their applicant pools and can also utilize the enhanced tools to better screen their applicant.","In summary, we had a solid quarter and made progress on many fronts including strong sales execution, service delivery, product development and deployment and financial performance. I appreciate the great work of our entire Paychex's team across the country.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer to review the financial results in more detail. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks, Marty and good morning to everyone.","I\u2019d like to remind you what I customarily remind you that during today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk, refer to the 10-Q for a full discussion of these risks.","Before I get into the specifics of the quarter results. I'd just like to say that fourth quarter expectations for payroll and HRS revenue indicate that we'll meet the full year guidance that we've provided throughout the year, more on fiscal 2015 guidance later on.","In addition we introduced our minimum premium plan health insurance offering for PEO clients and worksite employees in the third quarter of last year. We have just passed the anniversary of this new health insurance offering and we have seen strong acceptance by our PEO clients.","Due to the self insurance provisions within the new offering, certain PEO direct costs are now classified as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. This change had no impact on operating income although it did have some impact on margin as those of you who have been looking at our results over the last three quarters understand.","This new health insurance offering did not have a impact on our fiscal 2015 third quarter and nine month results. As Marty indicated, our third quarter financial results for fiscal 2015 represent continued progress building on the solid start we experienced through the first half of the year.","Here are some of the key highlights I will provide detail in certain areas and then I\u2019m going to wrap with a review of our full year 2015 outlook. Total service revenue grew 8% for the third quarter to $694 million and 9%, $2 billion for the nine months.","Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the third quarter and 3% for the nine months to $11 million and $31 million respectively. These fluctuations were driven by an increase in average investment balances.","Expenses increased 10% for the third quarter and 11% for the nine months primarily in compensation related costs and the PEO direct costs that I mentioned previously. Driving a portion of this increase in PEO direct cost, the new health insurance offering accounted for approximately 3 percentage points of the growth in total expenses for the third quarter and 4 percentage points of the growth year-to-date.","The plan has grown significantly in the number of worksite employees enrolled in the plan since it began a year ago. The increase in compensation related cost was driven by higher employee benefit related cost, together with higher sales headcount and performance based comp cost associated with the strong sales execution that Marty mentioned. We also continued to support investment and product development.","Operating income net of certain items increased 6% for the third quarter and for the nine months grew to $254 million and $771 million respectively. We maintained strong operating margins and anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance range, which I\u2019ll discuss shortly.","Diluted earnings per share increased 5% to 46% per share for the third quarter and 8% to $1.41 per share for the nine months. Net income increased 6% to $169 million for the third quarter and 7% to $514 million for the nine months.","Turning to payroll service revenue, it increased 2% for the third quarter and 4% for the nine months. We benefited from increases in revenue per check in client base. Revenue per check growth resulted from price increases net of discounting along with the impact of increased product penetration.","Checks per payroll grew, but at a more moderate rate than we had projected. We expected payroll revenue results for the third quarter to moderate as we shared during the second quarter earnings call.","As we indicated in last quarter's call, timing shifts between the quarters and lower checks per payroll drove the results. We expect a return to more normalized growth rate in the fourth quarter expected to be comparable to the first half of the year and full year guidance for payroll revenue remains unchanged.","Turning to HRS, revenue increased 19% for both the third quarter and for the nine months. We experience strong growth in both clients and worksite employees at Paychex's HR services.","The new minimum premium health insurance offering also contributed five percentage points of the growth in HRS revenue during the third quarter. Retirement services revenue benefited from pricing together with increases in the number of planned and average asset value of participant funds.","Insurance services benefited from the ramp up of our new full service offering to comply with healthcare reform requirements, a moderate increase in the number of health and benefit applicants and higher premiums in our Workers Comp insurance product. Our online HR administrative services continue to experience growth in clients.","Turning to our investment portfolio, our continued goal is to protect principle and optimize liquidity. We invest in high quality lower risk instruments primarily variable rate demand notes and bank demand deposits for short-term funds and municipal bonds for our longer term portfolio.","Our longer term portfolio has an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 0.9% for the third quarter and 1% for the nine months consistent with same periods last year.","Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the third quarter and nine months, primarily driven by wage inflation together with growth in the client base. We are now on a gradual upswing from the impact of the client new rates that begin in 2008.","Our average reinvestment yields are now meeting or slightly exceeding the weighted average yield on our longer term portfolio. As such we are not seeing a significant negative impact from turnover in the portfolio.","The Fed has indicated that it is possible that they will raise rates later in the year, which could have a positive impact on our interest income earned on our client and corporate portfolios.","We\u2019ll now walk you through highlights of our financial position; it remains strong with cash and total investments of approximately $1 billion as of the end of the quarter and no debt.","Funds held for clients as of February 28, 2015 were $5.1 billion compared to $4.2 billion as of May 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and average $4.4 billion for the quarter and $3.9 billion for the nine months. This reflects growth of 3% for both periods.","Total stockholders' equity was $1.9 billion as of February 28, 2015, reflecting $414 million in dividends paid during the nine months and 1.7 million shares repurchased for approximately $70 million.","Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 36%. Cash flows from operations were $693 million for the first nine months, a slight decrease from the prior year. The change was the result of fluctuations in working capital partially offset by higher net income.","The fluctuations in working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of income tax payments, you look at the prepaid line on the cash flow statement you see the end collections from clients, payments for compensation PEO payroll. It\u2019s common for our working capital to fluctuate between quarters.","Now let me turn to fiscal 2015 guidance and I\u2019ll keep it fairly short. I\u2019d like to remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant change and I\u2019ll just summarize it by saying our guidance has unchanged from what we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year.","Before I turn things over to Marty, I want to let you know that Paychex will be hosting Investor Day in mid-July. We're working on a transportation friendly day, so you can get in and out on the same day, if you are on the East Coast or the Mid-West, sorry for those on the West Coast, get for you how to make that work.","It\u2019s going to be scheduled for Wednesday, July 15 here in Rochester. We\u2019ll post a save the date message on our IR website and we will be providing registration information and other details in mid-April. We hope to see many of you in the summer.","I'll turn it back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Thanks Efrain, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] That question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Togut","Thank you and good morning.","Martin Mucci","Hi David.","David Togut","Can you provide a little more detail on the underlying drivers behind the double-digit growth in new annualized revenue, as told during the peak selling season? In particular, breakdown between payroll service and HR services bookings?","Martin Mucci","Well David we don\u2019t usually give that much detail on it but I will tell you that we were strong across the Board. I would say both payroll -- all areas of payroll as well as HRS, were both very strong and probably the best sales and we had a pretty good sales we had seen over the last year.","But this is probably the best sales results in a selling season we\u2019ve seen in I would say seven or eight years.","David Togut","What accounts for that?","Martin Mucci","Well I think very good execution on the sales side. I also think that the channels that we\u2019ve been developing from our constant CPA channel has been continuing to be strong.","The bank channel, we've picked up a lot from the bank channel from a referral standpoint. We\u2019ve also added a number of franchise arrangements for where the supported or the preferable company for payroll and I think we\u2019ve just done a good job overall also team selling.","So going in is not just payroll and then coming back to sell the other ancillary services but going in right up front in selling the full value of all of the products to the client right up front.","So we\u2019ve seen good growth in payroll. We\u2019ve seen good growth in HRS, in the Affordable Care Act products, our employers shared responsibility product has been strong and certainly HR outsourcing both PEO and ASO all have been strong.","I think its execution. I think it\u2019s a lot of work that the Head of Sales, Mark Bottini, he has been doing with that team to build a good referral and pipeline as well.","David Togut","With that rate of new annualized recurring revenue growth taken together with your current client retention trends, point to a change in your revenue growth rate for FY'16 and FY'17?","Martin Mucci ","Well, I can\u2019t really get into guidance, now I think we will have a better sense of that at the next quarter to talk about '16 but certainly bodes well for a start anyway.","David Togut","Thank you very much.","Martin Mucci","Okay. Thanks David.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","George Mihalos","Hey guys thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to start off on the core payroll side, the growth of 2%. I guess I'm closer like 2.4%, the way we calculated. But, anything else to call out there aside from timing, meaning was there any sort of slippage maybe on the pricing side 2Q to 3Q or a bit of a slower rate of client growth, or anything else?","Martin Mucci","Yes good question, so client growth no, pricing no, checks a little bit less than we expected. So little bit color on that. So we\u2019ve seen moderation in checks per payroll. We\u2019re not calling it out specifically because when it\u2019s trending around 1% it really is not a significant contributor to revenue overall.","But what we did see was that checks have just been a little lighter, were a little bit lighter in the quarter than we anticipated. Now just two more points of detail on that, what's interesting about that number is again I ruled out client and I ruled out price, because that\u2019s not a driver here.","Timing is primarily the reason, but secondarily what\u2019s going on is that even though we saw an increase in the amount of bonus dollars that we paid in checks, that\u2019s what we seem to be seeing in the data.","We actually saw a slight decrease in the amount of bonus checks. So it looks like people were being paid a little bit more in bonuses, but the size of those bonuses resulted in lower checks.","So it was a little bit lighter and that really kind of drove much of the difference in payroll service revenue. We\u2019ve accounted for that as we look forward.","I think we\u2019re just in this environment now where with check per client or check per payroll growth is going to be moderate going forward. So that's some color on that point.","George Mihalos","Okay. Appreciate that commentary. And then just my second question, on the prior earnings call, I think you guys talked a little bit about M&A and your appetite to do something there. Just curious what you're seeing out there in the marketplace and if you still have an appetite for, I guess what you would consider a large scale acquisition in addition to any tuck-ins?","Martin Mucci","Yes we do, I think there is -- we still a see a lot available, we\u2019re looking at more than we probably ever have in the past, everything is pretty highly valued.","So we\u2019re going to be very selective as to what we do, but we\u2019re looking at both something that would be product tuck-ins, but also just add to the base because we think whether it\u2019s PEO, payroll or other services, we think we\u2019re pretty effective at what we're -- how we're executing and it\u2019s a good time to acquire.","May not find something, but we are pretty deep into number of things we\u2019re looking at the time, and size would be -- we would be very selective, but we certainly have the cash to do it if that makes sense.","George Mihalos","And just to be clear, you\u2019re going to be sticking to your sort of a payroll acquisition or something in that area or in HRS services, you\u2019re not going to any sort of other areas?","Martin Mucci","Yes that\u2019s correct.","George Mihalos","Okay. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi Jason.","Ryan Cary","Hi guys this is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. I just want to build on George's question. Although you reiterated the full-year guide of 3% to 5% for the payroll services, has your outlook on where you might fall in that range changed at all after this quarter meaning, do expect 4Q to make up for any of the moderate softness or a little bit below that range we saw in 3Q?","Martin Mucci","When we issue guidance, we expect to be somewhere around the middle for the year. I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now.","Ryan Cary","Okay. Great. And do you see any material changes in the competitive environment as you got deeper into the peak calendar year-end selling season and I have to ask a question on pricing as well.","Last quarter you seemed comfortable pricing would stay in that say 2% to 4% band. Has that been any material change in either direction over the last quarter? I would love any additional color. Thanks so much.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I don\u2019t think so. We didn\u2019t literally see because actually we felt very good about the quarter from a selling perspective.","I would say the competitive environment was about the same, didn\u2019t see any extra pricing pressure. There is always competitive pricing pressure out there, but we didn\u2019t see anything pick up necessarily there was no big competitor plans or things that they were doing that we saw that made any big difference there.","So I would say pricing is generally holding like we thought it was last quarter and competitive environment about the same.","Ryan Cary","Great, thanks so much.","Martin Mucci","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Sara Gubins -- on behalf of Sara Gubins, your line is open.","David Ridley Lane","Sure so Efrain, you mentioned that some payroll service revenue was being deferred from third quarter into fourth quarter. Now that you're through this third quarter, could you give us a sense of magnitude of that, and this is David Ridley Lane for Sara Gubins.","Efrain Rivera","I thought it was you David, David I think it\u2019s implicit in what I said that we expect to be somewhere in the middle of the range if you heard my comments earlier, I said that that fourth quarter was comparable to the first half of the year and a kind of I will leave it at that.","David Ridley Lane","Okay and then could we get an update on the sensitivity of the portfolio to the first 25 or 50 basis points interest rate increase?","Efrain Rivera","Yes on the short term, it\u2019s going to be about $4 million somewhere in the range to little bit less, little bit more. And that just assume the short term prices. What that does to a long-term rage is a good question. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball on that and timing at this point, our best estimate is Q2, but again our crystal ball has been exceedingly fuzzy.","David Ridley Lane","Got it, thank you very much.","Efrain Rivera","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Smitti with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Smitti Srethapramote","Thank you. I just had a couple of follow-up questions on the minimum premium plan, maybe you can talk about how the claims have trended versus your expectations and whether you\u2019ve got in any closer to rolling out this offering to more states?","Martin Mucci","Yes, so I would say that claims experience thus far has been about what we expected. We\u2019re pretty conservative in terms of our approach and takes kind of belt and suspenders view from an actuarial perspective.","We have two actuaries look at it and have pretty extensive conversations about how we set prices. I think one thing that I just like to reiterate from our perspective the PEO is not a insurance play. It\u2019s an HR outsourcing play. So we understand the payrolls of selling cheap insurance in the PEO and it\u2019s not a direction we want to go in.","So I think claims have trended about where we expected them to be. I didn\u2019t get -- I forgot the second half of your question, Smitti.","Smitti Srethapramote","Just can you give us an update in terms of your plans to roll out the offering to more states?","Martin Mucci","Yes, at this point, we\u2019re still getting through kind of a full year of this one. We feel very good about it. As Efrain said, I think we\u2019ve done very well on the claims and so forth, but it\u2019s a year into it and we don\u2019t have immediate plans to expand it outside of the area but that is where a big amount of our sales are. So I think we'll give it a more experience before we look to expand it.","Smitti Srethapramote","And just falling along on the minimum plan, can you talk about how the client ramped has look like over the past year and whether you switch clients over or whether it\u2019s really new clients signing up for the product?","Martin Mucci","It\u2019s primarily new clients that we\u2019re signing up. When we initially did it, we obviously moved existing clients on to the plan, now what we're doing is we're selling new clients.","I would say PEO client base is growing nicely double-digit. So I would -- one thing I hope we\u2019re not leaving the impression that it's the minimum premium plan driving PEO growth, it really is that there is a lot of interest in the market now for bundled HR outsourcing solutions plus that would also include healthcare and that\u2019s driving the market.","Smitti Srethapramote","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Good.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","Yes. Can you help us contrast the double-digit growth in annualized new sales? I guess what was that growth number a year or two ago? How much of an improvement is that versus what you've seen in the last couple of years?","Martin Mucci","Well, I would say it's certainly gone from single-digit fairly flat actually to single-digit to now double-digit in par annualized revenue and so this is as I said, I think this is probably the best selling season we've seen in seven or eight years.","So I think every good execution. I think it's much stronger than last year, which was pretty good and as I said its very much across the Broad. So it's not just PEO in the HRS services.","It's a good team selling. We're seeing good payroll and HR outsourcing 401(k) really across the Board. I think this is very good execution and I do think obviously the market is coming back a little bit from a small business in mid size business environment.","So I would say how I characterize them is best in seven or eight years from an increased standpoint from a total par standpoint.","Tim McHugh","But last year it was improved, but you did have a still kind of mid single digits last year even.","Efrain Rivera","It was in single digits. I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as mid single digits.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And does it change your thoughts on. I think you've talked about trying to get unit growth or client growth back up to kind of somewhere in the 1% to 3% range. What are your thoughts on that as you I guess exit this selling season based on what you saw?","Martin Mucci","Well it's still a combination. We want the units and the revenue both and that\u2019s the way our comp plans and our incentives are set. So we're still looking for both and we're still trying to -- we certainly expect to be in that range from client growth perspective.","Tim McHugh","But you want to be I guess I was trying to see if you would increase that range given the sale season or if it's in other words I guess if you still would say 1% to 3%.","Martin Mucci","Yes, I would still -- no I would stay in that range from client growth perspective. I think this is an ability to sell higher revenue per client. As much as product it is selling more complete bundles to clients and more complete and more ancillary services as well.","So I think client growth would still be in that same range. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily bring that up, but I think we are selling more revenue per client because of the better execution the team selling etcetera.","Tim McHugh","Okay great.","Martin Mucci","Thanks Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Kartik Mehta","Hi Efrain, hi Marty. Efrain, you talked a little bit about the float. Are we at a point, now, if we assume that rates stay kind of where they are and don't worry about increases, that float income year-over-year should be flat and if rates go up you could start seeing an increase there?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I think you should see it tick up modestly. Yes, I think that\u2019s where we are at. We've kind of -- we've weathered the storm and the storm appears to have passed. Hopefully we're not in the eye of something, but its seems to be that the worst certainly has passed and from the perspective of the portfolio and how we will manage it interest rates now just represent upside as I like to say the embedded optionality of the stock.","Kartik Mehta","And Marty, you talked a little bit about price increases and this quarter we haven't seen, really, any increased competition. As you look at the next price increase, which I think you usually do sometime in the May timeframe, anything change in the environment which would change your mind as to the type of price increase you would do this fiscal year compared to what you were able to do the current fiscal year?","Martin Mucci","No I think we would still be in that same range. I think we got more sophisticated as to kind of where we put the price increase based on clients, products and the competitive nature of those products with the portfolio of different products we have, but I still think you would expect us to be in that -- you should expect us to be in that 2% to 4% range.","Kartik Mehta","And then just one last question. Efrain, you alluded to this a little bit when you were talking about the PEO and I'm wondering, is there a way to quantify any ATA benefits you're getting? And, if that benefit goes away next year? Or, is the PEO at least the way you look at it and the HRS business, the trends are fairly strong, so we should continue to see the growth you've been witnessing?","Efrain Rivera","My initial answer to that is that I would expect a continuation of trends, having said that we are going through the planning process and having our usual discussion with sales about what we think is attainable. I think we are -- its fair to say we're in a favorable environment. How we set that for next year\u2019s plan still remains to be decided.","Kartik Mehta","Thank you very much.","Efrain Rivera","You are welcome.","Operator","And the next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC. Your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi Gary.","Gary Bisbee","Hi. Good morning. Just going back to the minimum premium plan for one more question. Can you give us a sense, is that growing much more quickly than other PEO?","And I guess now that we've annualized you adding that, I'm trying to think, will that be growing faster and thus be somewhat of a drag on margins even though there's a little profit impact for several more quarters? Or, is most of that behind you now that you've got the introduction of that?","Martin Mucci","I think the next quarter is when it will pretty much anniversary Gary. So we will see a little bit a drag into next quarter and then starting the following quarter it should be a more fair compare, but the point you are making is a fair one to the extent that more PEO clients attach healthcare. It does have a slight drag on margins, simply because we don\u2019t get much a margin flow through. But, after fourth quarter it shouldn\u2019t be significant.","Gary Bisbee","Okay great. And then I think we all know PEO -- because of the pass through, somewhat lower margin, but when you look at the mix of new business and just the composition of your growth in the last year or two and going forward, how do we think about the puts and takes around margins?","Is stuff -- a lot of stuff coming in at a lower margin? Or, some of it is incrementally more profitable to existing customers? What are the main issues?","Martin Mucci","Yes. So Gary. That\u2019s a good question. The answer is if you look at most of HRS with the exception of PEO, if I take all of those products, they're all growing pretty strongly and they all have margins that are comparable to payroll. One exception to that is insurance, but it's still too small to exert an overall drag on margin. So the answer is we shouldn\u2019t see significant delusion there.","There may be a moderate impact if PEO really, really starts to grow much faster than everything else. It's been growing nicely but it's part of the mix and its reflected in our results. So unless that really took off, it shouldn\u2019t have a significant impact on overall margins.","Gary Bisbee","Great and then just one last one, last time the company got north of $1 billion of net cash in corporate investments there was a sizable buyback. I think it seems like you've been more likely to do some steady buybacks over time rather than the one big.","I wondered if you've given any thought to maybe a special dividend or some other way of returning more quickly a portion of that excess cash.","Martin Mucci","So we -- I guess my normal answer to that is that when its above a $1 billion, we have to think about what we do with it and it's a function of where we are with respect to opportunities within the M&A portfolio.","So to the extent we don\u2019t see those materializing in a shorter term timeframe than we have to have that conversation with the Board and they're ultimately going to decide what make sense but we will be having those conversations.","Gary Bisbee","Great thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is open.","Jim MacDonald","Good morning, guys. On the double digit new bookings growth do you think we will see that more in HR or in somewhat in payroll or how is that going to play out?","Martin Mucci","I think both of them are pretty strong. But I think it's a little stronger in the HR side. I think that\u2019s obviously where we have more opportunity to sell the ancillary, the wide breath of ancillary products that we have.","So a little bit stronger on the HR side particularly as Efrain said between PEO, ASO, 401(k) our online service, time and attendance kind of everything, but payroll is in there. So I think it's certainly been a little stronger on the HR side, but both of them are good.","Efrain Rivera","And I would say on this that Marty mentioned it was double digit, it was in the third quarter it was in double digit in payroll. So to Marty\u2019s point we were pretty strong across the Board.","Jim MacDonald","Great. And this I think is similar to other questions, but as people continue to adopt the minimum premium plan, will you continue to get a little bit of a tailwind in revenue growth that you sort of had this year from new revenue recognition?","Martin Mucci","That's a good question. You really don\u2019t see as much of it next year. We really obviously got a -- two things. We obviously got an uplift this year. We've been careful to call it out because we don\u2019t want people to misunderstand what\u2019s going on in the underlying numbers and most people understand it.","We were within $3 million of what the street had on revenue. So everyone understands kind of what\u2019s going on. You get a modest tick up, but after this year you would -- the impact is not significant.","Jim MacDonald","Okay. And just one sort of on the repurchase your share count kind of started to drift back up again, any thoughts on that?","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I wish the share count didn\u2019t drift up, but we will -- I would say we will repurchase opportunistically. I think that's where we're at right now before I think Gary\u2019s question earlier on would we do something more? We'll have to take a look at where we are with M&A and address whether we think something larger is warranted.","Jim MacDonald","Great thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi Bryan.","Evan Bull","Hi guys. This is Evan Bull on for Brian. Just real quick on the bookings growth in the December and January quarters, maybe directionally, was that ahead of your expectations, below or right at? Just given the magnitude of those months?","Martin Mucci","I think it was pretty close to our expectations. We set pretty high goals for the sales team and what we expected in particularly in selling season. I would say it was pretty much at our expectations because we set pretty high ones.","Evan Bull","Sure, that helps. And then you guys have introduced a number of SaaS-based products over the course of the past year. Can you talk about the traction with those products and maybe the competition and kind of the competitive dynamic there? Aside from ADP who else are the players that you're competing with directly?","Martin Mucci","Yes I always say the name competitors because it just gives them creditability. I think ADP is the one we run into the most. There is a couple of other that have recently gone through IPOs as you run into but we're winning some of those clients back actually right now over service issues and so forth.","So I think from a product standpoint we stand up very competitively and all SaaS, the ability of the SaaS products in the bundling of these integration is so critical to us and we're continuing you will see over the next six months to really even more fully integrate a lot kind of I think they're best-in-class products.","So we have myStaffingPro for example which is sold and integrated but it will see even better integration this year as well as stratus time, which is I think the leading time in attendance SaaS offering that we purchased last June and now you will see it not only as it integrated now, but it will grow much of a full integration.","So we compete very we'll. It's still primarily with ADP and then there is some of the pays that we call in that you'll see, but again we're starting to win those back. They're pretty small losses for them at this stage.","Evan Bull","Thanks, that helps guys.","Martin Mucci","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from SK Prasad from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","SK Prasad","Thanks for taking my question. First one is probably just on the timing impact. You guys talk about double digit growth you're seeing in bookings. How long does it take to actually see that from a revenue side?","Martin Mucci","You start to see that probably a couple of quarters out. That\u2019s when -- so you know the first quarter is not much depending on where it occurred. You start to get the client set up. There is a little bit of time and then probably after the second quarter that\u2019s when you're starting to see the impact.","SK Prasad","Okay. That's clear. Probably if you could provide some color on some of the newer products, which you guys have launched over the last few quarters. PEO, I understand it's at a lower margin profile than the Group level, but just thinking about this newer products are there any products or so is this, which are at higher margin than the Group level?","Martin Mucci","I would say as Efrain mentioned earlier most of the products are at a pretty strong margin level across the Board. I think insurance Efrain mentioned was pretty strong margin, but that\u2019s still a small part of the business although the health insurance in particular Workers Comp has always been pretty strong.","The health insurance is really starting to pick up now and that's in addition to the Affordable Care Act products that we have. I think ours is a business we work very hard to make sure we have the strongest margins possible obviously with our high margins in the industry now and we keep trying to drive those.","But I think when you look at the newer products that we either purchased or built set us time from a time and attendance, SaaS product, myStaffingPro from a recruitment and applicant tracking product, BeneTrac, the benefit enrollment all of those have -- will have pretty good margins particularly as we build scale and more fully integrate them into the bundles.","So all those products are doing well and they\u2019re getting out of the gate and this is even before we more fully integrate them into the Paychex flex our SaaS kind of the SaaS based for the whole thing.","SK Prasad","And probably just last one regarding float income yes there are some positive comments coming from Fed and you might end up seeing some positive impact from that, but just from a long-term strategy around your portfolio, would you be open to concerning options like small business lending given your strong distribution strength and strong customer base?","Martin Mucci","The answer your question SK we have that discussion probably I would say once a quarter. The challenge we see there, so we\u2019re looking at ways to partner, we do partner with Biz2credit on small business loans and referral arrangement.","We\u2019re just very cautious about tiptoeing into an area that could be highly regulated. So that's why we've been cautious about doing it. It\u2019s an area of interest if we could participate a little bit more fully we would look at it but that's the inhibitor.","SK Prasad","Okay. Thank you. Thanks Martin.","Martin Mucci","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, the next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Efrain, not to nitpick here but in looking at the supplemental schedule, if you look at the operating margin guidance for the fourth quarter, 35% to 36%, I think last quarter that number was 36% to 37%. Is there something going on that we should be aware?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, I think Jeff, so we're first of all eagle eyes there. I did not call it out except that in my comment what you saw were some discussion about higher cost in the quarter and the higher costs were driven primarily by sales related expense.","And so we're just simply calling out that we think given strong sales performance now we're moderating a little bit the margin given the strong sales performance in the back half of the year that's what's driving that modest change.","Jeff Silber","All right. That makes sense and I wish I could take credit for it, but somebody pointed out it to me. Just one other question you mentioned on the checks per payroll and I know it\u2019s not as big of an issue as it was before and you expect more normalized growth in the fourth quarter?","Efrain Rivera","Correct.","Jeff Silber","Is that because of the bonus issue you mentioned that shouldn\u2019t really impact the quarter?","Efrain Rivera","Yes so it\u2019s not going to impact the quarter and I think the timing shifts that I discussed in Q2 these happen from time to time. I\u2019m sorry that I mentioned in Q3 that doesn\u2019t occur in Q4 and then we're back at a more normalized rate like what you saw in the first half of the year.","Jeff Silber","All right great, thanks so much.","Efrain Rivera","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open.","David Grossman","Thank you good morning.","Efrain Rivera","Good morning.","David Grossman","I was wondering if you would just step back to the cost in HRS and perhaps help us better understand ASO versus the PEO on what the trends are you are seeing in the buyers of each of those different products?","Martin Mucci","Yes I think primarily the PEO has typically been in States where they're just more comfortable and more used to PEOs, but I think what's expanded a little bit from a PEO side David is because of the Affordable Care Act they\u2019re looking more to kind of feel more comfortable, kind of within a co- employer relationship.","So there is a little bit more acceptance I think to the PEO in that just the typical states of Florida, Texas et cetera type of states.","So we do see that growing and I think that has been frankly a lot of the Affordable Care Act has pushed more people into seeing the opportunity and just feeling more comfortable being part of shared kind of employment service.","And those who don\u2019t need to go there probably have the ASO and both I think the ASO is still coming primarily at it from an HR outsourcing type of business.","We\u2019ve seen that drop down so where clients didn\u2019t think about HR outsourcing at 30 employees or 20 employees now do because of the complexity of the regulations of the hiring and firing and other compliance issues.","So both are growing, I think PEO still tends to grow a little bit more from thinking -- starting to think about the insurance but then realizing that the HR support is there and that\u2019s why they buy totally.","Because that's really how we sell it is the value of HR support, but the ASO continues to be HR and I just think it\u2019s still complex now, the Affordable Care Act there is number of immigration reform issues that are out there for hiring and so forth.","All of these things add more people to say hey I want to be, I want to outsource my HR to somebody who is going to stay current and of course we have been a leader in this business that we have more client employees than anybody else in the business by far that we service and in over 400 individuals around the country who has serviced the clients face to face.","And I think that has made for great growth.","Efrain Rivera","And to build on that David I think that when you look at how we are going to market and how we sell that product. ASO tends to be as Marty mentioned tends to be a little bit lower typically work site employees and within the base, PEO tends to be a little bit bigger and a combination of inside the base and outside the base.","So our PEO sales are not just existing Paychex\u2019s clients but also outside the base.","David Grossman","And is the relative growth rate -- just without getting into the specific numbers -- are they comparable? If not, do you expect them to diverge at all over the next couple of years?","Efrain Rivera","I think they're generally comparable, yes they are pretty close on both side just a preference for what probably the clients thinks.","I think the other thing that we probably didn\u2019t mention is selling this more upfront, we have found that typically our model was sell them payroll and come back and say do you need HR services in three months or six months.","And we are selling much more upfront, if we think the client is of a 20 plus in a complexity, we were going in team sell and I think we are winning more clients were in upfront and ASO or PEO basis.","David Grossman","Okay. And just one other question. Do you sell the ancillary services without payroll? And if you don't, have you ever considered doing that?","Martin Mucci","Good question, so the answer is yes, we do, although for example we reported I believe last year 580,000 clients. We think we had in excess of 20,000 clients that don\u2019t take payroll but take other ancillary products.","And I think David it points to the fact that the company that we were prior to the recession in very different from the company that we emerged out of the recession. We are much more of an integrated full service provider to small and medium sized businesses.","And you are starting to see that in the client base and we will update some of that information when we get to the end of the year.","David Grossman","That\u2019s very good. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Okay. Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Your line is open.","Efrain Rivera","Hi Mark.","Mark Marcon","Hi Marty, hi Efrain. Good morning. With regards to the core payroll growth that you've seen, can you characterize where you're seeing the strongest growth in terms of, is it the smallest end of your other client size? Or, just the average small client and what are you seeing on the MMS side?","Efrain Rivera","I would say on the average, it is on the average, don\u2019t necessarily the smallest clients, although new business formation has picked up some obviously and kind of getting back to where we were pre-recession levels.","And I think in our sales to new businesses are back up over last year this year and so I think there is some small but I think primarily it\u2019s net average based if not slightly higher I would say meaning one or two employees or something like that.","So I think we\u2019re right in the average and in the mid market I think it is about the same, I think we focused very heavily on the 50 to 500 in that mid market space and I think that has been a sweet spot for us. We certainly have clients that are above that.","But we are really focusing the team on that 50 to 500, it is a very hard space right now for multiple products, those are the clients that need multiple products that are integrated in SaaS space and we fit really well there.","Mark Marcon","So you are seeing the same level of growth in that 50 to 500 as in that sub-20 group?","Efrain Rivera","Yes I would say we are pretty close I would say yes.","Mark Marcon","Great and you still have some improvements to make to that 50 to 500 product set right?","Efrain Rivera","Well I think what I mentioned earlier is over the next six months you will see even stronger integration. So all on the kind of the same user interface and so forth.","So they're integrated today from a different levels, but over the next six months Stratustime that we acquired last year myStaffingPro and BeneTrac will see even enhanced integration\u2026","Mark Marcon","Single sign-on, single database?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, good. And Mark just I\u2019m sorry go ahead\u2026","Martin Mucci","Just -- which will make that even a stronger product right from applicant tracking right through to retirement as they say, but particularly on the frontend of the applicant tracking and the benefit enrollment.","Efrain Rivera","Building on what Marty said, the way we segment markets mark is under 50 and 50 to 500. We look at it from a unit basis the growth is pretty comparable.","Mark Marcon","Okay. Great and with regards to the sales that you\u2019ve seen can you characterize the number of add-on modules that you\u2019re seeing now relative to say a year ago?","Efrain Rivera","I guess I would say this is what you mean. We saw a lot more bundled services\u2026","Mark Marcon","Right.","Efrain Rivera","Certainly than standalone payroll, that has gone up dramatically over the last four years.","Mark Marcon","What does dramatically mean?","Efrain Rivera","I would say from low double-digits is a percent to mid almost, okay double-digit kind of. If you think double hundred, so we used to sell probably standalone payroll, this is the change in the wholesale theme probably 10% to 20% of bundled services right up front, 10% to 20% of the time now we are selling a complete bundle probably 40% to 50% of the time. It is pretty dramatic.","Mark Marcon","That's great.","Efrain Rivera","That's the way we bundled the products as well and the way that sales has looked to increase the revenue per client and really to sell the client everything they need right upfront is part of a bundle.","Mark Marcon","Great and then what percentage of your sales are now coming from brand new businesses?","Efrain Rivera","I would say it is still close to half. It is still close to that 50%.","Mark Marcon","But that is picking up?","Efrain Rivera","Yes.","Mark Marcon","Okay. Great and then if the economy stays as it is would you expect your new business revenue growth target to basically stay about the same?","Efrain Rivera","I think so.","Martin Mucci","Yes Mark I think it is really been typically between about 45, then low 50s, 52, 53, it is hard to envision that that changes that much. I mean part of what distinguishes us from a lot of companies is that we are remaining that new base to get our customers.","So we get the 3% payroll they have eventually became an 8%, 10%, 20% payroll. Because we mind that, so that is part of the way we sell how we do that, how we go to market over time may change, but that's really core to how we're approaching the market.","Mark Marcon","Okay. And then lastly this is completely separate from new business formations in terms of a question but is specific to your bookings growth, when we take a look at the target that was set and if the environment stays the same, in terms of how you are judged, do you think that your target will roughly stay the same as what we have recently seen in certain documents?","Martin Mucci","So that is a very wonderfully elliptical euphemistic way of saying, we typically have a pretty tough target. Management doesn\u2019t get paid. We don\u2019t start to having conversations until we are getting close to double-digits.","So we will expect that we will have a double-digit target and we will expect it if we don\u2019t need it, we will suffer the consequences. So that is kind of where we are at from management\u2019s comp perspective obviously sales don't set of comp.","Mark Marcon","Well congratulations on a good year, this year.","Martin Mucci","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from John Williams with Topeka Capital Markets. Mr. Williams your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi John.","John Williams","Good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions first. So you had mentioned in the release a couple of things that I thought were interesting and maybe speak to, what's happening in the wider world, specifically regarding number one pricing and number two just the fact that you are starting to see wages move up a little bit.","I was wondering if there is any read that you have perhaps more on the wage side than on the pricing side you have talked a bit about the pricing side but curious to know what you're seeing on a wider scale with wage inflation and if that's something you think is become an issue in the next few months?","Martin Mucci","I think wages, we've generally seen around 2%. So I wouldn\u2019t say it's anything overly strong, I think we saw Efrain I think mentioned earlier from a bonus perspective, which we watch, bonuses were higher. It weren\u2019t -- didn't seem to be as many necessarily or bunch of an increases we thought, but they were higher, but general wage has been only has been pretty consistent at around 2% increase.","Efrain Rivera","Yeah, I think you're picking up John on the 3% client fund balances and so that incorporates not only wages, but anything else that we're paying. So it looks like it's ticking up moderately.","John Williams","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi Lisa.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call. Can you comment, just following up, on the strong bookings and then also, increase in sales expense? Can you just give a little bit more color around sales productivity and how that's trending compared to, say, growth in the sales force?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think we're showing obviously good productivity in this third quarter and the selling season from a standpoint of revenue per reps. So we\u2019re seeing pretty productivity there kind as we projected or set our goals I guess I\u2019d say. And so that always drives when you tie it back to expense in the third quarter because we have a lot of sales in the third quarter when January starts for payroll in particular that drives the sales expense up.","But I would say sales expense kind of per sale is generally consistent with where we thought it would be and we\u2019re continuing to get productivity out of the sales team I think they\u2019re executing very well as you look over last few years in particular.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. And then second one, on the ASO and PEO businesses, how much of the growth there is coming from Greenfield versus how many of those deals are you think that it's competitive or actually a takeout?","Martin Mucci","I would say in the PEO side, I think it's probably 60, 40 I seeing that number lately, but I would say more new, just when you think about it trends tended to be with our overall business. So we're 50% new businesses. I think if that\u2019s what you are asking from a payroll standpoint. I think the PEO is similar to that may be a little bit more on the new side but I think it's right in the range of 50-50.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Okay. And then last one, just a longer-term question. In your comments up front, you talked a bit about flex and the health care reform offering in myStaffingPro and then made some comments in response to question about looking more actively at M&A. Can you just take a step back and give us an idea of looking out two, three, four years, how you envision the product portfolio evolving?","Martin Mucci","Yeah, I think when you look out, it will be fully integrated software as a service offering meaning single database UI, very client friendly, mobility will be tied into it very directly.","One of the things we didn\u2019t really comment on today just quickly in the comments is mobility, our mobile app has been continually -- we\u2019ve added to the mobile app and it has seen, pretty dramatic usage being picked up even more from client employees than clients and so we\u2019re seeing a nice kind roll up of client employees, which we think will add to retention by the way, which will because the client employees now will be interfacing with our products and will get -- we\u2019ve very positive feedback on the mobility.","When you look out, it's going to be that single source for our client to come to us for everything from higher to retire as they do now and I think it will just be a very full product set.","I think the M&A piece of it is some product tuck-ins were needed, but to be straightforward we\u2019ve got pretty much the products that we need. Now it\u2019s finishing the full integration of a single database within this year and then it will be adding, I think where we can execute and add more ability and make the company more efficient.","So PEO\u2019s payroll companies probably 401-K is always out there in any off shoot of anything from recruiting etcetera those kind of businesses. So it\u2019s a pretty wide scope that we look at from an M&A perspective, but our job will be to drive upper single digit revenue growth on the topline and still be one of the most profitable companies in the business.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific, thanks guys.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the Joe Foresi at Janney. Your line is open.","Robert Simmons","Hey, guys this is Robert Simmons on for Joe. Thanks for taking the question.","Martin Mucci","Sure.","Robert Simmons","Actually just had my first question, but what are your thoughts on international expansion?","Martin Mucci","I\u2019ve been in Germany now for nine or ten years. We doubled our size last year within acquisition and continued sales growth. So we\u2019ve got a nice base there. Brazil we started last year and were kind of chugging along.","It didn\u2019t help the kind of Brazil, economy kind of slowed down at a time that we were starting up there, but were kind of learning there and were breaking into the business of winning over the CPA so that they will refer more of their payroll business out to us.","We're still very interested in it. We were going to focus on two or three countries kind of the third country we haven\u2019t quite found a good entry way in yet. We\u2019ve looked at number of them.","We -- it will always I think at this point it tends to be small, it's kind of tend to be small part of where we are as we approach $3 billion in revenue, but it's still of interest to it and we continue to look at acquisition opportunities and ways to increase sales and profit there.","Robert Simmons","Great, thanks guys.","Martin Mucci","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Matt O\u2019Neill with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Matt O\u2019Neill","Yes, hi good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in at the end. I was just hoping you could give us any updates you might be willing to provide on the short payroll business, specifically, and possibly if you could parse the client growth rate of 1% to 3% and the contribution from the SaaS side? Thanks.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, sure. We don\u2019t really well in SaaS most of our products now are or most of our clients are on SaaS. So, well over 80% of them.","From a growth standpoint, we don\u2019t breakout share payroll anymore, but they\u2019re doing fine. Really they've had good client growth year-over-year and I think they\u2019re competing very effectively with particularly the micro businesses for payroll.","All of that is done through web marketing and in sales on the phone. Once people call in, I think they've been very effective at that in growing their client base and we continue to be pleased with that and continue to always watch who we are competing against.","Not a lot of new competitors there. There some startups got up some quite a bit of press for a while but then it's kind of dropped out a little bit because they're not as a full product and ensure and so I think primarily it's into it that we run into as a competitor there and folks just wanting to stay manual do at a payroll manual.","Efrain Rivera","And the other thing I would add is, you surf the web, there is a bunch of these different ratings services, but they just won a recent award in terms of user access and appearance and so they're very, very formidable competitor in platform in that micro enterprise space.","Matt O\u2019Neill","Thanks very much.","Efrain Rivera","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.","Martin Mucci","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hey guys. So good job on the bookings, the run rate there.","Martin Mucci","Thank you.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","I guess my question is, as the bookings roll into revenues, can you talk about -- are there incremental expenses involved and then sticking to that question longer term, just longer term expense growth assumptions, where you're making investments in.","Martin Mucci","Yeah, hey Ashwin so two things. In a quarter when we have particularly strong sales execution and our expenses tend to ramp up, so we had probably a little bit higher expense growth in the quarter and then in the back half of the year based on the performance we're seeing.","Hopefully obviously that leads to little bit better build revenue going forward. But I don\u2019t think its unless we set our plans too low and they constantly beat them that\u2019s not the way we tend to do. We tend to set them pretty high and the sales force has a done a great job of rising to the challenge.","With respect to expense, where we -- I think there is really going to be no change in terms of the approach we take. We\u2019re going to leverage operating expenses as much as we can. We're going to continued to invest in IT, probably at a little bit more of a moderate rate than you\u2019ve seen in past years or then has been embedded in the SG&A number, which is where it appears.","And then we\u2019re going to continued to make selective investments in sales, where we think there is opportunities to grow the business. So I think that that will not change dramatically. Quarter-over-quarter you might have some changes as results are higher than where we expected.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","So, the incremental IT investments is that just part of ongoing transition as you move towards more product related, more cloud basis and\u2026","Martin Mucci","As you know, our double-digit increases in IT investment for many years and I think what we\u2019re saying, it tends to flatten and we\u2019ve reached at a very good point of the amount of productivity, we\u2019re getting and the development needs and that's still a very -- it\u2019s become a very large part of our investment as you would expect with a SaaS based company that\u2019s very much technology driven service.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Last question, if you can have bit sort of the relative sizing of various HRS offerings ballpark?","Martin Mucci","So the biggest now certainly is as I say is HR outsourcing both ASO, PEO and what we call our HR essentials product which is more a telephonic support HR light, HR outsourcing light. The second is our retirement services business and then third insurance nothings change there. Those are all businesses that are growing nicely and performing well within the portfolio.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","I was hoping you can put numbers to that, but okay may be you\u2019ll at your investment.","Efrain Rivera","Biggest followed by the next biggest followed by the smallest.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay, thank you guys.","Efrain Rivera","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions in queue.","Martin Mucci","Alright, thank you. At this we will close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until approximately April 25. We thank you for your interest in Paychex and for your participation on the call. Have a good day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect now.","May I introduce your speaker for today, the President and Chief Executive Officer, Martin Mucci. Please go ahead.","Martin Mucci","Thank you. Thank you for joining us for the discussion of our Paychex's fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. You can access our earnings release and our Investor Relations webpage and our 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July.","This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. On today's call, I will review the business highlights for the fourth quarter. Efrain will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2019. And then we will open it up for your questions.","We were pleased with our strong finish to the fiscal 2018 and the progress we made on key initiatives. Our total revenue growth was 9% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the fiscal year including our acquisitions of HROI, and the Lessor Group. As of May 31, 2018 we served over 650,000 payroll clients.","We acquired HROI, a national PEO in August of 2017, and acquired the Lessor Group, a payroll and HR service provider headquartered in Denmark at the end of February 2018. We are pleased with both of these acquisitions which have so far exceeded our expectations and are progressing well, and we believe these acquisition position us well for the long-term growth in both our PEO and international businesses.","At the start of fiscal 2018 we implemented certain changes on our sales go-to-market strategy. Our results - we started off slowly in the first half of the year but gained momentum in the second half. We are particularly pleased with the sales performance in our comprehensive HR outsourcing services including our PEO business which performed well in both sales and client retention. And excluding Lessor, our payroll client base was comparable to last year.","Client retention was greater than 81% of our beginning fiscal year payroll client base at the end of last year. We just completed the realignment of our service organization to allow greater flexibility and customization of our service - the service our clients receive and during that transition we experienced a slight reduction in retention. In fiscal '18 client lost trends improved as the year progressed and in particular we showed strong retention in our comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions for the year.","Job growth among small businesses is moderated and the unemployment rate is the lowest we've seen in many years. These reflect the tightening labor markets. We are well positioned at Paychex to help business owners make positive changes to wages, benefits and their challenging employee recruiting environment that will aid them in competing for top talent.","Within the small business sector, entrepreneurship is also near peak levels and since the recession which has helped to create jobs and drive the economy. Overall business owners have a positive outlook on small business economic environment and hiring.","We're constantly evaluating strategic opportunities to bring value to our customers and help them grow their businesses. In this past month we launched several new innovative offerings that are being well received to start. First, we introduced Paychex Promise which was its first of a kind offering in the payroll and HR industry. Paychex Promise is a subscription-based service that delivers peace of mind to business owners through protection against payroll interruptions and solutions to address the routine challenges of running a successful business.","The primary offering is payroll protection which extends the collection period of payroll funds from a businesses' bank account by seven days without interruption of service. This will allow business owners to pay their employees and remit taxes on time regardless of cash flow timing issues.","This is particularly helpful for small businesses that many times have cash flow timing challenges. This service also provides access to other tools to help businesses build their credit files, stay on top of regulatory changes, and resolve fraudulent events. We are pleased with the positive reactions to this service received so far in the market with over 1,000 clients joining us so far.","Second, we announced the partnership with Workplace by Facebook to introduce a social collaboration tool to the company's HCM suite. This platform allows for secure space for companies and their employees to connect, communicate and collaborate in the digital age fostering increased productivity and efficiency. The partnership with Workplace allows client employees to gain access to their Paychex flex information without logging into flex directly. We're bringing the information to them in their social collaboration space.","We are committed to delivering best-in-class technology solutions for our clients and business partners and in April we added new features to our financial advisor counsel to enhance the user experience, to manage their book of business with Paychex and of course earlier this year we did announce Accountant HQ to help our accounting partners.","We were honored to be named to the Forbes 2018 list of the world's 100 most innovative companies indicating that investors believe Paychex is among the firms most likely to continue to develop the next big innovation. I am very proud of our service organization for the receipt of a bronze medal for the Customer Service Department of the Year from the American Business Awards for the second consecutive year. The center is part of the ABA Stevie Awards which are widely considered to be the world's top honors for sales and customer service.","Paychex clients are empowered to choose the way in which they like to be serviced, dedicated payroll specialist, dedicated relationship manager, 24x7 call-center, social media options, or a self-service approach. This flexible service these many options along with responsiveness, reliability and the knowledge of our service givers allows Paychex the backup our leading edge technology with world-class service.","We were very excited to celebrate our 15 years of partnership with the AICPA CPA.com through the Paychex partner program. The partner program designates Paychex as the preferred provider of payroll, HR and retirement services and offer special benefits for the clients of the program members.","Paychex and CPA.com partner to enhance the CPA profession's role as in a trusted advisor to their clients and we provide unique value to CPA's in the program through the account specific experience in the Paychex Accountant HQ and a dedicated account service model.","Paychex is a significant beneficiary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we talked about last quarter. As we discussed, we have already initiated our plans to use a portion of these benefits to accelerate investments and the business in the areas of sales and marketing and product innovation. These investments continue into fiscal '19 and will provide additional product offerings and next-generation platforms that will position us well for longer-term growth.","The substantial portion of the tax savings of course is going to our shareholders. In April we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend of $0.06 or 12% to $0.56 per share. This increase was a fiscal quarter earlier than our typical dividend increase and was one way to assure the savings directly with their shareholders.","During fiscal '18 we also paid-out $740 million in dividends to our shareholders which represents approximately 80% of our net income. We also continue to repurchase Paychex common stock to offset dilution using about $143 million for that purpose in fiscal '18.","In summary our fourth quarter closed out another successful year for Paychex. We are an essential partner to our clients helping them succeed and grow their businesses through recruiting, engaging and supporting their employees. Our innovative technology full suite of HCM product offerings and flexible service model is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth within our market ecosystem.","Our organic business combined with our new acquisitions have positioned us well for fiscal 2019 and beyond. I greatly appreciate the work of all of our employees and the management teams and their efforts everyday for our clients and their colleagues.","I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Efrain?","Efrain Rivera","Thanks Marty, and good morning to everyone. I would like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements referred to the customary statements in that regard and our related risk factors.","In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measurements include certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to the press release and investor slide presentation for a discussion of these measures and our reconciliation for the quarter and full year fiscal 2018 to their related GAAP measures.","We posted on our Investor Relations site our normal quarterly investor presentation and in addition we\u2019re providing a supplemental presentation that outlines the impact to our financial statements of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 revenue from contracts with customers. This is effective for us at the beginning of fiscal 2019.","The changes are modest and you'll see that but they have an effect on the quarterly period and so you will need to look at that to understand what's going on. This presentation also reflects the impact of tax reform and other non-GAAP measures.","My discussion on the fourth quarter and full year results on this call will be under current revenue recognition standards. When I discuss our forward-looking guidance for fiscal year '19, I will be providing guidance incorporating the impact of ASC 606. Again it's relatively modest but it does impact the quarters and there's a one tax item that you'll just need to look at when you look at that presentation. I'll be hosting a separate call at 11 o'clock to walk through the impact of ASC 606 and other items for those who are interested in participating.","I\u2019ll start by providing some of the key highlights for this quarter and then provide greater detail in certain areas. I will touch briefly on full year results and wrap with the review of the fiscal '19 outlook. Revenue growth as Marty mentioned was 9% for the quarter and grew to $871 million and this was aided by HROI and Lessor and as Marty said they performed well.","Expenses increased 11% for the fourth quarter. The acquisitions of HROI and Lessor together contributed approximately 7% of total expense growth for the fourth quarter. Higher PEO direct insurance pass through cost for a factoring expense growth, as well as higher headcount due to accelerated investment in our sales and product teams.","The effective income tax rate was 28.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 35% for the respective prior year quarter. The significant decline year-over-year in the effective tax rate is due to tax reform. This effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was lower than we anticipated due to discrete tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter related to employee stock-based comp and an adjustment in the fourth quarter to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. So you can look at that, it\u2019s in the press release and its detailed.","Net income increased 17% to $229 million for the fourth quarter. Our adjusted net income increased 13% to $219 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.63 for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $0.61. We call out some of those items simply because some of them are very difficult to predict.","I\u2019ll provide some additional color in selected areas. Payroll service revenue increased 3% in the fourth quarter to $452 million. The increase resulted from the Lessor acquisition which contributed approximately 1% to growth and an increase in revenue per check which improved as a result of price increases net of discounts.","HRS revenue increased 17% to $401 million for the fourth quarter of which the acquisition of HROI contributed almost 8%. The remaining growth was driven by strong growth in client based across most major HCM services including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and insurance services.","Strong demand within our Paychex HR services which is reflected in continued double-digit growth in the number of client worksite employee service. PEO in particular reflected strong growth. As of May 31, 2018, PEO ending worksite employees and this excludes HROI were at 19% higher than in May 31, 2017 and were higher than our number at the end of February 28, 2018. I got a number of questions on that following third quarter call. We had a very, very strong year in PEO and expect that momentum to continue.","Insurance services benefited from continued growth in the number of health and benefit applicants and higher average premiums within our workers comp insurance offering. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds.","Let\u2019s talk about interest on funds held for clients. They increased 27% for the fourth quarter to $18 million primarily as a result of higher average interest rate earned. And turning to our investment portfolio, our goal is to protect principle and not optimize liquidity.","On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles are bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In the longer-term portfolio we invest primarily in high credit quality municipals bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities.","Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9%, average duration is now 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.7% for the fourth quarter up from 1.3% last year and we're beginning to realize the benefit of increasing interest rates you just saw that the Fed recently raised interest rates again.","Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were down modestly for the fourth quarter primarily driven by impacts of tax reform and client employee withholdings and the impact of average client size mix partly offset by wage inflation.","I\u2019ll provide some - a few points on the results for the full year fiscal 2018 just - so we keep the year-to-date in context. Revenue growth was 7%, payroll revenue up 2% and HRS revenue was up 14% compared to fiscal 2017. HRI contributed less than 6% to the growth and HRS revenue for the year. The impact of Lessor on payroll revenue growth for the full year was negligible.","Operating income growth was 4% and adjusted operating income which excludes the one-time charge following termination of certain licensing agreements reflected growth of 6%. Net income and diluted earnings per share grew 14% to 15% respectively on a GAAP basis to $934 million and $2.58 per share.","Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS were up 15% and 16% respectively to $920 million and $2.55 per share. This figure is comparable to what you'll see for 2018 when we restate for ASC 606 but I\u2019ll talk a bit more about it the quarter shift a bit and you need to pay attention to that.","Now financial position, it remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of 720 million as of May 31, 2018. Funds held for clients were $4.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2017. Funds held for clients very widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4 billion for the fiscal year.","Our total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $38 million as of the end of the year compared with net unrealized gains of $32 million as of the end of 2017 fiscal.","Our longer-term portfolio seen an increase in unrealized losses due to recent increases in market rates of interest. Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of May 31, 2018 reflecting $740 million in dividends paid and 143 million of shares repurchased during fiscal 2018, a return on equity for the past 12 months was a stunning 46%.","Our cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for the fiscal year, a significant increase of 33% over the prior year. This change was primarily a result of higher net income and timing impacts within working capital largely related to income taxes and our PEO payroll and related unbilled receivables for payrolls not yet processed as of the reporting date. The prior year reflected larger outflows impacted by higher accounts receivable balances related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing agencies.","Fiscal 2019, I\u2019ll remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. Payroll revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 2% to 3% incorporating a full year of Lessor.","Growth in payroll revenue for the first quarter will be below the full-year range. It will be closer to approximately 1% and the remaining quarters will be at or above the high-end of the range, [beginning] is impacted by the composition of processing days within quarters particularly the first quarter and normalizes as we go through the year but we have some impact because of that composition in the year.","HRS revenue growth is anticipated to increase in the range of 10% to 11% for the full-year. The HROI acquisition impacts gating of growth for fiscal 2019 with the growth for the first half being above the high-end of the full-year range, while the second half is slightly below the low-end of the range and if you remember we acquired HROI at the end of first quarter. So we\u2019ve got a little bit of incremental revenue from HROI in the first quarter.","Interest on funds held for clients is expected to increase in the range of 15% to 20%. The guidance contemplates two additional rate increases in calendar year 2018 but no further increase and let me just clarify that that means that we - at this point anticipate that will have two more raises in the year in all likelihood in the fall and at the end of the year based on what the Fed has said and we're incorporating that guidance nothing further than that.","Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is anticipated to be approximately 37%. We anticipate that operating margins will be impacted by accelerated investment initiatives, as well as some impact from anticipated growth in PEO pass through insurance costs.","Effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, investment income net is anticipated to be approximately $50 million. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of 11% to 12%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to increase approximately 11%. We anticipate that the growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first, second and fourth quarters will be a bit higher than the annual anticipated growth rate and growth for the third quarter will be approximately 5% as Q3 of fiscal 2018 is impacted by the change - was impacted I should say by the change in the corporate statutory rate.","In order to understand this guidance you need to refer to the ASC 606 presentation that either is posted or will be posted shortly to the website. There is some shifting in quarters. We do a very comprehensive reconciliation from as reported GAAP to what we're calling our adjusted number.","As I previously mentioned, this guidance is presented reflecting the adoption of ASC 606 which is effective for us in fiscal 2019. Again there is schedule that\u2019s been posted to the website or will be posted shortly.","We finalized our evaluation with new standard and the most significant impact of Paychex will be the deferral of cost to obtain and cost to fulfill our contracts over the average life of clients. Currently sales commissions and bonuses, as well as salaries related to client onboarding activities are primarily expense when incurred. These costs will now be deferred and recognized over the average life of a client. The impact of this add slightly more than $0.02 to adjusted diluted EPS for 2018 and we anticipate a similar result for fiscal 2019. So the impact one year to next is relatively small, doesn\u2019t shift margin significantly but it does have impacts on the quarters.","There are minor changes to our revenue which will be immaterial on an annual basis as I said but will impact beginning of the fiscal quarters. The changes from the new standard are all timing related and have no impact on cash flows of the company.","We\u2019ll implement a new standard using the full retrospective method which will result in restatement of prior year's results and allow for more meaningful comparisons. By restating fiscal 2018 under new guidance, the result is overall growth rates for revenue. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share that are comparable to those anticipated prior to implementing the new standards. So the growth rates will be pretty consistent.","As I previously mentioned, we've included a presentation on the IR website to provide greater transparency on the impact of the new standard. It summarizes the impacts of the new standard and recast financial statements for fiscal 2017 and 2018, as well as quarterly impacts for fiscal 2018 including the impact of tax reform and other non-GAAP adjustments. You\u2019ll need to refer that to their presentation to get next year right, specially the quarters.","ASC 606 also requires us to make additional disclosures in the footnotes to our financial statements concerning our revenue streams. As I had mentioned previously, our breakdown of revenue between payroll and HRS is becoming less meaningful as we are selling more product bundles and payroll becomes an allocation out of those bundles.","This trend resulted from our evolution to an integrated HCM provider. We believe that under new guidance there is more meaningful way to disclose the drivers of our revenues. Therefore as we move into fiscal 2019 and begin to provide new disclosures around revenue, we\u2019ll begin to align revenue guidance in the same manner starting in Q1. This will provide more disclosure not less, so - and you'll still see payroll and HRS.","In the future, our revenue will be desegregated into two categories, one will consist of revenues associated with our integrated suite of HCM products. Second category which will break out will PEO and insurance revenues. We\u2019ll continue as I said to provide supplemental information on payroll and HRS revenue during the transition to align models that won\u2019t be any change will be talking about all of those details. So we\u2019re not going to change models in the short run.","Between now and the end of our first quarter, we\u2019ll also provide on our Investor Relations website as scheduled with historical revenue detailed under the new revenue disclosures so that you can update models accordingly.","I'll be holding a separate conference call at 11 for approximately one half hour. For those who wish to participate, go through ASC 606 and really talk about what 2018 look like under that standard and again there is a shift in quarters and there is one tax item to discuss but otherwise it's pretty similar certainly on the overall year basis. We\u2019ll take you through the presentation, it's on the website on the impacts at that point of ASC 606 and other items.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty.","Martin Mucci","Great. Thanks Efrain. Operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call to any questions .","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Rayna Kumar","This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Thanks for taking my question. On your third quarter earnings call, you provided preliminary payroll revenue for guidance of 3% and now it's been revised to 2% to 3%. What's changed in the business since then?","Efrain Rivera","Very little, I think when we looked at the composition of days I just mentioned that, we saw that there was going to be an impact to revenue from one less day, it's in the range of about 25 to 30 basis points. When I looked at that and looked at where the range was, I just thought it was better to be a little bit more conservative than we had been when we were in Q3.","By the way Rayna, I also said it was preliminary, I also provided other guidance on margins that changed. So, we did some more refinement, this is where we ended up.","Rayna Kumar","Could you call out fourth quarter bookings growth and also discuss your expectations for FY '19 bookings?","Martin Mucci","I'll take that. I think we don't give bookings growth in detail, but I would tell you that, kind of what we saw in fiscal '18 was, we had go-to-market strategy at the beginning of fiscal '18 that shifted the number of - particularly the micro sales into an in-house virtual team or telephonic sales team, and we kind of miss call that one a little bit as far as how long it would take to gear that up and some of the leads and so forth.","So we started off kind of the first half of the year lower than we had expected but really gained some great momentum. And so we're feeling very good that through selling season in January and third quarter and then into fourth quarter, we actually ended up in the fourth quarter the best quarter of the year for us from a performance year-over-year in selling, and it gives us great momentum when we see that carrying into June right now.","So, we really started on the low end of what we had expected, below what we expected, and then have come back with great momentum as the inside teams in particular have gotten used to handling the leads, gain tenure, and the productivity is up substantially from the first quarter of 2018.","Rayna Kumar","And just one final question from me. For your 2019 service revenue guide, how much of a benefit are you incorporating for acquisitions from HROI and Lessor?","Efrain Rivera","There's a modest impact to payroll service revenue, about 1%, and Lessor is pretty minor, certainly less than 1%.","Operator","And our next question is coming from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","I just wanted to clarify one of the things I think I heard in Marty's prepared remarks. I'm just trying to get a kind of organic client growth at year end and I think I heard kind of flattish year-over-year x Lessor, is that right? And I guess if so, I think that would be kind of two straight years where we're pretty flat on that metric. Do we expect organic growth there in fiscal '19?","Martin Mucci","Yes, we do. And you're right, it's been pretty comparable - without Lessor it would be pretty comparable to last year. Again, I think while we saw some improvement in retention which we saw dropped last year, the previous year, '17, we saw an improvement in retention kind of across the Board as we settled on to the new service kind of model and so forth.","And in sales we started out on the first half of the year as I said, low, and had to kind of dig ourselves out of that in through selling season and then into fourth quarter gained a lot of momentum. But we ended up about comparable on the client base before - without Lessor.","And, so yes, you're right; and we definitely expect gain this year. I think we've got great momentum going into June and the first quarter coming out of fourth quarter again our best sales quarter of the year which it isn't always, but this has been our best fourth quarter, and we really ramped up the inside sales team as kind of back to meeting the productivity that we had expected at the beginning of the year.","Jason Kupferberg","And I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the organic outlook for next year, just getting into the segment level. We were trying to parse that out a little bit, we were kind of landing may be around 1.5%ish for core payroll and 8% to 9% on the HRS side. Are those ranges about right? I know you talked about it earlier in the context of total services revenue, but I wanted to break it apart so people have the models on it.","Efrain Rivera","We're between 2% and 3%, and you picked the midpoint and you're going to get about 1.5% organic, and then I would say it's about a point maybe a little bit less, little more, it depends on how you look at it on the HROI contributions, so take that out and I think you're closer to 9% to 10%.","Jason Kupferberg","And just my last question, in the quarter itself, looked like the operating margins actually came in like 50 bps above the high end of what you had guided to. So, was that just timing of investments and some of those getting pushed to the right or were there some other factors that surprised you to the upside?","Efrain Rivera","I think it was primarily timing of investments, Jason. So, you make an estimate of where you think expenses will come in, it was a little bit lighter than what we thought.","Martin Mucci","I think one point on that is, Efrain, as we talked about before at some of the conferences in the last quarter, I think we estimated, we were pretty conservative on the margins from the investments that we said we would make from tax reform. And so we kind of went a little bit on the lower end and we have brought that back a bit.","So, you saw approximately 37% and then you've also seen the guidance that Efrain has given on that going forward. So feel like, as we've looked at it, and tightened up the investments that we've already started to make from tax reform and accelerate those investments, that's where we're going to be which I think some interpret us to be a little lower than that, we don't see that happening.","Operator","And our next question is coming from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jim Schneider","Efrain, on the margin guidance, seems like the 37% number you're guiding to now, little bit better than the 36% you talked about preliminarily on the last conference call. So, can you maybe just give us a sense of, are you finding some kind of extra core savings in the business elsewhere to offset some of the investments or the investments a little bit less or how should we think about the outlook for margins now and I may guess more importantly as you look forward from here do you think you can kind of return to attain some margin expansion?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, so let me take the second. So, the answer to second is that\u2019s our anticipation that starting next year, meaning 2019. We begin with a cadence of margin expansion and how much to be decided as we go through the year.","I would say Jim, all of the projects that we contemplated in Q3 are still the ones that we're working on, and I think the differences we refined a bit what our estimates were for the spend on those projects, and it came in a bit better than our initial estimate suggested.","So, I think that's what it is. It does mark a significant departure from what we were contemplating doing, just little bit more pencil sharpening.","Jim Schneider","And then I guess maybe, Marty, you could maybe take this one. Just kind of curious about the overall kind of employment picture you're seeing in the SMB and down market space, clearly from a macro perspective, I think as we've talked about several times before, those job ads have kind of been disappointing through the cycle in that segment of the market. So, I'm wondering if you see anything in the market that gives you little bit more hope that SMB drive growth just on overall economic basis is going to be better and why?","Martin Mucci","Jim, I think it's going to be steady, I think that the optimism that I see comes from - if you look at the optimism indexes like NFIB and so forth, they're very strong. I mean they continue a historical highs of people in small businesses saying, hey, I am looking to hire and my issue is, I just can't find the right people for the positions.","And so we certainly continue to see that whether it's low unemployment rate, and the wages aren't going up quite as fast as you'd expect either, still hanging around 2.6% to 2.7% wage increase. But there is a lot of optimism there, people are looking to hire and there is job growth, it's just moderated and we're still getting job growth and we're still getting a lot of optimism.","So, we're pretty optimistic and what we'll continue to see, it isn't going to be huge growth because we've come back from the recession slowly and that job growth is moderated, but there is still job growth.","Operator","And our next question is coming from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","I guess my question was just going back to the idea of longer-term operating margin expansion. Could you size the level of investment you're making this year and future margin expansion, is it as simple as that incremental opportunistic investment phases out or are there other factors that you can point to with regards to maybe pricing or other factors that you can point too that help margin expansion?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, Ashwin, I'd say that what we said was and discussed back at the beginning of the year, we said that we'd invest between 33% and 50% of the benefit accruing from tax reform, that's what's contemplated in our numbers, and over time that will phase down.","There will be some probably incremental IT spending that will remain from those projects, but if we execute appropriately that will be offset by savings in other areas of the business and also better revenue growth.","So, I don't have a specific cadence that I'll give you because we need to walk through the year, look at the payoff on those projects. But we know exactly where we would take costs out if we don't think that the projects are generating the returns that we expect. And we know how to leverage, that's not difficult for us.","This is a year where we decided it was more appropriate given the ability we had to invest more heavily and see if it produce the kinds of returns that we anticipate it will. I would say early on we feel comfortable that we're getting those returns, but we'll walk through the year and then see how the projects progress.","Martin Mucci","Yes, we're following it very closely and as we've said, we really came out better stronger on the operating margin than we originally thought this year, and think that - and as Efrain mentioned, we do know how to leverage. So, we're watching closely to say, are we on track coming out of '19, for '20 what else do we need to do. We're kind of watching that and we are pleased that all of the investments that we're making are on track, and we believe that that, as Efrain said, will bring both revenue growth and expense reductions as well. They're across the board in both service and in product acceleration as well.","So, we're pleased with the investments we made, we think frankly we came out stronger this year than we originally had expected when we first looked at tax reform. Once we tightened up all the numbers and what we were investing in, we feel good they're the right things and we'll get back to margin expansion exactly the timing is more difficult because of the investments and getting everything done. But we certainly feel that, as we have said, that we'll be back on the margin expansion right.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","So, safe to assume based on that statement that, that is you're seeing early signs of sales productivity increases, retention, improvements, things like that. That would be matrix that we can look forward to as you make these investments, right?","Efrain Rivera","Yes, but I wouldn't say that the improvements in client retention and sales productivity and sales performance that we just mentioned are not necessarily, they're not driven by those investments because those investments just started. But we certainly feel positive about the investments we're making; we'd give you a better view of that six months from now as we get a little further into the investments. But, we feel like at this point they're certainly on track and then we just started the incremental and the additional accelerated investments in the last quarter.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Absolutely, and can I just ask the strong growth in PEO, what would you attribute that to, is there some share gain in there that you're thinking about or just higher demand for comprehensive outsourcing, can you color that?","Martin Mucci","I think, one very good sales execution, our integration with HROI and the team there, with our excellent team I think can really get it a great point, at the same time there is just a huge demand for more HR support.","When you think about, while you think that Federal regulations I've mentioned before coming down, there is a tremendous amount of state regulations that are going up, there is all the issues with immigration, there is the entire issue of harassment, I mean everything is driving more HR concerns and risks, particularly for small businesses that don't have the expertise, small to midsize businesses and that's fitting very well into the PEO business when you tie that into our insurance experience as well.","So, I think it's very strong demand in that marketplace and a very good execution from our sales and service teams.","Operator","And our next question is coming from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Kartik Mehta","I just wanted to understand little bit about FY '19, I think Marty, you said that you would anticipate client growth coming back in FY '19 but organic growth and the payroll side is going to be I think around 1.5% let's say. So, I'm wondering are there some changes happening or do you think it'd be less price? Just to better understand client growth versus organic growth expectations for FY '19","Martin Mucci","Yes, probably a little bit less on the price. I think as you see it particularly on the small end, it continues to be very competitive, I mean we're feeling very good about the product offerings that we have in introducing, consistently innovating with do-it-yourself handbooks and paperless onboarding and our Paychex promise.","But I think we're being a little more conservative on the fact that, okay, if we take a little less price, let's drive the client growth plus, and we're probably being conservative for how much we can do on the retention as well.","We saw some improvement this year, things really quieted down on the service models and so we're getting more positive affirmation about 7\/24 service and the dedicated not only payroll specialist but managers for the midsized.","So, I think it's just a bit of that, and we've seen a mix change. So, as Efrain, has mentioned many times in the call over the last couple of years, we've seen a little bit of a mix of size of clients and so when you put all that together I think that's our overall guidance.","Kartik Mehta","Efrain, just your thoughts on use of cash. Obviously, balance sheet just is flush with cash, you should generate a ton of cash again in FY '19. Is the thought that you want to wait for the right opportunity, maybe the acquisitions you're looking at, the prices change, or is it that there just aren't acquisitions that would fit kind of what you're trying to accomplish?","Efrain Rivera","No, absolutely not. That\u2019s in just your question Kartik. So, I mean I had point to Lessor. So, Lessor, we were in discussions for multiple years on that asset and eventually pulled the trigger and bought it. Advance partners we were in discussions for multiple years on that asset and then bought it. The fact that we didn't pull the trigger and I'd say probably due to some extent even HROI we could say that.","The fact that we don't pull the trigger in a given year, doesn't mean we're not in relatively advanced stages on discussions on assets that we think makes sense within our portfolio. So, I can say that we have acquisition targets that would use that cash, plus, very quickly if we thought that it makes sense to do it.","So, I would say the pipeline is very flush with opportunities and I would anticipate over the next year that we'll have an opportunity to do other acquisitions if we think that the due diligence makes sense. And, by the way implicit in that statement is the fact that they already need some level of strategic fit based on our screening criteria.","So, no, it's just really for us, timing has to be right, the numbers have to be right and sometimes we are very deliberate in our approach to doing it, but I think there's a pretty robust pipeline of opportunities out there.","Operator","And our next question is coming from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Just want to ask about competition. How do you think competition has impacted you guys' financials? I know I think last quarter you talked a little bit about the midmarket being a little more competitive and then now little bit on the small end on pricing, but I'm just trying to figure out in the big picture given the years of experience you guys have, how do you feel that the competition is having an impact?","Martin Mucci","Bryan, I would say it's been about -- it's about the same, I think as I mentioned the small probably putting a little more pressure on price on the small end, but not significantly too much different than what we've seen.","And then on the midmarket I'd say it's about the same, there's no really new players there, and I would say that some of the innovations that we've made and some of the changes that we're doing right now in our sales model that we've started in the fourth quarter that will roll into the first quarter here, and the midmarket I think are helping us position well.","So, we're pretty nimble about changing how we're going at it and I think we've found some things that we could be doing a little bit better in the midmarket, but I don't think -- I think product wise we have the most thorough and complete integrated product out there. It's not just payroll and HR that is integrated on a single employee record, but it's got, we're connected single way to 401(k) to HR, we have the largest HR generalist team out there, nearly 500 of them, all of everything positions us well for more competition, and I don't think most competitors have anything that's as complete as that. So, I think it's about the same and we should be doing better.","Bryan Keane","And then you talked a little bit about future operating margin expansion. What about on the revenue side? What does the future long-term revenue growth look like? Does it look pretty similar to this fiscal year guidance?","Efrain Rivera","I would say we'd like to see payroll service revenue higher than it is currently. So, we're working very hard to make that happen. On the HRS side, certainly double digits is where we expect to be and while I recognize that there's a lot of emphasis on payroll rightly so and it's competitive.","PEO is doing very, very well, and we're very, very bullish, on how that business is doing and we see a long trajectory of growth on that business. I would say, and you can do the math, we had almost 20% work side employee growth, organic; that's excluding HROI, and I would say that probably ranks pretty high in terms of where we stand in the industry.","We think we've got some momentum going there. So, we feel pretty good about double-digit and I think that we're working hard to get the payroll. We'll talk more about HCM, integrated HCM rather than just payroll, because I think that as Marty said that integrated suite is what we sell, not just payroll which frequently is just an allocation from that bundle. So \u2013 but we can do better and that's our expectation.","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think that mid to high single-digits is what you know we've been talking about for at least eight years and I think if you look at the overall CAGR all together, it's over seven and we're trying to make sure if that solidly over that number over time.","And we have lot of opportunity to do that. As Efrain said it's becoming much more of an HR play which is what we had expected and planned that our business would go. And that's why as he talks about the future of how that to report, it really is so much more about but not just payroll by itself but always payroll on HR or payroll HR 41K et cetera.","So we're trying to you know, six to seven is the guidance. Now we're trying to we should get that little bit higher longer term to be in that mid to high single digits.","Operator","And the next question is coming from Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Rick Eskelsen","The first one, and I'm sorry if I missed it, but I was wondering if you talk a little more about the composition of the float income outlook and sort of what you're expecting with balance especially with what I did this quarter?","Efrain Rivera","So Fed just raised rates a little while ago and we've got two rates baked in the remainder of the calendar year. One in the fall and one at the end of the year that's what the guidance contemplates. We looked at the probability of rates and when it got pretty higher for the second raise. We concluded that in our guidance.","So that's what we're expecting at this point. Nothing beyond that, although there is a chance obviously that rates could continue to rise after the end of this calendar year.","Rick Eskelsen","And for the balance growth, I mean, I know, it seems like tax performance with Holdings impacted this quarter. Does that continue throughout most of next year?","Efrain Rivera","You know, I'd say if anything it'll be flat to modestly up, that's where I think we're going to be.","Rick Eskelsen","And then just you mentioned several times about how pleased you have been with the acquisitions especially with HROI and what seem like going on the PEO business. So wondering if you could just sort of talk a little bit more about what explicitly you've seen from HROI? Whether this has changed your appetite particularly in PEO for acquisitions and then just more broadly on the PEO market? Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Yes. Sure. I think what we've seen is really a great fit from a culture standpoint and the synergies that we could get from our underwriting team with them. Also they have connections that we didn't have with.","From a carrier standpoint when you put us together the synergies from the insurance carriers is very important and we see future opportunities with that as well. You have to have great plans obviously to grow in cities where we haven't been historically.","And we're pretty bullish on the PEO marketing. Again, we were kind of one of the first in this business when you go back from an ASO perspective where there was not co-employment. And we were the - I believe only one out there that when you take all those ASO and PEO products we're servicing well over a million worksite employees.","And as Efrain said we've seen a very solid double-digit growth again this year. Those needs are just becoming more and more difficult and small to midsize businesses are really struggling with state-by-state regulations with the harassment policies that they need to have in place to protect them.","There's a lot of risk for them and when they hear risk they're ready to outsource. And when you going with a great insurance product is well they can add value to their employees which helps for the retention and engagement, it really is a great overall picture for us in the future. So, I think the market is very strong. Acquisition-wise we're constantly looking at that space. I think we know it very well. And as Efrain said we're always looking and ready to buy if the time is right and the value is right.","Rick Eskelsen","Just one follow-up, just confirming on the dividend that the change in the timing. Is that just a one-year thing and as we look forward to next year should go back to sort of normal timing?","Efrain Rivera","That's kind of a Board decision, Rick. So we accelerated one quarter, brought it forward. Martin, I don't have a clear answer on that one, but I think you probably could anticipate, we'll go back to the kind of the normal cadence. The board will ultimately decide that one.","Operator","And the next question is coming from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.","David Grossman","I'm wondering if I can just follow-up on a couple questions that have been asked already. And one relates to the investments that you're making. I know that both of you have referenced some of things that you are doing. I was hoping if you give a little more detail behind some of the major initiatives and maybe help us understand those that you expect to favorably impact your revenue growth, and then those that you expect to favorably affect your longer-term leverage in the model?","Martin Mucci","Yes. I think - David, its Marty. I can give a couple. I think if this is what you're looking for from the accelerated investments. One is the HR space and what you find is how you drive more flexibility for clients in our combined payroll and HR model. So whether that's from user interface flexibility, whether it's allowing them to do a lot more things that they want to do and then build the product kind of out the way they want it.","So from a user interface they want things a certain way. You can have all the product functionality behind it but you can isolate by designing some of the software more from a UX and UI perspective and we're spending a lot of time on that.","There is additional feature functionality, won't want to get too detail into that from a competitive standpoint. But I think you know we have a very full-featured HR and payroll solution that also integrates with insurance and 401(k), but we're finding that the clients always want more flexibility from that standpoint. They also want more self-service.","So, you'll see - and this comes - this helps on both a service operations cost perspective and a sales perspective. More and more clients want their employees to do more themselves and the employees want to do more themselves. As you know a lot of the generation these days don't want to talk to anyone, but they certainly want to be able to chat. They want to be able to going in question, hey, can I change my address. Can I change this? Can I change my deductions? Can I look at this information?","So we already have 25 different things that client's employees can do themselves, but we're trying to expand that list, which also takes pressure off of the operations and service teams to not answer the same old stuff, but to be more available for more detailed questions and more responsive to those.","So, that is in general that's where these investment, some of these technology investments are really going. One, it increases the efficiency and service performance to the clients and their employees. And the other also just response and from a product standpoint to something that I think we're going to be able to sell much more of.","And everything we design we've gone the mobile-first. Everything we design is mobile-first meaning that what you see your ability to do everything on your phone and we've made some significant investment in an agile approach to development in developing everything from mobile app which by the way is rated very close to a five out of five these days and we're feeling very good about that.","So it's the whole way we've looked at the technology and accelerating the needs of accelerated and we felt this was a good opportunity to accelerate the development.","Efrain Rivera","So, couple of others is built on that David. So the other two areas are in sales and marketing and operation. Sales is pretty simple. We're adding more salespeople particularly in small business and mid-market. We're also adding more salespeople in the PEO space more than we would.","We typically would add 2% to 3% in a given year. We're accelerating the amount of sales add, salespeople adds there. And we are also significantly increasing our digital marketing spend there to drive a better result.","And as Marty said, part of what we saw in Q4 was really good returns on that investment. And that we hadn't really started to healthy up the spending yet and we're optimistic about what that produces. So that's the sales and marketing bucket. You can titrate that up and down depending on what the results you get.","And then on operations side there is a work that we're doing from an efficiency of the footprint perspective. That is part of the spent in next year, and also looking at ability to operate \u2013 I'm sorry to automate some of the - some of those functions in the backend and so we've got numerous projects that we think will produce both topline growth, Marty mentioned, the platform opportunities that help both sales and back office and then on the operations side that's more of an efficiency play. So, all three of those are we're working on.","David Grossman","And thanks for the color on all those items. Let me ask one different question which it relates back to the PEO. WSC growth I think you said was about 19% organically. And I know HRS includes many different segments, but the category organically I think was growing around 8% to 9%, So, is that PEO organically will be growing 19% and if not if it's growing more in line with the overall category kind of 8% to 9%. Can help us understand why the unit growth is far exceeding the revenue growth?","Efrain Rivera","So two pieces of that, so make sure that disaggregate is a little bit. So we say PEO, PEO is not HRS and PEO itself is not total worksite employees. As Marty mentioned PEO is a subset of our worksite employees. I think we'll post when we post the K that what our worksite employees served are. It's lower than 19% because ASO is in that number.","So it'll be solid double digits but it won't be 19%. When we call our PEO we're calling out specifically a portion of HRS revenue, not all of HRS revenue. And so if I isolate just the PEO portion of the business excluding HROI because HROI obviously contributes but we exclude that. We're getting teens growth in PEO at this point. And you're getting worksite employee growth of about 19%.","So you need to disaggregate some of the pieces of the business. So HRS growing at 17%, obviously you have to pull the pieces apart organically more in Q4 like 9%, but within that you got a PEO piece of the business that's growing pretty rapidly and we think that continues. So hopefully that makes -- that clarifies a bit.","David Grossman","So just to clarify that; is it was the PEO worksite employee growth was in the teens? Or it was 19%?","Efrain Rivera","19%, and then revenue growth within the teens. So PEO revenue growth was between 10 \u2013 around 15%.","David Grossman","And is there a dynamic that kind of, is that mix, is that pricing, what? Can you help us understand why those are different?","Efrain Rivera","I think David it's really simple. It depends on the size of the clients you're signing up. So, smaller PEO worksite employees are smaller PEO client, you get more per client larger clients. We've signed a number of larger clients. You get less per worksite employee. That's really the dynamic.","It's interesting when you step back and look at the business, think about PEO for second. The backbone of the PEO platform is flex within Paychex. That solution works really well in the PEO context. And we're doing very well there selling pretty large clients.","And when we look at the market what we say is, there seems to be a growing number of mid-market clients who want to comprehensive outsource solution and that trends going to continue into the future. Now, as you go up market you get a little bit less per worksite employee than you do when you go on lower market.","Operator","And our next question is coming from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is now open.","Henry Chien","It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just I was curious to just learn a little more about what you did to improve retention. And just hoping if you could provide a bit more color or just talk a little more about how - what's change in your sales strategy that you kind of alluded to at least for the upcoming sale season? Thanks.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. I can't service what happen is that I mentioned last year in fiscal 2017, we went through quite a kind of a movement of client. So we're increasing the number of online clients and we changed our service model on how to handle call-in clients versus multi-product clients and the kind of normal payroll clients who are call-out clients.","So we were moving different service teams around and therefore moving the clients around. And that caused some disruption that cost us probably a percent on the retention in 2017 and from an all-time kind of high.","So then, as that settled out 2017 and we've kind of completed most of that. Then we started to see the retention calm down. The tenure of our senior pay -- of our payroll specialist, then our service givers across the board build up. Our tools got better when we got used to handling the different teams and everything started to come together.","So really retention is improved and better in almost every category we have from payroll to 401(k), to insurance you name it we had a very good year in retention. And we think that will continue as things continue to calm down and we get better tenure in those teams. So we had a nice improvement this year.","In promoter scores which we don't give out, but we saw an improvement there as well kind of across the board and the satisfactions that our clients have. From a sales perspective what we did was -- at the beginning of the year we had to go to market that as I said pulled some of the micro client. More and more clients as you know are searching online, reviewing our products and platforms, testing the product, comparing the product, and a lot of the sale is 60% complete particularly on the small end before they even get to a sales rep.","So we were handling more of that inside and we were we build out a telesales team inside, expanded and we expanded quickly beginning of the year. The tenure wasn't there. The leads weren't quite where we thought they were.","And as we refined our lead process during the first half of the year and built tenure and sales team that built a very good momentum in the second half of the year and now positions us very well going into June and this fiscal year, so that was the major change in sales. We have number of other things but those were the major change.","Henry Chien","And any thoughts on in terms of your, I guess client target mix and any thoughts on moving beyond that kind of small micro sized businesses and is that sort of factor in the sales strategy?","Efrain Rivera","Well, I mean, listen, our strategy is still really one to a 1000 and some above that, but that's our sweet spot and we have really - mostly the two sales teams that sell kind of up to 50 and then 50 to a 1000 or so, we would not be changing that strategy. But you're seeing like on the SurePayroll side they're growing very strong, the micro were refining how we handle kind of each market and maybe even changing the segments a little bit about what is a micro and what is a little bit larger and what's the over 50 kind of thing.","So, but we're not changing the overall strategy. We're still very successful and with over 650,000 clients we're not looking to initially change what we're doing or change the market we're going after because we think we're very well-positioned to capture more of it.","Operator","And your next question is coming from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Mark Marcon","Wondering if you can give us a little more color in terms of how you think the PEO space is going to evolve over the next three to five years particularly small versus large. Where you think the penetration is now and where do you think it's going to go, because there has been a lot of emphasis on that. What the acquisition opportunities are like? And just how you're thinking about the space generally? And then I want to come back and just ask one margin question with regards to guidance and just making sure we understand it on an apples-for-apples basis?","Martin Mucci","I think on the PEO space, obviously we're very bullish on and we been in it a long time. And we also like the ASO or PEO and I think what we've learned to do is kind of transition between \u2013 we're one of the few that can transition between what the client wants. What we have found is probably an increased acceptance of PEO over the last year or so.","So as you have very good insurance plans in our markets that we're in there is much more acceptance of the co-employment and the PEO kind of structure in those states, and from an insurance carrier perspective. I think ACA pushed a lot of that you know in what stays and what goes of ACA almost doesn't matter at this point, but when it started, it got a lot more clients and prospects looking at insurance and whether to bundle that in and that feeling has stayed.","With insurances, the other thing that I would say is helping the PEO and insurance side is the very low unemployment rate, the tough labor market makes it that more and more small businesses, small to midsize businesses want and need to have insurance to recruit and engage their employees. You're seeing that while the wage increases have not gone up as much as we would think in a tight labor market benefits have and that includes health insurance.","So I think the PEO market is continue - is really we think could continue to grow for many years. And it's really - don't think of it so much as the co-employment has the ability to provide total HR support including insurance needs from a very tight relationship and service model.","So, we feel very good about it. That's why we're continuing to grow. From an acquisition standpoint, we know the opportunities that are out there. We got to look at them very carefully. We think we've done that. And if the right opportunity comes up we'll be ready - I think we'll be very ready to go that way.","Mark Marcon","Where do you think that penetration is Marty in terms of just thinking about it more holistically in terms of both on the small and medium size business range in terms of like what percentage of the - what you view is being the addressable market has been - has actually gone to a more holistic HR outsourcing including the insurance component?","Martin Mucci","I think it's pretty small. And I think it's continuing - the acceptance as I mentioned is continuing to grow. So I think the opportunity is growing and the level that\u2019s been penetrated is pretty small. For years a lot of it was selling, PEO to PEO, so if somebody already had a PEO you could sell them from a competitor or something on that.","What we've started to see I'd say in the last year and half, again I think ACA really pushed some of this forward was more and more client saying, hey I have to have insurance. It's also a recruitment and engagement tool for employees. And so I think that that's going to continue to grow.","In the acceptance of it as that grows and other clients here that you have a PEO, okay I'm not as concerned about what co-employment means. And by the way the ASO side of our business is doing very well, is well. So we have both those opportunities. If you're not exactly - remember with our Paychex's insurance agency which is the 21st largest in the country, hey, if you don't want to go, if you're not a good risk for the PEO from an underwriting standpoint, we could transfer you over to the Paychex insurance agency and look for an opportunity for you there and still serve you with an HR generalist which is really the greatest benefit of the whole thing is having HR person who's there to support you.","And we've expanded that service model. For example, if you look at the Workplace by Facebook, one of the great benefits is not just that in Facebook, in Workplace you can gain information on your check stubs, and your 401(k) balance, but you can ask questions to the HRG while you're in Workplace by Facebook. So we're trying to expand that service model of the HR generalist as well.","Mark Marcon","And then related question would just be, there's more pass-through. So I'm just trying to understand when we take a look at like the - in the presentation that you posted we're looking on the operating margin for FY '18 of 38.2, the guidance is towards 37. When we think about just the year-over-year transition, how much of it is due to investments versus how much of it is due to mix, just because you've got more pass-through expenses coming through?","Efrain Rivera","The mix - I'm sorry, the mix, Mark is modest at this point. If PEO starts to accelerate significantly beyond where it is, it's going to start to affect more of a drag. But you're going to get better revenue growth. For next year it's more driven by the investments, there's a little bit of impact based on mix.","Mark Marcon","And then just the cadence was asked about earlier, but I mean should it go back to kind of the normal sort of leverage that we would typically end up seeing or is the mix going to impact that\u2026","Efrain Rivera","Well, it depends on the growth rates for PEO, Mark. So part of what we're talking about giving additional disclosures, we'll give you some insight into that. We think we still can leverage at least at current growth rates for the PEO if that would just significantly increase from where it is now then obviously that's going to impact margins but you're going to get better growth. So it's a little bit of six of one and half a dozen of another.","Mark Marcon","Can I sneak one more in the Paychex's Promise? Are you taking much risk on in there?","Efrain Rivera","Well, we don't think so, because we're - the client has to go through a review process. And so while we think that - and it\u2019s a very quick process, but we are reviewing what that risk is. But we feel that it's the kind of insurance for the client particularly then the small side that have cash flow issues that worry about that two days or five days or seven days that they might have an issue, that we think this is something that given our size and financial strength that we can do, but we're doing it very carefully.","Martin Mucci","We've run it through a lot of credit algorithms, Mark, so we keep up pretty close eye on it. ","Operator","And your next question is coming from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Just wanted to ask on the - given on the success and demand for comprehensive outsourcing and PEOs, you've talked about a lot. Is that stealing incrementally from traditional payroll or maybe even do-it-yourself. Just to try and understand how you might think about the secular theme there?","Martin Mucci","Well I think - I don't think so much from do-it-yourself, I think from midsize payroll it definitely I think could be taking some share from there because that's where its expanding for the most part. If you have 20 - 15 to 20 employees and up, that attractive to you, and so it certainly could be taking from payroll only, but again we're here to offer whatever the client needs in a full sweet basis, if they want full PEO that's fine. And that is certainly growing faster than the midsize payroll only or payroll plus just HR.","Tien-tsin Huang","So from a resourcing standpoint including inorganic investments then, I mean, would your risk appetite then go up maybe on the PEO side or maybe just to be little bit more aggressive on the distribution, just trying to understand how you are balancing that, the risk versus the growth?","Efrain Rivera","You mean from an acquisition kind of standpoint or\u2026?","Tien-tsin Huang","From an acquisition standpoint or even organically, if you want to expand what you've done in Florida?","Martin Mucci","I mean, we've really already expanded. I mean, we sell pretty much nationwide, obviously the largest concentration is in those states where it's most popular Florida, Texas, Georgia, but HROI is assisted in that well as we have gone even more national. And when you look at acquisitions and you look at investment you do try to get some sort of scale in certain areas so that you can have better insurance carrier relationships and plans as well.","Efrain Rivera","Yes. So Tien-tsin you asked two questions related to risk. One, Marty answered with respect to both kind of the appetite for broader business development and the appetite for PEO. The answer is yes. The appetite with respect to underwriting though, we're really tied on that and my appetite for risk is pretty low.","In that sense, I think you can underwrite good business. We have very, very stringent controls on that and a lot of reviews on the state of both the [MPP] and the workers comp portions of the portfolio. So yes, it\u2019s a little bit more balance kind of answer to the question.","Martin Mucci","Yes, definitely. On the underwriting we've always been extremely tight on that and feel like we're at very good place and continue to do that. And again with that balance of risk, we always have the insurance agency and the ASO product to say, if you're not a good fit there and we don't want underwrite this, we do have an insurance agency with multiple other plans that can usually get you the insurance that you need.","Operator","And the last question is from James Fossett of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","James Fossett","I just want to ask, you mentioned that employment or pace of new employment has been slowing as the market tightens. I'm wondering what are the things that Paychex is doing or it's adjusting to try to help its customers better attract employees, you've referenced that a couple of times, but I'm wondering if you can give some specific examples. And then how well do you think those kinds of assistances can carry into when the market maybe isn't so - the employment market isn't so tight?","Martin Mucci","Well, I think, yes, it's even more important now that it is tight, right? So, what we've been able to do is, we have over 500 HR generalist. So, if you buy our ASO or PEO product and you have an HR person, lot of these small to midsize businesses do not have a full-time HR person. They don't know how to recruit necessarily, and what we can do is help them with recruiting, we can help them on how to build the job description, how to recruit out, how to on-board and retain and engage employees.","That's where a lot of the benefit of that HR person comes from who has multiple clients by the way and can use that data and that experience to help small and midsize businesses. The biggest issue for businesses today right now is finding and hiring, recruiting and hiring the right people for their jobs, and that's where we actually, the HR person that we have can help them a great deal.","Also from a product standpoint when you think about it, being able to have an easy way to take prospect information ,so I want to go work for your small business, if you're with Paychex's, you can go online, do that without - paperlessly, that transcends over into the business, they can review those resumes that are all online, all paperless. And if you get hired, it's a paperless experience to bring you on.","And, then of course that transcends into a mobile app which you can show the new employees to say, hey, we're modern, we're with Paychex's, you have a mobile app, you can get your pay, your pay stubs, change your 401(k) et cetera is all here.","So, I think frankly it's been very appealing to businesses that are struggling to hire to use someone like us and our products and our services.","James Fossett","And so, I guess it's real more of an emphasis on what Paychex's can already deliver rather than you introducing any new capabilities. Does it make sense for you to look at adding additional or are there things that you can add to help in that recruitment employment process?","Martin Mucci","Well, sure, I think it's always - there's always more things that we can do, what's the best way to recruit, how is that being done, things like video interviewing, right. So, we can partner up with someone who can help a small business, who can never afford to do kind of video interviews, which is very popular, becoming more and more popular now, right.","So, I don't want to necessarily commend that, if I want to recruit, you do a short video, you send that with your resume which is all paperless. We continue to look to evolve those HR support products to give you the best ability to recruit and hire and retain the very best employees.","So, we're constantly looking at ways to do that and do it in a also a digital way, much more through chat bots and artificial intelligence, and also give you data analytics, right. So, when you think about as a midsize client that has data analytics on what your turnover is, where your turnover is, how it compares to other businesses, those kind of things are good tools that can help businesses that wouldn't normally have that available to them.","Operator","And speakers, we show no questions in queue at this time.","Martin Mucci","All right, I'm going to talk about your follow up call.","Efrain Rivera","That's okay, just close and then\u2026","Martin Mucci","At this point we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying this webcast of this conference call, it'd be archived for approximately 30 days. And I do thank you for your continued participation in our fourth quarter press release call and for your interest in investment in Paychex.","Efrain Rivera","For those of you who want to talk about ASC 606, we should have posted the presentation to the website, hop on the call in about five minutes or so, and we'll walk through that in about half an hour. So, it will be a primer on all things, ASC 606. I look forward to having the conversation. Thank you.","Martin Mucci","Thank you, everyone.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
