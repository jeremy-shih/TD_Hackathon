[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.","With us on the call today are Jim Cashman, CEO and President, and Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Cashman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","James Cashman","Okay. Thank you. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss our second quarter and first half of 2016 financial results. But of course before we get started I will introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, for our Safe Harbor statement. Maria?","Maria Shields","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks documents have been posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supportive data relative to Q2 and the first half 2016 business results as well as our current Q3 and fiscal year 2016 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I\u2019d also like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website.","Additionally, the company\u2019s reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call and in the prepared remarks we will be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning\u2019s earnings release, materials and related Form 8-K. So Jim, I will now turn it over to you.","James Cashman","Okay, thanks, Maria. Well, first, I would like to start with a recap of the results that the ANSYS team achieved in Q2. Basically, the quick headline is that all of our recent communications on performance metrics, including at our last Investor Day, they are track or even ahead of projections.","So as you may recall from our Q1 earnings call and from the Investor Day in early June, we laid out a number of key financial and operational objectives for Q2. These included, first, achieving non-GAAP revenue in the range of $240 million to $248 million; secondly, achieving strong margins and earnings per share; three, high rates of recurring revenue; fourth, continued growth in both deferred revenue and backlog; and then finally, an improvement in our direct sales and channel productivity, particularly in those areas where we have ramped up the new sales hires.","And I am encouraged to say that we did, in fact, deliver on every one of these goals in the second quarter. So specifically, first, our non-GAAP revenue for the quarter was $246.1 million, in the upper half of our range.","Our revenue growth was led by solid sales execution, particularly in Germany and Japan, which reported, let\u2019s see, 12% and 9%, respectively, growth in constant currency, as well as in China, which was actually our fastest growing of the larger markets. Now this in turn was offset by the UK and France, which were the softer performing parts of Europe.","Our overall revenue growth was also suppressed in the short term for the quarter by a shift away from perpetual licenses to leased licenses whereby the revenue is spread ratably over the term of the contract. But this shift also contributed to the record deferred revenue and backlog. And we will talk about that in a few minutes.","Now this shift was particularly true in the more mature markets like the U.S. and Japan. So notably growth came across a broad base of industries, including aerospace and defense, electronics and automotive. And all of these are actually highlighted in more detail in this quarter\u2019s prepared remarks, which are posted on the website so you can check into that if you haven\u2019t already.","Okay, secondly, non-GAAP EPS in Q2 was $0.93, which is actually above the high end of our guidance range. The 2016 second quarter and year-to-date results included approximately $2.4 million, or about $0.03 per share, related to incremental tax benefits that were associated with some end of the structuring and related repatriation activities that were not included on our previous guidance. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 47%, well within the projected margin range.","Okay, so now if we dig into just highlights, operational highlights in the first quarter included, well, 31 customers\u2019 orders in excess of $1 million. This is inclusive of the five enterprise agreements, actually one of which was in excess of $16 million with one of our long-standing aero and defense customers.","So through the first half we\u2019ve now closed eight enterprise agreements and we continue to build a solid pipeline for the second half. This should put us in good position to achieve our target of around 15 of these deals by the end of 2016.","In particular, these deals are a validation of the evolving licensing and increasing usage trends that we are seeing within some of our largest and most long-standing in terms of time customers. They tend to be very similar to Cummins and P&G, customer stories that were actually highlighted if you attended our Investor Day in June.","In addition, I am actually pleased to report that in addition to those long-standing customers that we also added over 350 new company logos to the roster of ANSYS customers during our second quarter. It\u2019s really important because ANSYS really has a long history of retaining and growing our relationships with customers for, well, basically literally decades.","This remains true today in our recurring revenue as I think are demonstrative of that success. These new logos complement our solid customer base. And basically, they represent all major verticals, but I\u2019d say there was a particular strength in sales to new companies, particularly in the sectors like, let\u2019s see, electronics, industrial equipment, automotive and the material and chemical processing areas.","Okay. Our recurring revenue for the quarter was 74%. And our deferred revenue and backlog as of June 30 was at a record-high $524 million. So I guess overall the second quarter results, they reflect a mixed bag of pluses and minuses. Most importantly, we saw improved execution in targeted areas of our business, while we also saw the continuation of softness in certain markets and parts of the channel.","In addition, we see the same ongoing geopolitical tensions that we highlighted last quarter and everybody is seeing. They maybe got a tweak worse in the short term as a result of things like the recent Brexit vote and some of the other activities going on around the globe. So on the technical side during Q2 we also released the latest ground-breaking version of our software, ANSYS 17.1.","In this we also launched our new ANSYS SeaScape platform and our SeaHawk solution. And both of these are spelled out in more detail in separate releases you can find on our website. But the key of these is that they leverage the power of really what are ANSYS-proven technologies for low-power designs, but it also combines them with Big Data analytics, and taking techniques that are useful in all forms of high-performance computing, such as Big Data, MapReduce, Hadoop and machine learning, we\u2019ve actually applied them to chip design. So coupled with an open interface, we are able to do things that really are very revolutionary compared to the previous state of the art.","So basically what it does is it creates a system of aware chip flow and also a chip aware system flow that our customers can leverage the technology to predict expensive failures and optimize designs and innovate actually before volume production.","So enabling this faster design convergence is extending our leadership in this important and growing market. I think the combination of advances of existing products such as chip package system and this next-generation innovation is what was really behind driving accelerated bookings growth in the first half of the year in our semiconductor business unit even amidst all the consolidations that we\u2019ve talked about and heard about in the news.","And I would also say we are well-positioned to leverage these technologies to close deals that are filling up the pipeline in the second half.","So now the one thing on the technology, as we\u2019ve said a number of times and particularly in recent calls, we know we have to make our software easier to use to bridge now to a broader range of engineers. For several decades we\u2019ve had strong relationships with academia. But we have really taken it to another level recently with new initiatives. These include, I am thinking, including our campus-wide licensing, our student version of the software, which actually recently went over the hundred thousand-download mark. And with massive online courses, or MOOCs, that actually one of - the largest ever with over 20,000 participants.","And then capped off by at our Investor Day on June 2 we also announced our new partnership with Carnegie Mellon University which basically includes an ANSYS simulation site to be built near the engineering - actually built on the engineering campus.","On top of that we also recently announced our University of Pittsburgh partnership whereby we actually jointly established and added a manufacturing lab to further education and research in next-generation manufacturing. So I think the key of all this is we are moving into not just providing current technology to students but we are actually proactively teaming with world-renowned institutions to drive how tomorrow\u2019s engineers are actually being prepared to tackle the challenges of the future. And this is a really big part of pre-equipping an ever-expanding user community.","So with that I\u2019ll - those brief comments, I will actually turn it back over to Maria and she will discuss our Q3 and 2016 guidance and then we will move on to Q&A. So, Maria?","Maria Shields","Okay. Thanks, Jim. So as we outlined in this morning\u2019s press release, we\u2019ve initiated our outlook for Q3 with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $244 million to $253 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.90 to $0.94.","With respect to our previous guidance for fiscal year 2016, we\u2019ve tightened the revenue range and factored in Q2 EPS outperformance as well as incremental tax benefits in the second half that we believe now are more likely to occur. So this translates to our updated outlook of non-GAAP revenue in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.57 to $3.67.","For the second half of 2016 we are assuming no significant changes either way in the overall macro climate. We also see sales rates ramping up, particularly in Q4 as some of the newer sales investments have been brought on and begin producing and as the channel improvement and expansion initiatives also continue to drive incremental sales.","Our updated guidance also factors in assumptions around the enterprise agreements that are in the pipeline for the second half and the high probability that those deals will be recognized ratably over the contract period given what we experienced in the first half of 2016 and also given the current dialogue with many of these customers around the compositions of the deals and the licensing terms. Further details around specific currency and tax rates and some of the other key assumptions that we factored into Q3 and 2016 outlook are outlined in the prepared remarks.","So during the second quarter we repurchased 1 million shares at an average price of $86.08 and for the first half we repurchased 1.5 million shares at an average price of $85.84. And as of the end of June we\u2019ve got 3.5 million shares of capacity left in our share repurchase program. So consistent with what we have been communicating, including at Investor Day, it is our intention to continue to dedicate a portion of our free cash flow to returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We currently anticipate that the second half share repurchase activity will be similar to that of what we did in the first half.","So with that, operator, now we can open up the phone lines and take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operators Instructions] Our first question is from Anil Doradla from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Q - Anil Kumar Doradla","Hey, guys, Jim and Maria. Good job on the quarter. I had a couple of questions. So Jim, obviously, you know, you folks have embarked on big changes within the company, whether it is sales force, whether it is products, whether it is pricing. We saw some positive impacts through the channel it looks like in some of the Asia Pac regions. Can you help us understand a little bit where you are on - or what innings you are on in terms of improving sales force productivity, improving [ph] B channel (14:20) and...","A - James CashmanYeah.","Anil Kumar Doradla","And adoption of these new products?","A - James CashmanOkay. Well, I will go along with your baseball metaphor and let\u2019s just say we are probably in about the 4th inning, but trends, as you can see, as you noted, are going pretty well. I mean first of all, the acquisition of the talent, whether it is channel or direct, is the one element. Second of all is the training. And keep in mind we are continuing to broaden, extend the product base, so it is not like it is this static base of technology that people can get on top of. So it is a continual learning process. And then actually the time it takes for them to actually take those skill sets and employ them into the field and actually interact with customers effectively. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying, we have gotten through pretty much the ramp-up in staffing. Actually what you were witnessing in the first part so far is that ramp-up in terms of the training and the efficiency of the team. And now we are into more of the traditional sales comment.","But you also mentioned a couple of other things. Because actually it is not that we are changing because things were inherently bad, because actually they have been very good for a long time. Actually we are changing because - we are evolving because the world is evolving an awful lot. So the presence of cloud computing, some of the buying preferences of customers, basically being able to embrace all of those. One of the most notable recent additions is we\u2019ve always had - perpetual - we\u2019ve always had software as a service, we\u2019ve always had time-based licenses. But now you get into some of these things that are being prompted about by cloud and you get into the concept of elastic licensing and different kinds of mechanisms like that. And that\u2019s really just meeting an evolving consumer demand.","So all the while, while technology is continuing to progress because we see with new technologies like additive manufacturing come forth, well, it brings a new set of pressures as to what can really benefit from simulation.","So it\u2019s just one of those things. You cannot stand pat in this industry. You have to continue. So we\u2019ve done a lot of organic investment, but we also continue to stay very active, even in these kind of like tricky valuation times, of a heavy search on potential partners for mergers and acquisitions.","Q - Anil Kumar DoradlaOkay. Clearly, you\u2019re on track of a good year on ELAs. You\u2019re talking about 15. I think you did like four or five in 2014 and 2015. So the question is, given that ELA is turning out to be actually much more on the upside and given that you\u2019ve been making some changes in your traditional sales force, is there a kind of taking a second look at your sales force strategy? In other words, people that you\u2019re allocated on these verticals, on these customers and clients, and not turning kind of the demand environment on versus focusing on ELAs where you\u2019re seeing a lot more productivity. Can you help us understand how you\u2019re balancing these two?","A - James CashmanOh, sure. Yeah, sure. No, it is a totally fair question. First of all, we don\u2019t sit there and say we are going to hit X number of these things. Because as we talked about, you talk about something this big and the buying cycles can move and push a little bit therefore. However, it\u2019s also one where it takes a very deep understanding and usually already a long history with customers who have already proven it internally.","So we actually mentioned about a year ago that we - actually more than that. We started to shift some of our sales force because there are an increasing number of customers that are interested now in moving toward these system-wide adoptions of simulation.","However, there is still a lot of traditional base. They\u2019re still doing tactical, technical buys. And we need to be able to serve both of those markets as that latter market continues to mature. So what we started to do was actually segment from what was basically an all-geographic-based sales force to one that are actually more targeted toward those larger engagements while also not leaving the tactical, territorial ones behind also.","So in fact that was part of the transition and turbulence that we were seeing, talking about probably even as recently as four quarters ago. So that\u2019s still going on in place. But the fact is we are now starting to ramp up. And I think you can even see from the measures of these that they are, in fact, starting to ramp up.","The other interesting part of this is that we\u2019re also seeing, though, that once people get into this mode, they\u2019re able to now adopt the value much more quickly. And we\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re getting some periodic additions from companies that may have already even committed to a multiyear deal, but now they\u2019re actually accelerating that. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve removed some of the barriers by making it very easy for them to adopt on an enterprise basis and quickly learn internally as to which paths are the right way to go.","Q - Anil Kumar DoradlaAll right. Great. Thanks a lot.","A - James CashmanThank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead.","Q - Jason RodgersGood morning.","A - Maria ShieldsHi, Jason.","Q - Jason RodgersHello. It was good to see the double-digit growth in Germany. And I wonder if you can talk about the factors that contributed to that and how sustainable that is going forward?","A - James CashmanWell, I mean, the factor is there, I mean, keep in mind that there has been a lot of ups and downs in Europe of all sorts of major votes and various domestic and all sorts of things like that. However, Germany is a really strong industrial base. It\u2019s been perennially one of our top three markets. So with that in mind, we\u2019ve also been doing some ramping up. We\u2019ve got one of our best long-term partners who has continued to grow and evolve with us also, which is of course one thing that we have always looked for. So they\u2019ve been very solid. They in particular - the channel activity was particularly strong there.","Now, how sustainable is it? Yes, it is sustainable. I think that even during this ramp-up thing we will see some ebbs and flows, but if you could pass a trend line through it you will see positive activity. Because, again, the same things that we saw in North America and Japan are fairly evident also in Germany where you\u2019ve got a strong industrial base, it\u2019s fairly mature, developed, we\u2019ve got long-standing relationships and now we just have to bring those same skills and processes into it.","I don\u2019t think it will be like a monotonically linear type of uptick curve, but it will be a - it should be trending continually up-wise and being in particular pretty positive. Now that being said, any time you talk about anything projected for Q3 in Europe, there is always a bit of ups and downs in there. So I mean I will put that caveat in any - well, I\u2019d probably put that in every Q3 for the last 17 years that we have been doing this. Did that hit you?","Q - Jason RodgersYes. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just looking at the perpetual license performance in the U.S. or North America in the quarter, would you expect that to be a similar rate for the next several quarters, or were there some unusual factors that led to the results there such as the signing of the ELAs?","A - James CashmanWell, ELAs can affect that, but keep in mind some ELAs, some customers doing ELAs still do perpetuals. They are not all time-based licenses. And I think in general what you will see is, yes, there does seem to be that trend that we have been talking about and trying to delineate in the last few quarters where there is more of a trend toward time-based licenses. But we\u2019ve also said that there is a lot of - actually a lot of financial examinations that companies are looking at. They\u2019re doing everything and looking at the trade-off between time-based licenses and perpetual licenses. They are comparing that to, oh, what if I use the cloud and elastic pricing, how does the economics of that work? We have got a number - in fact, most of our cloud activity is really right now tied up in customers doing economic comparison evaluations of on-premise versus cloud.","And I think during this situation where you have more and more companies entering that kind of thing on top of the macroeconomic choppiness, I think there will be some chop in those numbers. The bottom line is, at the end of the day, I don\u2019t want to be cavalier about this, we don\u2019t care that much over the long term because as long as we lock in customers we know our retention rates are very high. And right now, we are really trying to get the ramp of having more people utilizing the technology. So we just want to make sure that there are numerous ways and no particular enforced financial hurdles that could slow down that potential ramp-up.","Q - Jason RodgersThank you.","A - James CashmanThank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Q - Monika GargHi. Thanks for taking my question. You know first is perpetual license, first half 2016 over first half 2015 is down. But you know you talked about some shift to time-based license, but the lease of first half 2016 is only growing 5% over first half 2015. Could you maybe talk about the reason for that?","A - James CashmanWell, keep in mind if a perpetual license shifts to a lease, each time you compare a perpetual license you are renewing what happened that year before. When you are growing on the lease base, you are growing on something that has been accumulating for 20 years or 30 years.","So you can have a pretty dramatic swing in a shift toward lease-based licenses. But if you compare it to the total accumulated over history standpoint, it may look like a lower number but it\u2019s really showing some fairly significant growth. I think that\u2019s maybe the big comparison is when you compare perpetual growth, you are comparing it to only what happened last year.","When you are comparing lease growth, you are comparing to what added on to what preceded by the previous 30 years or 40 years of accumulated lease base. I think that\u2019s more of just a mathematical analysis of it.","The other thing is when you shift from a perpetual to a lease, I mean while the deferred balances go up and things like that, first of all, an annual lease is less than a perpetual license. And on top of it it gets ratably recognized, so you don\u2019t even see all the impacts of that. But in general you see a steady growth going up. But I think that\u2019s how the math is working if I am understanding the question right.","Q - Monika GargOkay. So would you see similar phenomenon going forward, that perpetual lease coming down but the lease growth is less than, you know, still mid-single digit?","A - Maria ShieldsYes. And particularly, Monika, I will also point out particularly in Q3 the decline in the comparative numbers to Q3 a year ago is probably going to be more significant because last year\u2019s Q3 contained a very, very large perpetual that we don\u2019t see repeating in this year\u2019s Q3. So I think you will see this phenomena continuing throughout the remainder of 2016.","Q - Monika GargThen operating cash flow is also down, right, first half 2016 over first half 2015. Maybe just some points on that.","A - Maria ShieldsYes, most of that is just around the timing of tax payments compared to a year ago. We are still looking at cash flow for fiscal year 2016 in the $355 million to $370 million range.","Q - Monika GargOkay. Thanks. But that\u2019s still down year-over-year, right?","A - Maria ShieldsIt is.","Q - Monika GargOkay. Thank you.","A - Maria ShieldsAbout - It will be about even.","Q - Monika GargThank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Q - Jay VleeschhouwerThank you, good morning. Maria, let me start with you and then turn to Jim for a longer-term product or technology question. So for Maria, you had a surprisingly large increase in maintenance revenue in the second quarter versus our model, but particularly given the quarterly and trailing 12-month weakness in perpetual. Was there anything with an unusual nature in the maintenance revenues that that level might not be sustainable in the second half?","Also for you, we see that you are now providing your bookings numbers, which is very helpful, and you were up 4% year-to-date and by our calculation about 2% to 3% bookings growth trailing 12. What does your guidance contemplate in terms of the annual increase in bookings? And then for Jim. Thanks.","A - Maria ShieldsOkay. So let\u2019s start with the first one. I am sorry, I lost track.","Q - Jay VleeschhouwerThe maintenance question.","A - Maria ShieldsI am sorry. So the maintenance question, Jay, sometimes that will be a catch-up of renewals that didn\u2019t renew on time. So some of those were renewals that flipped from Q1 into Q2. So you get the benefit of what I\u2019ll call back tax. So I think at least through the remainder of 2016 we are expecting the maintenance rate to continue at a healthy pace while renewals on maintenance continue to be in the mid-90s% and we don\u2019t see that trend changing.","A - James CashmanI would like - the other thing I\u2019d add is you asked the question about the bookings situation. And I would say right now, as we talked about the last call or two, we are - I mean the big issue particularly perturbed by the enterprise license agreements are the bookings being affected by the multi-year deals and then our push toward being able to look at the annualized contract value of that. I mean, you will notice that we\u2019ve actually tried to put a little bit more additional information on that as we have gotten to it on the prepared remarks. But we really aren\u2019t at a position right now to nail down guidance, at least for that on the long term right now. But again the main issue there being the preponderance of ELAs and the multi-year impacts of that, which tend to cause some real ripples.","Q - Jay VleeschhouwerJim, for you on the product and technology side, at the analyst meeting two months ago the company intimated that perhaps by the end of this year you would broaden your portfolio and necessarily also broaden your price ranges in an effort to broaden the user base or grow the number of users, which has long been one of your major objectives. But you didn\u2019t really say very much about it then. I am wondering now whether, two months later, you would be willing to say a little more about that.","And relatedly, with respect to the SeaScape architecture, could you talk about the longer-term implications of that for pricing and packaging? When we think about the modular architecture of SeaScape around the three different services that it is built upon and your wanting to become more of a platform, so to say, what are the longer-term implications for the business of SeaScape, particularly for non-EDA applications?","A - James CashmanOkay. Well, the first part of it is related to - I mean, the simple, non-profound answer is that we are always continuing to broaden the technology base. And yes, the pricing comes on a number of things. Actually, we talked about the inclusion of elastic pricing, which is an effective pricing addition as it is. But we are also trying to broaden things out because we\u2019ve seen, as people get the broader portfolio, there are going to be larger sales but we also want to come in at the entry level.","Amidst all that we are also - over the years we\u2019ve tended to get a very complicated number of SKUs, if you will, and we are trying to simplify the SKU base. So even while it\u2019s getting broader, it\u2019s probably going to have more discrete chunks in there. That being said, I really want to wait until we get the specific product release information on that, which is going to be later this year. Because anything else would be - there could still be some fine tuning. It would be like a pre-announce. It really wouldn\u2019t be right. Other than the fact that trajectory-wise those are the trends that we are doing, but they are also in support of what we have done forever.","So now the second part of the question was related to SeaHawk and SeaScape, right? You are absolutely right. Now, it got its start in the chip business. And that was really where some of the main brain power from our technology group put that to play. And also you look at the complexity, when you are talking about 5 billion to 10 billion transistors and how you look at all the permutations and how do you actually simulate all that, and just doing brute force computations is one of the reasons why it was very difficult to apply that.","Well, so that\u2019s why it came out in that manner. But as opposed to putting things in individual products, we - you just mentioned the word platform, and as that, there are certain things that need to transcend and go across all products. So you look at multi-physics; that\u2019s got to be handled at a platform level through our flagship products. You look at the advanced kind of calculations. So in general the SeaScape-SeaHawk was actually made a platform element. And it is our full intent, again, not pre-announcing specific releases here, but it is our intent to actually apply that in.","So I think you can see, as you started to do some very complicated simulations, maybe particularly of complete mechanical systems, or you look at complex hybrid systems between software, mechanics and electronics all combined, it might be needed in Internet of Things or autonomously driven cars, those type of things, or very, very complicated non-linear calculations, even in a particular, like mechanics or fluids, kind of situation. These kind of capabilities for handling the big data and then also using machine learning to learn from that and make it more efficient are clearly things that we have slated on. It is just that we haven\u2019t attributed those to any specific release, but they have applicability across a broader range of calculations for sure.","Q - Jay VleeschhouwerThanks, Jim. Thanks, Maria.","A - James CashmanThank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Q - Saket KaliaHey, guys. How are you doing?","A - James CashmanHello.","A - Maria ShieldsHi, Saket.","Q - Saket KaliaHey, so first and foremost, thanks for the additional disclosure on the bookings, and a nice acceleration in growth here in the second quarter. Jim, you kind of hinted at this in one of your prior questions. I kind of wanted to ask it a little bit of a different way. But lots of talk about sort of the ELA activity and a lot more multi-year renewals. So can you just talk about how much of that bookings growth that we saw this quarter, I think it was roughly 14% or 13% constant currency, how much that would have been excluding some of those longer-duration contracts?","A - James CashmanOh. Hang on, pulling out the calculator here. This is not a - we didn\u2019t parse it down to that particular number.","Q - Saket KaliaSure. And I didn\u2019t mean to put you on the spot, but even qualitatively, how much that might have added.","A - James CashmanYeah. My guess is it is somewhere in the mid-to-upper single digits in constant currency, but that\u2019s finger in the wind. Please, I mean just - I normally I like to give precise answers, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that in a couple of minutes, but I know it\u2019s kind of safely in that range.","A - Maria ShieldsYeah, and, Saket, the other thing I will add too is let\u2019s not discount the semiconductor business unit, the legacy Apache business also had a number of renewals and expansions that were scheduled in Q2 which took place. So it is a combination of not only new enterprise agreements that are expanding the usage and the product portfolio but also a good renewal and expansion in the semiconductor business unit.","A - James CashmanAnd the other thing I will add. You commented on what we tried to add to the prepared remarks. Like I told you before, we are committed both internally but also making that available externally. So as we start to evolve and enhance those disclosures, if there are certain things that you don\u2019t like or certain things that you specifically do like, we welcome that kind of input because I think it is an important part going forward. So I appreciate your comments on that, too.","Q - Saket KaliaNo, absolutely. It is very helpful. Just to clarify the answer to that and, of course, Jim, we won\u2019t hold you to it. Maybe we could take the specific math offline, but just to clarify. Would bookings growth have been - was it mid-to-upper single digits benefit to that growth? Or would bookings have grown mid-to-upper single digits excluding the long term, just to be absolutely...?","A - James CashmanThe latter, the latter. So we would have been in like that kind of upper-digit range, upper-single-digit range without and then the rest was additive.","Q - Saket KaliaGot it. Got it. Okay, that is very helpful.","A - James CashmanSorry I wasn\u2019t clear on that.","Q - Saket KaliaNo. Not at all, not at all. Just for my follow-up, more of an accounting question but, Maria, I guess how do you recognize the sales commissions on multiyear contracts and the ELAs? A lot of the longer-term kind of subscription companies that all of us cover kind of recognize that up front, in which case you could get a big bookings benefit but actually get a little bit of a ding on the margin. But maybe just walk us through how the sales commissions are recognized as that becomes a larger part of the business.","A - Maria ShieldsYes. So in the period in which the deal is recorded we take commissions on the first year and also a portion of the second year, largely the new business, if you will. And those all flow through the period in which the deal is booked. So in Q2 for those enterprise agreements, no doubt the commissions were all run through the P&L in that period. Not unlike, as you mentioned, other people.","Q - Saket KaliaGreat. That is very helpful. Thanks very much for the clarification, guys.","A - James CashmanOkay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Ashley with R. W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Q - Steve AshleyTerrific. I\u2019d just like to ask on the ELAs you signed in the period, and you may not have a line of sight on this, but if you had any sense whether some of the usage or use case of those would extend outside of the core QA and validation areas that you historically dominated? Thanks.","A - James CashmanNo, no, they definitely have. And in fact if you look at it, the part you are calling like the QA and the validation, the traditional analyst market, in fact that\u2019s one of the reasons why if you will on the overall push we have been on is because that part has been relatively - has a pretty good attach rate. However, it is a very small part of the overall engineering, design and innovation process. So this is actually, if anything, it usually signals the fact of a company now bridging and going to a broader range.","So it is clearly - I can only think of maybe one of the situations where that wasn\u2019t the case, where it was just in some cases they were just expanding and already well staffed that group. But really the premise of that is, if you will, moving down the pyramid into broader bases of usage and usually involved with that also is utilizing it earlier in the design cycle where you have a disproportionate impact on innovation.","Q - Steve AshleyTerrific. And then I would just like to ask about the vertical markets. You kind of - semis, I think, have been challenged over the last maybe year. But I think I heard a comment today thinking maybe that had gotten a little bit better. So my question is around the vertical markets. Number one, outside of oil and gas, is there anything else that is really weak? And number two, has the semi business shown some recent improvement here? Thank you.","A - James CashmanWell, okay. So in general, I would say that you might get into some of the commodity-based, the mining stocks, in addition to that that are a little bit - they are relatively suppressed. The one thing I would say is I wasn\u2019t trying to infer that I felt that the semi, their market was turning the corner and was coming around.","I am just saying that our relative positioning in it as a result of both chip package system and the SeaScape kind of platform type of things have put us in a much better competitive situation which in turn has led to accelerating growth where actually it\u2019s - well, it is all time-based and you have got a long pipeline of things. The pipeline is building nicely. And as we mentioned, the growth is accelerating, which kind of turned - reversed the trends that we might have been seeing last year.","So I still think the - I don\u2019t know, Maria, do you have different comments on this? I still think the headwinds are still kind of there but our relative stead in there has actually improved.","Q - Steve AshleyPerfect. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","A - James CashmanOkay.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Koenig with Koenig (sic) [Wedbush Securities]. Please go ahead.","Q - Steve KoenigI guess I am with my own firm now.","A - James CashmanYou\u2019re not with Wedbush anymore?","Q - Steve Koenig Okay, let\u2019s see. I want to start with a question about guidance and tuck in another financial question, and then I have a follow-up on cloud. So you all lowered the full-year guide on the top end despite the beat. Are you able to talk about, relative to your prior plan, did you take that more out of Q3 or Q4? And what do you attribute that lower guidance to? Is it mostly de-risking or is it Brexit? I mean just some more color there would be helpful.","And I will add in opportunistically just to follow up to Monika\u2019s question on cash flow. For the full year, it\u2019s flat, relatively flat. What - despite the increase in deferred - and, Maria, I guess the follow-up there is why? Can you give us some color on that?","A - Maria ShieldsYeah. So let\u2019s start with tightening of the range. No doubt it is de-risking. And as I said in my prepared comments, Steve, as we looked at the pipeline for the second half, a number of these deals, particularly the larger ones, are really going to translate to ratable revenue recognitions. So there are some paid-ups, no doubt, that are still in there, particularly I would say in the Asia Pac area. In some of the larger markets paid-ups are still the preferable licensing models. So it is a combination of de-risking. It is a combination of the composition of the deals. And as a result, we thought it would be wiser to go ahead and tighten the range.","Relative to cash flow, if you look at the plan and the way the numbers are working out, since Q4 is going to be the strongest growth quarter and the build-up of receivables, you will see that manifest in improved cash flow going into early 2017.","Q - Steve KoenigGot it. Okay. Great. Thanks, Maria. And if I could then shoot one to Jim here. So simulation seems ideal for the cloud where compute capacity is cheap and can be scaled up or down quickly. From our check, we see that customers are interested and it sounds like the main barrier is an effective pricing model. So you remarked that cloud activity was tied up in customers doing economic evaluations.","A - James Cashman Yes.","Q - Steve KoenigCan you talk about is this phenomenon impacting ANSYS\u2019s growth rate right now or is that a concern for the future? And then just any thoughts or metrics on adoption of enterprise cloud and also your elastic pricing model?","A - James CashmanYes. Absolutely. The first part is long term, no, it is nothing but a plus. Short term, I mean anything that causes people to spend more cycles comparing and deciding, yes, it is going to slow things down along that standpoint. You talked about an effective pricing model. I think you brought up that term. I\u2019d say to that, I mean luckily we have been able to look at this in two different steps. First of all is people can host existing licenses on a cloud and therefore pay on a basis of that versus actually acquiring hardware on-premise and all that type of thing. So that actually zeros out, if you will, it makes it a one-to-one on the software pricing.","That being said, they are still right now comparing what does it mean to turn loose that amount of computing, pay for it through a service versus the not having to maintain an IT staff and all the different things that are associated with that. And that really is what has been the major things that people have been doing. It\u2019s almost the comparative of the cost of the infrastructure, control of the infrastructure, things like that.","Now that being said, there will be an additional layer there, so okay, what\u2019s the advantages of actually doing flexible licensing versus actually hosting owned licenses, be they time-based or perpetual? That\u2019s one that people will only be starting to dig into now, but that\u2019s really kind of the age-old question on anything. Do you buy something? Do you lease something? Or do you just rent it for the weekend that you need it, if you are buying like - getting access to yard equipment, things like that?","So that\u2019s part, given the elastic pricing hasn\u2019t been out that long and given the fact that people are still trying to single out, if you will, the infrastructural cost, we are still at the early stages of that. But we have time to adjust. I agree with you there is interest. There\u2019s maybe a little bit of a gap between interest and ultimate adoption, but that ultimate adoption will come.","Q - Steve KoenigGot you. Great. Thank you so much.","A - James CashmanOkay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Shateel Alam with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Q - Shateel AlamHi, thanks for taking my question. I had one on the competitive dynamics in the space and your acquisition strategy. So CD-adapco has been under Siemens for a few months now. Dassault just acquired a smaller simulation vendor. Two parts. Does this change your go-to-market in any way, especially if these vendors are likely to be able to bundle along with CAD and PLM at lower prices? And then in terms of your own acquisition strategy, are there any areas of simulation that you want to build out, or should we expect more the bigger acquisitions to be in areas that are adjacent to simulation, a little like SpaceClaim was?","A - James CashmanFirst of all, I think the first way I\u2019d view that is, a lot of other companies are actually now kind of validating the path that we took years ago when people were saying, why are they doing that? And they are actually kind of, if they will, they are validating that in a form of imitation. I think more importantly is it\u2019s not just adding a bigger grab bag of products. You have to have a comprehensive set that actually allows those to do a complete virtual prototype. And of the various situations that are out there right now, really nobody runs the gamut like we do. And there are barriers to being able to do that.","And that being said, I\u2019d say that, if you will, our independence has actually made us attractive in mixed-vendor environments and mixed supply chains to being able to do that. So it really - we really haven\u2019t seen a lot of change, I mean other than the fact that - I\u2019d say the one change we\u2019ve seen, which usually happens when a CAD\/CAM company buys a simulation product, is people that were on a different platform now are strongly kind of looking at moving into that environment with us. So really it\u2019s - I guess we really don\u2019t see any directional change or we\u2019re not really surprised by too many things.","Now, to answer the first part of your question or at least one of the parts of the question is, oh, yeah, we still like some of the larger ones, but you said which parts of the - we have the basic families of physics all covered, had that for a while, and the only ones who do. However, every one of those continue to need to be continued to develop. So even though our home PC was around for many years, the processors need to get faster, the graphics need to get better, the connectivity needs to get better. Likewise, even though we have got industry-leading capabilities and have had, we need to continue to progress those further in addition to meeting the evolving and emerging new trends that are pretty much in the news today, like the Internet of Things, like autonomously driven car, getting into additive manufacturing, all those things that put new twists, if you will, on building virtual prototypes.","Q - Shateel AlamGot it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on territory sales. Last quarter you said these reps were a little bit slow to ramp. Just wanted to get an update there. And then your 4Q guidance assumes an acceleration. How important is it for territory reps to get up to productivity to make that guidance?","A - James CashmanWell, let\u2019s put it this way. We do have an assumption on productivity of the newer hires, which tend to be more in the territory alignment one. We do have - but we\u2019ve also got fairly conservative - we haven\u2019t made - based on our historical observation of the last few quarters as we\u2019ve been ramping up on here, we do see a progression. Of course, it maps very well into data that we\u2019ve shown at previous meetings where it shows, if you will, the sales force productivity as a function of maturity of the sales person, year one, year two, year three, year four. So we expect that kind of ramp up to come forward. But we\u2019re not relying on any kind of herculean effort. We are relying on continued progression along that path. So that definitely is part of it.","Q - Shateel Alam Great. Thank you. Very helpful.","A - James CashmanOkay. Thank you.","Operator"," [Operator Instructions] This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jim Cashman for any closing remarks.","James Cashman","Okay. Well, thanks. And I would like to thank actually all of you for your participation in our call today and for the ongoing support of ANSYS. So we\u2019re really encouraged by what we accomplished in the first half of 2016. But again, as we discussed on this call, and thanks to your questions, we have a lot of work ahead to deliver on our goals for the full year and the years beyond.","Nevertheless, I would still like to thank our entire ANSYS team, as we mentioned some of our key partners for their commitment to driving results. So all I would say is I think in general, the general tenor here is it is a really exciting time to be in the simulation market. We have seen a lot of trends that are driving that. We see other companies that are now interested in entering it. And it\u2019s really exciting in terms of the product advancements, things that we didn\u2019t even envision a few years ago like additive manufacturing, like the autonomously driven cars, like this whole concept of a digital twin for industrial use for prescriptive analytics, just to name some of the opportunities.","So it just continues to grow from this point and it tends to be pretty exciting and we\u2019re happy to be in the position we are to be able to embark upon that. So basically as the simulation market is proposed to enter what we feel is a new era, we are proactively evolving our ANSYS teams. I know some of your questions brought that up. But this is in terms of technology, infrastructure, the actual ANSYS sales teams and even the partner ecosystems to take advantage of what we see as a really tremendous opportunity over the next few years. So I think basically, unimpeachably, we have a proven product strategy, one that other people are trying to emulate. We\u2019ve got a progressing go-to-market plan, and on top of it all we have got a solid financial foundation that enables us to continue to invest in our business.","So I guess over the decades we have built I think unparalleled product offerings. We\u2019ve got longevity with our customers, very high reoccurring revenues and the opportunity to augment growth through new features and exciting technology. So bottom line is we\u2019re continuing to expand our direct sales force. We have a renewed focus on the indirect channel and we\u2019re basically committed to driving those solid financial results we have been talking about and generating long-term value for our shareholders and everyone else involved.","So with that I thank you very much, and we will catch you on the next call if not sooner.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

Please note this call is being recorded. With us today are Mr. Jim Cashman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Cashman for some opening remarks.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss our 2014 second quarter financial results. So let's get started by saying that the earnings release and the related prepared remarks document have been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning, and it contains all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to Q2 and the first half of our 2014 business results, as well as our current Q3 and fiscal year 2014 outlook.","So before we get started, I'd like to introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, for our Safe Harbor Statement. So Maria?","Maria T. Shields","Okay. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind you that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future business results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum. During the course of this call, and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and in the related Form 8-K.","So with that, Jim, I'll turn it back over to you.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Thanks, Maria. And so -- but before we open the call up for Q&A, I'd like to briefly provide some commentary about our Q2 results and our Q3 and fiscal year 2014 outlook. So from our perspective, Q2 was a very good quarter that combined results at the top end of our guidance while substantially building for future opportunities. We reported consolidated non-GAAP revenue at the high end of our Q2 outlook range of $234 million, an increase in 8% reported currency or 7% constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.86. This was above the high end of our range, even excluding a $0.03 related to nonrecurring tax benefits. We're encouraged by the continued progress that we've made in our Asia-Pacific business as demonstrated by another quarter of double-digit growth. Overall, the second quarter reflects a combination of improved execution in targeted areas of our business, the continuation of softness in certain markets, as well as the various ongoing geopolitical tensions that we highlighted last quarter. Consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy, during the quarter, we repurchased just over 970,000 shares, leaving about 2 million shares remaining in the current authorized pool.","So here's some other highlights from the quarter. We achieved revenue growth in all 3 major geographies, as well as double-digit constant currency growth in GIA, our Asia-Pacific area. We had 20 customers with orders in excess of $1 million. Now we had a similar number in Q2 of last year, but the amount this year represents a 27% increase in the underlying sales associated with them. Our recurring revenue was very strong at 71%. Deferred revenue and backlog grew to an all-time high of $440 million. Non-GAAP operating margins remained strong within our guidance range at 47.5%. We generated $80 million in operating cash flows.","There was one other specific data point of interest that we also called out last quarter, the relative strength of lease versus paid-up license revenue. This was also partially reflected in the increase in our recurring revenue percentage and was predominantly driven by continued growth in the lease space, most notably across all of our electronics products. The result of this is that we've updated our outlook for fiscal year 2014. This translates into Q3 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $233 million to $241 million and EPS of $0.81 to $0.85, and revenue for the full year in the range of $943 million to $960 million with EPS of $3.29 to $3.37.","So before we wrap up, I'd like to provide some qualitative context around the guidance. First and foremost, the fundamentals of our business, the customer interest and long-term market opportunity remain intact. We've also noticed that customer increase in interest has led to some more significant engagements, as evidenced by that 27% sales growth in our 7-figure customers this past quarter. Now these enterprise deals, they are very encouraging in that they embody, really, all the 3 dimensions of growth that we've been talking about, user account, density and intensity, but they are more complex in terms of timing and composition. So to net it all out, our enthusiasm continues, and we believe it's important to invest in our business to prepare for the long-term opportunity that we see over the next 3 to 5 years.","And one last highlight I'd like to mention regards Bob Kocis joining us our new Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Support. Bob brings a wealth of experience, as well as some new perspectives and expertise that will just add to the existing talent within the ANSYS global team. We're excited that Bob has joined us to continue our drive towards the targeted double-digit revenue growth, as well as our long-term vision of Simulation-Driven Product Development.","So with those brief comments, I'd be happy to open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I didn't see in the prepared remarks or the press release, can you give us what the acquisition-related revenue was in the quarter?","James E. Cashman","Yes, well, again, it was approximately $2 million related to SpaceClaim.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And can you give us a sense on SpaceClaim, if you take a look at just one -- a sample deal, who is it that they're seeing the most in terms of -- is there a specific RFP that they're going in and competing and benchmarking against? Or how is that kind of a sales cycle structure?","James E. Cashman","Sterling, I'm sorry. I wasn't quite finished with the one part of the answer. We also had about $1 million that was related to Reaction Design. So a total of about $3 million. So anyway, I just -- I wanted to clarify that one. So now, the next one?","Maria T. Shields","On SpaceClaim, sales.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","SpaceClaim, who do they -- the sales cycle, who do they -- who are they seeing in their RFPs, if there are dedicated RFPs for that type of purchase?","Maria T. Shields","So the largest part of their business right now, Sterling, is through OEM channels and building out their partner ecosystem. Some of those partners happen to be overlap partners that were traditionally ANSYS partners. And then a smaller piece is to direct customers, some of them, which are also overlap logos with traditional ANSYS customers. So I would say it's your R&D centers more towards the designer users, the initial users in the process.","James E. Cashman","Yes, again, we've talked about this from the very beginning. This is more of a conceptual design, supporting simulation -- our concept of Simulation-Driven Product Development. This is -- this really isn't a traditional CAD\/CAM kind of play. So it's not that -- don't view it in terms of the RFPs for a series of CAD players, because it's really not a primary market that they've been -- it's one that can be served, but it's really not a primary market that they were targeting or that really is in the main street of what we've been doing.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And then along that M&A front, can you give us an update on where you're at in your M&A strategy? What types of opportunities you're seeing? What are the parameters you're looking for at this point given you've been successful in a lot of the tuck-ins that you've done already?","James E. Cashman","Well, there's really no change. In general, I mean, even with some of the technological advantages our product currently have, I mean, we've got a very robust internal spending pattern that's driving those forward. And sometimes, we can acquire both talent and software capability to accelerate those. But the other thing is, if you've noticed the constant rise in some of the major account agreements, if you look at what's -- even some of our public announcements with the expanded relationships and joint technology relationships we have with key customers, this gets into a little bit more by necessity, not just a technological capability, but of a process play that actually supports the infusion of simulation throughout the development cycle. So when you get to that, the things related to process offerings, management of data, those type of things. So really, there's nothing different than we've been talking about probably for the last couple of years. It's just that the -- it's an emerging body of capability. There's a different base of players, and so the process of building partnerships as well as leading to acquisitions is a little bit longer than, if you will, the usual suspects.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask on -- first on the revenues for Q2. So you outperformed certainly relative to the midpoint of your guidance. Jim, would you, or Maria, would you be able to rank for us or kind of help us take apart what were the most important factors behind...","[Technical Difficulty]","Maria T. Shields","Are you still there, Steve?","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes. I'm sorry, can you hear me?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, you keep breaking up.","James E. Cashman","You cut out on us, so we weren't really sure.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Oh, I'm sorry. You outperformed relative to the midpoint of your revenue guidance. Could you identify for us the major factors, maybe in order of importance, for that outperformance?","James E. Cashman","Well, the key aspect of it, I mean, obviously was we had growth in all regions, and they were all pretty much on target. But getting to the upper end of the range and over consensus really was largely driven, as I mentioned, by the Asia-Pacific business. But then also, keep in mind, the acceleration that we still saw in those upper-end customers, fairly significant. It's the -- it takes a while for people to build into the -- into that 7-figure range and to have -- the group that's already there that increased by a fairly substantial, in excess of 20% growth, and those were areas that were a little bit above that. And that was also -- that was somewhat mitigated and could be counterbalanced by the fact that we also mentioned that there was an increased shift toward lease and time-based license versus the traditional perpetual, which on one hand, would, while it built up the deferred balance, it tends to mute a little bit the actual recognized revenue for the quarter. So it's a good thing for us long term. But even in spite of all that, when you balance it all out, it still wound up, like I said, above consensus and at the -- pretty much towards the top of our revenue range.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, I saw your bookings number was very good. It looked like it grew maybe 16% year-on-year. I did want to ask you then, my -- for my follow-up, another question about SpaceClaim. Jim, could you talk to us a little bit about the product synergies with your core offering and how any revenue synergies might unfold over time?","James E. Cashman","Well, over time is a long question, and -- but in reality, we do see that because the ability to build, develop a conceptual geometry that can also keep pace with the optimization capabilities of simulation also allows a much friendlier entry point for casual users to start to utilize the capability and actually close the loop on that. Long term, that's something that we clearly see, because we've also been talking about it being, over past years, one of those barriers that we'd be addressing going forward. But -- and you see that going forward. Keep in mind, we're a couple of months into this, and while we've got some fairly significant and I think exciting integration plans, the integration of that capability is going to be an ongoing pursuit. Now keep in mind also that for a couple of years, we were providing this as -- on an OEM partner kind of basis. But the overall theme really is around the democratization of simulation. It's really around ease of use. It's basically about being able to broaden the base, and if you will, just remove some of the initial fears that people might have of stepping into it with a more embracing kind of user interface.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Williams with Evercore.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if we could possibly get an update around sales hiring and sort of what you're seeing in the market there in terms of your ability to onboard reps, and maybe where you are relative to plan? It looked like you guys added about 60 employees in the quarter, and I think when you closed the SpaceClaim acquisition, you were talking about bringing on board about 50 from them. So I was just curious if we can get an update there. That would be helpful.","James E. Cashman","Sure. Well, the 60 people, as you noted, did include some from the acquisition, but we're pretty much on hiring plans and staffing plans. The on-boarding issue, of course, is a complex one when you consider the breadth of our products, but we've been having a pretty good hit rate on that. Obviously, we had a very smooth transition as the Head of Sales role that we did that particular one. So we're actually -- and the other thing is, keep in mind, you get some evidence, I mean, it's one spot. But you can -- you know that for the past few quarters, we've been talking about rebuilding -- of actually bringing the Asia-Pacific team up to a new level that we think is commensurate with where we're headed. And we talked -- started talking about that about 9 months to a year ago, and over the last couple of quarters, we've been talking about the noted change there. So I think in some ways, we've been able to increase both the effectiveness of the type of person we're hiring, but also the ability to get them on board a lot more quickly. With that being said, it still is not a matter of weeks, it's a matter -- it takes months to really get people up to kind of a par kind of capability and productivity.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And maybe just one quick follow-up from me. On the large deals that you've talked about, obviously, a nice increase year-over-year in the dollar value there. And I know in the past, you've talked about creating a more strategic relationship with customers and even using some of your services capabilities to really make sure you're getting the most out of those agreements. Are the increases that you're seeing in terms of dollar value, are these with customers that maybe came in and did a little bit a year ago and are adding capabilities as they're sort of renewing? Or is it really a factor of just large deals kind of coming to you right...","James E. Cashman","No, it's a mix. It is mostly known customers. Keep in mind that at the time, people thought many years ago that simulation was saturated. Most of these customers have been with us in, let's say, earlier generations of analysis software capability. They've been with us, in many cases, for 10, 15, 20, even more, longer in terms of years. It was just that we had to do a lot of the other things that we've been doing over the last decade or so to bring it -- to make it more broadly usable to the company. So most of those are customers that have been with us for quite a while, and they continue to ramp up. Now that being said, it's -- there are some that are immediate large sales. There are -- the majority of them, I'd say, are probably ones that used lower-level capabilities for a number of years and now are branching into broader ones. But you still see that there's quite a bit of this that's a continually increasing base of recurring revenue combined with substantial new sales. And again, the service aspect of it is the last part, and in general, that's a body that we've been building up over the last year or 2. Yes, that's having an impact on some of those comp customers. It isn't universal across all of them. Some of them are just in a normal proliferation phase, but it definitely has helped us. We've had a couple of press releases, if you checked our website about formal joint technology agreements and things like that, that have actually propelled some of that forward. But it's also one where it's not a standard practice that's really out there in industry, at least at the technical detail at which we deal with people ramping up on simulation. So that's one that -- we're continuing to build it as we grow the capability with the customers.","Operator","The next question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I had a couple of questions. Jim, I mean, the whole Eastern European crisis continues to go on. Can you remind us once again what the impacts were in this quarter and how should we be looking at it, say, over the next 12 months?","James E. Cashman","So at this point, what we really did was we said that it was around $10 million for the year, and once it kind of freezes up allocating what would have been in any 1 quarter, it's kind of tough. I mean, we could see over that range. Frankly, the reason why we didn't drum that up a lot on this call is because we mentioned it in Q1. We tried to account for it. We pretty much assumed, like I think we stated at the time that, hey, we assume that something this complex and this nasty is going to go on for at least a year. And for that reason, if anything positive happens, it's all good for us. But we didn't see it changing anytime soon, and quite frankly, we don't -- we didn't see it changing in Q2. If anything, it got slightly more strident. But again, we pretty much balanced a lot of that out. So while it still has an impact, it was factored into our guidance from the last call. It's continued to be baked in there. And if we do get some positive movement on there, it will be a pleasant surprise.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And one of the key themes that is going on in processors is the rise of ARM-based processors. It's a theme that is going to impact the infrastructure markets in 2015 with the rise of about 0.5 dozen semiconductor companies launching these products. Now, Jim, you've talked about commoditization of processing, and I wanted to know how you're looking at ARM-based processors competing with the Intel platforms, bringing the cost down significantly. And how should we be looking at your business, say, over the next 36 months with rise of these family of chips?","James E. Cashman","Well, in general, any -- I mean, there are a lot of different technology bases, but any increase in the availability, drop in cost of any kind of processing, anything driven along that turns out to be a net tailwind for us. And that's everything from the little-bit-earlier graphics processing units and the fact that they're in there and linking into there. So any form of computing that's out there is -- we're going to tap into it because, frankly, as valuable as our software is, it's also -- it also uses a lot of computing resource. So we go after that, whether it's large scale. Any of the new innovative kind of capabilities, we will -- we'll continue to tap into. And anything that drops the overall hardware cost of that is something that just creates more opportunity for us. So ARM, one aspect of that GPU, and for that matter, even some of the things that we see with some of the on-demand kind of licensing and access to that. So really, it's more of a broader base question. But virtually anything that increases the proliferation of the computing capacity, and in particular, embeds it in the company, even in a customer company, even in advance of us involved in the software engagement has turned out to be a net-plus. We've come a long way from the day where every time we sold a license, we also had to work with them to help procure a UNIX box or something like that to run along [ph]. So all of this is good movement for us.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And finally, if I can sneak in one small thing. The record backlog, anything that surprised you on the upside on that front?","James E. Cashman","Well, not really, I mean, but we have seen as we've done -- one of the things we saw was that, traditionally, we had a kind of our own balance in lease license, and it was very stable for a long amount of time. But you looked at some of the companies that we partnered with, and they each had their own individual models. So Ansoft, in particular, really didn't have a lease model, but Apache had virtually an all-lease model and a lot of it multiyear. As we started to get integration between the products, what we saw was that, okay, well, customers that traditionally might have been Apache products but are starting to buy increasing amounts of Ansoft products, well, they're -- whatever their dialed-in purchase mechanism was for the time-based license. And that's what I mentioned when we saw the lease part of our business actually growing more quickly. So that was one aspect of it. The other thing is that we do see that there are trends toward more of the on-demand kind of usage, which is inherently time-based by definition. So we have those 2 major elements going forward. Those are really the only major trends that we saw. And then again, the other thing is keep in mind what the -- those larger customer deals we talked about that were growing disproportionately, well, since they've been continually accumulating business, well, part of that accumulation, of course, is the growth of the maintenance business, in addition to some of that also being increased lease business, and of course, all of that adds to the backlog.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","I'd like to ask a couple of questions regarding, in effect, your sustainable competitive differentiation built around the breadth of your portfolio. And specifically, you've talked, for instance, about systems engineering or what you call your comprehensive systems solution on the one hand, including the acquisitions of Apache for electronics, of course, Esterel, Reaction Design for chemical processes. I imagine that's partly aimed at new types of batteries, for example, and SpaceClaim, which, when private, had a nice niche in automotive. And so the question I have is do you see automotive as perhaps the principal vertical market in which you can, a [ph], more succeed in systems engineering? So not to exclude other areas, but auto perhaps would be the most significant area. As you're probably aware, one of the major U.S. car companies recently made a very interesting selection, not involving you, around systems engineering, but it's perhaps indicative of what's going on in that space.","James E. Cashman","Yes. Well, I mean, the bottom line is we -- like anything we do, we assume it's got a broader base. The only thing I'd say is that what we've noted over the last couple of years, in particular, that automotive, it's -- while it's not the sole market, it's one that's been under a lot of transformation. Before, it was around hybrid drives and battery technology, motor efficiency, things that are inherently multi-physics. We talked about the fact that the amount of electronic content in car, whether it's entertainment systems, active safety systems, engine and control kind of systems, the combining of the electronics and the mechanics obviously was another key aspect. You mentioned Reaction Design, and yes, we see that, that kind of -- while it's not really aimed necessarily at chemical, the main thing was toward combustion and fuel efficiency, which, of course, not only is good for aero, but it's also very good for automotive. So it's more along the lines, when you see the convergence of all the regulatory pressures, of all the safety concerns of fuel efficiency, of a whole range of those things. The standard practices that used to be locked in 30, 40 years ago, they're not really the main failure point and failure mechanisms. It's when you switch over to new systems that might have unintended consequences. You look at the system combinations, a broad range of things, and that's just created in it -- not that automotive itself is inherently more applicable to this. I think every product can apply to this, but the pressure is for change, and the transformations that are going on are particularly noted in the automotive. And that's why we have seen some of those things going on. Like I said, we've also seen it in commercial aviation, and of course, the rapid transition of things, we've seen a lot in electronics. So that's one reason why those have tended to be predominating industries for a number of times [ph]. But you're correct, automotive is one that's been particularly noteworthy as of recent.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Secondly, could you update us on what's going on with EKM and your cloudy investments? Is it fair to think about those 2 as going increasingly together, that you're trying to grow your EKM business and of course, your cloudy investments as part of your new collaboration strategy?","James E. Cashman","Well, actually that's spot on. And this is -- and it's probably a little premature to talk about it at this time. But in fact, not surprisingly, EKM related to cloud offerings related to collaboration and actually related to the commercialization of our own offerings inside the cloud has been one that's actually gone -- has actually been one of the more technologically advancing areas for us in the last few months. The other thing is we find that it was the -- it was just the same technologies. Our architecture was -- is fine in a public cloud or a private cloud, but the ability to link all of those together was particularly key. So that's -- essentially, that's one element where we have continued to -- we talked about the increased R&D spend that we're doing internally. That's one where there aren't -- there isn't a lot of off-the-shelf things that are really there that are usable for us and the ability to link in with the innate knowledge created by a simulation product becomes important. So that's been a significant part in addition to ease-of-use of our own internal investment strategy. Now that's one, obviously, we've also talked about as being a potential target for some of the M&A activities. But like I say, a lot of these things really don't exist or there would be a lot of assembly required. It's just that we're always interested in different middleware and infrastructural software that can actually drive that forward. So it actually plays a little bit into one of the elements of our acquisition strategy.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. And lastly, with regard to sales. When Bob was at PTC, part of his experience there entailed working with the channel. And my question is, would you anticipate, now that you have the new Head of Sales, that the role or proportion of sales coming from the channel might change in -- on the direct side? Would you anticipate perhaps taking somewhat more of a vertical alignment as with the aforementioned automotive market or anything else?","James E. Cashman","Well, the verticalization, I mean, we don't want to sit there and over-slice that. And in general, we already have teams that are associated but largely around major accounts and clusters of industries. So it's really not a pure industry alignment, but it's a very focused sales and program backed with some -- from targeted marketing. Now on -- the other thing, our main thing is that we want to make sure as our product portfolio continues to broaden, the biggest issue we've had are taking these slightly smaller companies that have been with us a number of years and helping them move up the learning curve, if you will, on-boarding them to new technology. And that part of tapping into that channel experience was one thing that we were -- it was just one of those extra pluses that we wanted to tap into, and this new VP provides an expertise space in there that's particularly strong. A lot of people have ideas on the direct, but it's a little bit more complicated when you're balancing all of that. So it's not that you're going to see anything dramatically different. I hope what you'll continue to see over a multi-year period is commensurate and correlated growth between the 2 and keeping balance.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I want to just go back and revisit an earlier line of questioning on SpaceClaim. In regards to the product road map, what needs to happen to that product for it to reach maybe an important first milestone? You talked about it being kind of a longer-term evolutionary process, but I think the understanding here is you're going to try to import some ANSYS technology and simulation into that product. Does that sound right? And what kind of time frame are we talking about for that to happen?","James E. Cashman","Well, I don't think we see it so much as capability being imported into SpaceClaim. I think what you see is -- are some of the SpaceClaim constructs, user interaction styles being more pervasive throughout the ANSYS family in terms of having that newer user interface. A lot of our legacy products, while they're very popular, some of them have -- they've been around for a long time and so have their user interfaces. And if you think of how user interaction has changed with software and how difficult it is to effect those changes through it, it's pretty complicated. But with this using -- I mean, interacting with the -- interacting with a conceptual geometry and gradually refining it as you learn more and more about it is a very natural way of working with things. And so really, it's more of the merging and embedding of the combining of the capabilities of simulation with the capabilities of conceptual geometry creation, linking them together so you can do closed-loop kind of optimization in a way that actually -- where geometry can be both an input and a parameter to be altered and allow those all to come together. But at the same point is taking advantage of the ease of use because SpaceClaim was very effective at reaching a broad base of users and being very intuitive, easy to learn. In fact, we had a chance to witness that ourselves when we OEM-ed it as a -- when they were a third-party supplier to us. And we saw the impact that it was already starting to have in -- just with the initial baby steps in terms of implementing that. So I wouldn't see in terms of shoving a bunch of simulation capabilities into SpaceClaim, but I think what happens is it becomes very blurry as to where SpaceClaim -- where geometry creation starts and where simulation ends. It becomes part of an overall process, and linking those together both by data and user interaction are key aspects of it.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That was really good. In terms of -- is it possible that with ANSYS 16 later this year, we could also see some of that ease-of-use elements being rolled [ph] in the ANSYS offering?","James E. Cashman","I'm sorry, Steve. But the -- I didn't mean to cut you off, but no, that's absolutely part of the roadmap. And even though we're always adding features into the software, solving new classes of problems, I think that we even mentioned the last couple of calls, the ease of use is really the banner aspect of moving forward, and that's across all of our product lines. So it's not just that it's some of the ease of use with geometry, but in terms of what we're doing with all the major product lines, be they electronics, be they fluids or be that structure, we're starting to put that in. Now the ease-of-use, keep in mind, that's a pretty broad-based thing. Ease-of-use is everything from user interaction. It's to automation of capabilities that always could be strung together, but you had to kind of do it more manually, and now they do it more as automated steps. And frankly, the -- some of the ease-of-use that we're getting through the ANSYS customization toolkit, allowing people to customize it particular to things they want to do or different corporate best practices they have. So when we think ease-of-use, it's a really, really broad term, but there's 3 -- those are the 3 major fronts that we're working on.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And just real quick, Maria, do you happen to remember in the year-ago third quarter, you did a large license deal. Do you happen to remember which geography that occurred in?","Maria T. Shields","Do you mean second quarter, Steve?","James E. Cashman","Well, there was a second quarter when we had a really large one.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's what I meant to say. I'm sorry.","James E. Cashman","Okay, okay. Yes, that one we're familiar with. The Q3 ones, not so much.","Maria T. Shields","Yes, that was in North America, Steve.","James E. Cashman","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","I wondered if you could comment on your capital allocation strategy, obviously cash flow has been very strong currently and historically. Obviously, you bought back stock, but any thoughts on the continuation of the buyback and\/or dividend and\/or M&A?","James E. Cashman","Yes, yes. I mean, again, keep in mind, these weren't tactics that we invoked over the last few years. It really is part of a strategy, and it's really the same thing we talked about before is it's always been positive, accretive acquisitions that help us build our product roadmap and actually, if you will, pull the future in sooner. And then secondarily is the share repurchase, which I think we demonstrated in large part. Now keep in mind, as I mentioned in some of my opening comments was we still have around 2 million that's already authorized. And that's not to say that that's the end game, I'm just saying that's on the shelf and ready to go. But that's -- but those elements continue to be the 2 major bulwarks of our capital allocation.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","All right. And I don't know if you mentioned this or not, I know you had some comment about the employee count, but what kind of openings do you currently have and versus maybe a quarter ago or a year ago?","James E. Cashman","Well, the good news is we've closed on that quite a bit. The -- we do have -- we always have a number of openings because we're always -- first of all, keep in mind, for us, recruiting is a -- it's a process. It's not an event. It's something that we know we need to continually build. We know there's certain runway that it takes. So we continue to build things going on. Now we don't have quite the number of openings that we did because we filled some of them, but the most important part is that the -- in particular, the productive sales headcount and keeping that fully fleshed out, that's really been kind of a top of the thing. So bottom line is we're continuing to hire. Second of all, we're in -- we're disproportionately in good shape in terms of the sales headcount, although we're always looking for increased talent there. And we're just continuing to -- the recruiting process in a generic sense, just knowing that over the next couple of years that we want to continue to add top flight talent to the team.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Cashman for any closing remarks.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, thanks a lot, everybody. So in close -- basically, in closing, the emphasis for the remainder of 2014, it's an ongoing focus on sales execution, and then as some of you noted already, the delivery of ANSYS 16, a key release for us. Actually, many of us just spent the last quarter traveling to our annual user group meetings, and we actually engaged with well over 10,000 of our customers and partners from around the globe. So all I can say is that backing up the numbers and the guidance that we talked about today, those customers, their receptivity and enthusiasm for our long-term vision is actually continuing to strengthen, which gives us a pretty good visibility into that revenue range for 2014 that we mentioned, and it certainly gives us increased confidence in the long-term opportunity. So again, the normal shout-out is that we continue to get a lot of propelling by a strong combination. The vision continues solid. I think our business model has demonstrated time and time again to be very resilient. The customers are loyal, those ones that keep increasing that large mega-customer base. But the partners, the technology and now this growing base of exceptional employees, they are really what has made it possible and continue to make it possible in the future, and I'd like to thank all of them. But thank you for your time, and we'll be speaking again with you next quarter.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

With us today are Ajei Gopal, Chief Executive Officer; Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer; and Annette Arribas, Senior Director, Global Investor Relations.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks.","Annette Arribas","Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks documents have been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to our second quarter and the first half financial results and the business update as well as our Q3 and fiscal year 2017 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available on our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future.","Statements made on today's call are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum. During the course of this call, and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.","I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?","Ajei Gopal","Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. I am delighted to join you today to discuss the results of Q2 and the first half of 2017 and to update you on our progress. As you saw in our earnings documents, Q2 was an excellent quarter that exceeded the guidance we provided in May. Our record deferred revenue and backlog of $656 million, which is a 25% year-over-year increase, and our 76% recurring revenue rate, coming from both leases and maintenance are leading indicators that our business is both strong and stable.","I am particularly excited that we delivered double-digit revenue growth in constant currency in the first half of this year. Because of our over performance in the first and our increasing confidence in the second half of the year along with an adjustment for currency, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance for 2017 by $19 million. I am proud of our progress and more confident than ever in both our opportunity and our ability to execute. I do want to caution you, however, that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, including a number of ongoing sales and go-to-market initiatives.","Let me now spend a few minutes on our products. ANSYS 18.1, launched in May, advanced our vision of pervasive engineering simulation by introducing a number of enhancements, most notably pushing the envelope on performance and memory usage.","Saudi Aramco and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology recently set a new supercomputing milestone by scaling ANSYS' Fluent solvers to nearly 200,000 computer cores, more than 5 times the record we set just three years ago. A simulation that once took weeks to perform can now be performed in a day, allowing organizations to reduce design development time and better predict equipment performance. Saudi Aramco will apply this technology to make more informed and timely decisions to help optimize oilfield operations.","In June, at the Annual Design Automation Conference in Austin, several customers including Broadcom, Samsung, Hisilicon and Nvidia, shared their successes using our solutions to address power, reliability and thermal issues in their cutting-edge system on chip designs. We also released several new additions to our suite of semiconductor products to help customers improve performance and reliability, while reducing cost for chips design for the automotive, mobile and high performance computing markets.","The new version of ANSYS Redhawk achieved this by allowing users to take advantage of Big Data analytics and machine learning to improve their designs. In addition, we delivered a 10x improvement in capacity and scalability over previous releases of Redhawk, by efficiently using cloud environment. As a result of our advancements, a major mobile processor company now has full chip visibility into power integrity with a 3D integrated circuit flow with high bandwidth memory, and that's a first for this global brand.","Redhawk was also key in growing businesses at another Tier 1 customer, focused on high performance computing, driven by the current needs of 7 nanometers and their future needs at 5 nanometers. Our vision of pervasive engineering simulation continues to give us access to a large and growing market opportunity and drives the broad adoption of ANSYS solutions across multiple industries.","Let me illustrate by highlighting some of our Q2 successes in 2 of our strong industries, communications and aerospace. The communications sector is seeing increasing demand for next generation high bandwidth low latency solutions. ViaSat is leveraging our industry leading workflow for chip package support system simulation into their design process. Their most recent success using our solution surrounds the launch of ViaSat-2, their second-generation satellite, which is expected to provide unprecedented bandwidth and deliver 7x more coverage as compared to their first-generation satellite. Based on this success, ViaSat signed a second multi-year agreement with ANSYS to help develop their new global constellation of ViaSat-3 class satellites.","As, Huawei has an extensive portfolio of end-to-end solutions in telecommunications, enterprise networks, devices and cloud computing. In Q2, Huawei expanded its use of ANSYS solutions, bringing high accuracy analysis to its leading products. Huawei has now expanded the use of our technology to include signal integrity, power integrity and thermal analysis. Also in Q2, CommScope, a leader in network infrastructure, broadened their ANSYS adoption in a multiyear agreement to deliver high-accuracy simulations in support of their 5G initiatives. A major global electronics and telecommunications company increased its 25-year relationship with ANSYS with a new Q2 commitment, advancing their multiphysics adoption and displacing a competitor solution. Our pervasive simulation capabilities helped this customer achieve faster turnaround times, reduced development risk and gain early validation of product performance for 5G systems.","ANSYS has historically been strong in the aerospace sector, and Q2 was no different. Meggitt PLC, a leader in engineering extreme environment components and smart sub-systems, has increased its adoption of ANSYS SCADE simulation for aerospace and defense safety critical applications. The global agreement will allow Meggitt to further accelerate time-to-market, reducing cost both in time and prevention of costly late stage design changes. SCADE enables customer to increase the efficiency and productivity of their current software development processes by leveraging simulation and certified cogeneration to reduce manual reviews and to help ensure accurate, safe and reliable embedded software that is DO-178C compliant for the aerospace industry and ISO 26262 compliant for the automotive industry.","In a Q2 transaction, a large U.S. defense contractor has chosen SCADE as their solution to support high reliability for their next generation of flight controls. This longtime ANSYS customer extended their commitment to us by adding SCADE onto an established ANSYS platform. This is a common journey for our customers and highlights our large cross-sell opportunity.","The strength of our product portfolio and our vision of pervasive engineering simulation is reflected in the traction we are getting with startups. We launched the ANSYS startup program last fall to put simulation into the hands of emerging companies. The program now boasts hundreds of startup companies from around the world, with 76 new logos added in Q2 alone. It is exciting that these next-generation companies are building their businesses in part on ANSYS technology.","Let me now shift to the performance of our 3 major sales regions. In North America, revenue grew 13% in Q2, helped by strength in the aerospace and defense, high-tech and automotive industries. We're gaining traction in automotive, for example, as manufacturers adopt ANSYS' multiphysics solutions for the development of autonomous and energy efficient vehicles.","Our lease revenue grew 20%, consistent with the trend we have highlighted in past calls of a continued shift in preference to lease licenses, particularly in our largest customers in North America. Our slowest growth region was again Europe, delivering constant currency revenue growth of 3% in Q2. We saw weakness in both Germany and the U.K. However, excluding those regions, for the remainder of Europe, we saw double-digit constant currency growth for the second quarter in a row.","Our performance in Europe, while disappointing, was in line with our Q2 forecast. We know our challenges are in sales execution and our direct business, and as I have shared with you on previous calls, we have put a plan in place and are taking appropriate actions. Our actions have included putting in place a new head of sales for Europe, who's based out of Germany, and was previously our head of sales for Asia Pacific, where he led our successful go-to-market transformation and channel expansion.","We have also hired a new global head of major accounts, also based in Germany, and reporting to Rick Mahoney. We also have new leadership for 3 of the 5 regions in Europe. Our rebuilding efforts should set the stage for improved performance in 2018 and beyond.","Shifting to Asia-Pacific. The Q2 results reflect overall revenue growth of 8% that included a 14% and 9% growth in maintenance and lease revenue respectfully, all in constant currency. China and Taiwan continue to deliver strong revenue growth, both in excess of 20% in constant currency for the first half of the year. From an industry perspective, the regional performance was driven by sales into the electronics, aerospace and defense, automotive and industrial equipment sectors. The region also continues to benefit from investment in domestic development programs, particularly in China, India and South Korea.","I'm also delighted to announce that we have hired a new head of sales for Asia Pacific, replacing our former leader, who, as I mentioned earlier, is now leading sales in Europe.","Now, I would like to turn to M&A for a moment. You might have seen our acquisition -- our announcement a few weeks ago about our acquisition of Computer Engineering International, or CEI. A longtime ANSYS ecosystem partner, CEI augments ANSYS' solutions by helping users to quickly and easily visualize and analyze the immense data sets produced by complex simulations, so that they can rapidly get to the right engineering decisions. While the deal isn't material to our 2017 revenue, we're incredibly excited to add this very talented team and this great technology to ANSYS.","Moving onto the ANSYS executive team. I am delighted that Janet Lee has joined us as our new General Counsel. Janet has decades of experience that will help ANSYS as we enter the next phase of our growth. She has held leadership positions at HERE Technologies, Nokia and AOL, and worked at law firms in the United States and abroad. In her short tenure here, Janet has already made a big impact, and we're really delighted to have her counsel. Finally, I'd like to share with you a different sort of customer win. Emirates Team New Zealand used ANSYS technology and a simulation-driven development approach to make engineering and design improvements to optimize their yacht's performance. The team's seven-one win in the America's Cup speaks for itself, and everyone at ANSYS was proud of our part in the victory.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financial results in a little bit more detail. Maria?","Maria Shields","Thank you, Ajei. For the next few minutes, I'll review our second quarter financial results and comment on our Q3 and updated fiscal year 2017 outlook. All of the financial figures that I will be mentioning will be in terms of non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise. We ended Q2 posting strong results across most aspects of our business. This enabled us to deliver record revenue in earnings, which exceeded the upper end of our guidance. Key highlights include total revenue of $264.3 million for the quarter, a year-over-year growth of 8% in constant currency. Our Q2 revenue results include a negative currency impact of $2.1 million. Our recurring revenue for the second quarter totaled $200.3 million, or 76% of revenue, and grew 11% in constant currency over last year's second quarter.","The Company's consistent ability to offer our customers the choice of licensing that they desire, while also maintaining a solid base of recurring revenue, remains one of the hallmarks of our business model. During Q2, we closed 28 seven-figure deals, including four customers with orders in excess of 5 million and one customer with orders in excess of 10 million. For the first half of 2017, we had 67 customers with orders in excess of 1 million, including nine customers with orders over 5 million, and two customers with orders over 10 million. These orders, combined with our overall sales growth in recent quarters and continued strong renewal rates, contributed to a deferred revenue and backlog balance of $655.8 million. This is a record high and represents 25% growth as compared to Q2 of 2016. This positions us well for Q3 and the remainder of 2017.","In Q2, we achieved a gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 48.3%. These were both ahead of the margin guidance that we had provided on the last earnings call, largely due to a combination of hiring plans that did not close at the pace that we had assumed coming into the quarter, and the reversal of an R&D tax credit reserve in France of approximately $1 million as a result of the favorable conclusion of a tax audit. Including the second half impact of the addition of the recent CEI acquisition, combined with our internal hiring and investment plans, we are currently targeting full year 2017 operating margin in the range of 46% to 47%.","We reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.99 for the second quarter. Our Q2 GAAP results included $2 million of charges related to our previously announced workforce realignment. And currently, we are expecting to incur additional charges of up to $2 million, or $1.3 million net of tax, primarily during the third quarter of 2017 as we complete the realignment initiative.","Our operating cash flow for the second quarter continued to be very strong, and totaled $112 million, a 57% increase over last Q2. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $863 million, which was essentially flat with our closing balance in Q1. Keeping with our commitment to return capital to our stockholders, during Q2, we repurchased a total of 1 million shares. For the first half of 2017, we have completed repurchases of 2 million shares, and there are 3.5 million shares of capacity remaining in our authorized repurchase program.","Now, let's turn to guidance for the third quarter and full year 2017. We've initiated our outlook for Q3, with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $258 million to $267 million, which represents constant currency revenue growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.94 to $0.98. With respect to fiscal year 2017, we are again increasing our outlook to factor in our Q2 performance, movements in currency since we last provided guidance in May, the impact of the CEI acquisition for the second half of the year and our increasing confidence in the sales pipeline. This translates to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1,053,000,000 to $1,073,000,000 and non-GAAP EPS of $3.77 to $3.89.","We are targeting a non-GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 90% for the third quarter and full year, and non-GAAP operating margins of 47% to 48% for Q3 and 46% to 47% for fiscal year 2017. For the details around specific currency and tax rates and the other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and for 2017, are contained in the prepared remarks document.","And finally, before closing, I would like to remind everyone that our Investor Day will be held on Thursday, September 14, at the Hyatt Regency at the Pittsburgh Airport. Details on the agenda, as well as the registration form, are available on the IR homepage of our website. And since space is limited, if you expect to attend in person, please register as soon as possible, and please plan to join us the evening before the reception with management. We will also hold a webcast for the event, accessible on our IR website for those who can't attend in person.","So, operator, we can now open the phone lines to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Monika Garg of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg","You talked about strength in the semi industry. I have a question on the Redhawk too. Could you talk about how -- before you had talked about the consolidation of semi industry impacting its growth, maybe talk about how this business is growing. Any quantitative numbers could be helpful. Also, cadence tool Walter seems to be growing strong in power analysis also. Also talk about competition in the market.","Ajei Gopal","Sure. So what we are seeing for our tools in the space, I mean, we're seeing a demand as customers are going to a more and more advanced process nodes. We see the opportunity for simulation continue to grow. And so the cost of failure, if you consider something like 7-nanometers, the cost of failure is something like $270 million per design. And so customers are very keen to run more and more simulations, and we see that as an advantage to us because that's where we come in to provide the assurance around the capability to the design from a power and from a thermal perspective. So that's one aspect of it, is more simulation being driven as we go to advanced process nodes.","The other thing, of course, is as we think about the nature of these solutions, many of our customers are not just focused on a single physics, they're focused on multiphysics, so they're trying to run co-simulations in the chip and package to deal with things like power and thermal effects. And that's, again, an area where we shine, because we're able to bring in a number of technology from across our portfolio to be able to help our customers achieve this.","And I think the other area that where we are excited is, of course, we made a lot of investments in the Big Data and the analytics piece of our portfolio. And in the DAC conference, as I announced, we brought together -- we brought into our Redhawk solution, we've brought together some pretty compelling Big Data and analytics capabilities as we continue to transform that -- continue to evolve that product and as we continue address the needs of the customers at the higher end, and at these advanced process nodes. As far as the competitive dynamic is concerned, I think that our customers really value what we are trying to accomplish in terms of accuracy and speed of simulation. And we feel very confident in our product roadmap and our capabilities to manage the competitive landscape.","Monika Garg","And then, Maria, a question on the cash flow of -- is your cash flow guidance unchanged? And good strong cash flow in first half, are you raising or why not raise the guidance?","Maria Shields","Yes. So Monika, we are taking up our guidance for full year cash flow to now $385 million to $410 million.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","For the trailing 12 months, your bookings were up about 16%, and that's the third trailing 12-month period in which you've had a double digit bookings growth. Would you expect to be able to sustain that for 2017? And perhaps beyond in terms of showing that kind of double digit growth for bookings on a DTM basis? And with respect to the end market composition of bookings, I'm -- totally understand, of course, the variability from quarter-to-quarter by end market, but when we back into an approximation of your bookings by end market, on a quarterly basis, from the data that you gave, it does look as though you had, and perhaps you can correct this if it's wrong, a fairly material sequential decline in automotive from Q1 after having several quarters in a row of pretty good quarterly demand in automotive. On the other hand, you had very strong results again in electronics and semi. So maybe you could just talk about some of the quarter-to-quarter dynamics by end market? And then how that comprises your thinking for 2017?","Maria Shields","Yes, so Jay, let me start. We don't comment on bookings guidance, but a couple of things around bookings that I think are important to consider. If you take a look at just the quarter, it would appear on the surface that bookings growth has declined. However, if you just take a look at the fact that some of these larger deals and the timing of when they close can have extreme volatility on the bookings results. So last year in Q2, we had 2 $10 million deals, this year we had 1. And just that shift impacts the bookings growth by 6.5% for the quarter.","We have closed the first half with 9% bookings growth. And we closed everything that was in the pipeline and scheduled to close that we had planned. But as you commented, there are some deals that are particularly slated for the second half, a number of which are in the industries that you commented on relative to Q2, that are scheduled to close in the second half that are currently part of our guidance. And as you know, I always suggested that trailing 12 months performance within the industries is probably more indicative of the performance than looking at any quarter. Because when these deals, these larger deals close, can definitely skew the results in any one of the industry subsets.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. My technology follow-up for Ajei is that we saw it back, as you pointed out, the updating of Redhawk and your other EDA tools based on your new SeaScape architecture. And that has given you some good capacity increases there, but the question is, when do you think you'll follow through in your commitment of bringing your other non-EDA physics and solvers to that architecture to get similar kinds of capacity and analytics performance in the other solvers?","Ajei Gopal","Right. So as I mentioned earlier, we have a number of customers, obviously, who are looking to figure out the impact of the multiphysics impacts on their designs, and that goes across things like power, timing thermal, mechanical, electromagnetics, so that they can essentially avoid overdesign, on the one hand, or they can avoid the risk of complex and costly design failures. And so they're relying on simulation across all of these, in this multiphysics environment. And our semiconductor products now have integrated workflow with our electronics and our mechanical products. And so that allows customers to take advantage of this integrated direction that we are driving. And of course, as we continue to make progress on the SeaScape platform, this workflow will continue to get augmented to reflect the integration of SeaScape into that workflow.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI.","Ken Talanian","I was wondering if you could talk about the traction you saw from channel partners during the quarter? And where that is relative to where you'd like to be?","Maria Shields","Yes, so Ken, with respect to the quarter, the channel continues to perform on plan, and has really refocused as we've undertaken these past couple of years of refocusing on the channel. The channel itself has refocused on, not only the renewal portion of the business, but more importantly, driving new business, not only in existing accounts but in new logos. So we are very excited about the performance of the channel and the progress that we've made in that area. And we will continue in, particularly, in Europe as we look at some of our go-to-market initiatives. We anticipate that the gentleman who is now in charge of our European business will take a look at similar opportunities as he did in Asia Pacific to bolster our go-to-market by adding additional channel capacity. So we will continue in that area.","Ken Talanian","And just as a follow-up, I was curious have you seen any changes to your retention rates on the lease side?","Maria Shields","No. Our overall renewal rates on both leased and the maintenance business are in line with historical.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ross MacMillan","Ajei, maybe just for you first on Europe, given the very substantial changes you're making there, what's your expectation for the timing of when the new leader will -- Tom will have the -- will kind of get his arms this and start to see improved performance in core geographies? And just related to that, the new head of global major account, is that a brand-new position? Or is it a brand-new -- or is it a replacement, maybe with a geographical change?","Ajei Gopal","So let me address that and perhaps put the question a little bit in context. So we've had our new leader for Europe in placed now for a couple of quarters; he's had his opportunity to get his hands around the problems that we are dealing with in Europe. He -- and as I mentioned in my script, the growth that we've had outside of the UK and Germany was essentially double-digit constant currency for the rest of Europe. And so we don't have a universal problem across all of Europe, we have a more targeted problem in a couple of areas that we need to be very focused on. And clearly, the UK and Germany represent areas that we need to improve our performance. We've, as I mentioned, we've made all these personnel changes. But if I think about the UK as an example.","In the past, we had perhaps over-rotated on to oil and gas and with the -- obviously, the multiyear impact on that business on that sector, we've had to re-pivot and move to some of the other areas where we've frankly been historically strong and our products really work well, but we hadn't necessarily been in the market in the UK in those sectors. And that's an area where we now have incremental focus, and we're trying to get that done. Your point about major accounts. If you think about Germany, where of course, there's a very strong automotive industry, many of those were within our major accounts team, and we already had a major accounts team that was in place. That was run out of Canonsburg.","And what we've done now is the new leader for that major accounts team, which is a global role, it has worldwide responsibility across the U.S., Europe and Asia, that is now based out of our -- that individual is now based out of our offices in Germany and reports directly into Rick. So we are -- we have people in Europe who are not just regionally -- not only have regional sales responsibilities but also have global sales responsibility. So I think there is a number of elements.","We are certainly thinking about the channel and the importance of the channel, as Maria mentioned. And as she said, the individual who's responsible for Europe is someone who\u2019s had a success in our channel turnaround in Asia. And we are excited about his savviness about the channel and as well as his prior performance. So there's a number of things that we have underway. As you know, with any sales organization, it takes a couple of quarters. We've been in this transition now for a couple of quarters, and I'm expecting it certainly to kick in as we get into 2018 and beyond. That's when we start to see the results of what we're doing.","Ross MacMillan","And Maria, my follow up. Just maybe two. Just on the rates for the year, can you maybe parse out currency versus fundamentals? And then on R&D, it's moved a lot between Q1 and Q2, just the dollars. Was there something peculiar in terms of timing, if you could just drill down on that as well?","Maria Shields","Yes. So we're off on the currency, I would say in the range of $7 million to $10 million, and then, the remainder being the fundamentals of what we see in the business for the second half. With respect to your question on R&D, in Q1, there were significant charges relative to the realignment in R&D that didn't necessarily repeat in Q2. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks in Q2, the R&D line also benefited from an additional approximately $1 million of the reversal of reserve that we had established in connection with a challenge to some R&D credits in France. And our team was able to successfully complete the audit, and the French government allowed us to maintain those credits, so we reversed that reserve in the Q2 P&L through the R&D line.","Operator","The next question will be from Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Anil Doradla","Good job on the reserves. So Ajei, the question that I had was around investments. Now since coming onboard, one of the initiatives that you've talked about is investing in the channel, investing in the sales force. You spoke a lot about that today. And you do expect to see some of the benefits. But from a spending point of view, what innings are you in right now? Both from an internal sales spend point of view and kind of the channels investment and spend point of view? Not necessarily through when you're going to start seeing the benefits, but really from a spend point of view.","Ajei Gopal","Yes. So we are, I would say, relatively early into this transformation that we've been talking about. I've been CEO now for two quarters, and obviously, I was here for Q4 of last year as well as President and COO. We have a upcoming planning process that the team is working through, which will ultimately lead to our budget for next year. And what we are in the process of doing right now is evaluating what the budget should look like for next year, and where we should be spending our resources. As you can imagine, we have a number of areas where we could obviously invest, and we have to prioritize, and that's the process that we'll be going through in the fall.","Anil Doradla","So Ajei, given that you are still in the early stages and it seems like there is some spend, when I look at the operating margins, I mean, look at the first half plus whatever you've given out on the September guidance, you folks are maintaining your 46% to 47% for the full year on operating margins. And just doing a little bit of a math. I mean, when we look at the December quarter, shall we be looking at kind of a step down? Or are the 46% to 47% that you've given right now is kind of conservative?","Maria Shields","So what I'd say is it's not conservative, because Q4, based on our current plans, will include higher commissions and will include some of the run rates from the additional hires that we've got in place. Not only that came in late in the second quarter, you heard some of them that Ajei highlighted in his remarks, but hires that we have planned for the second half of the year.","What I'd say is -- when we announced the realignment initiative, the first thing that we did was look at where we were going to redeploy those dollars into incremental investment in the business. And that was the first stage before doing realignment plus incremental. So this year, we're working our way through the redeployment of those dollars, whether it's in new positions or whether it's in projects. And then I think, as Ajei mentioned, we'll be working through the operating plan. Because given the current environment for simulation, and given the conversations that we're having with our customers around the opportunities, there is tremendous areas for us to invest in to not only maintain our leadership, but more importantly, to set the stages for longer-term growth opportunities.","Operator","The next question will be from Rob Oliver with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Rob Oliver","Ajei, I know you gave some color on the call about some of the large deals. I was wondering if we could drill down a little bit more on that? And you could talk about the enterprise portfolio, sales efforts and some of Rick's effort to broaden out the use base of the software within large accounts. It sounds as if customers are increasingly willing obviously to take ratable here. Is that helping to increase the appetite? And what are you seeing in terms of more pervasive usage of the products, even maybe more downstream than you typically would have sold to in the past?","Ajei Gopal","So as Maria said, there is a huge appetite for our solutions out there. And in part, it's driven by, as I've said in the past, it's driven by the fact that many of our customers are going through this next phase of their design cycles to factor in these big changes in the way that they have to think about how their products are going to be operating. So we have -- we're having conversations, for example, around IoT. We're having conversations around autonomous. We're having conversations around additive. We're having conversations around multiphysics. And simulation plays a really completing role in all of these conversations, because in many ways, simulation helps our customers accelerate their innovation to market. And that's been a universal.","Now for smaller companies, obviously, they have -- they're much more sensitive to budgets, but for larger companies and especially when you think about some of these broader, much more sophisticated initiatives, we are able to have this multiphysics conversation in a much more strategic manner with them, with these changes. I mentioned 5G as an example. If you take 5G, the complexity of building these next generation 5G solutions includes elements that have to do with incentive design, that have to interference. You're dealing with very high-bandwidth solutions, you have to be very focused on the interactions between different antennas and how you would be for example in a mobile device -- with a mobile device in the car, how we pick up these signals. All of these are incredibly complicated and that pushes towards more simulations. So we're seeing a lot of excitement on the part of the customers as we talk about our capabilities. And as we start to put in place the repeatable methodologies within these major accounts, that gives us an opportunity to be able to cross-sell across the portfolio.","I mentioned one cross-sell example in my prepared remark or in my script. And in general, when the company is buying to the ANSYS' platform, it is easily -- it is much easier for us to be able to establish that cross-sell capability. So -- and oftentimes, we will enter a customer with maybe a long one physics or maybe a relatively smaller deal. And then we'll work away with multiple deals into a large deployment across multiple physics, that's pretty significant. And that's why, as I mentioned to you in the last call, what Rick and his team are building is not so much an episodic onetime ELA. What they're trying to do is to make sure that we can build an ongoing metaphorical platform, if you will, between the customers and ANSYS, so that we can understand that there's challenges, and we can help them use our technologies to address the challenges, which results in a sequence of activities and an ongoing ability on our part to be able to monetize that relationship.","Now Rick will be able to talk more about his strategy around go-to-market, around major accounts, what we're doing on the territories, how we're working with the channel. He'll be able to go into much more detail during our Investor Day -- during his Investor Day presentation in September.","Robert Oliver","And just a very quick follow-up for Maria. On the hiring front, aside from the high-profile hires in motion of people around movement, was there anything particular this quarter that caused the hiring to be lag -- to lag or be deferred? And I think you mentioned that some of the hires have already been made for next quarter, or is that just merely timing?","Maria Shields","Yes. It's timing, and it's also, I would say, particularly, in the R&D area. The -- some of the skill sets that we're seeking are very unique. So it takes time to find qualified candidates, and to go through the interview process and to recruit them. As you can imagine, many of these people, particularly in certain geographies, who have jobs but are interested in joining, have longer-term commitments before they can leave their current employment. So we are not just looking to check the box and fill bodies, we're looking for people to join our team who will help us to continue to grow the business and who will be with us as many of our R&D folks are for literally decades.","Operator","Our next question will be from Sterling Auty with J. P. Morgan.","Sterling Auty","Maria, I want to follow-up on your comments to Jay, on the bookings front. Is it right to interpret what you're saying is you're expecting stronger bookings and bookings growth in the second half rather than just looking at the June quarter, where I think the reported bookings were, just, call it, roughly flat year-over-year?","Maria Shields","Yes. So Sterling, no doubt the second half, our plans in the sales pipeline do include a larger number of large deals. And so we are -- our current plan is that they will close, but we also understand we are given a range, because with large deals, timing can always be a challenge, particularly in Q4 as you get with competing holidays and other events. So that is, in fact, exactly what we're seeing in the second half is more bookings on the larger deals.","Sterling Auty","And then, Ajei, in terms of -- a lot of comments around semiconductors and their strength there. Is there a way to characterize or give us a sense of what the growth rates look like from the various segments? Meaning the semis area versus fluids, versus multiphysics or is it just not how you look at the business?","Ajei Gopal","No. We don't really break that out. We don't really break that out. But I think it's fair to say when you look at the -- when you look at a strategy, our strategy of course, is around multiphysics, and it's about being able to sell the whole portfolio. When you look at some of the initiatives that customers are driving, there is a lot of excitement, of course, about electronics and electronics within a product that previously didn't have smart controls, and that's something that we are actively involved with, and that's where some of our capabilities on antenna design, signal integrity and so forth come in.","And then of course, when you start to think about chip package system, that's what brings together our semiconductor products and our electronics products as well as some of the mechanical and fluid products when you start to think about issues of thermal, et cetera. So there are a number of different multiphysics initiatives that we drive across the portfolio. Our strategy, as I've said before, is around pervasive engineering simulation. We believe that customers are looking for the best-in-class simulation technologies, because that's what allows them to build products with a high degree of confidence. They're not looking for a basket of goods, they're looking for best-in-class. That's what we focus on.","And we are committed to a strategy of driving this multiphysics solution capability across, frankly, all of our physics embedded software. All of that as part of the strategy that we have on the table. So that's how we think about our business, and that's how we think about our success.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Steven Koenig","I wanted to ask about current bookings, which is something that ANSYS has trained us to look at here. And Maria, you already talked about bookings, maybe some of those comments apply here. In the quarter, current bookings look like grew maybe 2% to 3%. It sounds like large deal, comps, timing of renewals, you also mentioned execution in Europe, could you maybe parse out the importance of those factors? And related to the current bookings metric, if that's the best indicator of how the business is growing, how should we think about the growth trend for that metric and the opportunity to accelerate it?","Maria Shields","Yes. So you're correct relative to your calculation on growth rate for the quarter. I would say, the number one factor was, no doubt, the large deal. So as I mentioned, in response to an earlier question, Steve, if you just look at last year's Q2, we had two $10 million deals. This year, we had one. And those $10 million deals sometimes are multiyear deals. So they won't necessarily renew the following year. So just one deal of $10 million has an impact of 6.5% on the bookings growth just in the second quarter. So as we've tried to highlight, as these larger deals become more of our fabric, there is going to be volatility in bookings in quarter-to-quarter depending on the cycle of when these deals happen.","It's a reality, but it's one that just demonstrates, what we've been saying is, our customers' appetite to increase the footprint of our technology and our solutions across their business to help them solve problems that they've never had to solve before. And we are uniquely positioned given our portfolio to help them. So the volatility is just something that is going to be part of the business and probably something that would lend itself to looking at annual metrics as opposed to quarterly metrics, because things can easily move from quarter-to-quarter as we've seen.","Steven Koenig","So Maria, the second part of that question, I want to get to that, which is that how should we think about the trend on that? Or maybe, Ajei, you want to speak to that, and the opportunity to accelerate your growth? And I did want to ask a follow-up to Ajei about maybe just getting an update on ANSYS' efforts with IoT and Digital Twin. A little more color there would be great.","Ajei Gopal","So let me just quickly take the question on IoT and Digital Twin. As I said to you before, we have a number of customers who are excited about IoT, Digital Twin. In May, we announced a partnership with PTC around their ThingWorx platform, and that's going to allow customers to essentially transform a raw data into actionable intelligence using the physics models that we're able to bring to market, so that was something that we were pretty excited about.","And we obviously we see that the IoT conversation driving the discussion within our customers about connectivity. So that naturally moves then to what about wireless connectivity solutions and technologies, and that leads to a conversation, for example, about 5G antenna layout. Again, these are areas that we're very strong. So the IoT conversation really plays to our strength of multiphysics so that we can provide a real physics-based model in a Digital Twin that allows customers to do predictive maintenance. And that's a very important word for them, predictive maintenance and being proactive about that, because when you start to think about customers that for example may have thousands and thousands or tens of thousands, I mean, even hundreds of thousands of assets out there, the cost of maintenance is significant, and being able to do predictive maintenance is important.","And so if you were to use something like simulation, Digital Twins, we think that in many cases, it could be a significant percentage of the failures that you see in operations could be avoided through the use of Digital Twin. So we're able to make this case with our customers. They see that, then they move to a conversation about wireless and it plays to our sweet spot. So that's, I think, an area where we see a lot of future opportunity for us as well.","Maria Shields","Yes. And Steve, relative to your question on trends and how to think about it. Here's the way that we view it. We had a strong, really strong Q4 last year. We had a strong Q1. Our first half bookings is 9%, and we've got large deals that are scheduled for the second half. So, overall, we feel that we're making very good progress in line with our plan, and we are extremely confident that the addition of the new global head of major accounts and some of the positions that he'll be adding to his team will even better position us as we head into 2018.","Operator","The next question will come from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Gabriela Borges","Maybe just a follow up on the overall demand environment. Ajei, if you could comment if you're seeing any change in the macros that you run to -- in 2Q versus 1Q? And as we go into the second half, the commentary on the large deals potentially closing deals, just been pretty consistent over the last couple of quarters. Is the visibility into those large deals improving? And maybe we can compare how the visibility was this time last year going to what ultimately ended up being a very strong 4Q '16?","Ajei Gopal","It's hard for me to give you a year-over-year comparison about visibility, because I wasn't here at this time last year. And obviously, we have changes in leadership in place. So I think, giving you that subject of color is kind of hard to do on a year-over-year basis.","Let me give you a couple of comments about some of the industries. Obviously, I don't think there's any fundamental change between last quarter and this quarter in terms of how the industries themselves are spending or the sectors themselves are spending. We don't see any fundamental profound change from quarter-to-quarter. They're obviously small variations here and there. As we've highlighted in the past, automotive continues to be pretty excited about the autonomous transformation that's taking place, and that's an area that we have good solutions, and that's an area that's driving our connection in our relationship with the automotive companies. So autonomous, ADAS, that continues to drive some of the conversations. ","Chip package system on electronics, as I said, with the electronics essentially becoming ubiquitous, it's electronics is 35% of the billing materials of the car, today it's going to 50%. The discussions about chip package board system, those kind of conversations were able to effectively drive, and that's also driving some of our engagement in the electronics and the high-tech sector as well as, of course, things like telecommunications 5G, that I've highlighted a couple of times. So there's no fundamental and profound change, but there continues to be I think strong demand for the ANSYS portfolio across all dimensions. The one sector that we've highlighted again in the past is oil and gas, that's still historically off where it used to be, and years ago, but that -- it really hasn't changed quarter-over-quarter.","Gabriela Borges","That's helpful color. And as a follow-up, if I may. Last quarter we talked about the decision not to report ELA, sometimes they can be artificially restricting to focus on onetime large deals. As you went through 2Q, did you see any change in how the sales force interacted with customers? And in some of the large deals that were closed in 2Q versus 1Q because of the decision not to report ELAs?","Ajei Gopal","As we said, what we're trying to accomplish is to make sure we have an ongoing relationship between ANSYS and the customers around which we can build a metaphorical platform and I've used this word a couple of times around which we can monetize our solutions. That doesn't translate into a single deal, that translates into multiple transactions that might spread over multiple quarters. And that strategy is something that's very important for us. Customers oftentimes will come in with 1 physics, and then will start to put in a second physics. And as they broaden their ANSYS product platform, they will add more and more to that product platform.","I gave an example of a longtime customer who was using pretty much most of the ANSYS portfolio in the platform, and -- but they were not using ANSYS SCADE, and we were able to have a conversation with them, and that became part of the relationship. So the focus has always been on expanding our footprint within the customers, and that's essentially where we are as a company. We see that as an opportunity to build on these multiyear relationships and to add more technology into those relationships.","Operator","The next question will come from Mark Schappel with Benchmark.","Mark Schappel","Ajei, just one question. It's on CEI. It appears that they built themselves a post-processing tool. And this is an area that ANSYS has always been relatively strong. And I was just wondering if you could just go into a little bit more detail what capabilities CEI is bring to ANSYS?","Ajei Gopal","Sure. CEI has been a long-time ANSYS ecosystem partner. We've had collaborations with them for many years. They certainly help on the post-processing as you rightly pointed out. They add in -- essentially, part of what they do is give you photorealistic images so it makes the post-processing much more -- it pops more, it's more -- it's easier for people to consume. They're able to pull together multiple streams of simulation data more quickly, and you can integrate multiple views that can show different variable graphics, et cetera, into a single window. So essentially, and obviously we were strong there but with the partnership here, we believe that we can significantly simplify and speed up the way in which our customers are dealing with the complex results that you get from simulation. And it helps them absorb those results more rapidly.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks.","Ajei Gopal","Thank you. And thank you for joining the call today. Look, I'm really much more excited than ever before about ANSYS and the opportunity ahead of us. And I hope you'll be able to join us on September 14 for Investor Day here in Pittsburgh. Thank you again and enjoy the rest of the day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"2053":["ANSYS, Inc.

With us today are Ajei Gopal, Chief Executive Officer; Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer, and Annette Arribas, Senior Director, Global Investor Relations.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks.","Annette N. Arribas - ANSYS, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks documents have been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supportive data relative to our fourth quarter and full year financial results and business update, as well as, our Q1 and fiscal year 2017 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","So, I'd like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are available via our website.","Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures, are included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.","I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal for his opening remarks. Ajei?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you, Annette and good morning, everyone. The demand for ANSYS' portfolio has never been stronger. The merger of the physical and the digital worlds is creating an unprecedented disruption, resulting in a new generation of innovative and transformative products, such as self-driving vehicles, personalized medical devices and smart buildings. The opportunity is immense, and we're seeing it play out in industries as diverse as industrial equipment, to consumer goods, to healthcare.","This coming generation of products will be significantly more complicated to design and manufacture than anything on the market today. And to make things even more challenging, these products will have to be produced more quickly than ever before. And it's not just the products themselves that are becoming smarter and more exciting, this disruption extends to the way they are being manufactured, brought to market, and operated.","Simulation, and whether you call it final for verification, simulation is the most important solution companies have to help them address product complexity and the need for speed throughout the product lifecycle. Whether it's just single physics or multi physics simulation, companies have come to rely on the accuracy, flexibility and robustness that simulation provides. And that's where ANSYS comes in. ANSYS is the only vendor with the depth and breadth of simulation capabilities across all major physics to empower our customers to bring this next generation of products to market.","I am more excited than ever about ANSYS' future, and I'm delighted to join you today on my first earnings call since becoming ANSYS' CEO on the 1 of January this year. If you recall, I joined as President and Chief Operating Officer in August, and I've been on our board of directors since 2011. So I've seen firsthand the remarkable work this company has done.","As you saw in our earnings documents, we closed 2016 on a strong note with financial results, which met or exceeded the guidance that we provided in November. I'm very pleased with the performance of the business in Q4, especially with our strong bookings that resulted in record deferred revenue and backlog of $638 million, which is a leading indicator of the ongoing health of our business.","Our 2017 guidance remains unchanged other than for adjustments to currency. We are also off to a fast start in Q1, with continued momentum from the higher growth that we just experienced in Q4. Maria will review the financial results in a bit more detail in a few minutes, but let me give you some color into the performance of our sales regions.","North America revenue grew 10% in Q4, including a 15% growth in leased revenue. For 2016, North America revenue grew 4% in constant currency, with 9% in leased revenue. This is further evidence of the shift in preference for time-based licenses that we have highlighted in recent quarters.","Electronics, aerospace and defense, and automotive were the strongest industries. Driven by continued strong performance in China, India and Taiwan, the Q4 results in Asia Pacific included a 12% revenue growth and a 6% increase in leased revenue, both in constant currency.","For 2016, the region experienced overall 9% revenue growth, including 8% growth in lease. We had double-digit growth from our indirect channels in China, India, Taiwan and South Korea. From an industry perspective, we continue to see the adoption of the broader portfolio, including integrated multiphysics, electronics and control software.","Our weakest region was Europe, delivering constant currency revenue growth of less than 1% in Q4 and 3% in 2016. These results reflect a combination of mixed sales execution and lingering pockets of economic and geopolitical issues. Germany led the region with 6% and 8% constant currency growth for Q4 and 2016 respectively, while we saw continued weakness in the UK and France.","With regards to industry performance in Europe in Q4, automotive, industrial equipment, electronics, aerospace and energy, all contributed relatively equally. In recognition of the disappointing results in our European business, in the fourth quarter, we took specific actions to improve sales execution and sharpen our go-to-market strategy in the region. These included, but were not limited to, senior sales leadership changes, a new organizational structure that allows for more effective deployment of sales resources by separating out the largest economies and consolidating smaller and similar economies, and a greater emphasis on partnering with the indirect channel. We believe these changes will set the foundation for a stronger 2017 and beyond in Europe.","As I mentioned in our last earnings call, one of my top priorities was to fill the vacant role of the Global Head of Sales. I'm really excited that Rick Mahoney joined our team as Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Customer Excellence in the middle of December. Rick is a superb sales leader. He's previously led global sales teams in the EDA space, and has been responsible for generating billions in business. He understands large deals, has relevant industry experience, and knows what it takes to build a winning sales culture. As an added benefit, given the highly technical nature of our products and our customers, Rick began his career in software development and technical presales. Simply put, he is the perfect fit to lead our sales and services organization. He has already made a difference in the short time here and I look forward to telling you more about his accomplishments on future calls.","In Q4, my extended leadership team and I worked on our 2017 plan. Our planning work was done in the context of our desire to reinvigorate top line growth, while preserving our commitments on strong margin structure and cash flow. The team has done a tremendous job, working collaboratively and cross-functionally to pull together detailed plans for product, go-to-market strategies, staffing and other areas of critical investment.","To drive growth, we realize that we had to increase the level of investment and emphasis in certain areas of our go-to-market, product and infrastructure activities. We also realized that with ANSYS' growth as a company from $50 million of revenue in 2000 to almost $1 billion today through a combination of organic investments and acquisitions that we have opportunities to fine tune our organization. As such, as mentioned in the last earnings documents, we began a workforce realignment in Q4 with the intention of freeing up investment capacity and reallocating that capacity to other areas that will generate the highest returns to the company. Maria will discuss the financial impact of this realignment in her comments.","Earlier this quarter, we launched the latest version of our industry-leading portfolio, ANSYS 18, and I'm excited to announce the demand for it is strong. Built on our industry-leading technology, ANSYS 18 is a feature-rich release that customers can use to accurately simulate and give insights into products that are as diverse as the latest smartphone to highly efficient aircraft engines. With ANSYS 18, users can reduce costly physical testing, improve time to market and lower development costs, all while spurring innovation.","We have a number of recent examples of customers around the world who have leveraged the power of ANSYS technology for amazing results. For example, a large defense contractor reduced testing time from a year of physical testing down to about three weeks of digital prototyping that significantly improved time to market. The company was also able to cut costs and estimates that it has saved about $2 million by leveraging ANSYS to reduce systems failures.","Another customer, Orbital Power designs, develops, and manufacturers the highest power-density heavy fuel rotary engines in the world. Based in the UK, this private company is making a big impact on the industry by using ANSYS solutions to create digital prototypes of its engines that are one-fifth the weight of competitor's products, while decreasing costs by 93% and shortening design time by 70%.","On the semiconductor side, ANSYS worked with a major mobile device manufacturer to deliver a tape-out on the most advanced process node, which is critical to deliver reliable, high-performance, cost-effective chips. We have grown our relationship with this company with a multiyear agreement.","Our historical strength in digital prototyping is just one way that ANSYS delivers values to customers across industries. In addition, ANSYS 18 expands the use of simulation throughout the product lifecycle from the earliest product concepts, all the way through operations. ANSYS 18 enables designers to make simulation based choices near the beginning of the design process, when 80% of the product cost gets locked in. Using ANSYS 18, a designer can rapidly evaluate thousands of widest possibilities for potential designs and quickly assess product performance. We call this process digital exploration.","You might have seen our press release yesterday, where we highlighted Grundfos' use of digital exploration. Based in Denmark, this multibillion euro pump manufacturer is using simulation to digitally examine thousands of design options to optimize pump efficiency. By using ANSYS simulation, Grundfos reduced its overall design time by 30%, allowing it to bring a more efficient product to market faster.","With ANSYS 18, we also move simulation downstream to production. We are enabling our customers to create digital twins of their products, so they understand the performance of individual products in production in real time, which dramatically reduces unplanned downtime. In fact, we're working with a European division of GE to jointly develop technology to accelerate digital twin adoption, quality and customer results.","As you can see, ANSYS 18 expands simulation from digital exploration to digital prototyping to digital twins. We call this pervasive engineering simulation and we believe that it will transform the industry. Simply put, the future is here today with ANSYS 18 and if you haven't already been to a website to learn more about this offering, I encourage you to go to ansys.com\/18 after the call concludes.","Finally, Walid Abu-Hadba will be leaving the company for personal reasons on May 1. Now Walid has made many important contributions to ANSYS during his four-year tenure with the company. And perhaps the most important is the development of a key group of strong product leaders below Walid, who believe in and are committed to the ANSYS' vision and strategy.","Now that Rick is here, and I no longer drive day-to-day management of sales, and given my years of experience running product organization, I'm looking forward to working more closely with the product leaders over the coming months to help guide the product roadmap by incorporating customer feedback and to ensure that we are spending our R&D dollars in the areas that would yield the highest returns.","I want to take this opportunity to thank Walid for everything that he has done for ANSYS. Walid will always be a friend of the company and he will always be a friend of mine.","With that, allow me to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financial results in a little bit more detail. Maria?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. For the next few minutes, I'll add some additional perspective on our Q4 and fiscal year 2016 operational performance, touch on some key financial highlights, and also comment on our Q1 and fiscal 2017 outlook.","Also just to note, I'll be commenting in terms of non-GAAP. The results of Q4 reflect improved execution across many aspects of our business. Key highlights include total revenue of $270.6 million for the quarter and $988.6 million for the year. We reported EPS of $0.98 for the fourth quarter and $3.63 for the year.","As outlined in our earnings release, the Q4 and 2016 GAAP results include approximately $3.4 million or $0.03 per share related to workforce realignment activities that were not previously included in the company's November financial guidance. The Q4 and 2016 results also include in both the GAAP and non-GAAP results a charge of $4.7 million in connection with an employment-related settlement, which was also not included in the financial guidance provided last November.","We achieved gross margins of 89% for the quarter and for the year, and operating margins of 45% and 47% for the quarter and the year respectively.","The fourth quarter's operating margin was adversely impacted by approximately 2% related to the previously mentioned employment-related settlement.","Sales bookings growth far outpaced revenue growth in Q4. This was driven by a combination of the 37 seven and eight figure deals which were closed in the quarter, eight of which were enterprise agreements, as well as an increase in software license sales and solid maintenance renewals. These factors all contributed to deferred revenue and backlog of $638 million, representing a new record high and a 26.5% growth as compared to Q4 of 2015. This puts us in a very good position as we head into 2017.","Recurring revenue for the year was a healthy 74%, higher than the 2015, and on a larger revenue base. The company's consistent ability to maintain a solid base of recurring revenue is one of the hallmarks of our business model.","We reported operating cash flow of $357 million for the year, and we ended the year with total cash and short-term investments of $823 million. We closed 2016 with a total of 3.7 million shares repurchased at a cost of $336 million, leaving 1.3 million shares in the authorized pool. And as you saw in last night's announcement, the board renewed our commitment to continue to return capital to our stockholders by increasing the authorized share repurchase program back to 5 million shares.","Now let me spend a moment on our outlook. We've initiated our outlook for Q1, with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $237 million to $246 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.85. With respect to fiscal year 2017, we're updating our November outlook to factor in movements in currency, particularly the weakening of the Japanese yen. This translates to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.10 billion to $1.45 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of $3.63 to $3.83.","We are targeting a non-GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 88% to 89% for the quarter and the year, and non-GAAP operating margins of 45% to 46% for Q1 and 46% to 47% for 2017.","Before we move to Q&A, let me offer some brief commentary around trends in our licensing model. For 46 years, ANSYS has been committed to offering our customers a range of options to fit their licensing preferences. With 45,000 global customers, there is no one size fits all. Our history of growing these customer relationships over decades has shown that this flexibility helps to shorten sales cycles and to drive adoption of our platform and broad portfolio of solutions.","In the past year, we've seen both an increasing preference in certain markets for time-based licenses as well as an increase in enterprise agreements among our larger customers.","In the short-term, our flexible licensing model may create variability in our results due to variances in revenue recognition. However, over the long-term, we are confident that we will continue to achieve growth in revenue, sales bookings, deferred revenue and backlog, and most importantly, customer relationships that we can continue to grow for years to come.","Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and fiscal year 2017 are contained in the prepared remarks document.","So Andrea, I'll now suggest that we can open up the phone lines to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Good morning, Ajei, and welcome to the company and your first earnings call.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","I had a couple of questions. Well, let's open up with the backlog and deferred, good job on that. If I look at the short-term deferred and backlog, it just went up by $58 million, but if I take the longer term in consideration, that's almost $150 million. Now I compare this with your full year guidance, in absolute dollars that's about $20 million to $50 million increase from 2016. So the question is, I mean why is the guidance not higher? Are you just being conservative or is there a degree of caution in converting some of the backlogs?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","So, Anil, I'll take that. I would say at this point in time, there is, as you can imagine, given the size of some of these deals, some volatility around the timing of the closing of those. We've got a healthy pipeline as we head into 2017, but we are being a little cautious given that Rick is new to the scene and we're working our way through some of the transformations in the sales organization. So, we feel good about the pipeline. We feel good about the opportunity, but we're also being cautious, given how early in the year it is.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Good. Ajei, you talked about mixed execution on sales on Europe, you're taking some steps. Can you just elaborate on it a little bit more?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Sure. So, there are couple of things that I highlighted in my comments. One is, we've made some leadership changes in the European sales organization, which we felt will improve our ability to execute. The second is with respect to how we were going to market. And before we had somewhat of a mix go-to-market strategy. To give you an example, we had the leader who was responsible for Germany also being responsible for the Nordics. And as a result, that was dissipating his efforts across both Germany and the Nordics, and Germany of course being a very strong economy and the Nordics being a little bit smaller, he was being pulled in two different directions.","So what we've done as a result of the go-to-market, as I described is, we've essentially separated out the UK, France and Germany as key regions with leaders who are focused on that. Germany is of course including Switzerland and Austria, so we've got a key set of leaders focused on those areas and then we've taken the other smaller economies and we've grouped them together in a couple of regions, where we've coupled and linked like geos together. So we feel that that will significantly improve and streamline our ability to execute and focus our team on the thing that's most important.","And then finally the last point is, with respect to channels, we're really making an investment in indirect channels. If you look at our performance in Asia, you'll see that we delivered double-digit growth in our indirect channel, and we've made some investments in channels last year. So we're trying to make investments in channel, in the channel in Europe, and you'll see the results of that as we start to execute through the year.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And if you don't mind me squeezing in one last one, with the departure of Walid, are you going to fill up a product position or are you just going to keep it as is?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, Walid is leaving on the 1 of May and I'll have a plenty of time between now and then to work with the product team under Walid. And as I said in my comments, these are very seasoned executives. These are not uniquely technologists. These are people who understand how to run a P&L and they have an enormous amount of experience between them. So I am looking forward to working much more closely with them.","As you know or as you might know from my background, I am a product guy for many years and I believe I can bring a different perspective to the table and I'm looking forward to working with these guys on product roadmaps, bringing the customer perspective into the roadmap and also thinking about the longer-term strategy of the business. So this will give me a good opportunity to get my hands on into the details. Just as I did with the sales organization before Rick came on board and I believe that four-month period when I was running the sales organization gave me a really good insight into what was happening in sales. And so I am looking forward to spending some more time with the product team.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And great job on the backlog and deferred revenue guidance.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Monika Garg of Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, we've seen recent M&A in simulation space in last 12 months, Siemens, Dassault, Hexagon, all bought companies. So the question is, are you seeing an increased competition in the space?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So the question is, are we seeing an increased competition in the space as a result of the M&A. Well, what's happening is, when I look at our product portfolio and you look at what customers are looking for, I believe we have the strongest product portfolio in the industry for what we do. We address some of the key challenges that customers are having in the area of simulation. We provide the most \u2013 the best accuracy and the most effective, I believe solver technology in the industry and so that remains a constant. In many cases, you find technologies that were previously competing with us in the marketplace now under a different roof and we haven't really seen that \u2013 we don't really see that making a tremendous amount of impact on our business.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. Then one for Maria. Well, your cash flow from operation is actually down two years in a row. I mean, given that your operating income is growing, why would that be the case? And then maybe I missed it, but have you provided cash flow from operation guidance for 2017? Thanks a lot.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","So, Monika, I would say, Q4, if you look at Q4, there is really a significant factor relative to cash flow that was negatively impacted by three days of DSO, as it relates to the larger deals, which were highly backend loaded. So, we did not get the benefit of about $9 million worth of cash flow, which we had modeled into our outlook for Q4. And for the full year, in 2016 versus 2015, we did have about $11 million of incremental tax payment. So those are the two key factors relative to cash flow swings in Q4 and for the full year. We have updated our cash flow outlook to factor in, not only the changes in currency since we last guided, but also the restructuring and the settlement. So we are suggesting cash flow of $360 million to $380 million for fiscal year 2017 at this time.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to ask about your bookings results and what your expectations might be by end market or vertical. Based on the data that you provided last night on a trailing 12 month basis, we could see that certainly for Q4 and for the year, you had particularly strong results in the semiconductor market after having had a number of quarters of fairly weak bookings in semis. And similarly you had quite strong results in aero and defense, which was pretty consistently strong throughout the year. So, I guess, a couple of questions there. How are you thinking about growth by vertical in terms of your 2017 outlook, particularly given what might be tough comps for you in semis and A&D in 2016?","And were any of the ELAs, or any of the large deals in Q4 business that might otherwise have been done in 2017, particularly the semi business, were any of those, let's say, early EDA multiyear renewals?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","So, Jay, let me just talk \u2013 I'll take the numbers piece and then I'll let Ajei take some of the qualitative commentary. So, you're correct in what you commented on relative to the strength, particularly in semis and aerospace and defense. The semis, none of those were early renewals, many of them were renewals that were in the pipeline and were slated to close. The good news is that with the addition of some of the technology that we have added into our semiconductor business unit, that bodes well, we believe, for continued growth in that aspect of our business. And as we look at the pipeline heading into 2017 as it currently exists, I think you'll see continued growth in those segments and we are also hopeful that some of the investments that we've made around the new initiatives in auto will continue to yield increased growth as we make our way through 2017.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. And then just to give you some perspective on the qualitative from a business perspective, if you think about the semis, as our customers are moving to advanced process nodes like 16-nanometer and below, the designs as you know are becoming significantly more complex and that will drive the need for more simulation and frankly that drives more seeds of our products. And especially when you start thinking about 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, that's especially the case. So we see that's a natural driver for incremental demand for our offerings.","Also as you see, complex process is moving from the mobile space into new applications like autonomous vehicles, those systems require tremendous amounts of computing resources. They are creating power and thermal challenges, they require advanced multiphysics simulation and that's right up our sweet spot, that's exactly what we can do and we can help in this multi-domain simulation of the chip package system that's essential for those systems. So that's again going to drive more simulation.","And then finally, as traditional systems companies are moving into custom silicon, we see the opportunity as well for our technologies to continue grow. So that's in the semiconductor space. And of course, we talked about some of the others briefly, but Maria mentioned automotive, there, self-driving vehicles or ADAS is a big driver, and we see significant opportunity there.","Let me give you a very quick anecdote. One of the CEO's of a large automotive company predicted that to get a car, vehicle to be tested for self-driving capabilities completely certified, it would need about nine billion miles of road tests, to test every possible scenario and nine billion miles of road testing is simply not practical.","And if you think about that challenge, the only way in which you could get that certification is by simulating some of that, and that requires simulation across the entire portfolio, its mechanical, its electronics, its semiconductors, the entire portfolio comes to play, including of course embedded software, because these devices are essentially supercomputers on wheels now. So we see a very strong opportunity across some of these verticals.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","For you, Ajei, let me ask you a technical follow-up, a product follow-up. One of the most interesting announcements the company made last year was around your SeaScape architecture, which was originally intended in support of your EDA products, but you've also committed to rewriting or porting your other physics products onto that new platform to deal with what are increasingly significant data infrastructure and data handling issues across simulation physics.","So the question is, are you in fact this year going to get those new non-EDA products onto the new platform as you had indicated you would do? And then lastly, the company has had a long time commitment to increasing its percentage of revenues invested in sales and marketing, R&D and also to grow your services business proportionately. Are all of those still your commitments?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So lot of questions. So let me start with the \u2013 let me start with your commentary about the big data architectures that we've talked about. As you rightly note, we started off with SeaHawk and SeaScape in the semiconductor space. We've had some good response from customers, and the idea there of course is with the increasing complexity of data and the analytics involved, you need a different way of thinking about your design and think \u2013 the different way of addressing the challenges that manufacturers and chip typically had. And so that's why the architecture helps, and as I said, we've seen some initial traction. It's of course early days yet.","We have ongoing development as we think about how this architecture would move to the other physics. We have ongoing development, but we will keep you posted and updates will follow on that space. It's obviously an area of tremendous amount of excitement for us.","The second with respect to sales and marketing and product. As you know, we are trying to be, and as I mentioned in our prepared comments, we went through \u2013 we're going through realignment this quarter. We've announced, so that we can free up resources and investment capacity to focus on those areas that we think are most important and that includes elements of sales and marketing, that includes some product areas, and that also includes some investments in infrastructure.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next questioner is Ken Talanian of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at your investor presentation for the fourth quarter, it looks like 2016 finished up with about a 8% organic growth. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for your expectations for organic growth over the next couple of years?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","So Ken, we'll just stick with 2017 for now, because we've got a lot of moving parts as you know, and we're also dealing with longer term the impact of the change in software recognition, software revenue recognition that we and many of our software brethren are working through right now.","If you take a look at 2017, right now, we are booking at, for the full year, 4% to 8% and that 6% is the midpoint, and we are looking for about 8% at the midpoint for Q1, given the I'll call it, health and momentum that we have coming off a strong Q4, as well as what we will admit is a relatively weaker comp. So that's kind of the outlook that we'll give you currently and we will continue to update on out years as we prepare for Investor Day in September where we'll be rolling out our strategy and some metrics that we believe will be in a position to share with all of you relative to the longer term aspects of the business model.","Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, great. And then also I was wondering, could you give us the sense of how your partnerships with PTC and GE on the IoT side have impacted your sales process if at all?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, the business model around areas like digital twin and so on are still, I would say, being developed by the industry. The opportunity is obviously enormous, because if you think about the digital twin space, which goes to the Internet of Things, the opportunity there is of course to be able to create a digital doppelganger, if you will, of every single product that's out there in the market place, and every instance of a product and get real-time analytics \u2013 do real-time analytics, not just statistical analytics, but to do real-time physics against those models to know what's happening for that particular instance of that particular product.","And so, that expands the use of simulation dramatically. And I think the industry is still trying to understand what and how this business model is going to look like as it evolves. But the good news for us of course is that, as you think about the Internet of Things, there is an element which collects information and brings it back in and then, of course, there is some statistical analysis that people do around machine learning. But I believe that one of the most important things there is the actual physics simulation, is to take that information and to figure out what's going on exactly.","And that means, if you have sensor information that's perhaps remote, using that remote sensor information to do a physics model and understand what's happening for example in the details or the insights of a particular component where you may have no sensors. And so I feel that we have, in simulation have an extremely strong position in this developing business model in this developing economy, but of course, that's still work in progress.","Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to start with the long-term backlog. I think this is the biggest jump I've seen in the long-term backlog and multi-year deals. Can you give us a sense or more detail around what drove it, maybe what the average duration of those contracts look like? And when they come back through revenue, are they going to come back through as paid up or lease?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. There were some longer-term contracts in there, but those are frankly mostly three-year contracts and most of them show up as lease revenue. And so, obviously, they come in and they convert to revenue over a multi-year period.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, can you give us a little bit more detail on the realignment. How many employees were actually let go, maybe some sense of the areas, and how you plan on rehiring and where they'll get layered in?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So Sterling, Q4 impacted approximately 20 employees. The total as you saw from our announcement is approximately 4% during the course of the entire realignment, which we are currently planning to the majority to take place in Q1, some to take perhaps a little bit longer into Q2. It touched all parts of the organization in all geographies, and we are looking to redeploy, as Ajei said, I'll say three key areas. One around some of the product opportunities as we see areas like additive manufacturing, digital twin, IoT, and even some of our core products. Sales and sales operations and infrastructure, all the areas that we believe that we need to invest in to be able to drive not only higher growth in long-term, but be able to really scale the business from $1 billion to $2 billion.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question...","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. On the go-to-market side to add to what Maria said, also investments on technical sales and also in channel and sales enablement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much for taking my questions, one for Ajei and one for Maria. So, Ajei, just obviously, you're making some tactical changes here, you've added Rick, you got the sales changes in Europe and now you're going through some sort of resource reallocations. I was just curious about, now you've been in the CEO role for a little while. What are the strategic things you're looking at. I'm just curious whether it's delivery models, whether it's pricing? I wondered if you could shed any early light on some of the strategic things you're thinking about?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. I've been in the CEO role since January 1 and until that time, I was spending a fair amount of time with the sales organization, of course, prior to Rick ramping up. I am obviously working with my leadership team. I've been spending a fair amount of time thinking through, of course, the long-term strategy for the business. I've been spending time with customers to understand where they are going. I've been talking to partners to understand what their thinking is. So for me there is a lot of data gathering and there is obviously some short-term decisions that we made, which are pretty obvious with respect to some of the tactical executions that you've talked about along the number of different dimensions.","Our expectation is to continue to work through the strategic direction for the company. We're not \u2013 I don't see any major strategic change in direction at this point of time, but we will be getting back to you on Investor Day, which I believe is on September 14 of this year, and we'll be in a position to have a more fulsome conversation about our long-term view of the business, about product strategies, about business strategies, business models, et cetera, and I think that will give us the opportunity to have a pretty detailed conversation at that time.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And one just \u2013 thank you. One follow-up for Maria. I think Sterling sort of asked this, but just to be precise, if I look at the long-term backlog, I wondered if we compared the long-term backlog at the end of 2016 versus end of 2015, do you have weighted average duration of that backlog? I was just curious to \u2013 whether it's consistent one year versus the next? Thanks.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Ross, I don't have that currently off the top of my head, but I would suggest that this year, given the number of enterprise agreements, it is probably slightly higher than it was a year ago, given that last year at this time, we had only closed a handful of those. So I would suggest the duration is slightly up from a year ago.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions here and Ajei, of course, welcome to your first full call as CEO.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I had a question just on longer-term product strategy and just kind of zeroing on one aspect of it. Historically, ANSYS has talked about simplifying the tools to appeal through your broader TAM and again, realizing it's early, again January 1, kind of taking the seed, how are you just thinking about broader democratization of simulation?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, I see, when I look at our \u2013 when I look at the market, I think that there is a \u2013 there are probably three legs is the way I'm thinking about it to the stool. One is the traditional use of simulation by engineers, by analysts and we see an enormous amount of opportunity there as we start to talk about things like ADAS. As we look at our semiconductor business and so on and so forth, there is enormous amounts of opportunity there and we've talked about some of that. We see as purely incremental to our current business, we see as opportunity of moving upstream to address a new audience which is essentially the designer market. We see that as incremental upside. We've invested in this space. We are now with ANSYS 18. We have the third generation of a product in the space called AIM and it takes time to mature a product, but I think at this point, we have a product that meets the needs for a simulation market that's upstream of our existing install base.","And then of course as you look downstream, I see the opportunity around digital twin that we've already articulated. So, absolutely, there's an opportunity and we have activities underway there. We see that as being incremental. We see the downstream opportunities around digital twin as being incremental and we see our core business as being with all of the changes that are taking place in the industry, we see our core businesses as being stronger than ever.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's great. Just for my follow-up, maybe for Maria. Maria, could you just talk about current bookings growth this quarter? And of course, we all saw and appreciate I think the healthy big deal activity. I think you said seven $10 million-plus type of deals. How would you normalize that current bookings growth, if at all, for what some might argue sort of lumpy business, because that was significantly higher than what you had last year. So how do you sort of think about current bookings, maybe on a normalized basis, if that makes sense?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So current bookings growth was around 12%, 13% in constant currency. Probably for full year 2016, bookings growth was 6%. I would anticipate for 2017 based on everything that we're modeling right now, it will be slightly higher than that.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Velkavrh of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you and thanks for taking my questions. First question I have, you signed eight ELAs in the period, which is very impressive, but more about the previous 10 customers that have been on ELA for a bit longer. I was wondering if you can give any color on how those customers are extending usage of ANSYS within their organizations?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. I can tell you that there actually were two of those customers who had previously signed deals, who either decided to extend the initial deal or have added incremental technology to their deployment. So it's still early in the game, but we are very excited about the opportunity that engaging with our customers at this level provides us relative to insight and also, I'll call it, knowledge relative to other customers that, as they work their way through tool consolidation and some of the challenges they have around their new growth initiatives relative to taking our story and our broad portfolio to help them through those transitions that they're going through.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","And to add to what Maria is saying, our strategy for enterprise agreements is not just simply a fire and forget, where we consummate a deal, complete a deal, and then move on. It's really building an ongoing relationship with the customer, and this obviously as Maria pointed to, with the couple of deals that we've talked about, this translates into a long-term relationship that they can, they feel like we're a partner, we're able to work with them. And I think that's very helpful. In some cases, we have people onsite, in some cases we have ongoing business reviews. So there are a number of different mechanisms that we use to make sure that we have that ongoing relationship both at the strategic level as well as at the operational level with the people who are using our technologies.","Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. And then my next question is about AEC or ANSYS Cloud product, I think the last update you gave there was a 50-customer pilot in place. I was just hoping you can give an update on, where you are with that product, where those customers are at their usage, and if more folks are using that product at this point?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. I mean we've had tremendous feedback on the product, and obviously we have customers who have been using it. It continues to be an area that I think is still developing, and we'll be in a position to share more strategy around our cloud and the cloud direction, when we get together in the September timeframe.","Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Ajei and Maria. Thanks for taking my questions.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","So congrats on the strong quarter. I wanted to circle back to the last question on cloud briefly. I realize you are not in a position to talk about your products yet, but maybe just some color here, remind us the 50-beta customers, are they on, is that your multi-tenant product or is that, or is the multi-tenant still under development? And just more generally, how do you think of where you stand in cloud right now versus your competition and what you need to do kind of strategically in cloud?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So, what we have right now is, this is not our multitenant product, that's still under development. And that's an area of frankly where I plan to spend a little bit more time with the development organizations to go through the cloud plans in some detail. As you know, I have a pretty strong background in that space and I think that the cloud is going to be very important for us in a number of different dimensions both from a licensing perspective as well as from a business model perspective, and I think that there is some usability and scalability challenges that we can address. So, I feel pretty good about the strategic direction, but again, as I said, this is an area where as we make this transition to multitenant, this is an area where we're doing more work and I'll be in a position to share more details with you guys when we talk about this at Investor Day in September.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Got it. Thank you. Quick one for Maria. Maria, what are you assuming in your 2017 guidance for ELAs? What are you targeting there? I think you did 18 in this last year, so what are you looking at going forward? And then how should we expect those to grow over time maybe more generally as well?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So I would say, it's early and we sat down with Rick and his team and reviewed the health of the pipeline. Currently, I would say a good target would be somewhere in the \u2013 similar to this year, 18 perhaps 20 at the high end range, and we believe that those will grow, at least on a bookings basis over time in double-digits just given the extreme opportunity to not only increase the number of users, but also to deploy increased applications of our technology across the broader base across those enterprise customers.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Very good. Well, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Karlsson of Bodenholm Capital. Please go ahead.","Erik Karlsson - Bodenholm Capital AB","Thanks for taking my question. ANSYS has historically created tremendous shareholder value through capital allocation, mostly via acquisitions, primarily building out the multiphysics offering. Ajei, I would love to hear your thoughts on capital allocation going forward, given that the balance sheet is quite strong, which is a great thing. How do you look at the opportunity to create further value via the balance sheet?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","I mean, obviously, we're going to look at all opportunities that are available to us and, I mean, your point about M&A, M&A is certainly one of the opportunities that's ahead of us. As you may know, I've had some experience in driving M&A and I've seen the transformative opportunity that can be created by doing the right M&A. But I want to be thoughtful and make sure that we do the right M&A. But obviously as you know, the wrong deal can have a very negative impact on an organization. So absolutely, M&A is something that we continue to look at and we will continue to look at. We see some opportunities and we will keep you posted as we think this through.","Erik Karlsson - Bodenholm Capital AB","If we look at the \u2013 because ANSYS generates very strong cash flow, as a follow-up then, if we look at the cash flow generated over the next year or two, do you think it's most likely that you can deploy it in M&A?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","That would be our number one preference. However, to Ajei's point as you highlighted earlier, we've been extremely successful in creating long-term shareholder value because we were selective relative to how the M&A targets that we added to our portfolio really aligned with the future needs and directions of our customers. So, we are continuing to solicit inputs from not only our field and our customers around which would be the appropriate assets that we continue to differentiate off. And in the short-term, in the absence of significant M&A, we will continue to redeploy capital back to the shareholders through our share repurchase activity. But, we are committed to continue to take a look at opportunities for M&A that we'll continue to distinguish our portfolio from other offerings.","Erik Karlsson - Bodenholm Capital AB","Very good. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Bersey of MUFG. Please go ahead.","Stephen Bersey - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Hey. As you step up your investments back into the business, whether it's on products or operations, I'm just wondering how we should think about the potential impact on operating margins and the balancing act that you mentioned that you'd like to walk. So just a philosophy on that.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So, Steve, one of our problems is not our operating profit margins, relative to trying to expand them. We've taken a step back as part of our annual planning process and with Ajei coming in and having perhaps some different perspectives from his experience at other enterprise providers, and we made a conscious decision this year when we went out with our early outlook in November to at least reduce the margin by a point to 46% and then to also take on the realignment in recognition that we needed to make some improvements in our own business to allow us to fund areas that we believe are higher growth opportunities or have unfortunately been perhaps impediments to our growth. So, as I said, we are looking to maintain our industry leading margins. For this year, we're guiding for the full-year to 46% and our ability to stay at 46% is going to be dependent on really the pace of hiring in the remaining quarters and some of the initiatives that we currently have underway that we've already redeployed some of those dollars too.","Stephen Bersey - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Great. And with the cloud subscriptions going on in the industry, there has been a few data points out there where vendors are having some flexibility to raise maintenance price as we've seen that, in particular Autodesk is saying that that's how they are going to press people on to the client. I'm just wondering how you guys are looking at your maintenance fees that you're charging and if you're seeing the opportunities for potentially boosting that up?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, I think, right now we have no significant or we have no increases that are assumed in our plan for this year as far as maintenance is concerned. So it's pretty much what we've been doing in the past is what we'll continue to do. So there is no change in the business model assumed in this year's guidance.","Stephen Bersey - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","So, do you look at them as reasonably fair or do you see some opportunity on the upside potential?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, we're around 20% maintenance. We think that's a \u2013 in the short-term, that's what we've been planning for this year. Obviously, as we start to think about different offerings and different capabilities that we are planning that might have an impact, but that's still in the future as we think about the nature of our portfolio going forward. And, again, I think we'll be in a position to share some more insight into strategically where we're going and that might have some more context here in the September timeframe.","Stephen Bersey - MUFG Securities America, Inc.","Thanks. That's helpful.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you, Andrea. So I believe that ANSYS has a huge opportunity ahead. With ANSYS 18, our next step in making pervasive engineering simulation a reality, we brought to market a feature rich release that continues a long track record of providing the best simulation solutions in the market. I'm excited by our performance in Q4, I'm excited by our momentum early in 2017 and I'm looking forward to seeing the impact of the operational changes that we've made and that we will continue to make.","And with that, I'd like to close by saying thank you to our customers, my ANSYS colleagues and our longstanding partners.

And then we ask participants please to direct their business related questions to Jim and myself.","So, Jim, I'll turn the call back to you.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Maria. So, after I provide a recap of the Q3 results that the team achieved, I'll turn the call over to Ajei for some introductory comments as this is his first call as part of the ANSYS team. After which, then, Maria will provide an update on the financial highlights and our outlook for the balance of this year and our preliminary outlook for 2017.","So, with that being said, let's see. For Q3, we reported consolidated non-GAAP revenue of $246 million with solid revenue growth in Germany, Japan, China and Taiwan counteracted by some pockets of weakness in North America and Europe.","Revenue growth for the quarter was impacted by an increase in our lease business which grew at 7% in constant currency. This is in line with our comments from recent calls. The shift in customer preference from paid-up to lease was most pronounced in the U.S. and Japan, where we both saw right around a 10% growth in constant currency in our lease business in the third quarter.","This shift to lease is in line with our comments from the recent calls we've made as I mentioned. And with this in mind, perpetual revenue was down due to this shift but it was also heavily influenced by consideration of, if you recall from our last third quarter call, we had a significant perpetual deal in North America, it was actually over $7 million. And it didn't repeat itself this year, obviously, and we actually alerted to that. But excluding that single transaction, the perpetual business for the quarter was relatively flat when compared to last year's third quarter.","From an industry perspective, aerospace, defense, automotive, healthcare and biomed performed well while energy and the materials and chemical processing sectors continued to lag. Importantly, our recurring revenue base continued to be very strong at 76% of total revenue for the quarter and year-to-date.","In addition with the deepening of relationships with our major accounts and the growth of our lease business, we continue to see a strong balance of deferred revenue and backlog resulting in a Q3 record high of $485 million. And that's 11% higher than Q3 of last year. Again, this growth in deferred is a positive result of the shift to lease that we've been seeing.","Now, in the third quarter, we had 20 customers with orders over $1 million including one customer with cumulative orders of over $10 million for the quarter and these 20 customers compare to 18 customers over $1 million in Q3 of last year. And that's what's happening at the high end, but we also at the SMB perspective saw an 8% increase quarter-to-quarter in the number of new logos that were added in. Now, part of this improvement is from some new channel partners, particularly in Asia that we've added, as well as some good early results from our newly introduced start-up program.","Non-GAAP gross and operating margins for the third quarter were a little bit over 89% and 49% respectively which were above our expected range, and that was driven by a combination of our own third quarter spending seasonality, but also, our continued efforts around cost discipline.","Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.95 or a 6% improvement over the $0.90 that were achieved in the prior year period and was actually $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was approximately $82 million. Basically, and also, I'd say continuing our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we repurchased 1.2 million shares during the quarter and that makes it 2.7 million shares year-to-date.","Now, also, those are the numbers, but during the quarter, we had some other notable accomplishments, which I'd like to highlight. First was the August release of ANSYS 17.2 and it basically just continues to offer this steady stream, a wealth of new functionality, including enhanced multiphysics coupling, new workflows, particularly for things like antenna design and things related to the Internet of Things.","The latest version of the ANSYS portfolio also enables engineers to combine advanced simulation technology across physics to address complex engineering challenges inherent in today's smart and connected products. And on top of this, of course, we continue that common theme of continued ease of use to bring this to a much broader audience.","So, if you visit our website, you can get a lot more details on this release and other updates, but when you do hit this website, one thing you might note is the increasing opportunity for ANSYS in systems. And as we continue expanding our leading simulation software platform, it's important to include capabilities that manage and streamline complex system engineering processes.","And in light of this, you might have also noticed that we announced this morning the acquisition of medini Technologies. Now, this is a Berlin-based leading provider of system safety analysis solutions. So, medini brings a world class engineering team of course as well as solutions for system safety analysis, reliability engineering and quality management. Now, its flagship solution, medini analyze implements core functionality, safety analysis activities and they integrate them within their customer's existing work flows.","This is especially important in the automotive industry where medini really has been widely deployed, it's gotten its start. So, I mean, just imagine the systems and security issues surrounding all these new trends toward autonomously driven vehicles and drones, just for example, and you'll get an idea of what this has in the design of overall comprehensive products.","With our strength in electronics and aerospace, we're also very well to expand the usage into those industries as well to help customers in those other global industries innovate their products probably in ways that they really had never envisioned.","So, as you're also aware, we're going through a managed CEO transition and its part of a comprehensive multilevel initiative to help ANSYS realize opportunities over the next 20 years. So, I've come to know and admire Ajei as a fellow director and I have no doubt that his outstanding leadership and his unique perspectives and appreciation for the ANSYS culture, people, and organizations make him the right choice to serve as our next leader during this next phase.","So, as I move to the chairman role, it's been a pretty darn smooth transition process. So, in keeping with that, I'd like to now welcome Ajei to the call and have him maybe provide some commentary around his first couple of months here as part of the ANSYS team and some of the operational priorities that he, his team and all of us will be working on. So, Ajei?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'm actually delighted to be here. I've been President and Chief Operating Officer here at ANSYS for about two years. I had a running start after over five years of tenure on the board of directors of ANSYS, and I've continued to learn more and more as I interact with employees, with customers and with partners. I am more excited than ever to be with the company.","Jim's vision and his tremendous leadership have set a high bar, indeed, and I am committed to building on this base of excellence. With new opportunities in big data, in the Internet of Things, in additive manufacturing and in the cloud, to name a few, ANSYS will push the boundaries of innovation to help customers solve their most complex design challenges and also to broaden the use of simulation. I look forward to meeting with you in the next weeks and months to come as we at ANSYS continue to define the future of simulation.","Now, from an operational perspective, let me update you on a few key initiatives underway. We are continuing our search for a new global head of sales. We are working with a leading search firm and interviews are under way. We have spoken to a number of highly qualified and seasoned candidates who have strong global sales experience, operational rigor and enterprise account skills.","All of these attributes are very important as we continue to drive the productivity of our global sales force and build the operational foundation to grow and scale the business. We will provide an update as soon as the search process is completed.","We are also in the midst of our annual planning process and working through all of the detailed plans relative to products, go-to-market strategies, pricing, hiring and other critical investment areas for 2017. We will share more of those details on the February call when the plan is finalized.","Finally, we went live on the first phase of our planned migration of our legacy CRM platform to a more modern sales force automation platform. This is another important step in a multi-phase project to update our business infrastructure and processes. This will give us better visibility into our sales pipeline, it will improve our sales forecasting, and it will support the future growth of our business. And I want to thank the ANSYS team involved in driving this important initiative.","I look forward to updating you on our final year-end results and providing further details on our hiring, and our business progress and on our 2017 growth initiatives on the next call at the end of February. I will now turn the call over to Maria to discuss our fourth quarter 2016 and our preliminary 2017 outlook. Maria?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Ajei. As we outlined in this morning's press release, we've initiated our outlook for Q4 starting with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $263 million to $272 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.94 to $0.99. With respect to our previous guidance for fiscal year 2016, we've narrowed the revenue range and factored in the Q3 results. This translates to our updated outlook of non-GAAP revenue in the range of $981 million to $990 million and non-GAAP EPS of $3.59 to $3.64.","Our guidance for Q4 reflects a number of assumptions based upon our current view of the business. These include a continuation of the existing overall macro environment in which we and some of our key customers will continue to experience growth or the business challenges in certain geographies. These situations may lead to delays in closing larger transactions or for long sale cycles.","An increasing mix shift towards leases, particularly in our most mature markets in the U.S. and Japan. This trend is accentuated by the closing of additional enterprise agreements which, while expanding our relationships with key customers, are having the effect of shifting near-term revenues out over the term of the agreement. And continued weakness in certain parts of Europe particularly in the UK, Russia, and France, as well as in South Korea, and in the state-owned enterprise sector in China. The latter due to naturally occurring buying cycles in the Chinese government's five-year plan.","Taking all of this and our current planning efforts into consideration, our preliminary guidance for fiscal year 2017 is non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.06 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of $3.67 to $3.89.","As Ajei mentioned earlier, we are still in the process of working through all the details of our 2017 operating plan, but for now, we are assuming no significant changes either way in the overall macro climate as we exit 2016 and head into early 2017. This is our preliminary high level view and we will be in a position to share more of the details with you in February as we finish up 2016 and the 2017 plan is actually finalized.","But at a very high level, our guidance assumes a slight reduction in operating margins for 2017 due to planned increased investments in R&D initiatives in the areas of cloud, big data and systems. Investments in sales and channel enablement and some necessary company infrastructure.","We are also assuming a slightly higher tax rate in the range of 33% to 34%. That's a result of ongoing benefits associated with some entity structuring activities that we accomplished in 2016 that are expected to be lower in 2017. And lastly, our 2017 preliminary outlook does factor in the impact of the medini acquisition that we announced this morning.","Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored in to our Q4 2016 and fiscal year 2017 guidance are contained in the prepared remarks that we posted on our Investor Relations front page earlier this morning.","So, with that, operator, we'll now open up the lines to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We please ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one brief follow-up question. Also, please direct questions to Jim and Maria. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes today from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. So, during this transit...","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Hello, Sterling.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hello. So, during this transition with the head of sales, is there any other either sales management or sales rep turnover that could also be contributing to some of the weakness that you saw in bookings and business?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, no. Sterling, we're \u2013 it's pretty stable beyond that level. So, nothing beyond that kind of like the normal movements in the sales organization. Now, that being said, we are going to be looking as both Maria and Ajei mentioned. We've already started to see some positive upticks from the ELA and the major account initiatives, those large orders that we alluded to earlier.","We've also talked about at the lower level. Now that requires \u2013 we've been encouraged by those results that requires some, a slightly different investment that Maria signaled on there. But we want to be prepared for that because it is starting to pick up at the low end, too. And quite frankly, the enterprise sales motion versus the transactional one is a little bit different. And of course, that being said, as we continue to evolve that, as we have for the last decade, we'll continue to assess all levels and activities of the sales team and continue on.","If you look at it, there's a couple of other things where I'd say is that we're going to continue, as we've seen, we've seen some positive movement in the channel activity, and we're going to continue to further that not only strengthening our existing channels but adding additional channels, particularly in those developing areas in there. And then, quite frankly, there's a number of other different initiatives. So, I guess maybe in those \u2013 even apart from the channel in Asia, there are some other opportunities that have been looking pretty favorable for us there. So, it's going to be a continual building in terms of preparing to harvest that opportunity.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then the one follow-up would be given that you're going through the management transition of CEO, head of sales, you already have a significant part of the business that's lease. You have the new start-up program where you're trying to make it less expensive for start-ups to get into the simulation area. Any further consideration or thoughts around taking the business much more to a subscription and less off the perpetual, especially following what we've seen with Adobe, Autodesk and now PTC?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, I think we're going to stay on \u2013 well, again, that's something that you continue to evaluate because we still see a lot of people that are still interested in the capital thing. Right now, we're really worried more about the adoption and not creating barriers to adoption.","That being said, I mean, some other companies that have really tried to push that model, they've actually seen declines in revenue and the like. And we're not trying to force that one way or the other, but as the market trends pick up, we're definitely seeing that. That had a short term, and you could see the short-term impact that it had on some of the growth rate, but with our higher-lease renewal rates and the growth in the deferred balance, you can also see that we're building up a pretty good base, which over the long term actually adds to the growth potential for us as we have \u2013 as business renews versus having to be replaced before growth even starts.","So, I mean, we're still \u2013 and with that being said, on the perpetual side, our test business has continued. It actually was strong before. It's actually even a little bit stronger than it's been before on that. So, essentially, in our parlance, if you think back to our business model that we put forth about 15, 20 years ago, it was really subscription before subscription was even called that, and that meant a high lease and these enhancement subscriptions to our test. And we've been continuing to see that and that's one reason why we are already pushing up into the upper 70% of recurring base.","So, in that respect, we've always had a very strong subscription element. Right now, we want to have the multiple avenues that allow people to adopt because once they adopt our software, it's incredibly sticky and it stays and it normally is growth. Almost every ELA that we've been involved with is part of an ongoing growth with our existing customers. And so, really getting that penetration and getting our footprint in there is one thing we want to do.","But that being said, we're very cognizant. We've always been very open. Lease has been a big part. Subscription has been a big part of our model for decades and it will continue to be so. And as the market tends to shift that way, it will move that way. And as cloud starts to become more prevalent in our particular sector, which it's not strongly the way other sectors are, when that happens, we'll be well positioned for that because we already have the software and the investment for that.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I noticed in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that Caterpillar and GE have consolidated simulation on the ANSYS platform. Along with that, I was curious. Is that fully reflected in the financial impact on your numbers? Yeah. I'll start with that.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, I mean, those are examples, but keep in mind those are ones that as companies start to adopt that, they build that, and then from that point forward, it becomes part of the run rate base that we're talking about. So, you'll see it reflected in deferred revenues, you'll probably \u2013 actually, in some of those you'll see it also referred in the backlog for those further-out areas.","And basically, those have \u2013 to my earlier point about ELAs and getting that footprint on these early adoption phases, you picked two customers that have been with us literally for decades. And those were with older generations of the technology, but as we've gotten into this new era, those are a couple of examples of ones and some we can't mention by name. But that's just part of what they're growing up.","And what you're seeing there is not only growth in their continual usage of the traditional software, but you're also seeing an enlargement in the portfolio. So, using this broader platform because there is a strong advantage to being able to get multiple tools all working together in concert, particularly as you're trying to get complete systems to be operating.","Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Now, along those lines, how should we think about your M&A strategy? Are there particular physics where you feel acquisitions would accelerate your competitive position?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, I'll tell you right now, and this is going to sound like the same thing I've been saying for years, and the fact is M&A is one varied part of our \u2013 it's accounted for 25% \u2013 a third of our growth over the last 15, 20 years. And it is a great way to add additional strong members to our team and also proven solutions in there.","So, if you think of it, every one \u2013 we have leadership in every one of our individual fields of physics, but each one of them is only a shadow of what it's going to need to be in the next 10 to 15 years, which means we're going to continue to invest on the R&D line internally. We're going to look at ways of augmenting that with external acquisitions.","So, every one of our physics can be \u2013 is going to be strengthened, whether it's internally or externally and we'll look at the best mix of those things to go on. That being said now, you look at the other initiatives, it's apart from just physics. The proof that we are getting from both our cloud offerings, our platform offerings and overall systems orientation, are areas where we're going to also play.","So, every time you hear a buzz word term out there that sometimes almost gets overused, Internet of Things, additive manufacturing, 3D printing, big data, all those things. I mean, sometimes we overuse those throughout our industry, but the fact is there are major customer interest, initiatives and value movements that we can take place on that.","So, we're going to continue to move that way and we're also going to be looking for best partners and we've been doing it continually. We always are looking at 20 or 30 companies on a continual basis either for partnerships on a technology standpoint, acquisition, marketing relationships, anything that basically helps get this value to the customer. And I don't see that changing anytime in the near future.","Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. Jim, I wonder if you could ask Ajei what his early feedback has been from customers. I'm actually just kidding. In terms of the...","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, he just gave two thumbs up. He just gave two thumbs up, so you get a free question from there, but okay.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Well, okay. Good. It's going well. So, I was just going to ask about ELAs. How many have you done to-date? And when you started the year, you were hoping to maybe get to 15. Can we get an update on what that might look like?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, to be overly precise, we weren't hoping to get to maybe 15. We were hoping to get to 15. So, if you look at it right now, the scorecard is we actually had eight through the first half. You don't expect many in Q3. It's kind of a sleepy quarter. But we actually had one in Q3, and I'd say we had one that just squeaked out of Q3. And in fact, it's one of the biggest ones that we had. It actually closed in the first week of October.","So, you look at that scorecard right now and we're sitting at 10 where Q4 was always considered the big quarter because, A, these are big things. They have major budget impacts, and they have long selling cycles even to established customers. So, in general, and quite frankly, the pipeline looks really good.","Now, again, the pipeline looks really \u2013 the pipeline is much bigger than five. However, when you have anything this big and this kind of budgetary impact, they may slide a month or two, some of them. So, the pipeline still supports that. And we've got an increasing interest driving there. So, I'll take a breath now, but that's \u2013 ELAs, again, at the high end, going very well. As we mentioned, we're just starting to get some traction that we want to propel in the small to medium business. But ELAs, moving right on target, maybe even a little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And as we look out into next year, I'm not looking for exact numbers, but would that be something you would expect to maybe grow from the numbers you're doing this year and what does your guidance assume?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, we haven't gotten to the guidance on that because quite frankly we're closing out Q4 and we're doing an awful lot of planning. So, even when we give a preliminary look into 2017, we're not giving guidance on 2017, we're giving a preliminary look as we always have.","But in general, if you see the pipeline as going up, we also have a pipeline of these for 2017, and the pipeline for those look very encouraging. However, they're at very early stages in the selling cycle, and quite frankly, you have to get through a point where you also know that the customer has not only bought into it conceptually, but they're starting to build it into their budgets and the like, and that kind of information is very premature for us. But pipeline, in terms of sales interest and things of that nature, it's staying on a positive track for us.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Monika Garg of Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks for taking my question. Given you're seeing shift towards the hard leases, going forward, do you think your lease revenue grows maybe double digit and perpetual, is more like flat to maybe down?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","I don't think we're at that level of precision right now, but for instance, we know that first of all, seeing the leases going up. The lease bookings were like in high-single digits both for the last couple of quarters, and also, in the current period. So, I mean we've seen some positive things there. And keep in mind for \u2013 mathematically, for the lease business to grow at that level, given the fact that it's layering on top of accumulated leases of the previous couple decades, it takes a lot of new lease business to move that cumulative base up. So, that's why we've been seeing that.","The other thing is when something moves to lease, keep in mind that over a 12-month period that maybe a lease, just rough numbers, is maybe half of the billing of a perpetual, and given the fact that in the current quarter, you only get to recognize like about one-twelfth of that, I mean, so one shift of a perpetual to a lease has a huge impact on the short-term revenue. However, you also see that now that goes into deferred balance and you've seen the double-digit growth in the deferred balance for Q3. So, it takes a little bit of time for a lease shift to move forward into that.","And likewise, we're not trying to expand sales cycles by telling people that if they have capital ready to spend that they have to now force it into a period sale, that's one reason why we've tried to let this take its own course which is why we maybe have less disruption than some of the other people trying more significant binary shifts.","But we see those things moving up. Now, at that point, keep in mind, once something goes into lease with a high renewal rate, you have the basis of \u2013 if we sold a perpetual this year before we could show growth in perpetual next year, we had to replace what we sold last year and then sell new stuff on top of it. As we move into next year, there's a really high probability that that lease continues to renew, so we're already at ground level there and everything is additive.","So, from that standpoint, it allows us to build that up. However, the lease space will take a little bit longer to build up to double digit in keeping with the opportunity, and we still believe that the opportunity is there, but it will take more time to build up because it's layering on top of a huge accumulated base to begin with. I know I threw a lot of stuff at you but it's all related to that. Did that cover it?","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Yes. As a follow-up, generally you have made small tuck-in acquisitions. Would you be interested to enter maybe semi-design verticals? You have product simulation through Apache acquisition (31:45) but would you be interested to enter much wider semi-design media tools market.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","We're interested in all aspects of simulation and anything that allows products to \u2013 keep in mind, if you actually divert from any particular target and say, we want to be able to create a complete virtual prototype of a complete system in the computer and put it through its entire duty cycle.","You get a feeling of why years ago nobody thought embedded software was important. Well, embedded software is a component in a complete operating system. That's why it makes complete sense. And you see how the work that we did in that actually helped drive our early successes in Internet of Things and the system simulation things.","So, that being said, we will be looking at all aspects because every portion of our portfolio, even if it's leading now has to get a lot stronger over the next 10 years. That being said, you started your question by saying the number of \u2013 that we're focusing on tech tuck-ins. That just happens to be how it played out over the last couple of years. But if you look at our history, every few years we had some very \u2013 we had like every couple of years we might have a significant add-on.","And then what we did was we focused on doing a very good job of integrating and really extracting the shareholder value. And just because they don't fall out of the trees on an annual or quarterly basis, we're still always continuing to examine those and we will continue to examine those. So, I would not be \u2013 I would not at all be shocked to see some larger transactions. I would not at all be shocked to see a continuation of tech tuck-ins. But it's all part of building toward that strategy. This has always been an exercise in building out our product vision. It's not been an exercise in financial reconstruction.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. Thank you.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","To be very unambiguous.","Operator","The next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Let me start, Jim, with a near-term question and then follow up with a longer-term question related to business model and technology. For the nearer term, your bookings in the third quarter were down sequentially from Q2 by a more-than-usual amount when you look at prior years, second to third quarter trends in bookings. Was that, however, more or less what you had anticipated absolute bookings would be? And looking out at least into the fourth quarter, could you talk about how you're thinking about your pipeline specifically for industrial, electronics and auto? And then the follow-up question. Thanks.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Okay. Boy. So, I'm trying to parse down. First of all, I mean, we might be debating small points here, but I wouldn't say, first of all, that it was down more than historical. But secondarily, I would say it was right in line of what we were thinking given the fact of if you take into account things that might have been forecasted as perpetual that came in as lease and probably affected 1% to 1.5% of the growth rate.","But if you look at our view of current bookings, and keep in mind we are still committed to coming up with a meaningful annualized contract value, some of those other metrics we've talked about. If you look at it, we were in the high-single digits for current bookings and that's taking into account the reduction in long-term deferred and backlog, and also trying to launder out, if you will, the timing of ELAs. They're just not as predictable since they're relatively new. And by the way, the high-single digits, that was a constant currency number.","Also, from the best numbers we have, the lease bookings were also in that high-single digits. So, around the 8% or so. And that's been for about the last two quarters and taking on this concept of the annualized contact value. So, essentially \u2013 yeah, but again, these overall bookings in the lease, they've been counteracted partially by some of the paid-up shifts and that's actually been true for about four quarters now. And I think that we've been talking about it for at least that long anecdotally.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. And Jay, to your one question relative to the Q4 pipeline around those industries, if you take a look particularly across the larger deals, heavily influenced by aerospace and defense, electronics and industrials where many of our longstanding customers have big Q4 renewal activities around their annual budgeting cycle.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. And Jay...","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","...you have to repeat part of that because the last part of the question you asked, I think Maria started to address that, but you were asking something about on the industry sectors.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Well, no Maria touched on that.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. I didn't know if that covered it.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","No, no. That's it. So, the longer-term question is as follows. And I appreciate that you're still working through the specific planning details for pricing, products and so forth. But pursuant to what you were saying at the Analyst Meeting in June, is it still your general intent to broaden the portfolio across a wider range of functionality and price, particularly to engage a larger number of users more so than in your core markets. And so, that's really the longer term strategic question as to what you're meaning to do tying your technology roadmap to the business model.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. The bottom line is if you look at it, probably, if I had to categorize it, we'd probably in the past, we probably had too many SKUs and too narrow a band, we'll probably have a broader band with a fewer number of SKUs going forward. But it's really meant to have a broader coverage both across industries and into things that comprehend what happens when you get into much broader user segments even within existing companies.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks very much.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for...","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Hi, Anil.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","...taking the question. Hey. Hey. So, big picture question. Maria and Jim, you guys had provided preliminary kind of markers for 2017. And when I look at that, I look at some of the issues that are playing around in the company story into three buckets. You've got the ELA dynamics going on. That has impact on revenue, obviously, bookings and all that stuff. You've got the macro uncertainty playing around, and obviously, you've got the change in sales.","So, what I'm trying to understand is the preliminary outlook, Maria said that \u2013 it sounds like you guys are still working through it. But I just want to understand the degree of conservativeness, the way you're looking at 2017. Is that different from how you looked at the guidance or the outlook from your previous years give that there's perhaps a little bit more uncertainty in the model. So, can you help us appreciate that aspect?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, sure. I'd say there probably is more conservatism in there. But you think of the moving parts. A, we've been in the process of a managed sane transition but we want to make sure that that hand off continues to operate well. We are moving up the maturity curve of the sales force enablement. But as we've mentioned, it happened a little bit slower than we were planning. We're not just plugging in an arbitrary number in a spreadsheet to hit a number. But we are expecting to see sales force productivity increases but we're going to take some time on that.","Also, embedded in the numbers are we actually have a little bit stronger \u2013 we're assuming, again, even though we're not forcing the market, we're assuming a continued shift toward lease. Like we've mentioned in the last few calls. We're not saying it's all going 100% there. At some point if you get there, it may want to rebound back and come \u2013 the market can be funny that way. But we want to be able to serve market in any number of ways that the market wants to be served given that they've chosen our software.","But when you continue to have this perpetual to lease preference shift as you start to move into a cloud model, we've already demonstrated that it can mean a couple of percent of short-term growth rates but it can also provide some very nice expansion of the long-term deferred and backlog models moving into the double-digit growth there which long term is a very good indicating sign.","So, those are shifts that we see going on. And given the fact that all of those can be \u2013 all of those would be positive vectors for us, but they're going to happen in different mixes, we want to have a very strong operating model that we could continue to stick to and something that didn't, let's say, it didn't ransom the long term for any kind of a short term fix.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then as a follow-up, clearly lot of transitions going on in the sales force. The average sales guy typically works for his own incentives. And given the change in management, what is the message and what kind of incentives are you giving to these individuals to make sure that it's business as usual, double down on your efforts rather than some of these guys trying to figure out how their new compensation is going to be structured. Until they don't (41:43) figure that out, they're just not going to kind of put in the efforts?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, by the way, we've already got some things in play right now and by the way that's been done with the existing in place sales management, so there's not going to be a whole lot of surprise there. There has been a number of other structural things though that we've done in terms of consolidating some of the sales ops so there's less chaff and chaos in some of the communication things. Not that it was there before but I'm just saying it's a much more coherent distribution capability along those lines.","But also you can see that one thing that we've done is that there's different types of sales psyches that are better going after different kind of models. And if you recall, like, two or three years ago, we have a person in a territory and they tried to serve all markets. Well, it's tough going after a lot of the small transactional start-up SMB business at a relatively low rate one day and then turning on and being this maestro selling at the $1 million dollar plus level. So, we've been able to focus a little bit more in that as all of us mentioned in some of our introductory comments this morning.","We've seen some strong interest in the small, medium business. I mean, the growth in new logos. We've always kind of had a healthy add but I was kind of surprised at the uptick in that. Very encouraged by the program and the start-up program. But those are smaller kind of market \u2013 a different kind of go-to-market movements in there. And so, we're going to continue to move along those lines.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, guys.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Shateel Alam with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Shateel Alam - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you talked about increasing R&D investment, and you specifically mentioned cloud. Can you just talk about what exactly you're investing in, in terms of products and capabilities, and whether or not your margin guidance implies that you move beyond the 50 or so pilot customers you have today?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Oh, well, yeah. I mean, yeah. First of all, the easy one is, yeah, we're planning on moving way past the 50 pilots. If you think about it though, if the cloud has the means to be a fully democratized kind of open environment, it has to move quite a bit beyond \u2013 if you look at \u2013 we've got the enterprise cloud model and it's kind of provisioned. It was almost a hardware displacement kind of model where somebody could implement it inside their Intranet or they could provision it. But it was basically getting access to additional computing cycles but still acquired in the same ways. As you start to move toward multi-tenant and some of the other kind of situations that allow it more to be more on tap, those are the areas that we really want to accelerate along that line.","Now, also included in that are if you're going to move into that market, it's not the traditional heavy upfront investment that the customer is buying into. So, we've invested in learning management systems that allow people to very quickly at distance at their own pace start to learn the software. We've been talking about the ongoing push of ease of use. That's not like a one-and-done kind of a release. I mean, think about how long ease of use had to move in the PC market from 1980 up until even now, like over 30 years. So, there'll continued progressions there, but we want to do investments along those lines. So, all those would relate to cloud type of activities.","Shateel Alam - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. And, Maria, just one for you. On the last call you said you expected free cash flow growth in 2017. Do you still expect that considering the level of investment you're taking on and some of the lower margin guidance you've put out there?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. And so at a very high level, as we have articulated throughout the call, we're still working through the details. But for now, $370 million to $390 million of free cash flow.","Shateel Alam - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi, ANSYS. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe one really for anyone here, and then a follow-up for Ajei. So, granted the shift to leases makes it a little hard to gauge your performance in the quarter, and more generally in trying to get clarity on your real trend growth, but maybe to parse it out a little bit. How should we think about your bookings growth trend maybe as reported, and if you were to adjust for the mix shift, which I think, Jim, you suggested that's a one- or two-point hit?","So, in relating that to the quarter, just to put a finer point on it, is 3%, is that below trend is that about right? Meaning, maybe a 5% point adjusted sort of growth. I mean, how should we think about this trend?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","First of all, 3% is year-to-date, but keep in mind that thing I tried to say before in terms of the current bookings, again, view those as the upper-single digits around that 8% in constant currency. So, I mean, that's really what's going on.","Now, as to the numbers, I mean, without telling everybody how to do the model, I mean, you can almost back out, if you took out the growth in the lease space from historical purposes and then took that amount of money and then translate it towards the impact of what that might have translated to in terms of perpetual, you can almost reverse engineer what it would have looked like if everything had stayed totally unchanged.","But with that being said, I'd still say that you, Steve, the bookings as we mentioned the \u2013 even as I mentioned, the lease bookings have actually been up in the upper-single digits over the last couple of quarters, and we're continuing to see those trends moving on also. So, I'd say that we probably see that as being \u2013 for right now, the closest thing to the new normal.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","So, just to clarify, Jim, and I do want to get to the follow-up for Ajei. But it's a pretty big gap between 3% and 8%. So, what's the 5% difference? Is that all the mix shift? That seems rather large.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, I mean, the main thing on that is when you're looking at that aggregate rate, you're including perpetual. And like I say, $100,000 perpetual that shifted to a lease, is probably going to see about one-tenth or less of what that is.","Secondarily on the bookings growth again, don't forget take out immediately that $7 million plus from that one big customer. Now, we guided and that was never in our guidance, but you take that out and that was always considered a one-time \u2013 not a one-time, but a not going to be repeated next year, all the hyphens -","a balloon kind of revenue thing, so that one \u2013 and we said that last Q3 at the time that we are talking about that order and we remind people last quarter. So, I think you take that element out and then you consider what the effective part is on the lease space, on the lease conversion. And it pretty much explains itself out.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Got it. So, the quarter was basically in line with where you all expected, it sounds like?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. And so, I'll move to the question for Ajei.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, he's...","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","So, maybe...","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Actually, he's not in the room right now. We may have to save that for later. But we also wanted to get him introduced to these calls.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","But no chance to introduce that. But if you've got a question, I'd be happy to try to tackle it as best as I can with Maria's help.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Sure. Sure. I mean, I'll put it out there. I was basically interested in getting his perspective on biggest challenges and opportunities facing ANSYS going forward as he takes over. I'm sure you all have talked if you want to opine on that.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Oh, yeah. Well, I think, what we do is we can set up some time over the next few weeks or so, we're going to start to build that up. And I'd rather not put words in his mouth even though, yeah, we have spent a lot of time discussing it.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","In fact, it was a lot of \u2013 it was a point of discussion during the recruiting process.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Right. Sounds good, Jim. Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I appreciate it.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Okay. Yes. No problem.","Operator","The next question is with Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. Hi, Jim. You said 8% on current bookings for the quarter. If you have that number for year-to-date. And then, Maria, do you have the run rate revenue of the medini acquisition?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","I'm sorry. First of all, we don't have \u2013 I don't have the number handy for the year-to-date. But it's obviously been trending in that same direction and as I mentioned before, it's been one that's been going pretty heavily. It's heavily influenced by various timings of ELAs, some of the lengths of the time based licenses and the amount of shifts in there. But that's part of the complexity of the calculations that we're working through.","So, Maria, on that...","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. For medini, we're assuming roughly about $2.5 million in run rate for next year.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. And then may be just quick follow-up, Maria. We have an impending FASB proposal, 606, which has some potential implications for revenue recognition especially for software companies. And I was just curious, have you done your preliminary work there, is there anything to talk about yet there? Thanks.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","So we are continuing as many of our software brethren are to deal with our independent accountants and also a third-party firm that are specialists in revenue recognition and working our way through that. What it is preliminary looking like, albeit the FASB is not finalized, all of the details and the rules, is the legacy on-premise software providers such as us, particularly for leases, there will be a portion that will be recognized upfront as it relates to license key deliverables. And then there will be an element of ratable recognition relative to the ongoing services provided. Not unlike what ANSYS was doing back in the year 2000 when we had to bifurcate the initial delivery of software from the ongoing other elements that we delivered.","So, that's that preliminary view. We are working through all of that. And when we have, I'll call it, finality around the rules, we will certainly update everybody at that time, Ross.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Just maybe one quick question on that, if I could. Just when you think about that key delivery versus the recurring piece would that, if we just think about relative to an existing lease would that put some of the revenue a little bit more up-front and then a smaller recurring piece? Is that the way to think about it?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","It was.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","That's the way think about it.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erik Karlsson with Bodenholm. Please go ahead.","Erik Karlsson - Bodenholm Capital AB","Yeah. Thanks a lot for taking my question. On ELAs, I was speaking to existing ELA users. The general comment seems to be that the key reason to sign an ELA is to reduce the internal barriers and increase the usage of simulation. And indeed, most of the ELA users, I talked to at least, say they have achieved that, if not, overachieved it. Could you just help us with your view on that?","If you look at the first bunch you signed, so the first four, five, six ones, what level of uplift are you seeing in usage among those customers? And I appreciate that won't translate into revenue 100%, but directional, it should be the same way. Thank you.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, over time, it will translate into that. And in some cases, we've \u2013 I mean, well, it's always been at least in the lower double digits, and we've seen some where at least the usage patterns and things have gotten up into a 20%, 30% mark. And you asked about our view of it, and our view and why we conceived this program a while back was for exactly that part. When somebody had decided that this is the path they want to standardize on, what we want to do is help them start to extract the value immediately as opposed to going into a multi-month transactional analysis of exactly how much hardware, exactly which modules and what they should be getting. So, it actually allows things for a much quicker start. And it was a much more strategic sale as opposed to just a typical kind of tactical product acquisition kind of announcements.","Erik Karlsson - Bodenholm Capital AB","As a follow-up, perhaps of the existing ELA users, how many of them are in the \u2013 so big usage that you actually get to true ups right now?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, keep in mind that it usually takes about a year or so for going through. So, it's normally in the second year that you start to look at that particular thing. But we have already, I mean, let's just say we have already received those kind of adjustments from the people who have been in the program for a couple of years. Now, that being said, we're coming out of a Q3 and there aren't many things that were cycled around the Q3 evaluation period. Typically, it tends to be end of year, beginning of the year type of thing, Q4, Q1.","Erik Karlsson - Bodenholm Capital AB","Okay. Thank you very much.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Gal Munda with Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Gal Munda - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Hi. I have three questions. The first one is just in terms of competitive dynamics. A lot of things are happening this year especially Siemens becoming more aggressive in the market acquiring the CFD provider. Also, Dassault recently kind of entering the electromagnetic space and they're saying that that's a big area of focus for them for the future. So, my first question is do you see any other change in competitive dynamic when you're speaking to your customers and has it affected you?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, not \u2013 actually, the quick answer is no. I mean, obviously, those products were out there before. On one hand, they get \u2013 they maybe get a little less focus. On the other hand, they're owned by some larger entity. But it really hasn't translated into any particular kind of competitive dynamic shift from our standpoint. I think the thing to keep in mind, though, is that anybody can add one or two additional incremental capabilities, but still it doesn't get to that end goal of having a complete platform that covers the totality of things that are required in a virtual prototype of a complete product.","So, that type of thing \u2013 and keep in mind, once that's even done, there's \u2013 there's not an inconsequential amount of work. And it's true for them, it's true for us, it's true for anybody in terms of how you actually now integrate those products and actually make them actually flow together such that they can solve the combined problem, not just be a set of disassociated pieces.","Gal Munda - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. That makes sense. The other question is just on AIM. It's not a new product anymore. Can you just comment a bit on the demand versus expectations for the first few years and what the volume has been versus what you expected? Who is the typical user? Does it mainly come from existing company that potentially want to implement simulation \u2013 further democratize simulation further in the company to include more engineers and also what are kind of expectations for the ramp-up for the next few years?","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, again, AIM was always intended to be that starting push into the usability. But what we've been able to do, and things that we are excited about is \u2013 and again I don't want to pre-announce a lot of things, but the bottom line is that some of the things that we learned from the introduction of AIM has turned out to be very strong, ease of use adjuncts and front ends to our traditional legacy products which companies are standardized around.","So, the bottom line is, it's, as a stand-alone product, it has some different advantages, but it's largely been in some of the newer and emerging markets. But in general what we've done is taken the best parts of that and made that available to our overall broad platform type of capability and we see that as being a good long-term direction.","Gal Munda - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Cashman for any closing remarks.","James E. Cashman III - ANSYS, Inc.","Okay. Well. Okay. Well, thanks everybody for the questions.

So, it's been a serious pleasure getting to know and work with all of you. And I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank the entire ANSYS team for all the hard work and commitment and also, I'll welcome the newest members of our team from medini Technologies.","We've built a world-class business and we've led the growth of simulation for over 46 years or so and I look forward to many more years of growth in my new role as Chairman of the Board. So, much has been achieved so far this year from both an operations and a financial standpoint, but as you've always heard us say, there's a ton of work that continues to be done to continue to maintain our industry-leading competitive advantages and really drive toward the opportunity that we're firmly committed to.","So, we remain resolutely focused on improving our sales and channel execution as we've talked about on this call and your questions. And particularly, in those geographies where we know that we could be performing better and that we'll make any necessary changes to better position ourselves to capture the opportunity for the next 20 years.","So, I can assure that Ajei and I, as well as the entire management team, are dedicated to continue to driving both stockholder and customer value by continually leading our industry with innovation and outstanding customer support.","So, with that, I thank you very much and the ANSYS team will look forward to linking up with you over the next weeks, months, and on the next call in February.

With us today is Mr. Jim Cashman, Chairman, President and Executive Officer; and Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Cashman.","James E. Cashman","Will good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Actually, today, we're going to be discussing 2014 first quarter financial results.","So a little bit of bookkeeping first, consistent with our standard protocol, just be aware that all of the general information and key topics relative to Q1's business performance, and our updated 2014 outlook are included within this morning's earnings release and in the prepared remarks document that we posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning.","So with that, and no further ado, I'll introduced Maria Shields, our CFO for our Safe Harbor statement. So Maria.","Maria T. Shields","Okay, good morning. Thanks, Jim. I'd just like to remind you that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future.","These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call, and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K.","So Jim, I'll turn it back over to you.","James E. Cashman","Okay, thanks Maria. So before we get started with Q&A, I'd like to briefly comment on a few important highlights regarding our Q1 results, our updated fiscal year 2014 outlook and this morning's announcement of our acquisition of SpaceClaim.","So let's start by saying that Q1 was a solid quarter on many fronts. It was highlighted by record cash flows of $132 million, a deferred revenue and backlog balance of $437 million, and an operating margin of 47%. So we reported a consolidated non-GAAP revenue above the midpoint of our Q1 outlook range, or $216.5 million, which is an increase of 9% in both constant and reported currency, and our non-GAAP EPS was at the high end of our range, or $0.76.","In addition, few little sub-points here, our first quarter non-GAAP revenues were driven by a combination of growth across each of our 3 major geographies. We had 32 customers, with orders in excess of $1 million. Our recurring revenue was very strong at 75%.","In the first quarter, we welcomed Reaction Design to Ansys. And today, we want to welcome SpaceClaim to the Ansys family, and we'll talk more about that momentarily. And for those of you are interested on the hiring front, we netted about 80 employees during the quarter, including the new employees from Reaction Design.","There were many positive aspects from the quarter, which like I said before, we saw growth in all regions, led by strong constant currency growth in Asia, most notably the 13% growth in Japan, which we had highlighted as an area of concern and effort over the previous quarters.","Now even though we were above the midpoint of the revenue guidance, there was one significant downside aspect for the quarter, and that's namely the situation that developed in Russia and its several million-dollar impact on our business that otherwise would've seen us at the top of our revenue guidance.","There was one other specific data point of interest, the relative strength of lease versus perpetual revenue. This is also of course, partially reflected in the aforementioned increase in our current revenue percentage. It was largely driven by continued growth in the Apache, and our electronics business unit lease businesses, as well as the small inclusion of Reaction Design which also offers both a subscription and paid-up model.","While the Apache business has historically been a time-based license model that we continue to grow, it's a little too early to ascertain whether there's a shift towards time and usage-based subscription revenue in other elements of our business that were traditionally offered under a paid out model. Or even if this is a -- one of those responses to macro conditions. In any event, nevertheless, the increases in subscription and recurring revenue are 2 positive factors that have been part of our business model for decades.","During the quarter, we combined a focus on a combination of sales improvement initiatives, and sales and technical support hiring in those market places where we see the most opportunity for growth in 2014 and beyond.","The sales teams are focused on finding new and complementary ways to better address the market opportunities in their local geographies and increase the overall sale of productivities. These ongoing internal sales improvements are beginning to translate into top line results in certain regions, as I mentioned, Japan being one example. And we believe that the changes that we've made coupled with the continued focus on execution, should continue to produce improvement in sales through 2014.","On the industry side, the industry composition continued to be diverse, while exhibiting strengths in electronics, so let's see materials, chemical processing, automotive and the industrial sectors kind of stood out. We had a host of new logos, and we also continued to see sales and strong renewal in our existing account base, reference back that growth of the $1 million-and-above customers.","And then also, as you hopefully saw in this morning's announcement, we're excited to report that yesterday, we closed the acquisition of SpaceClaim. This addition, while relatively small in revenue contribution currently, is exciting, I'd say, for 3 major reasons: First, it accelerates by a few years the delivery of our long standing vision of simulation-driven product development, by injecting the intuitive interaction into the simulation process; secondly, it strengthens the democratization of our products to help extend our potential user base from the traditional analysts and expert users to a much larger cadre of design in nontraditional users, as seen in the ranks of management, marketing, manufacturing sectors, as well as increased traction in our SMB and our SaaS subscription delivery models; and then finally, equates a new end user market as an embedded application in the variety of OEM offerings that can benefit from a new paradigm or a product innovation and collaboration.","So basically, we're really excited to welcome the talented employees to the Ansys family. I would mention that more information on the SpaceClaim acquisition is provided in this morning's prepared remarks document that I referenced earlier, as well as some supplemental materials posted on the acquisition page of our Investor Relations website.","So as we look to the remainder of 2014, for Q2, we are currently forecasting non-GAAP revenue in the range of $226 million to $234 million, and GAAP revenue in the range of $224 million to $232.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $0.77 to $0.81, and GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $0.57 to $0.62.","We're adjusting our outlook for fiscal year 2014 factoring in plant increases and sales capacity and other headcount additions to your current visibility around sales pipeline and forecast, and the inclusion of SpaceClaim starting May 1, and some small changes in currency rate assumptions. What this translates to is we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $939 million to $964 million, or top line consolidated growth of 8% to 11%, and GAAP revenue in the range of $932.5 million to $958.5 million. Our updated non-GAAP diluted EPS outlook for 2014 reflects a range of $3.23 to $3.33, and we expect GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $2.44 to $2.62.","Netting this kind of explaining digging in a little bit more, the revenue outlook for the full year remains unchanged at the low end of our guidance range, and is slightly down at the high end. While we expect SpaceClaim to add roughly $10 million in non-GAAP revenue for the remainder of the year, this amount is offset by reductions in the business we previously expected from Russia, and also by some weakness in portions of our indirect channel.","Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the situation in Russia, based -- also including the most recent announcements of additional U.S. sanctions earlier this week, we're being prudent in our business outlook and we're assuming no appreciable improvement through the remainder of the year. Of course should the business conditions significantly improve, we'll factor the changes into our future outlook as upside.","The full year EPS range, slightly lowered to account for the margin structure of SpaceClaim, and that's fairly typical of all of our previous acquisitions over the past 15 years or so.","So summarizing the situation, continued growth with upside potential from any reasonable Russian stabilization, combined with new technology offerings that come from a combination of our own upcoming traditional product releases and our recent acquisitions. For the next few months, no surprise here, we'll continue to focus on driving increased productivity from our ongoing sales and support investment while also balancing our investments for future growth against the realities of the current and changing economic conditions and cautious customer sentiment.","So with that, we now open up the phone lines to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Well, I'll take the easy question the one that's probably on most people's minds. I'm wondering if you can give us any quantification around the Russian impact in dollars to first quarter, second quarter, full year, just any kind of help or color there would be appreciated.","James E. Cashman","Yes, well, for the fiscal year, it was probably slightly in excess of $10 million. I mean, no surprise, and we talked in previous quarters about Russia being -- relatively being one of those higher growing areas. And it was probably approximately in that $3 million kind of range for Q1, and then the rest of it of course spread out over the remainder of the year. And the bottom line is, we still have a high regard for the long-term aspects of that business, and we've heard nothing about the things sort of -- but there's a lot of saber-rattling. There is talk about export license kind of concerns, there are things like that. And we want the fact there that in the overall business operation. And basically, when it comes in, we can cut the keys and get into the customer.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Perfect. Then I have a question. You may not have this at your fingertips but it has to do with the lease license mix. And you give us some nice color, pointing out that the Apache business, which tends to be more lease, was strong. But within your core business, kind of the Ansys core business, has there also been a shift there? Do you have any sense of that.","James E. Cashman","Well, no. There has been some shift. Like we mentioned, there was an increase, particularly in the EBU, in our electronics business unit, and some of that could be a crossover thing of some of the cross-selling that we have between that. But again, we had relative performance of historical paid-up to lease ratios in our other main line businesses. It was more resilient, in the lease. And like I said, we want to -- there can be a couple of things at play here. There can either be some trends in the buying sentiment, as people get more comfortable with time-based licenses and subscription model. But if you recall, from other time frames of uncertainty, there were times where we would have short-term dislocations of lease. At the end of the day, we're both happy that customers are still coming on board in the purchase mechanism the fact that our recurring revenue percent went up, that our deferred balances are going up, some things like that. Those are all positives. But we do see some of those. But it was enough of a relative perturbation that we figured we'd call that out.","Operator","The next question comes from Anil Doradla from William Blair.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I think the question I have around here, now that you've got -- had Walid for I think almost a year as Chief Product Officer, can you share with us some of the key achievements in this new role, and the reaction of customers? And where I'm going with this question is, you've talked about democratization of these simulation tools, and him having a Microsoft background, I would love to hear your perspective given that we've got 12 months behind.","James E. Cashman","Well, keep in mind, in terms of just the energy and new mindset coming in, and energy, that's probably one of the key things. But keep in mind, even once you to that, it takes a certain amount of time to create and develop code and get that in place. I think you'll start to see some of that coming out even in the upcoming releases that I mentioned. I mean, we've not formally announced the date, but we've got we've got our 15.1 and 16 releases coming up soon. Some also, some further ones from Apache in terms of RedHawk releases, and things like that. So I think this is really a thing where you see initial energy and enthusiasm and now it's -- now the function is really on the ongoing delivery of that. So nothing too surprising. But also not too surprising are some different perspectives of the computing industry and delivery models and things like that are particularly key. And I think also the different perspectives, not just from an IT standpoint but from some of the user paradigm, things that we want to do but -- where it's not going a change appreciably, but it's just going to get better due to that different mindset. Those are the key things we look at. All in all it's a positive.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And as a follow-up. I think the key question that is on my mind and many investors' mind is this growth trajectory of Ansys. One of the key issues that I hear from investors is it's a high-end product, they fully penetrated with the high-end of the market, and it takes time to go down to the wider engineering space. Can you help us understand anything that can help? I know this is a question that's come before, but I would love to hear your latest thoughts on this especially in the context of...","James E. Cashman","Well, the latest thoughts are the same as the oldest thoughts. And if you think about it, about 15 years ago, we had a patent technology which was really aimed at coming with very easy-to-use software for those historians in the crowd that was called DesignSpace. And we were trying to capture those elements of how you get that extreme ease-of-use. Even though at that time, we were heavily constrained by limitations in the computing infrastructure that would facilitate that. Now if you look going forward, you've heard an awful lot of talk about the Workbench architecture and some of the things in terms of our user experience that, over the last 2 or 3 years, has been a focus item for us. So we're starting to move into that. I would also accentuate the fact that, that was one of driving factors in terms of the acquisition of SpaceClaim, because they had a very modern kind of interaction, not only a user interface style, but way of interacting with geometry. And we wanted geometry to be able to move, if you will, at the speed of consensual thought, because a simulation-driven product development, you want to continuing look at many of many factors and use that, and get the product totally right before you even go into a detailed design phase. And this is one aspect that actually brought that into us. So but the third leg of this, which is one that we've also talked about extensively, is there is one element of making the tools available to -- comprehensible and usable by new cadres of less-sophisticated users from a simulation standpoint. But there's another -- one of the driving factors is, before, mainline companies will unleash all this capability and change their processes around it. They have to be able come up with something that says, \"I'm comfortable by adding this in here. I'm not going to disrupt my age-old legacies of being able to get reliable brand-leading products out there.\" So we also want to make sure, we also have to work with helping customers bridge that. But obviously, if you can't get to that first step of making it embraceable by the new class of users, you're not going to get much of a push to move that in there. So this is something that's been identified for a long time. We've been working on mainline for a number of years now, and we're looking at different kind of technologies that can actually, as I mentioned, accelerate. That's what I meant by accelerating the division of simulation-driven product development and the democratization aspect. Is actually being able to get this in a place where we can reach those users. And do it in a totally immersive passion, not just by providing lesser capabilities that have less options and are dumbed down, because these aren't -- the less-sophisticated users aren't solving less-sophisticated problem. They're still making major commitments to things that have to be successful product launches.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Unknown Analyst","This is Zack Aisman [ph] in for Jay. We have a couple of technical and financial questions about SpaceClaim. First, how does the Ansys strategy, as described at the Analyst Meeting, and ANSYS as a platform at systemic and comprehensive engineering?","James E. Cashman","Yes, well, the key thing is the geometry has always been a factor in there, and we've linked with a lot of other geometry systems, most notably the ones that, for instance, came from Kansas. We're not becoming a CAD company, we're a simulation company. But that ability to have something that we can organically blend in and go through rapid iterations and allow people, and in some cases, allow the simulation to actually drive the geometry. You remember the Investor Day, we talked adjoint solvers where are actually say, \"What do I want the results to be? And therefore, tell me what the geometry should be.\" Kind of inverting that overall processes is a very key aspect. And clearly, the SpaceClaim product and direct modeling in general, allows a more intuitive way of being able to interact with that and it links in more naturally with the concept portion. But it also was done at a time without any legacy baggage work and look at all the modalities of construction kind of techniques and interaction techniques and the way that works with computing infrastructures and we could leverage off of that.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. In recent years SpaceClaim seems to have been able to its base by about 10,000 licenses a year, including your prior resale activities on every half. How are you thinking about the unit opportunity here, given the size of your base or the needs of key verticals such as [indiscernible]?","James E. Cashman","I'm not sure I actually understand the question. Could you just re-word that? I'm sorry.","Unknown Analyst","So in recent years, the SpaceClaim license growth of about 10,000 licenses a year, including the presale activities on their behalf, how are you thinking about that unit opportunity?","James E. Cashman","Okay. Look, the key thing is we want to actually maintain that. Remember, I talked about 3 things that were pretty -- that were exciting about us. So you'll -- maintaining some of those pushes into the -- some of those peripheral kind of areas are still very much of interest to those, because even those people, even if they're not going to be doing simulations, resulting benefiting from the benefit of simulation, is particularly key. And there are, at the low-end, they literally have tens of thousands of seats, but they are at the low end. Additionally though, we want to take -- the same thing that made that accessible to a much broader range of people, if we can apply that same kind of attractive inclusion element, and bring that in to our traditional simulation base, we feel that we can knock down yet another set of barriers that sometimes might have impeded people from taking those first steps.","Unknown Analyst","Great. And as a follow-up, could you comment to the relative performance and outlook of your mechanical fluids and electronics business units, including Apache in particular?","James E. Cashman","Well, I think they've all been growing. Like I said, you would notice that there had been, we mentioned, there had been some -- a little bit a shift in Q1 or a relative stronger element of the lease aspects. If you look at Apache, Apache actually is -- performed, been performing ahead of projections and growing well. So there really aren't too many surprises. I would mention that the high-performance computing continues to be one thing that tends to keep people pretty interested, particularly when sometimes their resource constrained and want to get that through. But those are the major ones. Now the other thing is, you might -- the one place where our traditional mechanical and fluids, in particular sales got disproportionately hit was most of the Russia impact is really in those mainline flagship products. So you'd see -- we'd see a little bit of a ding there, but that was really the only thing that kind of -- that was really the main thing that stood out as being anything even quasi-anomalous.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I'll try to keep it -- it's a multi-part. I'll try to keep it slim here. So billings and bookings growth was much better than license growth. Is this mostly the mix shift to term or does it have to do with the timing of renewals. And I'll go ahead and throw in a related question, which is -- given that you're quota carriers, I think they were up 12% last year, from end of the year '12. Given that, can your bookings grow at this rate? And then I have one really one quick follow-up, if you don't mind.","James E. Cashman","Yes. Well, if first of all, if we were comparing only new customers to new customers, it would be a certain linearity to booking rates. when you're talking about add-on, the impact of HPC to already validated customers that are starting long-term rollouts facet, that's a particular -- that's really not too much of an issue. First, first question help me on the...","Maria T. Shields","Yes. Steve, Q1, if you look at bookings, has traditionally been a strong renewal period for us. It's either the beginning of the year in certain parts of the world or, in the case of Asia-Pacific, the end of the year. So Q1 and Q4 bookings are typically, heavily influenced by renewals.","James E. Cashman","And yes, to a much smaller degree, the mix shift affected that, also, likewise. And then even then, if you look at the bookings, keep in mind there's there is a phenomenon, if we look at the Apache side, where you got -- last year, we had a number of customers that they settled around the multiyear time-based license where you get that commitment and booking early on. So even though the revenue continues to project up, you may say, \"Oh, looks like the bookings might have even slowed down.\" Last year we had a phenomenon of several multiyear deals being booked out of the Apache multi-year, time-based license model. So therefore, if you were even comparing those, you might get a little bit of perturbation. But that's really the difference between single year and multiyear kind of things.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, Jim, and just for clarification then, you know, I'm trying to parse your words in your first part of your answer. If I think about where bookings will go for the whole year and, I were to net out kind of your thinking about the mix shift and also what renewal activity was like last year. Should we expect billings and bookings to grow faster than licenses or about in line this year, kind of what's the -- what's your sense there? And then I just -- I did to add a question as well, which was how are -- just any comments on how your pipeline for sales coverage and your pipeline coverage and your close rates are trending.","James E. Cashman","Well, in general, pipeline trending is slightly up, even with the impact of the -- even accounting for the fact of the Russia stuff being now kind of clogged in the pipes, so we really don't count that as a -- we don't count that. And with regard to booking, probably a little bit advance of the actual revenue, probably expect double-digit booking growth for the year as we continued on. And keep in mind, that's even factoring in, if you will, the slight minus impact of some of the Apache business already being booked a year in advance as of last year. So actually even a little bit better when you look at that perspective.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Williams with Evercore.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask you on the indirect channel. It looks like your relative to some of the growth rates in fiscal '12, fiscal '11, slowdown fairly materially in '13, and then it was up a little bit this year over a fairly, I guess, weaker compare. So I guess is there anything going on in the direct business? I know it's about a quarter of revenue, so I was just curious for any additional color you could provide on the indirect channel.","James E. Cashman","First, you said direct is the quarter, actually indirect is the quarter, I think that's what you meant. If you look at -- first of all, there's always spot things. In trickier economies, the channel tends to feel it a little bit more. The more stable it is, the more they pace along with us. And of course, if you look at it, yes, we last year or so, a little bit more than a year ago, we opened up our own direct kind of opportunity in Russia. But we still are serviced by channel partners there. So there was a disproportionate ding on the indirect side from the Russia business. And yes, there are always elements of the business that are -- that will change by region and different cycles, but nothing too much out of the ordinary.","David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up on the sales side of things. Can you provide any update on the search for sort of new Head of Sales and then sort of within that, obviously Japan. Much better this quarter. I'm wondering if you could sort of help quantify how much you think that was a result of some sales changes that you made there, versus just any macro impacts in that type of thing. Any color there would be great.","James E. Cashman","I'm sure the macro is going to help a lot of things, but I also have no doubt that the -- that some of the investments and the leadership enhancements that we made in that area, definitely were contributory to the aforementioned pretty good response from Asia. With regard to the other search, hey, it's going on plan. And it's going well and we have -- we've got several good finalists that both bring a nice base of both scale and experience.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] As we're showing no further questions, I would like to turn the conference back over back to Mr. Cashman for any closing remarks.","James E. Cashman","Okay. So basically, in close, the -- let's see. The emphasis for Q2 and the remainder of 2014 will be continued growth, customer development, improved -- really improved execution across all parts of our business. No doubt, there's still a tremendous amount of long-term optimism driven by -- we've demonstrated several statistics here that kind of highlight the positive customer receptivity to our vision. But also the business model has been pretty resilient. If you look at the results, even with a major impact of something like Russia, so -- but that shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that's followed us through all the up and down periods of the last 10, 15, 20 years. But a lot of that is because we got really loyal customers that are adding that big growing base, our partners have been great with us for a long time. I think our technology speaks for itself and, as we mentioned on this call, with so many additions we've made there, it gets even better. And of course, even with our own adds, but also being able to add folks like from the Reaction Design and SpaceClaim team that, that team of employees really is at the heart of making all this happen is key. So -- but you know, over the short term, in this environment, we're balancing this with short-term caution, around some of the specific conditions that we mentioned even on this call. And those are the things that are largely outside of our direct control but we can manage and sail through those. So with that, I thank everybody for your time, and we'll see you next quarter.","Operator","That does conclude our conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

With us today are Mr. Jim Cashman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Jim Cashman for some opening remarks. Sir?","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us to discuss our 2014 third quarter financial results.","So before we get started, I'll introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, for our Safe Harbor statement and some housekeeping details. Maria?","Maria T. Shields","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Let me just start by saying that our earnings release and the related prepared remarks document have been posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website this morning. It contains all the key financial information and supporting data relative to Q3 and the year-to-date 2014 business results as well as our current Q4 fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 outlook.","I'd also like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC. All of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact; our business in the future. These statements are based upon the view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we will be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K.","So Jim, I'll turn it back over to you.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Thanks, Maria. Let's see. Before we open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to provide some commentary about our Q3 results and our updated outlook for the balance of this year and our preliminary outlook for 2015.","So continuing the trends from the first 2 quarters of the year, ANSYS achieved strong results in Q3 as solid revenue growth in North America, the U.K. and Asia-Pacific outweighed some weakness in Germany.","We reported consolidated non-GAAP revenue of $235.5 million. This is at the midpoint of our guidance range when factoring in the significant strengthening of the dollar in the last month of the quarter. This represents also a 10% in both reported and constant currency as compared with the prior year period. Our double-digit revenue growth was driven by really widespread growth across our major product lines as well as across many different industry sectors, notably electronics, semiconductor, aerospace, defense, automotive and energy.","Importantly, our recurring revenue base continued to be very strong at over 70% of total revenue for the quarter and the year-to-date. We had 22 customers with orders over $1 million, including 1 customer with orders over $10 million for the quarter. This compares actually to 15 of over $1 million in the prior year period.","Also significant are 2 facts relative to this population of customers and the transactions. I'd like to briefly cover those.","First is that the average deal size among transactions over $1 million increased more than 50% over the comparable deals in the same period of last year. And secondly, 6 of these customer deals were comprised of time-based licenses. Now these are becoming larger in size and are more multiphysics-based. For revenue recognition purposes, they're spread ratably. So while they may not have the same impact as a perpetual deal in the current or near-term or even in the current year, depending upon when they're recorded, they will impact bookings, deferred revenue and backlog growth. Most importantly, though, they enable our customers to choose the licensing model that fits the needs and constraints of their own business models.","So in summary, for the quarter, the top line growth and especially the bookings growth was substantial and solid.","Okay. Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter were 50%, above our expected range, but this was a combination of the solid revenue growth and the continued cost discipline that drove strong results.","Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.89, a 7% improvement over the $0.83 recorded in the prior year period, which included $0.05 of incremental tax benefits at that time.","The results for Q3 were above the high end of our guidance range. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was approximately $82 million. Continuing our commitment to driving stockholder returns, we repurchased over 460,000 shares during the quarter and 1.4 -- over 1.4 million shares year-to-date.","Now historically, the board has authorized 3 million shares in each of our repurchase programs, and each time we were about halfway through the authorization, they improved -- they approved actually and increase back to the 3 million level. This week, in recognition of the company's strong liquidity, excellent growth pipeline and confidence in the future, the board increased the share repurchase authorization to 5 million shares, and we intend to be more aggressive in our repurchase activity over the next 2 quarters.","Okay. Now let's spend a moment on our revised outlook for the balance of this year and our preliminary look at 2015. Now while Q3 was strong and earnings significantly outperformed our expectation, there were a number of smaller factors which, when taken collectively, have slightly dampened our near-term outlook.","As I mentioned a few moments ago, we're seeing some weaker growth in Germany and parts of Europe. And in China, like many multinationals, we have exposure to state-owned enterprises, and we've experienced prolonged sales cycles there as of late. I might note also that we're also in the process of enhancing some long-standing channel relationships in China in an effort to accelerate the sales growth through the channel, in addition.","Our updated look at foreign exchange and the recent significant strengthening of the dollar adversely affected both the Q4 and 2015. Also, we anticipate some near-term costs related to consolidating redundant offices, the move to our new headquarters as well as continued integration and organizational evolution efforts.","So generally speaking, these are the near-term factors which will have an impact on Q4 and into next year. When taken in the context of all the significant opportunities we see next year and beyond, we remain of the view that double-digit top and bottom line growth can be achieved, and let me give you a few examples of why we remain confident.","First, our growth and weighted pipelines have increased by statistically significant amounts, and our recurring revenues, as you can see, are also increasing. What we are seeing is a continuation of trends that we mentioned over the last few calls, and they both relate to shifts in buying preferences that bode well for the long term.","First, the lease business progressed at a faster rate than the paid-up business. We mentioned this as a new data point on the last couple of calls, but we were holding back on calling it a trend at that point. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing early signs of a shift in buying preferences in increasing numbers of established customers, customers who are historically oriented toward perpetual licenses. And they're starting to shift engagement discussions toward multiyear, time-based licenses, particularly as they start to expand their base of multiphysics usage. We've already seen this manifested in the accelerated growth of our bookings, which grew in excess of 20% for the quarter and even mid-teens after removing the effective Apache deals, which tend to be longer-term and more varied in their timing.","So if these larger multiyear deals continue to become more prevalent, the long-term endpoint prospects are the same, but in the near term, there'll be a steadier, more modest ramp-up. Also, bookings could be a little lumpier in a scenario that includes 7- and 8-figure multiyear orders versus the ones that renew on a steady annual basis, but the revenue ramp should be smoother over that long-term period.","Now these trends combine with some significant themes of previous calls to accentuate the impetus for enhanced investment patterns, many of which are already under way. First and foremost, we are accelerating our investment to improve sales execution, capacity and growth.","Last year at this time, we made significant changes to our leadership team for overall Asia-Pacific. We spoke about that on those calls, including leadership and structure in Japan, India, Taiwan and, most recently, China, and we're now seeing the payoff of that investment in the double-digit revenue growth for the first 9 months for both GIA, Asia-Pacific overall and Japan, our second-largest market in the world.","We continued that trend at the global level, most notably with a new head of worldwide sales and service who has strong enterprise and channel experience. In addition, we've augmented the team with 2 additional hires. The first is a global channel leader to focus on some of the channel opportunities that we have discussed, including earlier on this call. We'd also mentioned that services will be an increasing part of our business to help customers expedite the adoption of our simulation tools, and to that end, we've recently hired an experienced global services leader. And also, finally, if you check our website, you'll note that we're hiring a record number of positions to expand our sales footprint as we head into 2015.","And actually, just last week, we added a CIO, which is a new position for us. This is in response to not only our own internal requirements, but also to help us guide through the increasingly complex opportunity that's provided by those enterprise sales, as well as the SMB and cloud customer evolutions.","So our Q4 2014 and preliminary 2015 guidance is detailed in both the prepared remarks and earnings release documents. We're currently expecting Q4 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $245 million to $253 million and Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.78 to $0.82. This translates to 2014 full year revenue of $931 million to $939 million and EPS of $3.29 to $3.33.","The fourth quarter revenue and earnings per share guidance is lower than what was implied when we last provided guidance in August. The reduction in revenue is primarily the result of increased softening in Europe and weakness in sales from our independent channel partner in China, but the largest factor was the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which really, that accounts for about half of the overall revenue guidance adjustment.","The change in revenue was the primary driver also behind our adjustment to the earnings per share guidance. However, I want to note that our Q4 guidance also includes onetime charges of $0.02 to $0.04 that's related to headcount reduction costs, including those related to acquisition integration and office location reduction, and moving and duplicate rent costs related to our new headquarter's facility.","We're still in the process of finalizing details around our 2015 operating plan, but our preliminary outlook for 2015 is for non-GAAP revenue in the range of $984 million to $1,014,000,000, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.53 to $3.64.","This early outlook factors in some shifts in the preference for the time-based licenses that we've discussed on this call, the recent significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the continuation -- we're assuming of a similar economic and geopolitical climate -- and the more aggressive share repurchase activity that I mentioned earlier.","So as we close out 2014 and enter into 2015, we're excited about our ability to reinvest in our business, return capital to shareholders and explore the opportunities to accelerate growth with acquisitions.","So with that, I'll now open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Anil Doradla of William Blair.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A couple of questions, Jim. You talked about reverting to double-digit growth on the top line and bottom line, whereas if we look at the preliminary guidance for next year, it's more in the single digits. So can you help us understand -- how do we reconcile your comments about double digits versus some of your preliminary guidance?","James E. Cashman","The main thing is -- again, we talked about the currency turbulence, and actually, our guidance does factor a range of high single digits to double digits. So 7% to 11% in constant currency. It's just that these currency headwinds -- I mean, the movement in, like, for instance, the yen alone in the last few days was very significant. As we've seen, those kinds of things can shift. But it still maintains the trajectory that we're talking about, and that's even factoring in the fact of -- the impact of these -- I mean, we love the fact of the recurring revenue and the buildup and the interest by customers into time-based licenses. But the fact that those are building up, they will tend to build up in current periods visibly a little bit slower just because of what's recognized from a GAAP standpoint. So I think it's pretty consistent, but like I mentioned, currency is probably one of the major stories for us right now.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","You talked about softness in Germany, and you talked about some channel partner weakness, too. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that? And how long do you think this is going to persist?","James E. Cashman","Well, I think the bottom line is we've -- I mean, first of all, we've already started to take steps to go under that. There has been -- the general economic outlook in Europe has softened a little bit over the longer term, and Germany was -- had felt a little bit more of that going on. Now also, we've got very strong, long-standing channel partners in Germany. I mentioned some of the other channel partners throughout the world, and part of what we're -- if there's a major theme, a lot of those tended to still be in a legacy mode of selling individual physics. And what we've been trying to do is that one of the real strengths of our product has been manifested. It shows up in those -- the large mega orders that we talked about. It shows up in the disproportionate growth of those more established customers. And as a result of that, we've been trying to bring the channel up to the point where they can also avail themselves of the ability to really sell the whole portfolio as opposed to a fragmented story. So what that gets into is the normal ramp-up for the technical and business certification as well as, it's coaching them through the process. And that's one reason why when I mentioned the fact of actually having someone to focus not just on sales production but on the development of the channel we instituted. And actually, this was an internal promotion of a person who's been very effective in dealing with channel, and we've actually had them focus on mechanisms to both instruct, to guide and to help drive the channel. So those things are already underway, but they will be a steady building process, and that has been built into -- also built into our guidance with the more conservative view, obviously driving the lower end and accelerated views moving to the higher end.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And if you don't mind me squeezing in one final one. HPC has been a great business for you guys. Low double-digit as a percentage of revenues, I think. Can you share some color around HPC? How was the growth during the quarter-end? What are your projections, say, if for 2015?","James E. Cashman","It still continues to grow. Now there's going to be a couple of things. That first of all, some of the growth initially was heads-up demand, and that demand continues to grow, however. But the second part of it is we're actually getting into that situation where extreme volumes will start to play into it. So for instance, the scalability, of course, when customers are now talking about 50,000 when they wouldn't have even considered 10,000 before, there will be a thing where the per-unit costs actually will start to taper at those larger installations, but the overall volume will grow up. However, HPC is just getting to -- it's just continuing to be a major driver of the business. And while we don't see that -- we don't see those mega amounts growing, it is a significant part and it will continue to be a good growth element for us going forward. That's always been the case. I mean, we want to continue, of course, to drive those other axis of the new user and, as I mentioned, some of the pops that we're starting to see in the early stages in the multiphysics adoption, which also links back to why we're trying to get the channel more fully engaged in that opportunity.","Operator","Next, we have Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Jim, I'd like to follow up on your comments regarding the shift to TBLs. Are you seeing that in any particular geos or verticals or both thus far? And with respect to how you think that will evolve in 2015 and beyond, what is your expectation for the mix of TBL versus perpetual -- versus what it's been? And I would think there would also have to be a strong corollary effect on your maintenance revenues, not just up-front licenses. By our calculation, the R squared of your maintenance and perpetual is very high, which is not terribly surprising. Then a follow-up.","James E. Cashman","Yes. Well, okay -- I'll try to parse the question down. The first part is related to the geos, and I think more than related to geos, I think it is more correctly attributed to developed large companies, most of whom we can't mention by name, but you'd certainly recognize the name, and as such, you would see them -- in Asia-Pacific, you'd see them more likely in Japan. You can guess where you might see them in Europe, and a lot of them are actually traditional North American customers. And the reason why I pointed that out is these are people that traditionally for years has just done the traditional, perpetual paid-up model, and the fact that they're looking at this as a way of broadening the reach of the software, it's one that we started to see, but it's just very significant that whenever you see a modulation of those buying patterns. Like I say, long-term, it's really good for us, but it has some of the short-term effects. The second part of the question, I think, was related to the impact of the maintenance business. I'm not sure -- I could actually attack that from a couple of different directions, but could you -- I mean, are you -- could you give me a little more color on what you're asking on that, Jay?","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Well, sure. Again, the question was, what do you think the ultimate mix between TBLs and perpetuals might be? And as part of your 2015 guidance to the extent that there is a shift, have you factored in that there would be a corollary weakening of your maintenance revenues to the extent that the perpetuals also slacken?","James E. Cashman","Well, yes, of course. I mean, if that ramps up -- but again, we count the -- the maintenance combined with the lease is the major part of our recurring revenue, and therefore, we are-- we still see that overall strengthening. I think you've seen already the impact of increasing numbers of TBLs, of time-based licenses, even in the early phases and what's that done to our recurring revenues. Now with regard to the ultimate mix, I'd be really concerned about having something with such an early low denominator. It's very early in the process of this, and the fact is we're seeing those lead customers come in, but as we've also seen, those lead customers that were doing the accelerated adoption, they sometimes are 3, 4, 5 years ahead of the masses, and therefore, you can have a real heavy skewing. And as I mentioned, that's part of what we're trying to factor in as we continue our operating -- I mentioned that we're in the mid-phases of our 2015 operating plan, and that's really part of the things that we're trying to calibrate on, while not driving the business toward any particular expectation in a 12-month period, but just being cognizant of what the trend is going to be over the next few years.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. With respect to the sales capacity, we took your advice and did a spot check of your website, and today, you're showing about 80 openings in sales-related positions. As recently as last week, it was about 65 or so, and that's up from just a couple of dozen in late '13, early '14. What are your assumptions about how quickly you'll be able to fill those open positions and ramp up their sales contribution?","James E. Cashman","Well, first of all, that's the #1 priority, and then actually, that's underway. Some of which are on the website. Some of which are being done through other means and all of which have been underway for actually several weeks in terms of going on. The -- let's just say the -- we're in that stage now where we've got a very strong -- at least, the last report I got was we've got a very strong pipeline of candidates. Now what the close rate is on that and the close percentage and things like that, a little bit early for us to say. But the bottom line is we are aiming toward -- the stuff we're doing now isn't going to really onboard and show something in Q4, but what we want to do is we want to be able to come out of the gates strongly in the early part of -- in 2015. And so really, what we want also be able to do then is get that mass of people ready for the normal sales force launch event that we have. That's a training and a driving event, and that's really what the motion is aimed towards right now because we have seen that some of the -- just from the number of a requests, the number of leads, the growing of the pipeline, we don't want to get caught with a capacity problem.","Operator","Next, we have Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I would actually like to ask about ANSYS 16, which I know has been teed up here and you've put a lot of work into that, and that -- really, you talked even in the press release about the focus on ease of use. And I was just wondering if we could get a little color around what kind of ease of use we might see, improvements within the product? And what are the new user groups you might be trying to reach out to with that product?","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, the bottom line is the -- think of it -- well, okay, I got to break 16 into 2 major constituency groups, and they're both important, but they're not different. They're really extensions of the same thing. So first of all, one thing you always expect from ANSYS is the continuation of market-leading capabilities for broad-based physics, full stop. I mean, it's been that way for 40 years, and it's our intent to keep that going another 40 years. So I could run out the clock going through hundreds of features there, but just take that on word right now, and we can go through website kind of stuff. The second part, though, and the part that I think is particularly exciting, is the -- first of all, we talked about 3 phases of Workbench evolution. The first one is this concept of multiphysics. The second part was the concept of data integration that linked things together. That was the Workbench platform. Now the third layer is actually -- we talked about, it would be the evolution of the user experience, and we'll actually be showing a first preview of that for some of the baseline capabilities. So the bottom line is if somebody has invested in our physics, they can rely on those physics for a long time to come, but there will be alternate ways for them get to access to it. Some that will appeal to a broader range of users. Some of it's in the user experience. Some of it is in the customization, the kind of capabilities that now our customization toolkit has gone through a series of maturation, and there are customers that are doing some pretty exciting things. One that we'll be talking about soon in terms of patient-specific modeling for eye surgeons, where they can actually look at the impact of various approaches and actually get that viewpoint or get the results in advance. And then the third part is that ability to -- just general journaling and scripting kind of capabilities that will actually support the overall things that we talked about in terms of helping it fit into the engineering processes of our customers, which also, by the way, links into why we're upping the gain in terms of the services, in terms of our service organization and service leadership. So really, the first part is capabilities, the ongoing endless stream of features that you always expect from an ANSYS release. But this next one is the first unveiling of a new user interface, user experience that allows a much broader range of things. And it's one of the things that you almost have to really kind of see to fully comprehend, but it's something that will -- it covers a baseline of some of our capabilities, so people get started now, and over the next few releases, we'll actually be expanding that access to our full range of capabilities.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just lastly, I'd like to just touch back on the larger deals and just find out if you think that the go-to-market and the sales execution was just a part of driving that increased number of large deals just effectiveness and combining products and upsizing deals.","James E. Cashman","Well, that's definitely part of it, and like any perrito [ph], our top 20% tend to kick in sooner. That's part of it, but frankly, the strength and capabilities of the software driven by, if you will, years of customers' internal validation, basically, I would say prove to them that they'd like to continue to put that at a broader basis because their products are getting more complicated and complex. There's bigger regulatory concerns that they have to go through, and their job just isn't getting any easier. So we find kind of like that accelerating lower ramp of our S curve is that the people who have been using it now through a few good product cycles have started to work it through their organizations. We see that ramp-up, and so I think that is also -- it's a combination of the effectiveness of the sales engagement team, but underlying it all is the strength of the product that actually can solve the problems. And as we've said over the last few calls, the big thing for us why we pushed for services, why we're expanding the sales capacity, is helping bridge between the customer's current implementation to where, if you would say, their need is. That takes some pathfinding and some assistance that we're trying to help them do to -- as the number one means of driving the growth.","Operator","Next, we have Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, can you just help me understand the difference between a time-based license and a lease, if there is a difference?","James E. Cashman","No, they're essentially the same. If there's one kind of thing that we -- in the informal lexicon is that time-based licenses actually are tending to have a patina of multiyear and extended kind of commitment thing, and it shifts. Sometimes historically, why a person might have bought leases is kind of a little bit different than why people -- why existing perpetual customers are now considering time-based licenses. And some of it gets down to the flexibility of the implementation, flexibility of utilization to match the product design cycles and what they might need at any particular time so that they can continue to refactor within an envelope, and sometimes it just gets down to the economics and the purchase dynamics that exist within a customer. And the one thing we've said, I mean, for as long as I can remember, at least 15 years, is we never tried to drive any one eventuality on that, whether it was lease, whether it was pay-for-use and our Software-as-a-Service and cloud stuff, or whether it was a perpetual license. We just really wanted to provide multiple avenues for them to get access to the technology and then let them pick the right way. But like I said, right now, and I don't know how much of this is being driven by economy, I don't know how much is being driven by cloud mentality, there could be a number of things. But the fact is the customers are in fact at least beginning to show those signs of changing and that's what factoring in. Like I say, long-term, it's great, but we have to be able to selectively engage with a broad range of customers during whatever transition period might exist.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just related to that, a question maybe for Maria. We're seeing seen this divergence between your short-term deferred growth and your short-term backlog growth. In other words, your short-term bookings are growing much faster than your short-term billings. Is that related to this in any way? Or is that just an anomaly for this particular quarter?","Maria T. Shields","I think that's just an anomaly. I wouldn't see that as a trend right now, Ross.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And can I just squeeze in one last one, just on the repurchase. So you're going to be spending, call it, $100 million run rate for the next couple of quarters, which is a little bit above, I think, your annualized free cash flow rate. I guess, the question is on the sustainability of that level of buyback relative to free cash flow. Put another way, when we think about your cash balance, approximately getting up towards $1 billion, are there still M&A opportunities that would lead you to...","James E. Cashman","Oh, yes, let's...","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Want to grow your cash balance effectively?","James E. Cashman","Absolutely. First of all, acquisitions continue to be #1, okay? Just flat out. The bottom line is, though, if you take that $100 million per quarter, that's not too much off the steady state, but keep in mind, we've got excess capacity, excess liquidity that's been built up now. And as we looked at the trajectory of some of the things that we're looking at, combined with the availability of debt in the traditional markets, we don't see anything that would really constrain, nor would we constrain the strategic aspects of us being able to do those acquisitions. So with this, this is really just taking advantage of an opportunity, and again, I said the factor is going on when you look at the confidence we have in the future, when you look at the excess liquidity that we think we have right now over the needs for near-term acquisitions and running the business, and it's also -- we think it's an attractive way to return capital to our stockholders. I mean, you combine all that together, and it's a very logical thing and something that we think bodes well for the long term of the company and the stockholders.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's great. Is there a target, though, you have in terms of a cash balance or a rate of -- or a percentage of free cash flow that you think is a good framework for us to think about in terms of the share repurchase program?","Maria T. Shields","No, I think right now, Ross, we mentioned in the documents, we're going to target over the next 2 quarters to invest about $200 million in that program. But at the same time, we will do what we've been doing for the past decade plus, and there are certainly opportunities for M&A that we will continue to pursue that continue to add to the physics and to distinguish our portfolio from others in this space.","James E. Cashman","Yes, I think the key thing to keep in mind is that all of these things are temporal. We have some -- right now, what we're doing we think is a really good thing, also combined in lockstep with the acquisition path that we see going forward. I can't necessarily speak to what the acquisition target list might look like 1.5 years from now. So I'm not talking about a here's a steady-state lock turn, because if we get to a point and say, hey, here's an opportunity, and we're going to use the capital for that, that's what we'll do. But when we do that, we'll also have our mind towards having the kind of success for everybody that I think we've demonstrated in previous acquisitions. So this one is very much metered over the next few quarters and not really a -- something we carry on 5 years into the future on an autopilot kind of basis.","Operator","Next, we have Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I'll try to keep within the 2-question limit by asking you 2 very multi-part questions, if that's okay?","James E. Cashman","No, one brief follow-up. No, go ahead. Go ahead.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, let me do the first one. So the jump in open positions on your website was -- it looks like it really was 1 to 2 weeks ago. Was that in response to the strong Q3 bookings? And then more generally, can you comment on your headcount plans and your thoughts about deferred revenue growth for next year?","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, first of all, the thing is -- obviously, we have many ways of going after -- I mean, we've got a pretty strong -- I hate to call it a Rolodex, but I just did. We've got a pretty good group of sales candidates because recruitment is kind of like an ongoing process for us. It's not just an event that's driven by certain things. So -- and then we also bring the website in as a way of -- as another means in there, but yes, that has been underway. I wouldn't say it was directly as a result of the bookings. I think it was more a result of the opportunity, and then remember, I mentioned pipeline and the growth. And what we've already seen from our -- we talked about the Asia-Pacific. So that combined with the new leadership in Asia, in -- globally and everything else, it was that thing that allowed us to cast towards something and drive. It dovetails with the enterprise success that we see. So when you look at the pipeline, things like that, you get down to a situation where if we didn't accelerate this, we find ourselves caught in what I call a bandwidth issue in terms of how well you can process these kind of things. So it was a combination of many factors. I would say more that the bookings growth is a supporting data point that backs up all the other qualitative things that I said.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second other, the one piece -- go ahead, Jim, sorry.","James E. Cashman","No, there was a second part of your question, and I think I kind of garbled it, so I wanted to let you get to that.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes. So question 1b, deferred -- thoughts on deferred revenue growth for next year and the headcount plans more generally?","James E. Cashman","Yes, well, that's one where, Steve. I mean, we could give some pretty loose guidelines, but this is -- we're still in the baking process for the 2015 plan and bringing in some of these new leaders and capturing their input into it. So it's probably a little bit premature for us to do that, but we'll be talking about that in future sessions.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great, great. Now for question 2, and then I'll finish up. So obviously, there's a lot of positive things going on in the business with the strong bookings, the plans to reinvest along with bigger share repurchases, yet the stock's still -- it's down a little bit today, which kind of surprised me. So I think the only fundamental issue here appears to be the European results and the commentary about Europe. So given that the European PMIs actually are remaining pretty steady, I'd love to get your thoughts on the weakness. Are you seeing any signs of improvement in October? Could we see a return to the mean? The mean being maybe just sluggish growth, but we're not falling off the cliff. Are you making any tweaks to execution? And is your guidance thoroughly derisked and maybe possibly overly derisked if we see some improvement there?","James E. Cashman","When you say thoroughly or adequately derisked, I mean, it is derisked. When you put a qualitative term on there, not exactly sure now -- Europe, we have -- like I said, Germany is a very strong market for us typically, and that [indiscernible]. Now we've got some other areas of Europe that have performed pretty well, but in general, the -- but they tended to be in some of the smaller markets. So we're trying to really assess that and not overdrive the equation. Again, long-term, you can't -- I mean, the strong industrials are all -- industrial nations are always going to be a good long-term market for us, but there are little bumps that happen along the way there that continue on, and those are things that we're going to have to assess. But right now, trying to pin those down, at this point, it would be finger in the wind at best.","Operator","Next, we have Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So in terms of the buying behavior you're seeing in Europe, how does it compare with the slowdown as we went into the Great Recession? And what I mean by that is choice of lease or time-based license versus perpetual, the type of contracts, the size of contracts. How does it compare?","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, really, I'd have to say that there is really not a comparison. That's the -- again, the time-based -- the perpetual to lease shift in a short-term standpoint, that is fundamentally different because we saw how that recalibrated 9 months, 3 quarters later. We saw how that recalibrated and kind of readjusted itself, if you recall back in the 2010-2011 time frame. That is a fundamentally different motion than someone who used to buy perpetual licenses saying, hey, what about a 4-year deal that expands -- they're really looking at something a little bit different. The other thing is that those lease shifts tended to be the smaller companies that were looking for some financial respite during a rough time versus major companies that are looking at a different form of expanding their usage. So I really can't -- I hadn't thought of it in those terms, I think basically because they really were kind of fundamentally different. And again, it tends to focus, as I mentioned earlier, not so much on geographic pockets but on classification of customer that would want to expand into this level. And they tend to be the bigger-names, probably the ones that anybody could rattle off the tip of their tongue type of thing, if we could mention them.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And I missed this if you said it. But what was the SpaceClaim contribution so we can figure out the organic...","James E. Cashman","It was pretty de minimis, but it was a couple of million, just around that thing. It was pretty -- keep in mind that one gets to be a little bit difficult because we were also an OEM of them at one time, and we're actually embedding a lot of the software into the ongoing product. And in fact, what I was talking about when somebody asked about R16, well, SpaceClaim plays a very interesting role in that new user experience and the way that people interact with their models. And I'm not going to say anything more than that until we actually do the formal release, but that tends to kind of skew the numbers on that, too. But that would at least give you a talking point to rig [ph] the numbers around.","Operator","Next, we have Saket Kalia of Barclays.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So first, just going back to the shift to lease, not to beat a dead horse, but it feels like design overall is starting to feel a little bit more comfortable buying on a lease, and it almost sounds more structural this time around. And I think what you mentioned, Jim, was that some of that is particularly happening in some of the multiphysics engagements. Can you just remind us what the benefit is to the customer that's using multiphysics on a lease basis rather than buying perpetual, excluding kind of the OpEx versus CapEx read?","James E. Cashman","No, no, no. I understood, and so you ruled out the financial thing, which is, I mentioned, one factor that goes in here. The one thing I'd like to draw a distinction between is the difference -- that there is a difference in the selling motion of the old woah, do I do a lease or do I do a perpetual license versus this new emerging kind of set of factors where a major company that used to buy -- oh, every year, they buy a few more perpetual licenses. They are sitting there and saying, \"Hey, I've got these design cycles in mind.\" And let's just take, for example, my product. I've got a very complex product that maybe has a couple-year development cycle, and sometimes I need a lot of access to electronics for the electronics design portion, and sometimes I need to work on embedded software, and sometimes I need -- so depending upon the shifts, being able to look at adjusting those things on the fly without the traditional thing of here's your license, if you want to change.","So I think it's that flexibility given the fact that they've already made the decision they want to expand the physics and they want to expand the breadth of usage. The other thing is then what that allows them to do. Now this is different than the capital versus necessarily OpEx. There is a certain then predictability to them over a long-term period of what the spend -- of what the spending patterns will be and their ability to budget around that. At least, now that's just -- I'd just say that anecdotal from about a handful of ones that I've engaged with. I wouldn't -- I can't guarantee that, that's across all the people who are talking about this, but I know that's a constant theme that comes up.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So just to hit on that point of sort of the ability to get more product within a lease, so -- just to be clear, is a lease a token-based engagement similar to like an Aspen Technology?","James E. Cashman","No.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Or is it similar to some of the EDA companies where you can sort of remix into and out of products depending on needs? Just to be able to explain the benefits of lease a little bit more.","James E. Cashman","Well, a lease is not a token-based one. However, at an enterprise level, a time-based license often has -- it doesn't -- I mean, the license mechanism is not distinctly token-based, but it has the same impact of flexibility and remix within certain guidelines. So it has an element that kind of does that, and it also then gets around all the individual first steps that are required for any kind of like -- oh, we're going to do a complete new purchase and then each one almost has to be a new cycle that's gone through. So again, lease, don't think in terms -- that was never a token-like kind of approach, but the enterprise massive time-based licenses does have that element of flexibility and utilization and adoption built into it.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then for my follow-up, if I could squeeze it in, goes to the margins side. Maria, I think the prepared remarks said that fourth quarter operating margins should be about 44% without that onetime charge, which I think from this quarter would be a 6-point kind of sequential decline. Typically, we've seen it only be maybe between 1 to 3 points down sequentially. First, can you just bracket what that onetime charge will be on a dollar basis? And then why do you think that sequential decline is going to be greater this fourth quarter than what we've seen historically?","Maria T. Shields","So on the onetime cost, it's probably somewhere between $3 million and $5 million. From a sequential cost, it's just -- if we take a look at the dynamics of the Apache and the Esterel businesses combined with, albeit, while there are certain parts of our sales that are not performing as well as planned or we would like, there are other elements of sales that are doing very well, and this is the accelerator time frame for them. So a lot of the cost around Q4 and people being in accelerators have been factored in. And like any other quarter, including this one, to the extent that we deliver towards the higher end of the range on revenue and\/or above, you will probably see improvement in what we've guided to. But there is just a lot of unknowns right now, and I'd rather be safe than sorry.","Operator","Next, we have Matt Williams of Evercore.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore ISI, Research Division","I'll try and stick to 2. Just on the -- in EMEA, I know we've talked about it a little bit, and sort of going back to some of the success you've had in Asia-Pacific with some of the operational changes you've made there. Is there anything operational in EMEA that needs to change or that you're taking steps to change relative to...","James E. Cashman","Yes.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore ISI, Research Division","I know the business environment is not particularly great in some of those markets, but...","James E. Cashman","No, well, I mean, the bottom line is there have been a lot of times where the economic thing might not be all that great, and there's still ways for us to succeed, but I think that a, we continue to look at some of the -- and some of them are similar and some of them may be a little bit different than what we did in Asia-Pacific and other parts of the world. But obviously, some of the things we talked about with regards to channel has an impact on that as well as the broadening of the multiphysics space, and the capacity issues we talked about are also a major element of that. So we're adding capacity in Europe, too, because again, the pipelines have strengthened in Europe, but we need to make sure that we can actually close them and actually probably even expand them over what they are now.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then again, sort of sticking with the sales or organizational stuff. In the prepared remarks, you talked about making some organizational changes and go-to-market changes. You've talked about increasing sales, hiring and somewhat of a shift towards these term-based licenses. Is there anything within the sales or go-to-market model that needs to really change in terms of maybe pursuing the term-based approach with the larger customers relative to what you've done in the past?","James E. Cashman","Well, in terms -- again, in terms of wholesale shifts of what we'd be doing, I'd go back to our initial tenet is we're going to make many opportunities for customers to acquire the software available to them, and we even -- to the point of being able to talk about the advantages of each, but then let the customer make the decision. So the last thing we're trying to do is say, oh, we have seen this trend around some of these larger established customers moving in this direction. We see some of the data moving in that direction. That doesn't mean that we want to now force everybody wholesale into that, because there will be some that still continue to have that preference. But what we need to do then is arm our people with the data and the background to be able to help consult with their customers as to the best way to adopt, and that -- by the way, that adoption, again, links back into the service motion that we're also accelerating.","Operator","The next question we have is a follow-up from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, I just wanted to go back to the $10 million deal. Have you ever signed a $10 million deal before? And also, can you just maybe talk to the duration of a deal like that? Is that also a longer contract duration?","James E. Cashman","Oh, yes. It's -- that particular one is a 3-year deal. Actually, we did -- we have had larger ones, but maybe over a period of time and things like that. But all that does is it just speaks to the point of this is not a singular occurrence that happened with one wacky customer. This is something that many people are actually effecting with their dollars today and then you pile that on top of the fact that we're hearing it from many other customers, and that just becomes too much of a trend in one direction.","Operator","Well, at this time, we're showing no further questions. We will go ahead and conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Jim Cashman for any closing remarks. Sir?","James E. Cashman","Okay. Thanks a lot, Mike. In close -- okay, so let's see. The results of the third quarter reflect strong execution across our product lines, across many of the industry sectors and across almost all geographies. I'll just say we're pleased with what we've been able to achieve in the third quarter and year-to-date. We're extremely well-positioned to continue our growth into the balance of this year and into next year with strong recurring revenue, in-depth and deepening penetration of our top customers and the continuous improvement in the functionality of our software solutions. So all of this coupled with our disciplined cost management, our industry-leading competitive position and, of course, our base of talented employees gives us the confidence in our ability to drive shareholder returns over time and as we pursue that over $1 billion in revenue mark in 2015. So I'll just thank everybody for your time and questions, and we'll speak with you again next quarter.","Operator","And we thank you, Mr. Cashman and Ms. Shields, for your time today. The conference call is now concluded. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you, again, everyone, and have a great day.","Maria T. Shields","Thank you, Mike."],"2040":["Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) Q3 2013 Earnings Call November  7, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","James E.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Cashman. Please go ahead.","James E. Cashman","Okay, thanks. Good morning, and again, thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss ANSYS' third quarter 2013 financial results. So, consistent standard protocol bookkeeping, all the information and key topics that are relative to the quarter and the full-year business results, and also our future outlook, are included in this morning's earnings release and in the prepared remarks that we've posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. So before we get started, I'll introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, for our Safe Harbor statement. Take it away, Maria.","Maria T. Shields","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'd just like to remind you that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","Unless otherwise indicated, during the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we will be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K.","So, Jim, I turn it back over to you.","James E. Cashman","Okay, thanks. Let's see. Before we get into Q&A, I'd like to briefly highlight a few key points around our Q3 and year-to-date results, and also share some thoughts regarding our outlook for the remainder of 2013, and an advanced peek at this fiscal year 2014. So let's start by saying that Q3 was another quarter we delivered -- in which we delivered our commitments, and despite the persistence of the macroeconomic issues that continue to challenge not only us but our customers as well.","We finished out the quarter slightly above the midrange of our guidance, with revenue of $213.4 million or 9% constant currency growth, and beyond the high end of our range on earnings. So actually reflecting back on the comparable quarter a year ago, this was a very similar outcome relative to our final results versus our guidance and unfortunately, many of our predictions that I've made at that time around the challenging economic backdrop and the noticeable lengthening of procurement cycle extending into 2013, they have, in fact, remained with us throughout the past 9 months. And unfortunately, those same predictions are what we're currently seeing ahead of us as we move into finishing out Q4 of fiscal year 2013, and we're really not assuming any major uplifts into 2014.","So for the third quarter and year-to-date in constant currency, we delivered 9% and 10% revenue growth, respectively. In Q3, we reported double-digit revenue growth to both North America and Europe, with albeit slower but still positive constant currency growth in Asia-Pacific. The top line performance in turn yielded strong margins, cash flows and earnings for the quarterly and year-to-date periods.","During the quarter, we saw a disproportionate growth in leases as compared to paid-up licenses. Our maintenance business also continued to be strong with 13% constant currency growth in Q3 and a 15% year-to-date. So both of these factors contributed to our deferred revenue and backlog balance growing significantly faster than our reported revenue. These results were indicative of both solid renewal rates and a healthy 72% recurring revenue rate for the quarter. We finished out the quarter with total deferred and backlog balance of just over $360 million.","Our Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 included approximately $4.8 million or $0.05 of incremental tax benefits. But even excluding these benefits, we still exceeded the high end of our guidance range for earnings. On a year-to-date basis, we reported non-GAAP EPS of $2.31. So as we look back on the progress over the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2013, we continue to make important strides with a vast array of customers spread across geographies and industries. We continue to see the importance of product innovation, integrity and quality as critical business issues requiring the use of advanced simulation. And just one example, in automotive, we've seen strong R&D investments continuing globally, led by sustainability and smart systems development, in addition to increasing utilization of electronics and embedded software for safety, performance and entertainment. But even with that mind, across most industries, growth is really being driven by 4 major factors: First and foremost is just the increasing product complexity; second, is the need for localization that we're seeing in different geographic markets; next, any product segment linked to the trends in mobility are quite strong; and then finally, as I've also mentioned in automotive, the increased proliferation of electronics and software into our customers' products. So those 4 factors seem to be the canonical reasons for driving of growth. So all of these areas drive the increased interest and need for our unique multiphysics capabilities, and in each of these cases the rapid understanding of the extremely complex problems, the necessity of a high degree of fidelity and accuracy, all of these are key tenets of the ANSYS vision and strategy. And this vision is probably key because it's been in place for many years. It's predicated on the ability to virtually simulate increasingly complex complete systems that are comprised of mechanical, electrical and software components. So for those of you who are interested in additional depth, there's a wealth of content regarding our portfolio solutions and customer uses across a broad range of industries that we serve, and those are all on our website, at ansys.com.","Okay. So with the Q3 behind us, we look to close out the final quarter of 2013. No doubt about the global uncertainty and customer cautions and the challenges they pose for us and many companies in our industries. And from what we're currently seeing and hearing from our customers, those challenges will continue into the foreseeable future. That being said, our outlook for Q4 is non-GAAP revenue in the range of $234 million to $240 million, with EPS of $0.79 to $0.82. This translates into non-GAAP revenue for the full year of $863.2 million and to a high of $869.2 million and EPS in the range of $3.10 to $3.13. So netting all that out, this is essentially a slight increase to the floor and a narrowing of the range for revenue, and an increase in their earnings outlook to take into account the strength of our Q3 results.","I will say that we have anticipated no significant year-end budget flush that's to factor into our Q4 outlook, but as always, if that does happen to do it, that should be upside for us. We've also initiated a preliminary outlook on revenue and EPS for our fiscal year 2014, and this consists of non-GAAP revenue in the range of $935 million to $965 million and EPS in the $3.25 to $3.37 range. More details around currency rate and other key assumptions are contained in those prepared remarks that we posted on our Investor Relations homepage early this morning that I mentioned at the beginning of the call.","For purposes of today's discussions, since 2013 is not over yet, we'll stay at a very high level on the 2014 assumptions. We're in the process of prioritizing and finalizing all the details around hiring, capital and overall areas of investment for 2014. We'll provide more details and additional insights on the Q4 earnings call in February.","Now from a qualitative perspective, our current guidance takes into account the uncertainty that has persisted in various geographies throughout the world, and also an assumption of a continued level of spending discipline by our customers and it really continues to add variability around the predictability and timing of deal closings. The biggest realities of today's environments and there are things that can and will happen and we have no control over it. However, there are a couple of things that we are certain of. The first is the long-term confidence in the vision that's been our passion for more than a decade. And second is our commitment to invest from a long-term perspective in the realization of that vision. So with that in mind, we'll continue to be cognizant of all the short-term realities that get us from time-to-time and factor those into our business plans and our guidance.","So with that, I'll be opening up the phone to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Koenig at Wedbush Securities.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Jim, Maria. I'll start with a question on Q4 guidance.","Operator","I'm sorry, one moment, please. Just one moment. I'm sorry, just a moment. Sorry, Mr. Koenig, you may proceed with your question.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Let's see. The initial question is on Q4 guidance. The EPS guidance looks a bit low especially when I reverse engineer the operating margin assumption, looks like it's below 47%, which is out of your usual range. Can you give us any thoughts on that?","James E. Cashman","Yes, well there's no doubt. Keep in mind, again, you talked about that unpredictability about the revenue and even some of the earnings things, so we were over the high range. But if you look at it, there's really, there's probably 3 primary factors. First and foremost, we didn't hire as quickly as we really would like to in an ideal standpoint.","Maria T. Shields","He's asking about Q4.","James E. Cashman","Q4? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, so really the Q4 margins -- okay, so the key thing was that if you look at the natural flows of business and these are some of the newer ones. So like Apache and Esterel business, the margins for Q4 are typically a lot or significantly lower. They're driven by sales and commission accelerators that occur in the fourth quarter. So in general, they tend to be double-digit lower than they are in Q4, so you'll see something similar to that for those particular ones, but also you'll -- you're getting back to the timing of the predictability of spending, there are some additional expenditures that we're planning in Q4. Some are related around the IT bid out of our new data center that is supporting all of our global infrastructure and moving into some of our -- expanding our cloud offerings, and the timing of those came in at -- are coming in more planned for Q4. And then -- I mean, these are number of ones. Maria, you got...","Maria T. Shields","Yes. Steve, there's a couple of other factors. Q4 typically, our royalties in third-party commissions are higher in Q4. And we're also, as we typically do, we'll be doing some pre-hiring on the sales and support front to load for 2014.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. Great detail. And if I may squeeze in a follow-up. I'm curious the shift to leases that we saw this quarter, and it bounces around quarter-to-quarter. But I'm wondering, just your thoughts on the possibility that, that continues because of the secular shift we've been seeing throughout the industry and to more of a pay-as-you-go type of approach by customers. Do you think that could drive a more sustained shift to leases beyond kind of the choppiness you sometimes see quarter-to-quarter?","James E. Cashman","Well, it could be. This one stood out a little bit more, Steve. I mean, there's a number of things. Obviously, the Apache portion of business, which has been growing nicely, there's a little tweak there. There's no one predominating factor. We also don't know if the secular shift that you're talking about will pan out to be a trend versus a spike. I mean, we just pointed out because this one stood out now. It was something that was very noticeable. And also in general, times of macro uncertainty also tend to drive, but those tend to be short-term dislocations that tend to correct themselves over a 6- to 9-month period once things get on even footing. So there's a number of things. But in general, when you see the math add up and its impact on the recurring rates in the revenue backlog, it's good for us long term. Again, we've said for ages that whether or not it was our Software as a Service cloud offering or our perpetual license or our lease that really, in these early phases of adoption of this technology, that we are really interested in getting users of any style regardless and really not even caring a whole ton about how they acquire it. We want to create numerous avenues for them to do it. And we've just seen this particular timeframe that it did shift in this matter. So those 3 factors are the main ones. A couple of those are longer-term sustainable, one of them might be a spike, don't know about how all those will add up, but we doubt it was particularly noteworthy.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer at Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Jim, Maria, my first question concerns your preliminary 2014 outlook. The $30 million range is somewhat larger than the preliminary outlook at this time 1 year ago and 2 years ago, which were about $10 million to $20 million. I know that the company, of course, is larger and more complex on a larger base, but what are some of the components of that wider range that you had in mind for next year? And the follow-up question is, if you could talk a bit more about your electronics and semiconductor end market, which has clearly become now your largest business by revenue and clear driver for much of the past year. And does Apache continues to be a double-digit growth component of the company for you?","James E. Cashman","Well, okay. So first of all, yes, talking about the reasons for this extended range, basically you hit the primary one right on the head, it was the increasing complexity of the business. Your other thing is, that some of the macro uncertainties, particularly in -- a lot of people have been talking about different parts of the world and how there's been a lot of dislocation there. So there's just a greater uncertainty there. The third thing that I'd add in that I think leads into your following question is, we've got a range of some very new, exciting and unique technologies and capabilities in the portfolio that we've added over the last 1 to 2 years. But as I think we've all witnessed in all of this technology thing over decades is that it takes a little bit of time for them to incubate and therefore the starting error of what might take off and what might not in certain time frames tends to be -- have a pretty broad standard deviation to it. So the newness of some of those things while we know long term, they're going to be very strong trends, how long it takes for customers to get adapted to, what it might mean for them to implement it and how much those launch in. Now with that in mind, leading into your follow-up question is, yes, we see -- I mean, of course, Apache now has grown in scale itself. But even then, we see it as being a double-digit performer into the foreseeable future. I mean, I won't even put a time frame on it because I've seen no decline in companies pushing for their mobility solutions, for power, for power efficiency, for getting to smaller and smaller chipset sizes and moving down into at some point probably single-digit nanometer range but moving into that 20 into 14 and that. So with those trends going on, it's going to be a continual rate there and we see that continuing on. So I think with that, was that all the...","Maria T. Shields","I think and, Jay, just one other element I'll add is as to the earlier question, we've got this mixed model of paid-up and leases that we offer. So if some of the dislocations you mentioned continues into 2014, and people use -- elect the lease option as opposed to a paid-up option obviously that has different impact on how much that translates into GAAP revenue in any given quarter or any given period. So we're trying to factor all of that into a much bigger, broader complex business.","Operator","The next question comes from Sterling Auty at JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jim, you started to touch upon this in I think the answer to the first question. So when you're looking at the third quarter here, you mentioned maybe slower hiring. What I'm curious is normally we see this kind of upside of margins when you beat on revenue and you get that disproportionate contribution margin. It sounded like you managed expenses to get to this margin for this quarter. What I'm curious about, did you start off with a cautious view and kind of held back in expenses right from the beginning? Or was there something in the quarter where you started to slow down maybe the pace of hiring to make sure you've got to this level?","James E. Cashman","Well, first of all, again, there were -- the 3 major factors were we didn't hire -- and that was nothing we were managing. We would have loved to have gotten quality people on-site. But it is -- Q3 isn't necessarily the maximum transition, the optimal transition period for people that are looking to join or change during that time frame. So we just didn't -- the pace just slowed down a little bit from Q2. With that being said, we are planning on continuing to keep a pretty decent ramp-up even through Q4 in anticipation of building for 2014, so that's going to happen. Now with regard to the discretionary, I wouldn't say it was anything else outside the ordinary of the things we normally do with the business. But there were a number of different signals that we were seeing. Sometimes it was spread out globally, there were different global markets where we're seeing it more noticeably and with that in mind, we did at least use discretion in Q3. Keep in mind, Q3 is also historically the most bizarre quarter of the 4, of things coming in and predictability of revenue and things that happen as people come back from vacation. It's really not a full 3-month quarter. And then the, I guess, the other thing is that we -- I mentioned the dislocation of some of the costs. We had originally planned that we'd be doing as we bid out our data center, we had planned that we are going to be doing some expenditures in Q3, and they just, for a number of reasons, again, nothing related to management of anything but just the normal logistics of doing a major project like that. Some of the things that we anticipated being Q3 expenditures actually if they shift a few weeks, it becomes a different quarter. Really doesn't change the overall annual landscape of anything but it just cosmetically make something. Look, if you integrate it over time, you'll see that it probably mapped up pretty well. But those expenses are slated and actually are occurring now in Q4 as we speak. So those are really the 3 major factors and really nothing else, but nothing really out of the ordinary.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then the one follow-up. I understand the FX impact in Japan, but would you still call out further weakness just in demand out of Japan because I'm really trying to reconcile. If I look at where the geographic weakness was for yourselves versus parametric versus the cell versus -- and just looking at the broad segment, it doesn't seem like there's a common thread through it. And just wondering if that in and of itself tells us something?","James E. Cashman","Well, we try to look at that, I mean, when you look at those things. And I would say, there probably isn't a common thread. But if you look at some of the areas, I guess if you connect the dots between -- if you look at some of the areas where -- have been traditional pockets of strength for us in Japan, you'll see that some of those are either in retrenching or different competitive kind of environments. So it's again, I don't think there's any single trend that you're going to see there, things have shown signs of improvement for us in Japan and in general are progressing well along those points. But it's just a continual point. By converse you've mentioned some of those groups and other people in our space, they've had slowdowns in areas where we were in double-digit growth. I mean, there's just that -- there's just all of these local -- it's like you don't see a complete tidal wave covering all of the contingencies. It really is very spotty, but every sector of the globe is being hit by retrenchment of competitive positions and overall macroeconomic kind of situations going on. So it's really, I don't think -- we haven't found that one touchstone that seem to solve and answer all the questions.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Ashley at Robert W. Baird.","Unknown Analyst","This is [indiscernible] for Steve Ashley. Just piggybacking off of Sterling's question. Just wanted to ask on Japan, it seems like the macro environment continues to be challenging even on a constant currency basis. So just wondering what -- if you can give us some color on what you're assuming for trends there and your guidance?","James E. Cashman","Well, I'd say the bottom line is for the environment, we're seeing things very similar. Now the situation is that if the environment is going to be in a certain way, we obviously have to meter our business model and we do things to basically optimize our performance in whatever -- however a muddy field that we might be playing. So those type of things that we've also been involved with. I mean, you look at the one of the most telling things as you look at the relative comparant of, let's say, the electronics industry and the strength that it seemed to have almost a preeminence in Japan 5 to 10 years ago, and now you see what's happening with the Korean, even some North American accounts in terms of what they are doing. And then you see what the reaction of some of those Japanese companies are moving into other spaces, shifting, doing things. And I mean, so there's a kind of constant turmoil that's going on there. But those trends we still see continuing to go on. I guess the good news is that even if it goes -- if demand, if industrial demand shift in one way or another, if they are going to continue to grow, we'll proceed well because it's going to be done by some company somewhere in the world. And luckily with our geographic spread, we're pretty much evenly distributed across the globe, so we're able to do that. Now the other thing is that we are seeing, we are seeing some good activity in the auto industry in Japan. So I mean, again, it's not even a one-size-fits-all in Japan, it's different pockets of strengths and ebbs and flows, if you will, in all of those.","Unknown Analyst","That's helpful. And then just stepping back a little bit, and if he can just talk to us about your high-level priorities going into next year? Where will you focus your products, go-to-market and M&A investments, et cetera, that would be great.","James E. Cashman","Taking the M&A thing, because we can't comment on any individual one. But you're going to see really kind of the same trends that we've been doing over the years. But right now, we have pretty much a good footprint in all of the key areas that we want to be in, but we want to -- we actually want to make sure that we get a chance to fully flesh those out. So you could see a number of augmentations to our traditional lines that will actually allow us to solve these emerging new generations of problems that customers are coming up to. It seems like every time you solve one layer of issues then there's another cadre of them sitting in the background waiting to -- that they now want to solve. And we also see a lot of progression into ultimate materials, which we've talked about and what that means in terms of simulation. The concept of system simulation, your complete product system simulation is one that's been starting to take more and more hold up over time. So if you look at that, if you look at -- take that off the table and just say, hey that's part of the normal knitting[ph] that we'll be doing for a number of years because we -- it's a great way to get good qualities of staff and it's also a way to speed up the pace of development quicker than we ever could internally. But if you look beyond that for 2014, there are probably 2 basic themes. One of which is the release of our ANSYS 15 portfolio of products. And we won't get into a lot of detail on that right now but it's really one that we think tends to give us an incremental increase in capabilities that everything from look and feel to usability but blending together all of the applications that we've had that may have come from different parts of engineering discipline over time. The second part is then just the continuation of the sales momentum, given the fact that it's -- these are difficult times. But the headwinds seem to be against everybody. It's a difficult environment but being able to continue to build on that productivity but also be able to cross -- continue to get increased efficiencies of our cross-sell capability. So when we have strength in one area, that can actually be leveraged naturally in even though buying centers and buying maturities may be different even within the same company across those different disciplines, because ultimately, they all do play in being able to simulate complete systems.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Williams of Evercore.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Jim, Maria, maybe just to piggyback a little bit on Jim, what you were just talking about. I know you mentioned earlier that throughout 3Q, you didn't really hire at the pace that maybe you were expecting. But having said that, you have sort of ramped sales capacity throughout the course of the year. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit of color on sort of how those reps are on boarding? What their productivity levels are like and maybe what you -- what plans you might have in place to sort of increase that productivity going forward?","James E. Cashman","Well, I mean, first of all, I'll just say flat out we're a few down from where we wanted to -- where wanted to be. Yes, we added some and our hit rate has been better on the hiring. But we are net down from where we would originally are planned to like to have been. So that number aspect is one part of it. If you look into 2014, again, we weren't getting into all of the different planning and detailed things but I think you'll see a continual ramp-up not dramatically different than what you saw in 2013. That's just kind of what I'd expect but I can't hold there's anything right, not even finished with 2013 and we don't have an approved 2014 plan in detail yet. So sheer numbers is one. Now you've hit on the second topic, productivity. Well, productivity, I guess, you asked how are they ramping up? And I'd say in general, we've actually been able to, if you will, build the science of ramping up because we really don't have a single across-the-board competitor so there really isn't -- there really aren't pockets of people that will go and say, yes, here's these other people out there doing exactly what they're doing. So people are going to be already ready. So we had to actually build, if you will, the science of trying to expedite people coming onboard. I think in general, it's been okay, but if you recall earlier calls, we had mentioned also that, while -- if customers are more cautious than their buying pattern and they are more cautious of budgets. The general pace of getting meetings and those, if you will, building that muscle memory of a sales process by getting in there, that just all goes a little bit slower. So if anything, that creates a little bit of a lagging effect. But the -- probably the most important part is that you've got the right people and you know that they kind of get pretty -- they get marginally productive within a few months. And by the second half of the year, they're producing pretty fully and then they still continue to grow for a couple of years. I mean, the good news is that we've got a bank of those people that have really gone through, if you will, the shallow end of the learning S curve of coming up. So there's a statistically a good chance of those going up. But with that in mind, and we've also had to meter some of the training and mentoring programs that we have as people get into anything from major accounts to, well, in some cases, e-selling and inside an indirect sale of selling models and the like. So I mean, we've got those things going altogether. But first and foremost, down a little bit on the -- a little bit behind where we want to be in terms of the total headcount, but plan to ramp it up and continue into 2014. Second of all, ramping the productivity up and that's primarily through a lot more of targeted tools and training that we have specific to what we've observed through the first 3 months -- first 3 quarters, I'm sorry, of this year.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And maybe just one quick follow-up. I know we've talked in the past of the fact that you guys feel like you have plenty of white space within your installed base to expand users. Just wondering if we could get a quick update on, I guess number one, sort of how the expansion is going and the success you're having within some of those larger accounts trying to expand usage? And then I guess sort of alongside that, any sort of color in terms of hiring that you're seeing at your largest customers? Are they adding people still or is it still a very measured environment there?","James E. Cashman","Okay, well first of all, they're adding people. Our customers are adding people. They do it at a pretty judicious rate also. I mean, it's very targeted. And actually, some of them may be doing it as they spread out globally on a more global basis, which tends to, kind of confounds the situation a little bit. We're still seeing good growth to that point of the white space. I mean, not that we go after million-dollar orders, but those large orders that we saw continue to climb, even in Q3, which is a little bit more quiescent period. It grew so we had growth in the number of orders in excess of $1 million. And in fact the numbers of those continue to grow. I'd say also that right now, probably the key thing is that while customers don't want to, if you will, compromise on the accuracy of the solutions they're getting, in general, it's -- they're not going for, well, it's good enough software. A good enough software isn't good enough for where these customers are going. They're also at a point where, okay, now they validated the technology internally. And a lot of it gets into, okay now, organizationally and workflow-related, those tend to be now more barriers or the things that can slow down a sale. And quite frankly, a couple of those things are reasons of my aforementioned interest in the drive on the ANSYS 15 because that's where you start to see the -- some significant product surges in those particular areas.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","You mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but I got a question from some investors about your oil and gas effort. Is it fair to say that it's kind of probably less than 10% of revenues but has obviously upside potential? And then through these [indiscernible] how would you stay competitively on that bumping into?","James E. Cashman","Okay, well, we clearly, clearly we see -- I mean, clearly, yes, that is a growth area. It's about that range where it's in the high-single digits to mid to the low -- and, I'm sorry, the high single digits to the -- around the 10% range. Again, with any of the energy things, they tend to bob and weave sometimes on if there's a problem with a nuclear plant somewhere, if the price of oil goes a certain way, I mean, so there tends to add that in. Now the issue is that there's an awful lot of the oil industry that is still somewhat blacksmith and kind of this has been way it's historically been done. However, you're getting the new kind of problems that hadn't been -- probably hadn't been solved before and we talked about some of those in the past, increased drilling, grilling for, if you will, less desirable forms of crude. We're even seeing things that are along the lines of -- you wouldn't link these in normally, but the whole concept of if oil's being drilled a couple of miles down in the ocean instead of pumping up oil, sand and water, processing it and doing a lot of the processing of it on the ocean floor such that the energy you're using to raise up the stuff is only the end product you really want. Well, when you have that, you've got all sorts of electronics, wireless, all sorts of things that are going on there. So really we're seeing the emergence of new kind of product. In terms of the competition, really not a lot there. But we will run into some areas where the science of geologics and that actually entered the picture too and then it's a series of more niche people that probably most people haven't heard of and we haven't heard of in the past and go in. So if you look at that, that's really -- apart from that, there's always been -- there's still latent competition in the single physics kind of environment, a lot of those are just maintenance of status quo type of environments. But there seems to be a lot of interest from the research side now. And I think it's really aimed at the place of their doing things in different ways in different places than historically they had. I think when the old drilling above ground and things like that, there's really not a whole lot of change in that. But a lot of these other areas are what's percolating the interest.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Got it. And then one quick question for Maria. The Esterel revenue contribution, we're just trying to kind of gauge that rough -- organic rough rate. Do you have any color on that or we can catch that, but I was just wondering if you wanted to toss in there?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, for the year, it's going to be approximately about $20 million -- yes, over $20 million.","James E. Cashman","Over $20 million. And the only thing we'll say is without it, it's been a little bit in advance of our internal projections. So in general, we're pretty pleased on that. If you recall, though, one thing we did was we started with a -- as opposed to just opening it up to every account, every salesperson because we didn't want to swamp the support infrastructure that we had or disrupt the business that was already done. We picked the target list of the prequalified account and that actually turned out to be a very good progression for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schappel of Benchmark.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Jim, in the prior question, I believe you touched on your cloud offerings. I was wondering if you could give us a few more details of how you're seeing cloud impact your markets? And what you've done and what your guys are actually doing in the cloud?","James E. Cashman","Well, bottom line is it's really, it's one of the things that we want to prep for. Really I'd have to say, it really doesn't impact on our markets a whole lot right now. There's a lot of things that still technologically it's really well-suited to e-mail and personal productivity and sales force automation kind of activities. But long term, there's no doubt that this is going to be something that is at least an interesting adjunct to the business. Now I'd say that the good news at least we think from our standpoint is that we architected the software such that it serves our customers today but it immediately transplants into any kind of a large-scale cloud proliferation, and that's how we've been able to operate with these interconnect layers and the high-performance computing. And that actually is really the way that most of our major customers are using it right now is that they really, they've got their own internal cloud, but it's behind the safety of their firewall, they control the bandwidth, they control the prioritization of processing, things like that. In other words, they can provide a sustainable, predictable way for that to do it. But the fact is we want to make sure the software would actually be able to run in those environments. And in fact, we're even thinking of hybrid environment where people would be utilizing a baseline of capability internally, but then if they had surge capacities that they need, they'd be able to go out and actually utilize external and internal cloud symbiotically. Apart from that, the only other touch point we have in there is that almost over 10 years, we've had Software-as-a-Service offering and for the reasons I mentioned earlier, it's one -- it's used sporadically, but it's not one that our people are using as the mainstay. With that in mind, though, we're still basically upgrading, if you will, the store front and looking at different -- there's a number of different commercialization models and really, each one depends on the manner in which the customer wants to utilize the software, whether it's a regular stream, whether it's sporadic, whether it's in spurts, things like that. So it's one of those things that we definitely need to prepare for, but it's also not a broad scale at least for full-scale industrial strength kind of applications.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then one final question here. In your prepared presentation, I believe you called out problems in China, particularly with the state-owned enterprises. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what your overall businesses is in China as a percent of your revenue?","Maria T. Shields","Not China, individually, but I will comment, Mark, relative to the China environment. A significant portion of our direct and indirect business in China relates to the state-owned enterprises. And we definitely saw a lot of activity. However, we also saw, I would call, a noted slowdown relative to their willingness to pull the trigger to close deals.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Halter, Great Lakes Review.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Wondering if you could provide a little more background about the ANSYS 15.0, whether or not that'll be released to everyone at the same time? And if anyone's currently using it and things of that nature?","James E. Cashman","Well, [indiscernible], we've got customers who have been using it in preview mode, I mean, much like some people might call it a beta program, it's not exactly that process. People have been utilizing that, but we'll be announcing -- we'll be releasing that actually next month. And then, of course, there are different markets where there may be certain things in terms of localization and product launches and things like that, that we have to move out beyond that. So yes, but it'll -- it's this year.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. And there's obviously been a lot of interest in this whole 3D printing area, and just wanted to get your thoughts on that and how ANSYS software may or may not be working with that type of product area.","James E. Cashman","Yes, it's actually working together right now. I mean, if you think about it the -- well, 3D printing, of course, when you say that, it means multiple things, some of which is creating a pseudomodel of something with different materials that doesn't really match in. In some cases, it's also -- there'll be rapid construction for low-volume manufacturing that allows things to be done with the existing materials. The bottom line is to us, it really doesn't matter and in some ways a proliferation of 3D printing of real product actually tends to help us because again, the whole point of the value of the 3D printing for at least as a manufacturing -- well, let's call it additive manufacturing is it allows people to get something out quickly. Well, you don't want to rush something out quickly then you just have to send it to a laboratory and spend a certain amount of time testing it. In most cases, the people that are getting the most out of 3D printing are actually verifying the design virtually such that when it comes out, it's got a much higher probability of meeting the overall requirements. So I mean, it's net-net, it's really a positive. If anything, it's a positive for us. Greg?","Operator","Mr. Cashman, that does conclude the Q&A session, if you'd like to make any closing remarks.","James E. Cashman","Well, okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for the questions and for the attendance. So I guess we've kind of covered a lot of this, but in closing, our emphasis for the remainder of the year is going to be no surprise here, but execution, customer development and just the internal disciplines as we map out the year. Again, we're excited about the opportunity [indiscernible] for the remainder of 2013 and especially beyond. But again, there are going to be challenges along the way. So again, fortunate -- I say this a lot, but probably can't even say it enough, is that we've got a strong foundation that's built on over 40 years of dedication. It's combined with the focus on technological expansion, execution, growth, customer engagements, basically allow us to go after those changes. So again, as I said earlier, we believe that if the economic environment improves in the future, we're well-positioned to be able to achieve even more robust financial targets and continue to be propelled by that really strong combination of a sustainable vision, I think a business model that's gone through a lot of -- gotten through a lot of different economic cycles, but at the heart of it all, I mean, we've got the greatest customers on the planet, good partners, strong technology and of course, the employees that have been part of this for a number of years. So thanks to all of them and thanks to you for joining us this morning.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note that today's event is being recorded.","At this time I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Jim Cashman, President and CEO. Sir, please go ahead.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Good morning. And thank you, everyone, for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial results. Before we get started I'll also introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, and she'll take us through our Safe Harbor statement. So, Maria?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks documents have been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to our Q4 and fiscal year 2015 financial results and business update, as well as our current Q1 and fiscal year 2016 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I'd like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website.","Additionally the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call and in the prepared remarks we will be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K.","With that, Jim, I'll now turn the call back to you.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Maria. Actually I'd like to start with a recap of the results that the ANSYS \u2013 the team achieved in 2015. And to frame this let's go back to, if you recall from our Investor Day in June of 2015, we laid out a number of key objectives for the year. We set goals of achieving non-GAAP revenue growth of 8% to 10% in constant currency, achieving strong margins and cash flow, high rates of recurring revenue, and continued growth in our deferred revenue and backlog.","We also committed to deploy capital to invest in our business for the long term, continue to pursue attractive M&A opportunities, and return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. So I can say that we did in fact achieve all of those goals with the exception of one, which we narrowly missed.","So first, our non-GAAP revenue growth for the year in constant currency was 7%, a result of our Q4 revenue coming in a little weaker than we had anticipated in early November. But as we'll talk about in a moment, the growth is susceptible to mix shifts toward time-based licenses and the VSOE effect of enterprise license agreements. And both of these are good long-term factors for us.","Our non-GAAP operating margin was 47.5%, slightly higher than projected. Our operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was 18% higher than last year's Q4. And we generated over $367 million for the year. Our recurring revenue for both the quarter and the year were solid at 70% and 72%, respectively. And we closed out the year with another record-high deferred revenue in backlog balance of over $500 million.","Okay. So we also accelerated the rate of returning capital to our stockholders through share repurchases. In total we repurchased 3.8 million shares of stock in 2015. Now while our primary focus is and remains on growing our business, both organically and through acquisitions, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. And I think you can \u2013 you'll see an example of this also included in our earnings release is that our board recently increased the authorized share repurchase pool back to 5 million shares.","So on the acquisition front during 2015 we acquired Gear Design, Delcross, and Newmerical Technologies. All important technology acquisitions, but with minimal revenue impact in 2015. These acquisitions, along with the groundbreaking technology we introduced last month in ANSYS version 17, they all contribute to expanding our broad portfolio of industry-leading solutions and also further distance us from the competition.","So now let's take a moment to highlight a few things from the fourth quarter. While we delivered within our target range, we did not achieve the full level of revenue production that we were expecting as we headed into the fourth quarter. However, and it \u2013 our revenue was adversely impacted by a transaction with over $6 million of perpetual revenue, the large majority of which was deferred over a 2-year period. Now this is an example of the short-term VSOE effect that I mentioned earlier. But it's also reflected in our good bookings and our deferred numbers. So good for the long term.","There was continued weakness in the semiconductor industry. Actually if you recall we spoke about that on our last call, one of the earlier mentioners of that. And there were some pockets of weakness in Asia Pacific and Europe that also contributed to revenue growth of 4% in constant currency in Q4. And I might say the weaker than planned Asia result had a more pronounced impact on the paid-up license line. So also keep in mind that last year we reported 14% growth in perpetual licenses, creating a strong comparable. While the revenue was at the lower end of our range, our sales bookings growth was the highest it's been all year and grew in double digits in constant currency.","We closed Q4 with notable contributions from two of our largest markets. Revenue grew 10% in Germany and 9% in Japan in constant currency. Now North America and Asia-Pac both saw revenue grow at 5%. And we continue to see weakness in the rest of Europe, which had a 2% growth overall.","For the year we saw pockets of strength from the performance of our three largest markets. Japan, North America, and Germany grew 9%, 10%, and 11% respectively in constant currency. Now this is significant, because these are the areas where we have the most advanced customer relationships, and where we have our most experienced sales and support infrastructure. So we would have expected our go-to-market evolution to unfold more quickly in these areas. So this is a very encouraging validation.","Now from a high level perspective this was a respectable quarter, even in the face of weakening economic indicators and off a strong comparable in Q4 of 2014.","Sales bookings growth outpaced revenue growth. This was driven both by a number of enterprise agreements that were predominantly closed in North America and the healthy increase in time based licenses. This contributed to an 8% uptick in the deferred revenue in backlog to $504 million, as compared to $468 million in Q4 of 2014.","And as we previously highlighted through 2015 these deals, they tend to add a certain level of volatility around the timing of closure, the impact on revenue recognition, and even the size of the deals. But we foresee more of these types of deals in 2016, which is good for the long term health of the business. It's a net plus.","Recurring revenue for the year as I mentioned was a healthy 72%, which was higher than 2014 and on a larger revenue base. We really do \u2013 I mean we've been saying this for years. It's been part of our model. But the consistent ability to maintain a solid base of recurring revenue is one of the hallmarks of that business model. And a foundation that's proven to be a real differentiator and a stabilizer for navigating tough economic cycles. Now we're also \u2013 we're seeing increased penetration within our broad customer base. And the pipeline and new opportunities they continue to improve, even amidst the continued challenging economic environment. We're seeing growing interest.","Also the procurement process remains protracted and a lot more diligent on our customer side. So there's little doubt of the long-term opportunity as evidenced by the \u2013 basically the continuing multi-year momentum both in existing and new customers.","But in the short term I'll add this caveat, because even with this increasing interest, there's also cause for continued vigilance in \u2013 basically you look at all the recent economic forecasts and financial market conditions, they become markedly more volatile over the last few weeks. And this has had a dampening influence on customers' current buying cycles. So we tried to factor this into our current guidance. And we'll continue to do so going forward.","In 2016 we're continuing to selectively ramp up elements of our customer facing organization in response to the available opportunity, both short and long term. And we're also continuing to invest in upgrading our business systems and infrastructure to support the growth of our business over the long haul.","So just with those opening few points, I'll now turn it over to Maria Shields, our CFO, to provide a more detailed look at our financials. So, Maria?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Okay. Thanks, Jim. So for the next few minutes I'm going to add some additional perspective on our Q4 and 2015 performance, touch on some key financial highlights, and also go through our outlook for Q1 and 2016.","As Jim highlighted we continued to execute on most phases of our business. We saw gross margins of 89% for the quarter and the full year. And strong operating margins of 47.5% for both the fourth quarter and the year.","Currency continued to be a challenge in the fourth quarter with a negative $13 million impact on revenue and even greater on sales bookings and $8 million at the operating income line. The full year results were negatively impacted by $66 million and $39 million.","Looking ahead into Q1 and the full year 2016, we're currently targeting a gross profit margin in the 88% to 89% range and operating margins of 45% for Q1 and 47% to 48% for the full year. Our plan for 2016 calls for Q1 to be our lowest margin quarter and for improvement as we make our way through the year, not unlike what we just delivered in 2015.","I also want to highlight that in 2016, we expect to see an uptick in our effective tax rate from the 30.6% that we reported in 2015 to 32% to 33%. And as we have previously discussed, this is largely a result of the expiration of a prior tax benefit from a subsidiary restructuring that had provided us with meaningful tax savings each year for the last 5 years.","So as we enter 2016, while the macro economy is increasingly uncertain, we believe that it is vital to our long-term strategy to continue to make investments in areas of the business that we deem to be critical for the future. Some of those include, first and foremost, strengthening our global direct sales and field support teams, continuing to invest in R&D so that we can maintain our technology leadership, and continuing to evolve the business infrastructure to support improved productivity, automation, and our future growth plans.","So no doubt, the increased level of volatility in the overall macro environment has presented challenges to not only us but our customers, since we initiated our outlook for 2016 back in early November. Given our current sales outlook, which continues to factor in both uncertainties around the timing of a return to growth in certain geographies as well as the predictability of the timing of closing sales, particularly larger deals, we believe that disciplined spending will continue to play an important role not only in our own business in 2016 but in our customers' as well.","If we move onto the balance sheet. We closed in a very strong position that affords us flexibility and a solid foundation to support our business in the upcoming year. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $785 million, of which 69% is held domestically. We finished 2015 with total capital expenditures of $16 million for the year. And based on everything that we are planning currently, we're looking at CapEx in the $20 million to $25 million range. And as we did see in 2015 our ultimate level of spending in this area will be managed through a combination of pursuing those critical projects, but also balancing the remainder against the overall health of the business and the macroeconomic climate.","As we outlined in this morning's press release, we've initiated our outlook for Q1 with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $224 million to $232 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.74 to $0.77.","With respect to fiscal year 2016 we're revising our prior outlook to factor in a more cautious perspective on the overall economy, since we initially provided our outlook in early November. This translates to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $995 million to $1.03 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.53 to $3.69.","As we've been discussing throughout the year, we're continuing to work through and make progress on various parts of our evolving go-to-market strategy, some of which include an increasing number of enterprise agreements, a shift in certain customer preferences toward time-based licenses and the very early stage of our cloud launch.","We believe that we've made good initial progress on these efforts in 2014. But no doubt we have a lot of work ahead. We see that these trends will continue to evolve over the course of the year. And as such we're assuming an increase in revenue and earnings growth as we progress throughout 2016.","While other companies in our space are attempting to force customers towards a preferred licensing model, we're focusing on increasing customer adoption of our Workbench platform and our broad portfolio of solutions. To achieve this we're maintaining our historical approach, which offers our customers a range of options to fit their licensing preferences and the realities of their business. While this flexibility may inject some additional variability in our results in the short term or in any single quarter, we believe that these expanded customer relationships, combined with the ongoing maturation of the sales investments that we've made throughout 2015, should continue to reflect in the long-term rewards of growth in sales bookings, revenue, deferred revenue in backlog, and most importantly customer relationships that should continue to grow for many years.","Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and 2016 are contained in the prepared remarks document.","So with that, operator, we'll now open up the phone lines to take some questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session. We also please limit \u2013 we ask you to please limit yourselves to one question and a single follow-up. Our first question today comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. It's Darren Jue on for Sterling. I'm just wondering if you could talk about what parts of the product portfolio are you see the greatest pressure from? In particular in the energy and industrial areas?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually could you clarify? I didn't know if you were asking \u2013 I thought you started off asking about the product portfolio. And then you \u2013 and then I thought you might be talking about industry. So could I \u2013 I mean I want to make sure I answer the right...","Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. I mean \u2013 yeah. So the question is on product portfolio, but to the extent that you're seeing any particular pressure in energy and industrial areas?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC","(16:43)","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well it \u2013 yeah. It tends to comp around the major \u2013 the emphasis points. So for instance in the semiconductor area, we're more likely to see that for instance in the more electronic-oriented and semiconductor-oriented products that we have along those lines, with more minimal impact if you will on the major elements of the structural and fluids business.","Now when you move into the industrial and energy \u2013 and some of this also gets into what's happened with the general approach of the mining and commodity based markets and what \u2013 and how that ripples through the off-highway kind of market. And basically you can pick up a paper any day and see by major customer names \u2013 or major company names that that plays through. Now those tend to be slightly more \u2013 actually more pronounced on the structural and the fluids part. I mean just lumping these into broader classifications.","Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just to follow up, I mean coming out of the last downturn, you were able to manage margins back to a 50% level by getting some efficiencies on the sales and marketing line. And I know you're not guiding to a 50% margin for the year. But I'm just wondering if it's fair to think that maybe you could outperform in terms of margins in the current environment, if you start to see that you're not getting the return on your sales and marketing efforts as you move through the year.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well l think the important thing to mention is the first part, is that when we look at other downturns and similar recent downturns is, we were by far, far more resilient than most companies in our space or in the market generally. And as such we actually even still grew in revenue, albeit at a much lower rate at those times. However, we never at that time guided to higher margins. It's just that because we weathered that storm better based on our overall business model, the higher amounts of revenue that did come through that we were still able to take into account had the elevating aspect of margins. But we were \u2013 and at that time we were talking about holding the high margins. And they actually elevated into that point.","And I'd say that that's probably going to be a hallmark of most kind of economic downturn or softening cycles, where our recurring base and the solid customer base we have provides that good ongoing baseline of revenue. But I think that the things that we've done from the product standpoint and the preparatory standpoint in our go-to-market model is that that allows to \u2013 basically allows us to harvest any of the upside when it occurs.","The other thing is that again we can't \u2013 we really can't emphasize as much, because we have been talking about this the last couple calls, is the concept of as customers are starting to get into the very first entries of the cloud based \u2013 and all those people are starting to shift. But we've been talking a lot about the time-based license. We saw how our time-based licenses actually grew at a higher rate, but \u2013 and that's good for the long-term deferred balance. But it has a dampening effect of course on the short-term thing. So it's more of an appearance kind of thing.","And the overall movement of enterprise license agreements also tends to add that volatility. The other thing is with enterprise license agreements, we also get the situation where, because they cover a broader range of products, even if we have a small percentage that are related to products that don't have VSOE very often, we have to put the entire order into a time deferred kind of basis. And that's what happened.","I mean I even signaled \u2013 I even talked about the one \u2013 just taking one order and that was a $6 million order that had to be time deferred. I mean you can pretty much do the math yourself and determine how that can help drive the long term and show strong bookings growth, while it has that temporary dampening effect in the short term.","So I guess the bottom line is we're not guiding toward those things. But if the same things happen as before, and we are \u2013 we have the continued strength, relative strength in the top line, because we're gearing around that other assumption, that naturally filters down to the bottom line disproportionately.","Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First is, are you guys seeing that customers are preferring more leases than perpetual licenses?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Yes. Now the thing is as Maria mentioned in her comments, we've seen these trends \u2013 but keep in mind for years we've had a mix of basically cloud type of offerings, online type of offerings, of lease and of perpetual licenses. So we've always had that.","We feel it was more important to focus on providing flexibility for \u2013 in these early stages for customers to introduce and get involved in those kind of applications. So we still see that. We just see that the buying shift has been tending to shift a little bit more on that.","Now that happens at a very personal level on a company by company basis. So this is not like necessarily a herd mentality, but we are seeing shifts. And those numbers were borne out in the relative strength of the time-based license versus \u2013 going on. Now we also \u2013 on the large deals that we're going into also is \u2013 we've been seeing an increasing amount of that. And companies that traditionally were doing that on a paid-up line. It doesn't take more than a handful of those as we've seen to change the results.","And then keep in mind again this VSOE thing. I'll say one thing. When we encounter these things, when we get a big order with customers, we treat that as very, very good. And if we find out there's a VSOE issue, we don't sit there and try to artificially do something to optically make the current quarter at the expense of a long-term growth and the customer disruption.","So overall it's a net good thing for us if you look at the building of the business. But that flexibility sometimes is what can also drive the additional VSOE. I don't know, Maria? Do you have anything to add to that?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yeah. And so too \u2013 and some this lends itself to the earlier margin question. So as that business that traditionally would have been recorded as perpetual in the current quarter gets recognized ratably over \u2013 in the case of the one deal that we mentioned a 2-year period \u2013 that no doubt is going to depress the margins, as opposed to how we may have historically recorded it even back in 2009.","But as Jim said we're not trying to do anything unnatural to either change the customer preferences or to pull those deals in to make the current quarter appear better than it is. Because obviously that will have long-term impacts on the future cash flows if you will.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. Then the question is with Siemens buying CD-adapco and now Siemens becoming second-largest simulation provider, do you see any impact from this acquisition they have made?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, no, no, no. I mean not really. I mean you've got good technology and good companies that abound in general. Basically for the last 10 years, 15 years CAD companies have bought simulation companies. And in general I mean it's tended to be neutral to a net plus for ANSYS, because in general we're agnostic when it comes to those overall CAD environments, which come \u2013 which tend to come and go.","So it's just one of the natural \u2013 just kind of like the natural flow of life in this industry. And if you roll the calendar back 15 years, you'll find many times that these things came in place. So it's just part of life but nothing unnatural. And really nothing unexpected. You have...","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yeah. No. Well one thing I will add. It does validate in our minds not only that the strategy that we've laid out for 15 years is the right strategy. And that simulation is in fact becoming a more critical aspect of what, not only Siemens, but other of our competitors are seeing in the marketplace. So as Jim said, this has happened for 20 plus years in our industry. And our job is to continue to invest in R&D and to acquire technologies that continue to differentiate us from the rest of the pack.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks. Just the last follow-up, housekeeping question, what is your 2016 cash flow guidance?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","We are looking at currently somewhere in the $355 million to $385 million range.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Why would it be at the midpoint slot, just year-over-year?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Some of it's going to be \u2013 we had a very strong \u2013 you saw 18% growth in cash flow in Q4. And some of it will depend on the timing of when some of these deals close. So if they close early in the year, you'll see improvement. If they close later, then it may impact flow over into 2017.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anil Doradla from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, Jim, one very fundamental question that I'm trying to reconcile. So obviously you had record backlog and deferred revenue, which was great news.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","So over the 3 months when I look at \u2013 or how you looked at the 2016 outlook. You certain \u2013 had a certain growth rate. Three months later we've got this great backlog and deferred revenue. But you're tweaking your 2016 growth rates downwards.","So I'm trying to reconcile. I mean even if I look at it, the backlog increased by $70 million, and the \u2013 at the midpoint, the top line comes down by $17 million, something like that. So how do I reconcile these two moving parts?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well the bottom \u2013 the first and foremost is the macro. But second of all I think the \u2013 some assumption of the buying preferences that we talked about. Again good long term and over the short term. So bottom line is the good relationship is \u2013 or the good thing is we've got a really strong relationship with our customers.","And if you recall we actually were pretty good at \u2013 in the anticipation in the downturn a few years ago in the 2009, 2010 timeframe. And that came because of some relationship with the customer. But I mean, geez, even on the ride in today, picking up some of the latest forecast from Citigroup. And that was kind of echoing \u2013 that was just putting frosting on the cake of some of the things that we're already seeing.","But then you see that. And then how does that ripple through? First of all, customers are \u2013 they're going through purchases a lot more carefully and judiciously. Second of all, when they buy things they might be tending to buy maybe even the same amount of licenses. But now it's being spread over. So we get that, the multiple impact of what we saw for instance with the \u2013 just that one illustrative order I talked about was the $6 million one, which is core to be (29:05) \u2013 I mean you can do the math on that one. What does $6 million in a quarter mean, versus spreading it over 22, 24 different pay periods?","So it's really taking into account all of those factors and trying to give a real accurate picture of everything we're seeing. I mean in terms of the long term prospects, man, no, there's nothing changing there. I mean there are the things that we have to navigate, but everybody is going to have to navigate those type of things.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And as a follow-up, Jim, the ELA program was kicked in, some very good sectors.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","You talked about couple of dozens to 50 people I think, or something like that. Can you just give us an update and some color on how that's playing out? And how should that play out in 2016?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well I'll tell you. First of all, it's playing out very well. And second of all, I'll tell you we're learning. I mean because \u2013 and I'm just trying to be totally open with you on this. Is that first of all, I think we mentioned the very first one at the tail end of Q4 of like \u2013 of 2014, which by the way was part of the reason for that really tough comparable we were talking about. We projected a handful, mid-single digits of those going on in 2015. And that absolutely occurred.","Now we're seeing a significant increase going into double digits, numbers of those going on. But as I mentioned we're learning on these things too. So as you get to that broader base of customers, that's where we're finding out the things about \u2013 for deals of these size in this changing environment, what does that mean in terms of duration of contracts, multi-year contracts, augmentation with our cloud-type capabilities, broadening of the product line, all of those things. And keep in mind this is happening at the same time as all the economic reports are coming out and saying, hey, there's some increased volatility here.","So customers are making bigger, new relationship decisions with us at the same time the environmental factors are causing a little bit more cautious.","So that's what I meant by the learning process. And what that means in terms of how we structure these, because each time you to open up to a broader range of customers with these type of deals that really were unheard of before over the past time, it gets into a much broader range of contracting, delivery, additional things added on, and additional ways that we deliver that. So we're continuing to moderate that as we go forward.","And then as we also mentioned we wanted to come out the gates expecting this. So now we're getting to the point where we're now being able to take this into a slightly broader range of our sales and go-to-market.","Like I said we weren't just opening this up to everybody all at once and having chaos while we were learning. But we have some of those best practices already coming in play. So this is something that we see as going to be a continuing trend. And it's super good for the long term and building solid relationships with customers.","But it's one of those things that \u2013 most things that are really good, they don't happen with a snap of a finger. They build over time. And we want to make sure that they build in the right manner.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Maria, I'd just like to ask the original fourth quarter guidance, had you made any allowance for some ratable deals to get done and for some revenue to be shifted to the balance sheet when you provided the original guidance?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yeah. So we had provided guidance. And a portion of that deal we had in our forecast. It ended up coming in much bigger than we had forecasted, but that was in the upside.","Our \u2013 I would say as we went into Q4, our expectations for Asia were much stronger than where we finished. And unfortunately for us Asia still \u2013 as Jim highlighted on the call, Asia still has, particularly in the larger economies, preference for paid-ups. So when things don't cross the finish line in December, it disproportionately impacts that top line.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. And, Steve, as I mentioned before we could have \u2013 I mean we could have gone in and tried to take all that extra business that came in, which was significant, and say, oh my gosh, we had \u2013 and it wouldn't have been \u2013 it really wouldn't have meant anything long term to the customer, other than some frustration. And we'd still have the same good pace of business going forward \u2013 and going forward.","So again keeping with Maria's earlier comment, we just want to make sure that right now we create as few obstacles to the customers' financial procurement of the capabilities as possible. And knowing that it's \u2013 at the end of the day the real name for us is getting more people using more software. That really flattens it out over time. Because as they start to use it, they usually don't start to unuse it or stop using it. So it almost \u2013 it's always the platform that builds on, which again you've seen over the years and the building deferred and recurring base that we have going forward. So that's a constant (34:44). And also we didn't want to get into a situation of having to give up things for \u2013 if you will for just creating some smoke and mirrors.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Sure. Absolutely. And then in terms of \u2013 so the one TBL deal is very visible optically, because of the $6 million moving from the license line. Were there any other leased base TBL deals in the period?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Oh yeah.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But keep in mind there through our entire history, there have been \u2013 those things always tended to happen at a lower level. And there were some gives and there were some takes. There were some plusses and minuses.","So we were \u2013 we just focused on this one illustrative one, because it is very significant. There were others that were in there, but I'm sure there were also others that might have gone the other direction.","But the net trend overall was kind of \u2013 is pretty undeniable when you look at the relative growth in the leased space and along those lines. And then all I can add is anecdotally I know of at least two or three other customers as we go forward that traditionally were that. And they're looking more at going into the time base, as they go through whatever financial decisions are on their plate.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. The first one is a housekeeping. And then I'll have a second question relating to it. Do you have the sequential impact on deferred from foreign exchange? Do you have that number handy?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hang on a minute. I'd say it's close but not handy.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","$2.2 million.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Looks like a little over $2 million. Yeah.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sorry?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I got $2 million.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","$2.2 million, Ross.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Negative, right?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yes.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Oh yeah.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So my question relates to trying to adjust basically for all the puts and takes between how your contracting, whether business is going into deferred, whether it's going into backlog. And when I look at trailing 12-month current bookings, that's bookings to be recognized in the next 12 months, I see 6% growth. And then I look at your revenue guidance for next year and it's 7%. There's probably some FX in there. So it's probably closer to 8% plus.","So I'm just trying to understand what drives the conviction in the higher revenue growth in 2016, when it looks like your trailing 12 month current bookings is closer to 6% growth?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","So, Ross, I would say it's based on what we know today, two important things. One is the strength of the pipeline. Two is we are still convinced that the investments that we made in 2015 in ramping up the sales capacity are in a maturation phase. And that they are going to yield increased productivity in 2016. And the strong bookings growth that we just saw in Q4 are three things that give us a lot of confidence.","And as Jim has been mentioning, these conversations that we're having with some of our long-standing customers about expanding our presence and our footprint across their enterprise give us a lot of conviction about the long term opportunities that we have with those customers to migrate well beyond the current installed base that we have in those customers.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the only thing I'd add \u2013 I mean again the \u2013 I absolutely agree with those points. But the general pipelines are increasing, but also the targeted number of \u2013 as we move into that ramping up, which we're trying to manage the growth of, the ELA increase, those tend to be major ones. And of course then we have to factor in the timing and the closing of those things.","So you've got some very strong rifle shot anecdote information from the ELAs. You've got the general broad based from the amalgamation of the pipelines. And then you've got the intuitive aspect of that sales team that we were building up through the course of 2015 that we admittedly said it takes 1 to 2 years to get to a full \u2013 well not a full, but I mean a really strong maturation of that thing. And then you counter all of that against the macro backdrop, which also is factored into the pipeline and forecasts. And that's what it nets out.","But if you look at the growth of that and the general path of bookings outpacing revenue for the quarter and the year, and doing it significantly in the latter part of the year, I mean those are all the factors that basically that went into our calculations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Sure.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","I'd like to get maybe really clear on some of these license definitions. And then I've got one follow-up. So, Jim, when you're using the term time-based licenses, are you using that synonymously with lease licenses? And if not what do you mean by that?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Yeah.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And then related to that question, if I could just add, on the enterprise agreements. Could you please help us by characterizing those deals? To the extent you can generalize.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","How do they typically split between paid upfront and lease portions of those deals?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Yeah.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And to what extent are those \u2013 you have VSOE issues sometimes in those deals?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well the first part is that yes I am \u2013 I guess I am conflating terms. So I use time-based license, because traditionally we used lease to be like a 12 \u2013 a typical kind of annual license or 12-month lease. To me a time-based license is a period-based thing, whether it's 12 months or it's part of those 24 months to 36 months. Maybe I should've defined that more clearly in the beginning. That's some of internal stuff that we're using.","Now on the ELA thing. It tends to have some general characteristics that then can get perturbed by individuals. ELA is inconsistent. Perpetual time-based licenses, they can also even have some service associated with them. Like if you will with embedded support and the like or certain services. On top of it with those that \u2013 no matter whether it is perpetual or lease, you can run into VSOE issues. So and these \u2013 my finance colleagues here are a lot more okay with these.","I mean I think this is kind of \u2013 it's very interesting when you get in you've got something. If you combine it only takes a small percentage of product added into an ELA, which are inherently broad-based in product to create a VSOE issue, where upon everything in that order has to be ratable. Even if traditionally this one chunk was \u2013 had no VSOE, and it was all time-based, and it was like a few percent of the order and then the bulk of it is the same traditional perpetual.","Everything has to be \u2013 and correct me if I'm missing some nuances here. But it all gets applied over those things.","So the bottom line is those tend to be \u2013 so even I'd say it's a mix, it's a matter of preference when customers decide if they want their ELAs to consist of perpetual or lease. And right now at small levels they can provide \u2013 they can have lots of choices. They can mix things in there. But once those things are put together, then you can still have something applied that still makes \u2013 forces them to be ratable.","Maria, would you want to add anything?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","I think that's enough. And then we can see if Steve has anything...","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","...he wants to ask specifically for clarification.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Sounds good. Okay. Thanks. That is helpful. So I'm going to move on then just to my second and last question, which is about the ratable portions of the ELA in conjunction with the time-based licenses overall. Is this possible to tell us ideally for 2015 and 2016 what you're expecting? How much recurring or ratable revenue you had in total, beyond just the lease revenue that you recognized? In other words the contribution from cloud to revenue, plus the contribution from the ratable portion of the ELAs? And then for 2016 is that going up by quite a bit? Are we talking 1 point, 2 points, 4 points? Any sense of how big or small this is?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The bottom line is we're at the very early stages of this transition. So yeah. I could say with a pretty good certainty it's going up. Now how much? Those are things that we're really trying to, as we proliferate this through the broader customer base. So in other words we don't have \u2013 right now we've got maybe 5, 10, 15 of these. And they're big. And they can perturb the model by a couple of percentage points. Necessarily saying that this automatically ripples to a user base of tens of thousands of customers, and to what degree and how quickly, we're not at that predictive point in terms of being able to go.","However, we are \u2013 as we've mentioned before we are starting to construct some of these models as the ELA concept becomes a little bit more mature with that. As the cloud offering itself gets a little bit more mature. And as some of these buying preferences change. But there are a lot of moving pieces. And we've tried to consolidate all of those into what I think shows a pretty good stable long-term picture. But it does provide a little bit more variability over that crossover period.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","So, Steve, if I can add to that. If this will help you in building your model, our 2016 model for ourselves, trying to factor in all of these pieces, some of which we don't have certainty or precision around, because these deals are kind of \u2013 each one is customer dependent. We're looking at 58% in the software license line and 42% of revenue in the maintenance and service line.","And I will also add one thing. I tried to make this in my comments, but our cloud initiation is still in its very early stages. So there is not material revenue in either 2015 or 2016 that is specific to cloud.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. That is very helpful, and I'll look forward to talking to you all in the callback. Thank you.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Question first about Q4. First, your North America revenues were down sequentially from Q3, which seems unusual. And the question is if that was solely related to the $6 million VSOE issue you mentioned? Or there was something in addition that caused that sequential decline?","Also in Q4 your R&D revenues \u2013 sorry, R&D expenses were down slightly year over year and more so sequentially from Q3. And I'm wondering if there was mostly a currency effect in there? Or if there was in fact something you did organically to change R&D in Q4?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So if you \u2013 I mean if you look at it, no. That's a sheer thing in numbers. And I think you can see that when you roll that out and project that over an entire year and see that North America...","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Double digit.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...was still in that 10%, 11% range. So what you had is \u2013 I mean there were a number of factors. But if you look at three major ones. First of all, in the comparable that the huge North American-centric deal with Cummins that was mentioned in part of that \u2013 the comparable. Now Q3 you've got \u2013 we talked about another one. That was actually something that shifted forward. And so originally it was thought of in the Q4 thing. And that wound up in Q3. And then in Q4 we had the one deal where a large chunk of perpetual revenue drifted out. All of those things were factors in the \u2013 in that 5% for North America.","But again projecting it over an entire year is probably the best way to look at it as an overall trend rate. And by the way we saw the same picture, albeit in the other major markets, which were like if you will that first wave of our go-to-market with Japan and Germany. It's just that we didn't have those big perturbations based on the huge orders. Does that...","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then the R&D question?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh I'm sorry. Yeah.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","I mean can you repeat it, Jay?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Oh sure. Your R&D was down fairly substantially from Q3, which is somewhat unusual in that case as well. And down a little bit year over year. Was that currency? Or was something else going on in terms of R&D expenses?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","No. I think most of it is, Jay, related to variable compensation.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. Looking forward, one of the things that we've seen from a number of your peers in engineering software is that they are working to consolidate or repackage their portfolios, not necessarily kill products off, but perhaps simplify into more suites and simplify the selections presented to customers.","And my question there for you now with R17 is \u2013 and given the overall multi-physics strategy, is whether you've begun to do anything like that? Or are planning to do anything like that in terms of consolidating or repackaging across the various business units? And if so how might that affect any leasing or potential of pricing?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well the bottom line is, yeah, we've been doing it. As we typically do, we do these things in waves. So the very first one was actually, first of all, simplifying each product set if you will, so the mechanical, the fluids, the electronics, bringing those into overall simplicity. Because we had \u2013 over the years we had had multiple tiers of that.","Secondarily, as we then look to rationalize some of the add-on technologies if you will, the tech tuck-in acquisitions that we've been doing, as opposed to having a number of those. So those tend to get incorporated into each of their parent orbitals if you will. Then the second part of that is, okay now combining those into \u2013 now we've always had a multi-physics package. But combining those into packages. But we've even gone one step further for markets when they proved to have a certain amount of centroid of effort.","So I will talk of one in specific, where you take the overall drive in everything from electronics, semiconductor, to Internet of Things. And the whole concept of chip package system type of simulation. Where you \u2013 traditionally there were individual tools applied by different groups and those kind of things. But bringing those together. And then also combining not only the pure electronic side of those. But all of the \u2013 if you will the structural, the thermal, the cooling and flow, all of those types of capabilities.","Because one thing that there's \u2013 that's really a hot thing right now is that as people started to instrument things for the Internet of Things, it's not just one thing to have electronics that work and send the signals and do the readings and everything. It's important that the electronics survive the same kind of harsh and hostile environments that the products that they're mounted on are able to do.","So those are probably about four very significant things. But just suffice it to say the simple answer is yes. That is a general trending. Because if anything we probably have a potentially broader issue, given the fact that we've got by far the broadest product offering. And trying to simplify that overall is a really, really key aspect for us.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yeah. Jay, what I'll also say is as the result of some of these things, we're not planning to do a significant shift between the relationship between the perpetual and lease pricing. But we're trying to harmonize it across the broad portfolio. So there's more consistency across that portfolio and across some of these new offerings.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Bersey from Mitsubishi UFJ. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephen D. Bersey - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi.","Stephen D. Bersey - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","Just wondering if you noticed any trends on your leasing side, maybe lengths of leases expanding or contracting? And also feedback during the pipeline reviews of that. Did you get any feedback from the sales force?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","Stephen D. Bersey - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","As far as customers that had planned on getting a license, but then snapped over to a lease?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Oh yeah. We're absolutely getting that. We're seeing that even heading into 2016. There are \u2013 and not surprisingly it's happened in some of the major geographies, most notably Japan and North America. But we are seeing those things.","Now one thing I would say is that I'd say in general, in aggregate, the trends are toward longer term. But parsing down what part of that is by individual customer versus what's being influenced by the increasing number of ELAs that are inherently multi-year, I don't have a precise answer on that.","And for the companies that are basically going from perpetual to lease, no matter what timeframe they elect for on that, it's not like we're comparing somebody that used to do a 12-month lease now going to a 24- or 36-month lease. Someone who used to do perpetual going to any kind of lease, which in and of itself is a fairly significant kind of question.","But I'd say in general if you look at it right now, sweet spot is typically about 2 to 3 years. I'd say \u2013 yeah. And in general sometimes people will even try to look at both of your things, even though the financial commitment will stretch out into years four and five, albeit \u2013 and when that happens we don't count that, because that's really not a contractual order at that point in time. Did I cover every \u2013 did we cover each point of your...","Stephen D. Bersey - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","Indeed. Yeah, and maybe just for ...","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Stephen D. Bersey - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","... Europe, looks like Germany is trending nicely here. But wondering if you have any color on France, the U.K.? And please let us know if you've been over there. I know you traveled a lot recently.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah. I was actually \u2013 I've been in the U.K. twice the last 3 months as a matter of fact. And actually France only once. But those obviously \u2013 mathematically you can see that those are a little bit tougher areas.","You look at \u2013 I'd say that in particular, part of our U.K. business is seeing some of the stuff. Even though our North American business was strong, because it's a broad base of things, we mentioned before the Texas area and the impact of the \u2013 of oil and energy, had an impact there. Not an inconsequential part of our U.K. business of course is North Sea and that type of thing. So there's an element of that. So that was felt along those lines.","France had some difficulties. Oddly enough they're smaller parts of the business, but yet some of our \u2013 a couple of our Mediterranean areas actually did pretty nice performance. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag. But holistically it's been a little bit more sedate. It's just that \u2013 when you get \u2013 basically what it gets down to more is not necessarily country by country, but where you've got the major multinational companies that are competing on the global stage. They're competing globally. They're not competing just in Europe. And there just tends to be a higher clump of those in the markets like Germany. That's really more of what we're seeing, as opposed to what's the GNP of any individual country.","Stephen D. Bersey - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schappel from Benchmark. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, switching gears for a little bit. With the R17 release it appears that the company's marketing materials are promoting as kind of a meaningful step change in capabilities, rather than just nice, linear incremental improvements.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC","I was wondering if that's way you would characterize the release in functionality? And if that is the case, maybe you could just highlight just a few of the significant features in the R17 release...","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well...","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC","...that you think will catch the attention of engineers.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well I think the main thing \u2013 I think the key thing is \u2013 and first of all I'll just say that every release that we've had the last 10 years has been sequentially significantly better than the previous one. And I'd be really disappointed if when [version] 18 comes out that we're not saying exactly the same thing.","But really to highlight it, we've talked about a couple of things, is really it looks in terms of how can you actually compress the cycles that people can meaningfully go through a range of these different evaluations? Because we really want people early on being able \u2013 the earlier simulation is applied, the earlier you can avoid downstream problems, the more robust you can make things, the more alternatives you can look at to really drive innovation. That's really the key of it.","But what was the problem? Two main things. First of all, the performance and throughput. And second of all, ease of use. Now it's not like you attack ease of use, and you throw the switch one day, and automatically it's there. I mean just look at what happened with the home PC from 1985 all the way to even the current time with tablets. There was ease of use progression through each stage of that. But \u2013 and each one created additional business. But it took a number of applications of that to make that go. So we've actually done that.","If you look at really the \u2013 some of the main messages are if you will, reducing by significant amounts the amount of time it takes to actually get a model. Really at the end of the day we'd love to have somebody just not even worrying. They're just really trying to simulate their product, seeing what's there. And not get caught up in all the nuances of all the modeling aspect or have to spend a lot of time doing that. And that's one area where we've done quite a bit.","Secondarily is we look in terms of how long does it take? I mean it used to take \u2013 sometimes these things would crank for days in terms of getting results. But with high performance computing and actually some really, really significant things we've done in terms of high performance computing and performance overall, being able to take things that might have cranked for a day, and now allow somebody to get things in a matter of minutes.","Well if you do that \u2013 it's not like I do a run, I go home at night, let it crank, come back the next morning and each cycle takes a day. If you're taking like 10 minutes or something like that, you can actually go through a number of progressive things.","Likewise I'd say that \u2013 on one of the earlier questions, we talked about what we were doing in terms of actually continuing to drive multi-physics. I mentioned the chip packet system.","Well it used to be that a lot of these things were done sequentially by different groups using different mathematics. It had to be massaged and go together. And sometimes the workflow is just making it to the point where you don't have to have the equivalent of 30 adapter cables when you're hooking up some kind of an electronics system and being able to go \u2013 you'll go through all of those things. So that's \u2013 if you look at, that's really been some of the major portion of that going forward. So again performance, ease of use, and actually getting these work flows compressed.","But even once you do that, as soon as you say well I've got multiple groups working together, now you have to also contend with the fact of, hey, there's organizational resistance to change. And there's also some things that companies have to do to get repeatable processes in and of their own capabilities.","And that's one reason why I'd say the final thing has been related to \u2013 we've talked about the \u2013 basically the customization tool kits that we had invoked in there. And we've been able to proliferate those across a lot broader range of products, which allow individual companies to take pretty strong generic software and now tailor it to something that they can create as repeatable processes. Those are probably the major things that I think are particularly significant.","But on top of it I mean there's \u2013 in every one of our individual products, there's been a number of individual things. We'll get into it a little bit at Investor Day coming up. And there's some pretty good information on the website along with some \u2013 actually some customer testimonials, because when they actually come through and see \u2013 say they saw these measurement things, it probably means a lot more than our \u2013 what our technologists or media or anybody inside ANSYS is talking about. That's really where the proof points are.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for today's question-and-answer session. At this point I would like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Cashman for any closing remarks.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh okay. So well thanks, everybody, for the questions. And to recap basically, I'd say first, continued good diversified financial performance of most the major parameters of the business, even in light of the current environment and hazy build visibility.","Secondly, sustained customer interest that is marked by activity on a broad front. And I think that's evidenced \u2013 I mean we talked about it on some of the questions here with the industries, geographies. And I'd also mention the commitment levels and renewal rates, even while customers are going through a lot of additional discretion in terms of what they're doing.","Obviously the last question we talked about, the rapidly expanding product portfolio that we continue to augment with a range of partnerships and relationships. Not only on the technology side, but also in distribution and customers. And I'd say maybe most importantly is over the long term, we've demonstrated an ability to grow the revenue in line with our range of guidance. And we still maintain the solid margins and delivered earnings growth in a range of economic situations. So a testament to the business model.","So basically the long-term outlook stays bullish. And basically to map this out it means first, the long-term premise and opportunity are still there. And we still have the best technology and the team to meet those.","Secondly, even at the floor of our assumptions, we continue to have solid business with good returning revenues, marquee customer relationships, and all of these combine for good earnings and cash flow. So we'll be focusing on maintaining strong operating margins in the upper 40s%, while continuing to build our annuity base of recurring revenues, and expanding at the maximum rate allowed by the macro market conditions.","And then lastly, we \u2013 as Maria mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet. It affords us a maximum flexibility should opportunities present themselves or should the macro economy even deteriorate further than some people are projecting.","So we've seen over the years that the continued revenue performance creates upside margins. But that the revenue performance \u2013 and again it's only sustainable with continued product and business investments. So we remain committed to that.","So in close, the emphasis is going to be a continued focus on execution, continued technological leadership, and basically supported by our 45 plus years of history. The customer acceptance of the existing vision is \u2013 and unique value proposition, the expansion of our product portfolio and through ANSYS 17, it really only bolsters our long-term enthusiasm.","So I'd like to say thanks to our customers. I'd like to say thanks to my ANSYS colleagues and our long-standing partners. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. And we'll be talking to you again in a few months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending.

With us today are Mr. Jim Cashman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer. ","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Cashman for some opening remarks. ","James Cashman","Okay, thank you Rocco. Good morning, and thanks to everyone, for joining us to discuss our 2014 Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Financial Results.","So as usual before we get started, I'd like to introduce Maria Shields, our CFO and ask her to go through our Safe Harbor statements. Maria?","Maria Shields","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks document have been posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website this morning. And they contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to Q4 and the Full-Year 2014 business results as well as our current Q1 and fiscal year 2015 outlook and our key underlying assumptions. ","I'd also like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum. ","Finally, during the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we will be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K. ","So Jim, I'll now turn it back to you. ","James Cashman","Okay, thanks Maria. So let\u2019s start with a recap of the results that the ANSYS team achieved in 2014. So as you might recall from our Investor Day in March of 2014, we laid out a number of key objectives for the year. We set goals of achieving non-GAAP revenue growth of 8 to 11% in constant currency, achieving strong margins and cash flows, high rates of recurring revenue, and continued growth in both deferred and revenue and backlog. And I am pleased to say that we did in fact achieve every one of those goals. First, we achieved an extraordinary milestone of $1 billion in sales bookings. Our non-GAAP revenue growth for the year in constant currency was 10%. ","Our non-GAAP operating margin was 48%. We generated over $385 million in cash flow. That's a 16% increase over 2013. Our recurring revenue for the year was 71% and our deferred revenue and backlog grew by 14%. We also accelerated the rate of return in capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. You might recall that in the November 2014 call, our Board of Directors we mentioned had significantly increased our share repurchase program to 5 million shares. At that time, we committed to purchasing $200 million in stock over the following five months. We actually achieved that goal in less than three months. ","So in total we repurchased 3 million shares of stock in 2014 and 930,000 shares in January of 2015. Now we committed to returning capital to our shareholders while simultaneously growing our top line business, both organically and through targeted acquisitions. As a result, our Board recently increased the authorized share repurchase pool back to 5 million shares. During 2014, we acquired Reaction Design for advanced simulation of chemical reactions for combustion, and SpaceClaim for evolutionary geometry handling. And just a week ago, we acquired Newmerical Technologies International, a premier developer of in-flight icing simulation software and associated design, testing and certification services. ","These acquisitions along with the groundbreaking technology we introduced last month in ANSYS version 16 which I\u2019ll discuss a bit later, further distances us from the competition. So I\u2019d like to now just take a moment to highlight some of the successes from the fourth quarter. Most importantly, we achieved double-digit growth in revenue in the fourth quarter in constant currency surpassing the expectations that we shared with you in early November. We ended the year on a particularly strong note with record revenue and operating cash flows for the fourth quarter which drove record results for the full year. ","Importantly our recurring revenue base continues to be very strong at 66% for the fourth quarter even off of the strong license performance. Now continuing the trends from Q3, we closed with strong contributions from all of our major regions. North American non-GAAP revenue grew 12%, Europe rose 9% and Asia Pac increased 15%, again all in constant currency. Growth came from a broad base of industries and these industries are highlighted in more detail within the quarter\u2019s prepared remarks which you can find on our investor site. ","During the fourth quarter, we had 35 customers with orders in excess of $1 million. The average value of those orders represented a 14% increase over last year. Now two of those customers actually had orders in excess of $15 million, in fact one of them Cummins was featured in a separate announcement that we made earlier today. We signed a landmark agreement with Cummins Inc, which has been a customer of ANSYS for over 25 years. The new multiyear enterprise license agreement provides Cummins with broad access to the ANSYS portfolio, including our high-performance computing solutions. ","Cummins\u2019 commitment to the ANSYS technology is in direct relationship with their vision of Analysis Led Design providing them with the flexibility necessary to grow their use of simulation in ways that would have been very difficult previously. The agreement is actually indicative of the continuing shift to multi-year enterprise license agreements that several of our larger long-standing customers are considering that we talked about in recent calls. This allows for a widespread adoption of our technology across their enterprises. ","So the Cummins announcement is really just the next step in a long journey that we\u2019ve been on for over two decades, and one that we see continuing into the future for many more. This really is an example of simulation-driven product development and the democratization of simulation, visions that we\u2019ve been advancing for over 15 years now. Okay, so during the fourth quarter we continue to accelerate sales hiring as an important lever to drive the increased sales execution, capacity and growth as we head into 2015. ","Now we\u2019ve seen the payoff in Q4 and overall 2014 results from a number of the changes and investments that we made throughout the of the year of 2014. And our plan is to continue to drive change in investment in 2015 to continue on a path toward achieving our goal of double-digit constant currency revenue growth in 2015. So in summary for the quarter, constant currency and bookings growth were both double-digits. We ended 2014 with record results and we\u2019ve great momentum as enter into 2015. ","So now let me just share a little bit about the groundbreaking version of our software ANSYS 16.0 which we released in January. Now you may recall at Investor Day last year, we outlined for you the tremendous growth opportunities available to us across three primary dimensions; increasing the number of users, number one; increasing the density of usage through multiphysics; and increasing the intensity of usage through high-performance computing. ","ANSYS 16.0 is transformational in our industry and helps us to drive growth across all three of these dimensions. Even though we already have the deepest and broadest physics, we\u2019re continuing to make significant advances and investments in R&D. So first, with its dramatically enhanced user-interface and improved ease of use, it makes simulation more accessible to the broader range of people, and it increases the situations in which simulation can be used. Secondly, ANSYS 16.0 reflects major enhancements to our entire portfolio including structures, fluids, electronics, systems, engineering solutions of all types. ","These enhanced features will broaden the use of simulation beyond one type of physics to true multiphysics used collaboratively by teams to assess entire systems. And third, ANSYS 16.0 is geared for high-performance computing solutions and it provides extreme scalability, ease of use and flexibility through customization and cloud-enabled applications. We\u2019re the only simulation provider that's really certified at 36,000 cores and above. So all of these features will enable our customers to solve difficult problems in minutes, instead of hours or days thereby driving the intensity of usage. ","And then actually one final point I should make is certainly not the left, because there\u2019s a lot we could talk about. But with the release of ANSYS 16.0, we further solidified our platform status in the industry. The ANSYS Workbench platform further enabled simulation-driven product development by identifying which design parameters most influence product performance and by enabling engineers to easily evaluate multiple-design variations. ","There are numerous additional enhancements in version 16.0 around robustness, efficiency, ease of use and actually most notably including extensions to the Workbench customization to allow the user to create their own, well user-defined processes, automation wizards and customization and optimization algorithms. ","So in summary for ANSYS 16.0; A, extended leadership in each of our simulation disciplines; B, preeminent multiphysics and support of comprehensive virtual prototypes; and finally an enterprise-capable simulation platform. There\u2019s a lot more on the website if you are interested in digging into that, but those are just the summary highlights. So with that, I am going to turn it back to Maria to discuss our Q1 and our 2015 guidance before we move into Q&A. So, Maria? ","Maria Shields","Okay, thanks Jim. So as we outlined in this morning\u2019s press release, we\u2019ve initiated our outlook for Q1 with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $217 million to $225 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.74 to $0.79. With respect to fiscal year 2015 with the sole exception of updates for movements in currency since we initially provided our 2015 outlook in early November, everything else remains largely the same. Those currency updates translates to our revived outlook of non-GAAP revenue in the range of $946 million to $976 million and non-GAAP EPS of $3.40 to $3.51. ","From a qualitative perspective, our Q1 guidance takes into account the currency updates that I just mentioned, as well as one particularly large customer deal that has historically included a combination of upfront perpetual revenue and the annual lease and maintenance business. Because of the structure of this year\u2019s deal, the entire value of the transaction will be recognized ratably throughout 2015. The structural change of just this one transaction adversely affects first-quarter revenue by approximately $2 million to $3 million. ","For 2015, we\u2019re assuming no significant changes either way in the overall macro climate. We also see sales and revenue growth rates ramping up as the year progresses, particularly as the new sales capacity that Jim talked about earlier that has been brought on in Q4 and Q1 begins producing and as the recently announced channel initiatives begin to take hold. For further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that we factored into Q1 and fiscal 2015 outlook, please take a look at the prepared remarks that we posted on the Investor Relations home page this morning. ","So with that Rocco, we\u2019ll now open up the line to take some questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, ma\u2019am. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, we\u2019ll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question comes from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Please go ahead. ","Anil Doradla","A couple of questions. Can you talk a little bit about you know the oil and kind of drilling end markets. I know you\u2019ve some exposure there, they are heavy users of your products. Energy prices have been coming down, so in terms of their discretionary spending, how have they been off lately? ","James Cashman","Well the good news is that you are correct. We\u2019ve exposure there, but keep in mind with the number of customers we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve exposure across every industry because we\u2019ve access and play in every industry. And there\u2019s no doubt that the oil prices where they are now compared to where they have been in past years, it does have a dampening effect on their spending. But the only thing I would say is that, that's one thing about the diversity of our industry base is that there\u2019s almost always one industry that's always in kind of a temporary nadir. So that's really not to get around. ","So the interesting adjunct to that though is that while there\u2019s a dampening effect on the expenditure of engineers, the one thing we\u2019ve found is that when that is the case, a fair amount of times companies will actually say well we can\u2019t add more engineers, we\u2019ve got to do more with less. And more and more simulation is one of those things that allows them to amplify the number of engineers that they do have. So you know there is you know a hedging aspect in terms of that utilization. ","But there\u2019s no doubt that the industry you know does ebb and flow on those prices. And by the way, likewise when oil prices go high, you know a lot of other alternate energies become a little bit more in vogue as the comparative tradeoffs there. So it\u2019s really a pretty complex dynamic equation that is kind of just beyond the one. But I guess you know briefly it's not a major factor to us, but yes it is an overall environmental thing that we\u2019ve to factor into our everyday living. ","Anil Doradla","Great and Maria, I mean given that you know FX is a hard reality going forward, have you guys considered or considering you know incorporating some level of hedging in the whole P&L? Because going forward with 65% of exposure to foreign currencies, you know we could see this recurring theme, wouldn\u2019t you say? ","Maria Shields","Absolutely, but because of our presence we\u2019ve got natural hedges built-in to the expense base. So the reality is, I'll be honest with you. I am not an expert in betting on currency movements and so I think we will continue what we have historically done and just use the natural hedges that we\u2019ve got in place. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Maria, first for you and then a follow-up for Jim. First, could you comment on your 2015 cash flow expectations? And secondly, when we look at the Q4 revenue split by license type, that is lease versus perpetual, it looks like your total lease revenues were about flat sequentially. And that on a year-over-year basis most if not all of the year-over-year increase in lease revenues might have been attributable to Apache, which of course is an entirely lease-based model. Could you just comment on that as well? And then a follow-up for Jim, thanks. ","Maria Shields","Yeah, so let\u2019s start with cash flows. We\u2019re looking at for right now based on everything we know Jay, we\u2019re looking at probably somewhere in the $360 million to $380 million of operating cash flows for 2015. With respect to your -- yes, in constant currency so the lease base was up about 8%. No doubt the Apache business for Q4 versus Q4, the Apache business plays a role. But we\u2019ve also got leases throughout the rest of the portfolio and some of the strength particularly in the Electronics business unit which is complimentary to the Apache business also played a role in that growth. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer","And for Jim, when we look at your portion of revenue by end market, you provided that now for 2014. It looks as though for Q4 and for the year as a whole, but particularly for Q4, you had quite strong growth in automotives. So that is pretty consistent with what we hear from your peer group vis-\u00e0-vis that end market. It looks like you did well in industrial equipment and materials and chemicals just to name a couple of the end markets. Could you comment on your expectations on sustainable momentum into 2015 and beyond, particularly for automotives, and after semis and electronics, it\u2019s your largest vertical? ","James Cashman","Yeah, well we\u2019re still seeing continued progress in there. And in fact even some of the -- you know some of these larger kind of engagements, we\u2019re getting to or starting to bring in non-traditional sources along that line. And by the way that's across multiple geographies on top of it. And what it really gets down to is if you look at the complexity of what\u2019s going in there, it used to be things were always broken into, here\u2019s body and white and here is powertrain. ","And here is, I mean now looking at some of the more system impacts of these are tending to take you know a broader role in addition to the overall kind of inexorable push toward efficiency you know in the vehicle. So I look at that and then I look at also the -- we also look at the increasing amount of [electronical] content, be it control systems, be it you know all sorts of safety systems and monitoring and things like that. And those are major things that are driving it, along with also some of the changes in materials. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Williams of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Matt Williams","I was just wondering Jim, if you could spend a little bit of time on ANSYS AIM. It sounds like you know as a component of ANSYS 16.0 that that really has a lot of potential to really broaden the access and user base within your customer base. So I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on any feedback or reception that you\u2019ve gotten around that? ","James Cashman","Well, essentially keep in mind that this is also a first step of a multi-step journey, so we\u2019ve been continuing to do that. The key thing to focus on is we always said that A, the first thing was bringing together multiphysics. And then the second part then was okay, we\u2019re going to develop a platform that allows these shared data inter-operate. And then we were -- and that was roughly embodied in the Workbench platform. And you can see, even though we\u2019ve been at that for a few years, some of the things that have taken hold most recently was the customization and that is the next step. ","But we always talked about the third step of that was going to be the environment for using multiphysics in a way where people didn\u2019t have to struggle with all the nuances of the legacy applications that were pervasive throughout the industry. And AIM is really one of those first things that terms at that step of providing a user environment that basically draws the user in and allows them to take advantage of a lot of the modern advances that are going on. ","And of course when you layer everything else underneath that, the next step will be how does that work into both private and public clouds and going there and there\u2019s a lot of exciting movement on that point. So again just like Workbench was several stages going through, AIM is a very important first step, but it's a very real palpable thing for the next generation of user interaction. ","Matt Williams","And then maybe just one quick follow-up for me and then I will hop off. But you know it seems like with the Reaction acquisition, the Newmerical acquisition, that you're starting to get a little bit more vertically focused in some areas. I guess, you know are there other opportunities to really get a little bit deeper with some of the vertical opportunities and some of the demands that you are seeing within particular industries? ","James Cashman","Well the only thing I\u2019ll want to say primarily is that we\u2019re not inherently getting more vertically focused because we\u2019ve a broad base. But keep in mind, any time you acquire any kind of a relatively small company, small companies tend to focus around some area of excellence. The main thing around Reaction Design was that A, starting to move into the chemistry realm and you can think of all sorts of realm where chemistry meeting physics opens a whole new line of thing. ","I mean we talked about powertrain that realizes a different set of chemistry, but you know what impact might that have on battery life and things like that sometime in the future. But it also in many cases plays very well into what was mentioned on an earlier question around the automotive, something that we even mentioned for instance around the Cummins deal and things like that, where okay now some of the performance aspects of this are very important. And while we may, we don't want to have a 1000 paper cuts of all these vertical different [apps]. ","These are unitary products that fit across our family, but they provide immediate value for a group of customers that then we can expand based on our scale, the breadth of our -- the breadth and depth of our sales and go-to-market strategy that maybe a smaller company might have been more limited by. So actually we can create that and frankly that's something that we\u2019ve demonstrated with every acquisition that we\u2019ve done, you know done so far. So you know I think the thing is that these are ways of fleshing out things and in particular getting areas of intellectual competency in areas where we might have been able to study up and build our way to them. ","But if we can get masses of very talented people who are interested as we\u2019re in continuing to build this vision, that\u2019s a great immediate move for us, and it\u2019s something that plays well with our customers. So I wouldn\u2019t say that's the only thing that we\u2019re doing as we go forward, acquisitions are still a major part. Actually I shouldn't say that, I should say the major part of what we intend to do with our capital utilization. But amongst that, that's going to be a mix of some of the additional add-ons we do, but also some of the tech tuck-ins and some of the ancillary type of technologies that we\u2019re bringing on. ","But you know virtually all the technologies we bring on ultimately have some kind of you know bearing into you know into other industries. So it's not just a niche play. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. ","Steve Ashley","Yeah, I\u2019d just like to drill down on the sales force a little bit. Do you know by any chance, how many reps you maybe ended the year with? What kind of you know increase we might have seen in the fourth quarter and what you are highlighting [indiscernible]? ","James Cashman","Well it was -- you know without getting into specific numbers, it was a little bit above 200, you know the things we\u2019ve talking about. And we\u2019ve probably had the equivalent of about, you know to date probably about a 15% to 20% increase in head counts. And that's something we did very aggressively in Q4, because we wanted to be prepped up for the year. As it is, we\u2019ve had a really good you know onboarding of some of those people. We\u2019ve had a really good attraction kind of strategy. ","And of course then it\u2019s going to take some time for them to bring up you know to get productive throughout the year. I think we\u2019ve talked about a 3 to 6 month kind of ramp up. And by the way, we were still hiring into the early part of Q1, because you know there is a certain amount of bandwidth for bringing these on. But we\u2019ve already seen some of the impacts of that early hiring and certainly from a demand generation effort, you know the system is still, I mean the external system is still absorbing that ability. So in other words, we\u2019re not getting, you know we\u2019re not over saturated by any means. ","Steve Ashley","And then on ANSYS 16.0, you gave us a nice little overview of all of the benefits there. And I know one of them you talked about is the UI enhancement, really wanting to make that easier to use. Can you give us just maybe a little more color on that ease of use and what might be involved with what you provided in ANSYS 16.0? ","James Cashman","Well, there\u2019s a whole range of things where -- I mean if you think about a lot of other applications that you use, I mean in terms of you know being able to you know to get -- you know how to pod things, videos, it will pop up like as you hover over things. So in other words, in some cases, you don\u2019t even have to ask for things. It\u2019s anticipating what you want, it's anticipating certain guidelines. ","It allows you to set the preferences. And I think the other thing that can\u2019t be overplayed is that you know in some cases, these initial steps where we can be operating all the physics within one window, that may seem like a pretty trivial kind of end-user enhancement or a comp-side achievement. But what you can do you know in that one window where you are not kind of like trying to you know hop between different things that are connected and talking to one another, but they still feel a little bit different. ","And I think that's part of it, I think also as somebody, as people start branching into multiphysics, you might think you know historically fluids and structures even though they are both mechanical engineering disciplines. And every mechanical engineer learned in school the tools and their application historically have been so separate, you had to be an expert practitioner in there. ","And because of that, the different tools kind of pose problems in different ways, spoke in different languages. And you know we want to get to that point where a person with good engineering judgment overall isn\u2019t wrestling with the nuances of the linguistics of the program. So they can get those working together. So first of all, we solve the interactivity from the data standpoint, meaning we can solve the problems. ","Now we want to bring that in where the bar gets lowered to a good engineer being able to get access to it. And that's what I meant about the multi-step journey that we\u2019ll be on that. Just like we\u2019re in a multi-step journey on Workbench, even though we\u2019ve been able to harvest some nice success out of that over the last few years. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Saket Kalia","The first one for Jim. Jim, can you just talk about this Cummins contract a little bit? You know it seems like it wasn't just the flexible payment structure that the time-based license inherently give. But it also sounds like Cummins was maybe getting broader access to the portfolio. And I know you said in the past that you are not doing a token-based licensing model. So can you just walk through how maybe these sort of agreements work? ","James Cashman","Yeah again token, that's just -- that's one way of approaching a flexibility issue and things like that. But really what we looked at was -- and that's where when we engage with major customers, we get a concept of what they want to do. But what we try to do is make access to that software. We elevate it out of the individual transaction level, because they have already made a commitment to us. We\u2019ve already made a commitment to them, and it provides that flexibility to actually bring in the things. ","You know sometimes it's very difficult at the very beginning to say I'm going to need exactly this capability at this particular time. And you try to over-programatize it, but with this one we can look at the number of users, the types of jobs that they trying to do, the things that they are trying to solve from a business standpoint. And it allows you to do the things we couldn't do for our 45,000 customers on a standard price list. But when you can actually engage with somebody and get that economy, it allows us to work together. ","I think also an interesting adjunct of these kind of enterprise agreements we\u2019ve. And you saw a reference of that with an announcement we had made a year ago in terms of this is the way that sometimes we\u2019ll actually collaborate with those customers to be prepared to jointly tackle the next generation of problems that are maybe addressed by simulation. So it's actually \u2013 it's more than just a transactional purchasing. It's really more of a holistic technology implementation trajectory that we tried to build on there. ","And it\u2019s really an invigorating one, because it\u2019s really solved -- it\u2019s really around how you solve new classes of problems as opposed to how do you get over a certain kind of purchase hurdle. And we\u2019re starting to see more and more of these. That's what factors into some, you know some of things we\u2019ve talked about the last couple of calls in terms of time-based licenses that you know it tends to maybe slightly deflate in the early period. But it builds over the long period and I think we\u2019ve even seen that you know in these early stages. ","But we just see increasing interest you know in those type of a relationship. And it really is one of those things, and I think it\u2019s a very significant point because it shows. It basically shows if you will, getting to a certain level of maturity and jumping a hurdle in terms of the adoption simulation on a broader base. ","Saket Kalia","And just for my follow-up for Maria. Well, can you just parse out that -- it\u2019s roughly a $40 million reduction to 2015 revenue guide for the year. I definitely see that FX is really the vast majority of that. But is that large contract, you know having any sort of impact beyond maybe the first quarter? ","Maria Shields","No, and so -- and that's why if you look at the headline, the word solely was inserted in there. So that the only significant modification we\u2019ve made from when we guided back at November is roughly 3% to 4% related to currency for the full year. However at the same time, you know we hadn\u2019t guided on Q1. This deal has been in the works. And we\u2019ve been working with this particular customer similar to we work with Cummins on a deal that makes sense for them, their usage pattern, trying to proliferate more technology across this organization. ","And as a result the treatment under GAAP for this deal is going to be spread. So for 2014 or for 2015, it will be spread over the full year as opposed to in the past when we booked a deal with this particular customer that tended to be a couple of million dollars of paid-up revenue won\u2019t be there. But we\u2019ll take the long-term gain for you know what people might perceive as short-term pain. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. ","Steve Koenig","I wanted to ask a bit about what you are doing with your direct channel and maybe partners as well. And then I\u2019ve got one follow-up. Is the Q4 large -- ","James Cashman","No, I thought that was a question, please continue. ","Steve Koenig","Okay, let me just elaborate a little bit more. So two parts here, one is, is the Q4 large deal performance, is that normal seasonality [indiscernible] variability? Or is that attributable in part to some of the initiatives you put in place to drive adoption at large accounts? And can that lead to better, large deal performance perhaps going forward as well? And the second part of that question is maybe if you all could elaborate a little bit on Maria\u2019s comments about the channel initiatives that have been put in place should help provide acceleration as the year progresses? What exactly do you mean by that? ","James Cashman","Okay, the first thing there -- it really wasn\u2019t that there were new initiatives. But the increased bandwidth in our sales allowed us to address those more completely. And in general, if you look at that, I think a couple of things we talked about was, as opposed to having if you will more of a geography-based or a geography-skewed sales force, it's now pretty much partitioned between there is that element. But there's also a major account focus by the number of reps and that increased quite a lot because there\u2019s more of a consolidated aspect and a focus requirement that's required to drive that forward. ","To answer your question, there\u2019s more than just -- I mean there\u2019s typically seasonality patterns in these. However the number that I talked about is greater in terms of the number of customers of those large orders. And secondarily as I mentioned, the average value of those orders was a 14%, actually probably even a little bit above 14% increase in average order size. So I mean it\u2019s not just the -- like clockwork here is the season that comes in and goes forward. Now with regard to, I guess the final thing was with regard to we\u2019ve already talked quite a bit about the direct sales force expansion. ","But I will say that if you recall, we also mentioned in a previous call about the things that we\u2019re doing because the channel is still a very strong part of that. And we\u2019ve actually put constructs in place to do that. In fact there is even some things we\u2019re working on in terms of collaboration with them, where we can jointly do things under an ANSYS aegis. But it\u2019s really primarily focused at driving the channel business. So those are, I mean the bottom line is those are both you know obviously going to be key parts of our go-forward strategy. And we want to make sure that our historical channel you know was actually in the same boat going in the same direction we were. ","Steve Koenig","Okay and if I could squeeze in one follow-up if you don't mind. I am curious to know what you are seeing with SpaceClaim. How is it meeting your specific goals for the unit? And how is it advancing your overall goals and you know and over what timeframe? ","James Cashman","Well I\u2019ve to actually say, you know we talked in the last of couple of calls where the results were a little bit depressed. Initially, you know sometimes that happens when there\u2019s that changing of you know changing of the guard. But I\u2019ll say that once we got through that, once we were able to go through a broader base sales training, and introduction of what this technology means as well as customers realizing, this just wasn't kind of like a cute little third-party addition into our suite but it was a key part of what we\u2019ve going forward, it became something. ","And quite frankly the interest levels and the pipeline is actually pretty strong right now. So you know, we look towards getting back on the [glide] path or the take-off trajectory that we had envisioned for this you know, albeit maybe a few months lower. But the reception has been really strong, so I think we are headed in a really good direction on this. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our next question is from Ross MacMillan of RBC. Please go ahead. ","Ross MacMillan","Jim, can you comment how far you have progressed with TBL agreements. Is it still a very small number of customers? And secondly for Maria, what are the implications we should think about in the model as you do more of these TBL agreements? And then I actually had one follow-up. Thanks. ","James Cashman","Well first of all, it's a small number of actually enacted ones. It's an increasing number of people who are interested in engaging along those standpoints, so definitely the trend. The one thing before I turn it over to Maria, the one thing that I said is we know that this is a definite trend. How quickly or how completely it enters the equation is still a question. It will be significant, but is it like a 100% or 30%? Either of those numbers will be very significant. We don't really know that, but there\u2019s no doubt that the trend and all the winds are blowing in that particular direction which means of course we have had to try to make different assumptions on modeling that. ","But if you recall from the very -- I mean for years we\u2019ve been saying hey, we\u2019ve been talking about a strong lease base, a strong license base. And basically saying that you know we really don\u2019t care. What we\u2019re trying to do are providing multiple opportunities and just not create acquisition, you know purchasing hurdles to adopting the technology. And so we continue to do that, but the receptivity and the interest seems to be shifting towards more of that. ","And as this technology gets a little bit more pervasive, however it gets manifested in things like the cloud and large-scale networks long-term, that all could, that all could shift and affect it too. But it definitely is a trend line, but you said you wanted to turn in part of that question to Maria, so I\u2019ll give her a swing. ","Maria Shields","Okay. So Ross just a couple of comments to add on to Jim\u2019s point. What you\u2019ll basically see is probably over time an uptick in the percentage of recurring revenue. And obviously in whatever quarters that we booked those deals, you will see an uptick in deferred revenue and backlog. So just like I commented relative to the Q1 outlook, there\u2019s the potential for perhaps some slight decreases in short-term revenue growth. But these are really, really good for building our long-term relationships and our long-term growth. ","And the other thing I will say is as Jim pointed out, this is kind of I would say an evolution for some of our traditional larger customers. We obviously, the TBL have been part of the Apache model since that business started and since we acquired it. But there are still some parts of the world that larger deals, perpetual is the model they preferred in places like China and India and Korea. So what we want to do is remain as we always have been flexible to the needs of our customers to enable them, to acquire the software under whatever model makes sense for them. We are not going to force them into time-based licenses if perpetual is the model they prefer. ","Ross MacMillan","Maybe just one quick follow-up. So we pay attention to bookings, both current and total bookings. And there was a deceleration in Q4 relative to I think the trend we\u2019ve been seeing over the past three quarters, was there anything -- ","James Cashman","Keep in mind, Ross. The one thing is and you keep in mind, you know there\u2019s a lot of different factors here. Yeah, there is currency, but you look at long-term, you know multi-year kind of issues coming in. So they are definitely currency, there\u2019s issues between and maybe I don't know if we want to get into this, but the build versus unbuild. But you know one of the main things is that, if you\u2019ve got you know we\u2019ve talked in the past about, if you\u2019ve got a multi-year deal maybe a four-year deal. ","And it showed as a $40 million last year, the fact that it didn't renew this year may show one set of calculations as being down. But it is not at all indicative of a decreased book of business. I mean it basically is -- it basically is really strong stuff. It's just that when you do these multi-year things, those cycles are going to go in and out. So actually with this trend going on, we look at a number of things and trying to look at an annualized value of those going forward. And you know obviously taking out some of the currency and making sure that, I mean there\u2019s also things when you do bookings. ","You know some might be for periods out in the future as opposed to the current period. And trying to line up all that, it's a very complex you know kind of equation. But you know, you could really get caught off guard if you just try to assume that it\u2019s an apples-to-apples comparison. With that I mean and maybe Maria, if you\u2019ve got a concept on [indiscernible]? ","Maria Shields","Yeah, just you know Ross, the one thing as Jim pointed out, we would really encourage people to focus on full-year results as opposed to any given quarter. Because as these deals become larger, the quarters can become skewed. The reality is if you take a look at, at least how we calculate bookings growth and factor in the impact of FX for the full year on deferred revenue from 2014, we\u2019ve got you know roughly 11% bookings growth. So that's what we\u2019re really focused on is that double-digit bookings growth that we at least for 2015 envision will translate at the high end into double-digit non-GAAP revenue growth. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schappel of Benchmark. Please go ahead. ","Mark Schappel","Jim, I was wondering if you could just provide us, just a quick update or a brief update on your Asian operation. So you made several changes in the region [indiscernible], so I was just wondering if you could just give us a brief update? ","James Cashman","Well, yeah well remember when I was talking about the comparative growth, I think it was 12% North America, 9% Europe and 15% for Asia Pacific. And I think that's, you know that's not the only aspect of that. But we talked about things both at the country level at our major markets as well as the transition of the overall leadership in addition to propagating some of the best practices that we had in other parts of the world going forward. And I think as you go forward, you look at all that going forward. ","And I think the other thing that's very significant is a part of that also are changes that we did. And we talked about them being leadership, structural and operational changes in Japan. And if you look at that going forward and that even involves the way that we worked with our partners. And when you look at that continuing on, you know we talked about in past years we\u2019ve been a little bit disappointed with our number two market which was Japan. And you know they were in solid double digits. ","The rest of Asia was growing, you know in the mid to upper teens kind of level. So it\u2019s a pretty consistent you know kind of basis going forward. And when I talked about some of the investments we made in 2014 that we felt positioned us well, this is not the only one. But it is one significant one that, you know that we\u2019re on record talking about throughout last year. ","And so our prospects for that are very good. I mean again there is always going to be local economic and macro and currency, but that's part of everyday life. And no matter what it\u2019s at, I mean you know we feel like the team we\u2019ve got there is markedly more solid than we were say this time 12 months ago. ","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Just a couple of odds and ends. First in the quarter, you had an unusually large increase, an amount of services revenue although it\u2019s still a fairly small percentage of total. Could you talk about those results in terms of they are being concentrated perhaps. It\u2019s a relatively small number of large engagements or what are your longer-term expectations for these services businesses? ","James Cashman","The bottom line is we said for you, we actually again when we were talking about the investments in the last couple of calls, the services aspect was one that we specifically spoke on. And we were bringing in people that were familiar and capable of driving service as a business. And that's the key role of a couple of these major people. And also services play a major role in the enterprise deals and in general, what we view as services is not what traditionally has been service in our industry. ","But they are things that are made more along implementation and adoption services going, you know going forward. So it's clearly one of those things that we\u2019re going to continue to build going forward and it's not like it's one or two major big engagement. It's really a more of a broad-based one and it actually covers all of our geography. And it's one that will be a slow gradual buildup, but it's an important part going forward. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer","And just a couple of last things then. As I am sure you know, nearly all of your peers in technical software are speaking about the opportunity in systems engineering. Yet the definitions of systems engineering across the vendors seem to differ. So could you talk about how you envision systems engineering versus your competitors or more specifically what you think they might be missing relative to your definition of that capability. ","And lastly at a recent simulation industry conference a couple of months back, there were some discussion about the potential for what we would call preconfigured validated IT, you know similar to the trend that we\u2019ve seen in EDA. For example companies like Synopsys and Cadence have built some pretty big business in IT. And I am wondering if there is an opportunity for you in that sort of offering? And whether or not that might somehow tie into your new implementation of EKM that you will be bringing out in a couple of months? ","James Cashman","Wow I am trying to figure out, there is a lot there. Okay, so first of all we\u2019ve been talking about systems for a long time. I mean in the form of simulation, you know we were the ones that were kicking it off. And to us, it was always around the building, basically being able to build a complete virtual prototype. I mean not -- and this can be -- it can be the traditional zero and one-dimensional kind of approximations. But we see moving that toward three-dimensional with the help of high-performance computing. ","We see that, and basically if you look at almost all successful product launches of new innovative products, it was because the system succeeded. And thereby you have to be able to balance a lot of different component interactions. So it's the ability to conceptualize in the virtual world a complete system and then actually when you\u2019ve got something that works then it allows you to even use that to help describe what the requirements for the components are, so you can go through the traditional refinement of that. ","But it's multi-dimensional, it's multi-scale, it\u2019s multiphysics and it's really you know if you will creating that complete 3-D virtual prototype in the computer. Now what we define there, it really pushes the bounds of technology. But technology supporting us will allow us to go forward and enable those things. But that's again one of the reasons why we push multiphysics early and why we built a platform for all of these things to work together. And the last part which I -- we may need to dig into a little bit more, but that's one reason why engineering knowledge management in terms of being able to link together the multitude of all these simulations. ","But also the complex configurations that might compose a system, link those into optimization runs that might say I also want to look at multiple variations and permutations of that. But that's basically in a nutshell where it all heads. ","Operator","And thank you, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Cashman for any closing remarks. ","James Cashman","Wow, I don't know what else I can say after closing. But I guess I\u2019ll just start by thanking everybody for participating in the call and for the questions and for your continuing support or following of answers. So you know basically we are proud of what we achieved in 2014. But, and I would like to thank the entire ANSYS team for basically the fulfillment and the commitment of those results to date. But it's really only a starting point. This is a step on a long journey and a fun journey. So, but basically we believe that we\u2019re very well positioned to continue to drive the growth in the coming year probably for two very significant reasons. ","First, we\u2019ve the increased visibility from some of those larger multi-year enterprise opportunities that are starting to build that we talked about. Secondly, as we also talked about, you know we\u2019ve been very successful in the more aggressive approach to sales hiring that we referenced on the last call. So if you look at that, I mean those are the two specifics. But we\u2019ve those ongoing generalities, we\u2019ve an unparalleled product offering. We had extraordinary longevity with our customers. ","We\u2019ve an extremely high recurring revenue base and an opportunity to augment our growth through new product features and exciting technologies from some of the acquisitions. So we\u2019ve talked about all that, so we are growing our direct sales force. We\u2019ve a renewed focus on our indirect channel and we are committed to driving operating cash flow and continuing to generate significant shareholder returns. So basically we actually, we will talk to you on the next call. But we also look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day on June 2nd. ","It\u2019s going to be outside of Detroit and it's going to be held in conjunction with the Automotive Simulation World Congress. So that might be a unique opportunity for you to learn more about some of the exciting growth prospects that are available to us as well as to see you know some of the technology in action. So we hope to see you there. But thank you very much and we\u2019ll talk to you again no later than a quarter from now. ","Operator","Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day. "],"2050":["ANSYS, Inc.

With us today are Jim Cashman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer.","At this time I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Jim Cashman, for some opening remarks.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Robert. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us to discuss our first quarter financial results. But before we get started I'm going to introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, and she'll take us through our Safe Harbor statement. Maria?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and related prepared remarks documents have been posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all the key financial information and the supporting data relative to Q1 business results as well as our current Q2 and fiscal year 2016 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I'd like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website.","Additionally the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","In the course of this call and in the prepared remarks we will be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. Discussions of various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial matters are included in this morning's earnings release materials and related form 8-K. So, Jim, I will now turn the call back over to you.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Maria. I'd like to start with a recap of the results the ANSYS team achieved in the first quarter. Q1 was a solid quarter on many fronts as highlighted by strong earnings, a record deferred revenue and backlog balance of over $506 million, non-GAAP operating margin of 46%, and strong cash flows of $109 million. Our non-GAAP revenue growth for the quarter was 5%, driven by 5% growth in North America off a strong comparable, 6% growth in Asia-Pac, and 5% in Europe, all in constant currency.","Our recurring revenue for the quarter was at 78% and growth came from a broad base of industries and these are highlighted in more detail within this quarter's prepared remarks. Our reported revenue was within our guidance range and we achieved non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 in the first quarter, at the high end of our range.","Now I just want to comment that this is both a testament to the strength of the ANSYS business model and the ongoing spending discipline of the team. We've demonstrated over many years our ability to balance the need to continue to invest in the business while also being aware of the business environment that we are all operating in. We also continued returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. During Q1 we repurchased 500,000 shares, leaving 4.5 million shares in our authorized pool as of March 31. While our primary use of excess capital is for acquisitions, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders while simultaneously growing our top line.","Operational highlights in the first quarter included 22 customer orders in excess of $1 million. These orders included a $10 million enterprise license agreement with one of our long-standing industrial equipment customers. This deal is yet another validation of the evolving licensing and usage trends we're seeing within our broad customer base. More importantly, it represents the single largest displacement of a competitor's mechanical code in our history.","Now, as we've been highlighting on the past several calls, during the first quarter we continued to see ongoing challenges in the semiconductor industry. While we have not lost any business, we did see a combination of new and renewal business that slipped from Q1 into Q1 and Q3. While ANSYS and our customers continue to work our way through the evolving dynamics of this industry, there were some bright spots and I'd like to take some time to highlight those.","First, we saw important competitive wins in Europe. Second, we are also seeing new market opportunities that were secured in data center markets for early power modeling and reliability analysis. And then finally, through our long-standing partnership with TSMC, we have strengthened our leadership in next-generation technology and this includes a range of things like 7 nanometer design starts, 10 nanometer FinFET production and new packaging technology that will be critical for our key semiconductor customers.","In addition to these developments, I'm also pleased to report that we added over 300 new company logos to the roster of ANSYS customers during the first quarter. Now as you know, ANSYS has a long history of retaining and growing our relationships with customers for literally decades. This is evidenced by our recurring revenues and new logos are key elements of our longer-term growth potentials. They complement our solid customer base and represent all major verticals with particular strength in sales to new companies in the electronics, industrial equipment, automotive and energy sectors.","On the R&D side, as you know, during Q1 we released ANSYS 17.0, delivering major enhancements across ANSYS's entire portfolio and we have yet another release planned in the very near future. So stay tuned for additional announcements and updates on that front. And now for the last few quarters we've been talking about a systematic approach toward evolving ANSYS for accelerated growth, including increasing our direct sales capacity. While we've made progress on many fronts, our performance is not at the level we had planned. Despite the reality of growth challenges that both we and our customers are working our way through, we're focused on a variety of initiatives to drive that growth and attain the long-term goals that we have set for ourselves.","So, without a doubt, the major push for us right now is the generation of top line growth. To be very clear, all the major themes that we have mentioned on recent calls are still very much in play. We're still adding both an increased number of users and new logos. The penetration rates for total users is low, which bodes very well for us in the long-term, but it is still dependent on multi-year investments and usability and, by the way, without comprise in product capabilities.","Our recent sales capacity increase has been enacted and now the focus is the maturation of that investment into productive results. We have had initial success with our enterprise agreements but, with the increasing size and new arrangement of those agreements, longer sales cycles have been observed.","Now, we've also benefited from an increase in competitive displacements, which are typically pretty rare in our industry. And the new customer pipeline has been expanding, but they are also subject to slower sales cycles and ramp-up times. So, these positive long-term factors are balanced by some short-term realities that are beyond the typical macro and industry and currency turbulence. Notably, there is an evolution in the manner in which companies are choosing to acquire software. So, for example, we've talked over the past few calls as to the fact that there are some shifts from perpetual to time-based or leased licenses. But it's really too early to discern if this is a broad-based trend or not.","Secondarily, new procurement options related to cloud computing have been introduced, and they're getting interest and attention based on the success of other basic IT software in the industry. Now, it's not taken serious hold as of yet, but many of our major customers are doing economic evaluations of the alternatives. This is extending purchase cycles, as these decisions now entail both the R&D and the IT organizations within our customers to be aligned in the decision process.","So in summary, as we move forward, we have a number of explicit goals. First and foremost, our initiatives to reinvigorate sales and top line growth. Second, we remain absolutely focused on generating substantial operating cash flow, reinvesting in our business, looking for acquisitions that accelerate the company's strategy, and returning capital to our shareholders. And third, we'll remain at the forefront of technology development to further the competitive advantage that we possess, that are necessary for us to harvest the opportunities that we see over the long term.","So with that, I'll now turn it back to Maria to discuss our Q1 results in a little more detail, as well as our Q2 and full-year outlook, before we move into Q&A.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Morning, everyone. As Jim highlighted in his remarks, our results for the first quarter reflect continued solid performance on many fronts, albeit not the higher end of the sales and revenue growth expectations that we targeted in our original Q1 outlook. As you may recall, when we last reported our year end results back in February, I highlighted in my comments that we were facing a macro environment that was presenting challenges for both ANSYS and our customers.","And the reality is that our concerns around slow growth in certain geographies and extended customer procurement cycles continued to play out as we closed out the first quarter. I am pleased to note that we continued to deliver a strong operating margin of 46% for the quarter, above the 45% that we had guided, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 per share, which was also at the high end of our expectations. Both of these were driven by our continued rigor around the management of expenses in a challenging environment. Currency continued to be a headwind in the first quarter, with a negative $4 million impact on revenue and $3 million at the operating income line.","As we look out towards Q2 and the balance of the year, we're continuing to target a gross profit margin of 88% to 89%, and operating margins 46.5% to 47.5% for the second quarter, and 47% to 48% for the full year. I also want to provide some commentary around the tax rate for Q2 in 2016, very much in line with what we have been guiding. We did see an uptick in our Q1 tax rate to 34%, largely as the result of an expiration of a prior tax benefit, and also impacted by a late Q1 rate change in Japan.","Looking ahead into Q2, we expect a decline in the rate to 31% to 32% as a result of some one-time tax benefits. This will be the lowest rates that we expect to see in the 2016 quarters. And for the remaining quarters, we're forecasting 33.5% to 34.5%, and for the full year, a rate of 33% to 34%. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $864 million and capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $2.7 million, and we're currently planning total capital spending of approximately $17 million to $22 million for 2016.","As we outlined in this morning's press release, we have initiated our outlook for Q2 with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $240 million to $248 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $0.86 to $0.90. With respect to fiscal year 2016, we are revising our previous outlook for the full year to reflect the slower growth in perpetual licenses we experienced in Q1 and foresee continuing into the second quarter.","We've also factored in a slightly increased tax rate and updates in our currency assumptions. Those updates translate to our revised outlook of non-GAAP revenue in the range of $990 million to $1.2 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of $3.48 to $3.62. Our guidance also takes into consideration reduced revenue projection and a tax rate increase of 1%, primarily due to the recently proposed IRS regulations intended to reduce inversions which we are projecting to adversely impact EPS by $0.02 to $0.04.","From a qualitative perspective, we're assuming no significant changes either way in the overall macro climate through the end of the year. We also see sales and revenue growth rates ramping up as the second half of the year progresses, particularly as the new sales heads continue to increase their productivity rates and the deals which are in the pipeline for the second half continue to mature and begin closing.","I would like to take a moment to take this opportunity to personally invite you to the June 2 Investor Day event. We have a full day planned, including a roster of industry experts and some of our key customers to share their insights with you in addition to presentations by our management team on our current and longer-term strategy and we hope to see you there.","So with that, operator, we can now open up the phone lines to begin some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Anil Doradla from William Blair and Company. Go ahead.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. A couple of questions. Jim, you talked about the semiconductor industry and some of the moving parts there. Obviously there's some consolidation going on. But these consolidation trends will continue to persist. So, given the significant exposure that you have with some of these industries, how do you look at 2016? Does your guidance bake into account continued issues with some of these consolidations going on or do you expect some kind of snap-back in some of these areas? And I have a couple of follow-ups.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, for this particular example, we're continuing to assume that the semiconductor industry will continue through these patterns, albeit we are involved in some very interesting advanced R&D activity for \u2013 in preparation for as they launch out of this. But as that will continue on for the next few months, it will then take time for the sales cycles to kick back in and for companies to take stock of what their post-consolidation requirements are.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Switching gears, you've got ANSYS 17.0, AIM was out there, 16.0 obviously last year. Can you talk to us a little bit about the pricing environment? Do you have some pricing power or the macro issues are hurting you on that front? Any commentary would be helpful.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well the pricing power, in terms of being able to defend the very strong referring base continues very strong and that's based on long-term trajectory with our customers. That being said, with the macro environment the way it is and you see it every day, some of the statements and some of the softening in different parts of the global market. We do see there are pressures on customers. So, there are the additional cost sensitivities that we're seeing out there. But again, nothing like we saw like five years ago.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Jim, finally, big picture when you step back and look at the trends last, call it, couple of years, from a growth point of view, obviously you were not double-digit grower, granted you've got some strong impacts on FX. But you have embarked upon a very transformative set of initiatives, whether it's sales force, whether it's cloud initiatives, whether it's pricing. How would you address some of the concerns with some segments of the investment community that ANSYS is perhaps maybe saturating, struggling for growth, struggling to get back into the double digits because clearly the numbers in near term are pointing more towards that trend.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first and foremost, I'd say that all the tenets that we talked about for the long-term are still pretty much in play. Actually, I wouldn't say pretty much, very much in play. Now, the question is as you look at some of these long-term initiatives, you look at the impact of cloud computing. It is going to play a factor in our market over the next 5 years to 10 years. Various people have posited all sorts of different lengths of that. It's going to play a role right now but companies are starting to shift and evaluate that right now.","That is part of the evaluation cycles that we're seeing now are companies are trying to refactor the way that they may even equip their overall compute environments. So we continue to see those things going on. Third of all, the macro is pretty evident but if you look at the totality of things, we are winning more than our share of those. Our comparable growth rates are strong and, like I mentioned, it's a little bit rare but normally you don't see the kind of competitive displacements that we've been involved in.","That being said, I would say that what we're seeing right now is that we're seeing much more movement out of the higher end accounts that we have which is not too surprising because they tend to be more resilient in a tougher macro and they tend to be more advanced along the maturation of adoption curve so they can tend to make those things up. All of those factors are going on but the trend line still for the long term point to basically the basic theses that we've been talking about for a couple of years now.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Jim and Maria.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Good morning, Jay.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Morning. Two quick clarifications for you, Maria. One, do you have an updated operating cash flow guidance number for the year? And then, secondly, your SG&A number was up only $1 million year-over-year. And I'm wondering if perhaps the year-over-year increases in SG&A might begin to get larger than that, particularly having grown your direct sales force (19:41).","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Okay. So, first of all, Jay, on the operating cash flows, we are projecting currently $350 million to $375 million for 2016. On the SG&A front, or G&A, yes, G&A we continue to get some of the efficiencies from automation. We have traditionally done as much as we can, particularly post acquisitions, to leverage the infrastructure that we already have so that G&A does not have to continue at the same pace as sales and marketing and R&D.","One of the major things that we're doing this year relative to scalability and efficiency, not only on the G&A side of the house but in the, I'll call it, sales operations is a significant investment in updating our global CRM system. I think you will continue to see us push efficiency in the G&A model so that the profitability can be invested in both the R&D and the sales marketing engines.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","All right. For Jim, with regard to your pipeline, could you give us your thoughts on some of the specific verticals that comprise the pipeline? In other words, how are you thinking about the contribution from, let's say, auto, aero (21:12) and the like and to what extent does the pipeline including an assumption of further displacements of the kind that you talked about?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first of all, I'll take the \u2013 we never take displacements for granted because this industry tends to be very sticky. I mean, that's one of our good defensive moats but it also tends to prevail. So I'm saying that these happen in significant things and they are normally not done in wholesale movement. They're typically done as part of major long-term commitments. You'll see that with a handful of very big accounts as opposed to an overall covering.","Now with regard to your industry question. As we mentioned, we already discussed the semiconductor industry which long-term will continue to be good for us but over the short term we talked about the issues there. If you see the couple of areas that are probably most notable, if you look at the, and we try to track the trailing 12 months so we just don't get \u2013 even out some of the spikes here. But we continue to see good growth in the automotive industry. A lot of that is related to efficiency. A lot of it's related to electrification and even some of the things moving into some advanced topics like autonomous driving and collision avoidance type of systems.","A second area which might be a little bit counterintuitive is in the industrial equipment sector. However I want to highlight that that was also perturbed by one or two particularly large deals. And why I say it's counterintuitive is that sometimes when the commodity and construction in those areas might be a little bit down you might expect that to go down but we're seeing that there's a major push in those. Those are probably the two major ones. I'd probably say that the aerospace is actually staying pretty steady at a comparable rate.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. Lastly, if I may, what is it that's making your competitors, perhaps one competitor in particular, incrementally susceptible here to being displaced? Is it just raw functionality in terms of simulation speed, or perhaps, are there other issues going on?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think \u2013 and keep in mind, a lot of these products out there, they're commendable working products. But what we do see, particularly in our lead customers, are that products that maybe over the years were bought as individual productivity tools are now being viewed by R&D management and IT industries (23:52) as being part of an overall portfolio and, therefore, having systems of software that perform admirably, but also link with one another. It's very much akin to when companies have individual business systems that popped up in different parts of the business, then all of a sudden now they want those to link together. I really think the portfolio and platform have been the driving factor in all of these enterprise license agreements. A single physics, or even having a couple of them, really isn't enough to move the dial. Once you've covered (24:25) the entire expanse, that seems to be the thing that \u2013 well, that's been evident in every one that we've seen so far.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Go ahead.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Morning. How you doing?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello, Saket.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions here. Just one question and one follow-up. First, Maria, can you just talk about what bookings grew on an organic constant currency basis? It sounds like more perpetual license dollars are shifting to other models, and therefore ratable rev rec, but (25:07-25:10). Wasn't sure if there was something else to account for when looking at deferred and backlog.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yes, so, Saket, if you just do the math from your visibility to the numbers, it will appear that bookings were negative in constant currency. However, there're two things that play a role that, when we dissect numbers, you have to factor in. One is, in Q4 of this past year, we had about $6 million to $7 million in orders that were renewal orders that had Q1 start dates that got booked in Q4. That had about a negative 3% impact, is what we're estimating. And also, if you heard Jim's dialogue, in his talking points, the semiconductor deals from the traditional Apache part of the business that slipped out of Q1 into Q2 and Q3, we have not lost those deals, but they are taking longer to close, is about a negative 2% impact. So if you take those two factors, that would suggest that bookings growth for first quarter was relatively flat.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very helpful. Then, maybe a little bit more strategic for you, Jim. Jim, you talked about cloud computing impacting the industry. Can you just talk about what sort of growth you've seen in some of your cloud simulation products, and are you starting to see maybe some of the traditional lease and perpetual business shift towards those sort of form factors, and potentially having an impact on revenue as well?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Currently, we have not seen a shift in revenues. What we have seen is a lot of disruption and focusing of activity on the evaluation of them, because what people are doing now is saying, well, if I utilize cloud with this kind of a hardware infrastructure, versus my traditional one, how do the economics play off?","And in reality, there's a lot of data that's been generated for the typical kind of business application, the scatter-gather kind of thing. But the highly compute intensive environments in which we work in, there really aren't a lot of metrics there. So, while we think it is going to be very big, it could be several years before we start to see that transfer of the internal utilization preferences. But the fact is, customers are looking at it right now. In fact, virtually every engagement that we have right now on cloud is with existing customers who are doing this as a sidelight comparison. So that's really not too surprising. In fact, their typical term is proof of concept. That's the way that they're viewing it.","That being said, we really haven't expended any useless energy, because it's going to play a role in the future, but the same architecture that we built to work within our customers' compute environments from a high-performance computing standpoint, it's the exact same architecture that we're utilizing here. So, all this is, is a way of extending this into increasing the availability of access of our software. But I wouldn't expect anything super meaningful in the next year or two, in terms of ramp-up, particularly compared against our billion-dollar base.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Very helpful. That's it for me, guys. Thanks.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Rodgers of Great Lakes Review.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Yes, just had a question on the new pay-per-use license. Is it a risk with the current lease and paid-up customers that it might be more cost effective in the future to switch to an elastic license or do you see the pay-per-use as purely additive to your business?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We view it largely \u2013 I mean, there may be some shifts of buying preferences across there as people get involved with it but it's basically going to be a net add to what we're doing based on the way that the pricing is done. And primarily, essentially what you will be trading off is the flexibility to pay for what you use. But that flexibility has a certain economics associated with it also. So I think in general, what the main tenet is going to be is people that might have not jumped in and bought an entire cadre of software now will be able to step in and do their own proof of concepts and their own usage until they build up that ramping. So really what it does is, it's really lowered that first step on the staircase to overall utilization and makes it easy for people to take that first step.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Okay. And just as a follow-up, the cash balance increased nicely in the quarter, and just wanted to get your latest thoughts on the share repurchase as well as any current M&A opportunities. Thanks.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","So, Jason, I think you heard Jim speak in his commentary that we will continue our capital allocation on all three points: investing in our business, continuing to look at a pipeline of M&A opportunities, as well as share repurchases. As you saw in Q1, we did repurchase 500,000 shares. Q1 is typically our shortest open window. But I think you will see us continue at a minimum to hold the share count flat throughout the course of the year. And obviously, we will follow our traditional framework and be opportunistic around share repurchases depending on what's happening in the overall market.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, guys. Wondering, when you look at the current environment and compare it to the last slowdown, obviously the last slowdown was major but one of the things you got huge kudos for was you didn't really invest heavily because it was pushing on the string in terms of trying to generate demand so you managed your margins and we saw those operating margins go into the 50%s. What's different now? It seems like in this (31:51) environment, there's macro concerns and squishiness out there but this time around it seems like you're more focused on investing and pushing harder to try to generate the top line. So, maybe help me compare and contrast to understand why it's better to invest this time around?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first of all where not necessarily of vesting across the board at all levels at that same rate. Second of all, this is not the same parameters that we were dealing with in 2009. There are some similarities but it's really no comparison. In 2009, it was really locked down. So what you've seen, even in light of a macro environment where we are still outgrowing the market, what you're seeing is that we're still able to deliver the earnings results, the margins and everything else. So all we've done is we've just scaled, and that was one thing I tried to mention on our business model. We're trying to scale the requirements such that we're still building for the long-term but we're also being very cognizant of the environment that we're operating in right now. And what that means is, we may be more subdued in our spending, but we're still going to focus on building those key things that are going to be important to harvesting the opportunity that we see over the next 5 years to 10 years.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. And then, on the lease versus perpetual and cloud models, listening to the commentary, it sounds very much like you're listening to the customers and waiting to see what the customer wants to do instead of maybe proactively working with the customers and trying to decide the direction they are headed and maybe help push that direction. Meaning, we've watched Adobe and Autodesk and PTC and others move in that true subscription format. What's the pros and cons to maybe just choosing that direction and moving more fully in that direction?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the first part is, of all the companies that have tried to force something, there are mixed results. There are some that, different industries have done pretty well. There are others that, let's just say that the results are remaining to be seen. Now we are, make no mistake, we are engaging with our customers in terms of understanding their preferences and trying to accommodate the best procurement matters for them.","But keep in mind we've got almost 50,000 customers. With that in mind we want to make sure that we don't, for instance, come up with the perfect model for, let's say, the top 10% and all of a sudden create a barrier to people getting involved at the lower level. So, we, at this early stage of adoption of our technology, we want to make sure that we've got multiple ways to fit the way people are naturally going to want to acquire software. In fact, if you check, if you expand the sphere of other companies as you're looking out in the space, there are some that are even commenting on the fact and saying, well, they're going to go beyond there.","But you mentioned subscription model and the one thing I'd like to mention is that for decades we've had a model that had a very high subscription element to it and a very high part of repeat business. So, we already had factored that element in no matter which way someone might appear to acquire it.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yeah, and one thing I would like to add to follow on to that point that Jim made is, when we look back, we've got 46 years of history that show when we have a flexible model for licensing and procurement that fits the needs of our customers, we have been able to increase customer lifetime value. I think that 46 years of history is why we are doing what we're doing as opposed to doing a forced march because of the people think that that's the right answer.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird & Company.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Terrific. Just like to circle back here. You've taken down your full-year guidance on the top line just a little bit based on lowering your expectations for perpetual license here in the first half of the year. But you've made a couple statements: one, macro challenging; two, sales execution not where you wanted. Is the change in the perpetual license expectation due more to the sales execution or to a change in macro?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","More macro, basically. I mean, there are elements of both because, as we mentioned, the maturation curve, we need it to be a little bit faster than it was. But it is the macro thing. I mean, you just, again, if you even read the news that's come out over the last three months. I mean it's not that we're reading that news and adjusting, we are hearing from our customers things that echo what you are also reading in the broader news. So there are pockets in Asia that were typically much more robust 12 months ago. Now, a couple of those are tending to soften up. There's a lot of mixed bag in Europe, so we factored those in. But, again, it's all driven out of the pipeline build, the forecast and the guidance going in. But as you say, it's a very modest \u2013 it's not much of a change, but we still want to reflect it in the things that we actually see.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then your comment about direct sales productivity not exactly where you'd hoped it'd be at this point. And then I think Maria even mentioned in the guidance, the expectation to see some improvement or some productivity maturity at the second half of the year. Can you talk a little bit about direct sales productivity, the concept of it's not exactly where we want. Can you give us a little more color on that?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, well, the first thing you'd see is that at the upper accounts where we had the focus, we've got a very good coverage there. Now keep in mind, we did a couple of specific things. We took our more experienced sales reps and we put them into a named account realm. I'm sorry, for recent listeners who may not know some of those terms, but essentially it was on focusing them on limited number of accounts such that they would actually spend their time doing more developmental activities as opposed to ad hoc responses. Now, those have started to ramp up in the next cadre. However, it took those people time to evolve and cover those accounts.","Now, in the territory basis then we had more of the new sales capacity put in there. And essentially, that is one that therefore needs to take a little bit more ramp-up and that is the area where we have seen the slowest uptake. And you would expect a little bit more resistance in that given the fact that the macro headwinds are a little bit higher. So we think that it takes a little bit more time to ramp those up and basically those will key right at a handful of initiatives that I mentioned that we already have in place because that is a strong target area for us.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. Really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Hi, Steve.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No problem. Good morning, Steve.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","I guess for the first one, maybe cloud competing. So, to us, and I'm sure to you, simulation seems pretty ideal for cloud computing. And it sounds from your commentary as if customers are needing to consider this and that that consideration could in fact be impacting your sales cycles in some cases. I'm just wondering, what are the issues \u2013 you clearly have the vision for where you want to go in cloud, but what are the issues on ANSYS executing on this vision that could inhibit you from moving more quickly to address those customer needs that may be already impacting sales cycles?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, you're absolutely right, cloud computing does fit this model in the long term very well. And for the very reason that it implies virtually infinite computing, however, therein also lies the issues that customers are looking at. Because infinite computing can cost \u2013 even if it's more economic, it can cost infinite dollars. And as a result, what they don't want to do is, for instance, open up the tap and leave the water running and then all of a sudden find out that they've gotten caught in a very difficult economic model.","That is the reason, as I mentioned, for the economic evaluations and proof-of-concepts that are going on right now. Now, this really is not fundamentally different than what they always did when they were building their internal clouds. And, in general, that's why a lot of people didn't have 100,000 node clusters because, well, they don't need it most of the time, so they are not going to invest to have one sitting around.","So, we also think that being able to look at that model, of how people do that internal, and buy what they normally would, but now have the access to scale up on those periodic bases when they need a full scale simulation. But, given the fact that there isn't a body of history on this, and that people are very cognizant of budgets right now, that is what's driving the overall issue.","Now, on top of it, it used to be that R&D would decide, okay, I'm going to buy this computer and as long as IT says, yes, this is an okay computer, then the purchase was relatively an R&D expenditure.","We find, as the cloud and the larger scale computing comes in, R&D has to do it, but in addition, IT has to also really sanction and bring it into play. Actually make it usable, take care of cybersecurity concerns that weren't there before, all the budgetary concerns, and things like that. And the expansionary opportunities of that model are what also drives the complexity and uncertainty that's causing these extended evaluation cycles right now.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that, Jim. Then for the follow-up. Maria, you explained what your priorities were in terms of use of cash. So, my question really is a follow-up. I want to just ask why. So, why not use the balance sheet and free cash flow generation more aggressively to return cash to shareholders, beyond the opportunistic approach that you've been taking?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Well, Steve, if you look back, our ability to return value to our stockholders, the greatest value has been created through the M&A that we've done over the past two decades. And so, there are opportunities for us to continue to accelerate our longer term strategy and our customer adoption model with our customers, through M&A. So we want to make sure that we balance and prioritize where we think the greatest opportunity to return value to our shareholders is.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Maria. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Schappel of Benchmark. Go ahead.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Mark.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Good morning. So, most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one regarding the large deal. And Jim, let me just start off and say, I agree with your comments that competitive displacements like this are a rarity in the engineering tools industry. But I was just wondering if you could just give us some details around that $10 million deal, such as why this particular customer decided to actually boot out the incumbent, instead of just layering ANSYS of top of what they already have?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the first part is, you have to have requisite capabilities, and normally for people to shift, you have to have additional capabilities over and above. But as I mentioned, the portfolio, there are a couple of elements, one of which \u2013 using moving to a broader usage pattern. Second of all was also being able to use a broader usage pattern in terms of users, I'm sorry.","And then, broader usage in terms of the span of products there, in some of the portfolio aspect. So, again, superior capabilities and superior breadth in terms of that, plus a platform running on those, it just turns out, from a long-term perspective, if you're building a long-term strategy for simulation adoption, this currently has a much better survivability curve.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. And apologies for the background noise. Maybe we can start with revenue growth of 5% constant currency year over year. If you could isolate and exclude the drag from your semiconductor business, what do you think the underlying growth rate is?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, sorry if you see the \u2013 the semiconductor market for us grew at a low single-digit amount. So, given the fact that it's a fair amount of our business, mathematically it had probably a 1% (46:21) drag associated with that. Again, being short-term one, as we said, we don't think it's a fundamental one.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Ross, just one point to add on to that. One of the things that we are seeing is, China was a very bright spot for us in the quarter. And, one of the bright spots around China is the government's push in the semiconductor industry. As a result of that, we are seeing benefits from our portfolio of solutions that we've got for semis, as the Chinese government makes a push into that. So while there were some dampening effects from continued consolidation, we are seeing some positive aspects of portfolio in China from semis.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Have you made any changes to your head count growth plans for the year?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","No.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just curious on the competitive environment. We saw CD-adapco got bought by Siemens earlier this year. I was just curious any changes that you see in the market post that acquisition?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","At this point in time, no, but keep in mind that I don't think that's closed. Maria, add anything?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","I don't think that's closed. I think they announced the acquisition.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We really haven't seen an impact one way or the other on that currently. But no, it's not been a factor.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. Very last one, just can you give me the impact for deferred revenue, sequential impact from foreign exchange? Thanks so much.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yes, hold on, Ross. Negative $5.1 million.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Erik Karlsson of Bodenholm Capital. Go ahead.","Erik Karlsson - Bodenholm Capital AB","Thanks for taking my question. The extended decision cycle you're seeing among your customers, if that were to become a bigger (49:06) and more prolonged, should we expect to take a little bit longer time for you to return to the long-term growth targets you have?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, yes, it is now. We see the \u2013 first of all, in the first iteration of somebody moving to an enterprise license agreement, that type of assumption, it's the first one that takes the time. Thereafter, it then tends to ramp up.","Sometimes it can get into several months when you talking about the dollars and you're talking about the legal agreements and understanding all the terms going in there. So we'll see that. That's usually a cost of switching the kind of arrangement that's felt in the first iteration and then isn't felt in the outlying years.","The second part is we also mentioned the addition of the new logos. Now, the new logos, that's a real good thing for us because we have a pretty good track record of continuing to build off of those and retaining those customers.","However, whenever a customer takes that first step into simulation, they normally take a little bit longer to absorb it also. So you'll see at both ends of the curve that just from the procurement differences that the sales cycles are lengthening out. I am saying that's in addition to the overall effect you might see from the macros that can go up or down at any given period of time.","Erik Karlsson - Bodenholm Capital AB","Great. And just to follow up on that, if these behaviors prevail, do you still think you can return to the growth rate you are targeting in the next couple of years?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, yeah. When you stretch out the time, yes. The thing is that even if these behaviors persist, we would expect that the low-end customers will have that normal digestion process for their first iteration of software.","However, as we get more and more customers on the enterprise license agreement, we've already cover that first cost of getting them on. But as we mentioned, it's getting those added on is a several-year process. It just tends to taper off and build over time. But once you hit steady state, you're really past that large-end digestion problem.","Erik Karlsson - Bodenholm Capital AB","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. I'm back. I'm going to ask a question that's high-level, qualitative and tough to answer. But I'm getting hit with a question from investors and I've got the same question myself, which is not given all the comments around the macro and the shifts, etcetera, what have you factored in to this new guidance? Meaning, how much of additional macro sluggishness can we see before there may need to be an additional cut? So did you cut with a chainsaw or did you cut with a scalpel?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","I'm not sure. We did not cut with a chainsaw, Sterling. What we did was took a look, as I said in my comments. One, we are at this point factoring in no economic improvement through the remainder of the year. So we expect the same kind of headwinds that we've been facing. We will see (52:35) upticks in oil and gas happening anytime soon. So our business in parts of Europe, in Brazil, in Southwest, in Canada will continue to be unfortunately negatively impacted by that factor.","We have factored in the pipeline that we see of those larger accounts in the second half that are currently being worked now largely (53:00) in North America with a handful in Europe. And we've also factored in some of the softness in some of the parts of Asia. So we have tried to take a conservative view on our business for the remainder of the year so that we don't have to repeat this going forward.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Cashman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","James E. Cashman","Well, good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. We're going to discuss our 2013 second quarter financial results. So actually, well, bookkeeping consistent with the standard protocol what we've been using for a number of quarters now, all of the key financial information and the supporting data relative to Q2 and the first half of 2013 business results, and also, as well as our current Q3 and fiscal year 2013 outlook, and the underlying assumptions are included in the earnings release and the related prepared remarks document that we posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. So that's all there for your perusal.","But before we get started, I'd like to introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, and have her go through our Safe Harbor statements. So, Maria, if you would?","Maria T. Shields","Okay, thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind you that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future business results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K.","So, Jim, I'll turn it back over to you for some comments.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, yes, thanks, Maria. And before we open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to just briefly provide a little commentary about our Q2 results and our Q3 and fiscal year 2013 outlook. So basically, from our perspective, Q2 was a very productive quarter yielding strong results. They were above the high end of our range on both revenue and earnings. In addition, we largely focused on our own internal sales execution initiatives and spending disciplines as a result of Q1 and the things that we said during that call. Of course, not surprising to those of you who've followed the ANSYS historical performance over many years and many quarters, the strength of the revenue overperformance resulted in operating leverage and the margins that were also beyond what we had guided coming into the quarter.","So overall for Q2, we achieved double-digit revenue growth in both recorded and constant currency, constant currency at around 13%. This performance was the outcome of double-digit constant currency growth in each of our 3 major geographies, as well as in the perpetual software license and maintenance and service revenue lines. The recurring revenue aspect of our business remained healthy at 69% for the quarter, even off of a strong paid-up license growth. The combination of new and renewal business and leases and maintenance yielded a new Q2 record high deferred revenue and backlog balance of over $386 million. So all of this, of course, yielded superior margins and cash flows from operations of over $87 million, which is a 16% increase over Q2 of last year.","At our recent Investor Day, we said we'd be looking for attractive uses of capital and opportunities to return value to our stockholders. And during the quarter, we repurchased just over 988,000 shares, leaving about 2 million shares remaining in the authorized pool.","Okay, so the result of all this is that we've increased our outlook for fiscal year 2013. This translates into a Q3 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $210 million to $216 million, and EPS of $0.73 to $0.76. And revenue for the full year in the range of $860 million to $875 million, with an EPS of $3 to $3.07.","Before we wrap up, I'd like to provide some qualitative context around the guidance. First and foremost, the fundamentals of our business, the customer interest and the long-term market opportunity remain intact. Our outlook at this time factors in a continuation of the general macro uncertainty around the predictability, timing, composition of deals. That's a reality that we've been dealing with over the course of the past several years and throughout the first half of 2013. And we've been cognizant of this, and actually, therefore, built it into our guidance for the remainder of the year.","Our outlook also assumes an increased ramp in our second half spend in connection with the hiring resources and a variety of activities that are setting the stage for 2014 and beyond. To net it all out, our enthusiasm continues, and we believe it's important to invest in our business to prepare for the long-term opportunity that we see over the next 3 to 5 years.","Actually, one last highlight I'd like to mention is that today is kind of a key milestone date for ANSYS. It's the first, second and fifth year anniversaries, respectively, of Esterel, Apache and the Ansoft acquisitions. And I just wanted to express my own personal note of thanks, in addition to the teams here, to all the employees that have contributed to help us bring these great technologies and companies together into the ANSYS family, and to create the world's leader in engineering simulation technology. So with that, we'd now be prepared, operator, to begin with the Q&A portion of the session and head off with that.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, I'd just like to start by asking a question on the deferred revenue and backlog. It declined sequentially. Not a lot, just a little. Just wondering if there was anything related to the timing of maintenance renewals or if there was just any commentary around that.","James E. Cashman","Well, yes. First of all, the main point I want to make is I think maybe what may appear to be missing here is the fact that the deferred revenue on the balance sheet in Q2 2013 is treated differently than it was in Q2 of 2012. So a significant component of what was formally booked as deferred revenue is now reflected in the backlog. So really, the issue is we may be comparing apples to oranges there because we really weren't that. So we still wind up with about 13% growth. It's -- you can look at there's a 13% increase in that, but actually, you might be looking at a number of 300 -- comparing 386 million versus 343 million in the deferred. So that may be part of it. Now that -- so in general, I don't think the issue is quite as you said. Now the one thing I would mention that you commented on that always plays a role is that the timing of different renewal orders and maintenance and things like that, that obviously can affect it. But as you can see, if you net out the numbers and use a constant comparison, it jives up much more consistently.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So yes, that was not my question. So my question is on a sequential basis, from March to June...","James E. Cashman","Oh, sequential?","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Backlog and deferred revenue balance declined slightly. Historically, that has increased during that period. And so that was -- I was wondering if there was anything just related to maintenance renewals or anything along that line.","James E. Cashman","No, no, I'm sorry. Actually, I was triggered off of something that I read in one of your pre-notes, and so I missed the sequential part of that. I apologize for that. Yes, if you look at that, maybe the biggest issue, first of all, there's nothing out of the ordinary there. Probably the one thing that can affect that as much as anything is some of the -- that is where some of the renewals, timing if they came in a little bit earlier before, if they lagged a month, that can cause a little bit. And the other thing is that the nature of the Apache orders are they tend to be a much smaller number of customer bases, but they tend to be larger multi-year deals, and that puts a certain lumpiness in there. So any one of those would swing 1 month or 2. It might cost medically [ph] affected, but there's nothing endemic behind the numbers that is kind of contrary to the overall message.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Cummins of B. Riley.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","I'm going to issue congratulations in advance for ANSYS once again getting out of debt soon. You do that so well. You get in and out of debt for all the right reasons. I think that, Jim, when you mentioned the anniversaries or mentioning the deals, they're great deals. And I apologize in advance for what is a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately question. But the total revenue guidance for 3Q, it's flat even at the high end. And that, I think, implies a down Q-over-Q for license. And that would be unusual for ANSYS, even based on your performance in the last few, what I would call, squirrely years. So I'm curious if your 7- or 8-figure deals, if you had any, in 2Q, is that creating a tough seasonal comp or are you giving us a little bit new extra dose of caution here with the guide?","James E. Cashman","Well, I guess -- well, first of all, all of us are a little bit puzzled at the premise. So we're -- are you -- I mean, are you talking sequentially Q3 to Q2? Because that's normal, I think. But I -- where our numbers aren't -- we're just having trouble understanding the premise because as stated, I don't think we agree with it.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Oh, okay. Well, I mean, flat at the high end on the guide. I think your service revenue typically ticks up and up and up. So that would imply the license would go down.","Maria T. Shields","What are you comparing to? Maybe that will help us understand where you're coming from.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","The last couple of years, the 3Q over 2Q compare.","Maria T. Shields","Oh.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","In which license does not go down, or has not, traditionally. That's all I'm wondering. And so I'm just thinking, did you have some very large, large deals in 2Q, particularly on perpetual license? That's what I'm getting at.","Maria T. Shields","Well, Q2 was very strong. I'd say what we've kind of built in, Dan, is Q3 historically has been the, I'll call it, riskiest quarter. Just that it's a shortened sales cycle with the extended European vacations and even the extended U.S. vacations. So we have built in some conservatism in the fact that large deals can easily slip out of Q3 into Q4 if all the people that need to sign off aren't around.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Okay, right. I was looking at your guide for last year. I think the guide was actually up a little bit last year, 3Q over 2Q. But that's fine. I appreciate that.","James E. Cashman","All I can say is behind the scenes, there's -- I mean, that's why we're puzzled by it, because we don't -- it's important to see which dots you're trying to connect because, really, behind the scenes, we're not seeing anything that indicates a flag in that standpoint. There are a lot of different ways that [indiscernible].","Maria T. Shields","Timing and volatility, as the deals get bigger, they can easily move out of one quarter and into another. And we're just trying to say we're in what everybody knows as kind of elongated sales cycles, and Q3 has always historically been the iffiest quarter depending on how much can close after the vacation season.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Okay. And so my follow-up is just, I thought there were some extra words of caution in the notes around China and India. Just curious if Jim has any extra color to add there.","James E. Cashman","Well, no, yes. I think if you look at commentary by a lot of the software and enterprise software manufacturers, there is a little bit -- there are issues in there. There are business climate issues in India that are going on. There are spending patterns and growth things in China. You look at the uncharacteristic change in the India currency as of recent. I mean, there's a lot of things there that it's just one of those things. We're treating them as warning signals, so we just put additional attention onto those. And historically, we've always called out if there's an area where we think there may be something, or if even in those areas where periodically we, in the past, when we've had execution issues, we tended to try to call those out and just try to give the overall story. But there's really, again, there's really nothing hidden beyond that.","Operator","And the next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Jim, you did have an usually large sequential increase in your perpetual license revenues from March to June, about $15 million, which is larger than the first to second quarter sequential increases on average in prior years. So the question, somewhat following up on the earlier question, is could you correlate that increasing perpetual to either geographic performance or any of your functional areas such as mechanical or fluids, or anything of that kind or large deal performance? If you could -- and then as well, how are you thinking about perpetual for the rest of the year? And then a follow-up.","James E. Cashman","Well, all the business -- first, all of the businesses progressed. Mechanical has been pretty strong. I'd say the other thing is a small portion of that actually was catch-up from Q1. Some of it was pull forward from outlying quarters later in the year. So I mean, there were elements to that. I mean something comes in the pipeline and we normally have 6 to 9 months visibility, and we normally have those types of things and then -- but they don't always come in exactly on schedule, so -- and sometimes, they come forward. We had a little bit of that. We actually had a fair number of the larger deals that came in, some that came in a little bit larger than usual. But like I said, all the -- and then on your geography aspect, we tried to cover it as well as you can cover it in a brief commentary posted on the website. But every -- I mean, every one of the geographies grew double digits in constant currency, but they didn't grow within each region uniformly. So there were some that -- there were pockets of relative strength and weakness throughout each of the regions. So it really wasn't like there was one overall high tide that got raised in any one area.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. As follow-up, over the last 3 quarters, your maintenance revenue has grown more quickly than your license revenues. It had double-digit growth for each of the last 3 quarters in maintenance on a GAAP basis. And that's better than your license revenues. Is that -- can you comment on that? And is that, in some way, correlated perhaps to the earlier line of questioning about your deferred?","James E. Cashman","Well, again, the deferred, I think we tried to -- we covered the fact that yes, we are comparing some apples to oranges and things like that. Now the other thing is we've had a number of years of pretty good buildup if you look at -- of growth. And as a result of that, as the maintenance base continues to accumulate, even if we had a relatively softer Q1, we still have accumulation that is being pulled out of deferred. So it's not unusual for that to grow. That's one reason why seeing the license growth come back much more strongly in Q2 was a positive sign for us.","Operator","And our next question is from Richard Davis of Canaccord.","David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","It's DJ on the line. So, Maria, maybe first, I can just check my math on currency adjusted organic growth. Is it 10% in the quarter, is that right?","Maria T. Shields","Yes.","David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And then how fast did Apache grow? Can you ballpark comment on that?","James E. Cashman","In the mid- to upper-teens range.","David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe on the lease business, it's been flat sequentially the last couple of quarters, and I guess, the 3 variables that could impact that are obviously currency and then new business and retention. So I don't think we've heard you talk about retention on that side of the business in the past. Can you comment on why we're not seeing growth in the lease business? I figured that would be a pretty linear grower. Maybe any color there.","Maria T. Shields","Yes, DJ, what I'll say is for the core leases, i.e, the Apache side of the business that tend to be longer-term leases, we aren't seeing any issues. On the historical ANSYS side of the equation though, the lease base, it's kind of got different components. You have some that are just because of the nature of their business, they tend to lease. But you also have some that are kind of short-term rentals in nature that...","David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes, like first capacity type things?","Maria T. Shields","Yes. Or that are specific to projects that they're doing for the government for XYZ period of time, or smaller consulting shops that only need it for -- so they tend to have a little bit of churn, if you will, in that part of the lease space, but...","James E. Cashman","Again, I'll -- I'd like to jump in. I'm sorry, David.","Maria T. Shields","Okay.","James E. Cashman","But jump in on the core premises. If you look at it, now depending upon leases are more popular in certain parts of the world, and therefore, can be more subject, plus or minus, on currency, if you look at constant currency, it's in -- leases grew in the 8% to 9% range, which is given the fact that the other parts of the business that tended to grow a little bit quicker as people go into enterprise licenses, they tend to start to evolve into, if you will, owned versus rent type of scenarios. And as such, I think that if you look at the overall lease space, it's actually -- we saw a no real -- again, we didn't see anything leading up to trigger a concern along that line. And in fact, it's somewhat tied in with the historical patterns.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Ross MacMillan of Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask one on geography. One of the things that struck me in this report was the strength of the other European, non-German, non-U.K. business, which suggests that you actually saw strength maybe in parts of Europe that had been more challenging of late. Could you just comment on what you're seeing in that other European segment and where the strength came from?","James E. Cashman","Well, again, overall growth was pretty reasonable. I mean, if you saw Germany, for instance, which is a strong package, if you look at -- you're in that 13% range. But if you look at other areas that were contributing, yes, there are some areas that are down, those are in the news all the time, but in particular, the developing territories, most notably Russia. France had a good recovery this year. There's no doubt, some of the Mediterranean regions, a little bit more subdued, to put it mildly. But just to put things in that perspective, that's probably where you'd see the geography, where some of the main bulwarks continue to do pretty well and some of the developing territories did in excess of that.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So I guess that's my question. You're not seeing a turn in the countries within Europe necessarily that had been hardest hit yet? You're not seeing a turn...","James E. Cashman","No. But those weren't major components typically for us anyway. I'd probably categorize them as wobbly stable.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. [indiscernible]","James E. Cashman","[indiscernible] basis with that, didn't I?","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then just going back to whether it's deferred or backlog, just so I'm clear. If I look at -- let's look at the total deferred plus total backlog, and look at that number and think about that as something that we can think about using for bookings, where we look at revenues plus change in that total deferred and -- deferred revenue and backlog piece. Obviously, this was weaker than Q1, but would you have us look at for the blended rate, let's say, for the first half of the year, is that the right way to look at it? Because there can be issues of timing on maintenance renewals or lease renewals or other elements, so we should really be looking at this on a sort of more blended basis. Is that the right way to look at it?","James E. Cashman","Yes, if you intergrate [ph] it over time, it's somewhat analogous to climate versus weather. I mean, you can have a climate of a certain thing, but the temperature can spike up and down on any particular day.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So you don't think anything in your business from an order intake that was anything but in line to better than you expected?","James E. Cashman","Yes, I basically call it in line combined with a lot of the other stuff.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Mark Schappel of Benchmark.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Jim, could you just give us some additional color on your Japanese business? A while back, you made some big changes over there, and I was just -- it will be helpful for an update.","James E. Cashman","Well, I mean, that's obviously -- probably it'd take -- particularly at that level, it takes a long time. And we identified the issue months ago. Did some structural changes in there that probably, I won't comment on right now, but they obviously become manifest in a short time. But did some structural changes in there. There's no doubt that some of the economic churn and the currency swings on there have changed things quite a bit from a numbers' standpoint. But if you -- maybe if you look at the -- the most interesting thing is in Japan, if you look at what happens is while it actually showed a negative growth, it was largely currency driven because if you look at the constant currency growth in Japan, it was double digits. It's still in constant currency, which, to us, is a positive sign, a positive sign going forward. In fact, reversing the trend almost, I mean, it almost -- it was like 9.5% year-to-date. So I mean, that actually shows not just a -- it shows a trend line in there that we think is encouraging. But I will tell you, there's a lot of work that continues to go on right now. There's a lot of discussion with the recent election, and Abe and his -- and some of the things that he's talking about doing there and what will happen. There's still some industries there that are reeling a little bit from pretty intense global competitive pressure, and I don't think their responses have been fully mapped out or felt. So I think that, that's some other issues that we'll have to wait and see, but we have to still service those markets like we would everywhere else because everybody is facing global competition.","Operator","And our next question is from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Jim, your commentary suggests the outperformance was very balanced. It wasn't any one large deal.","James E. Cashman","That's correct.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes. So it makes me wonder, when I compare your performance in Q2 to the CAD vendors, the enterprise CAD vendors, you were much stronger. And Simulation is -- has more growth in it, we believe. But still, the divergence in the performance was kind of striking. I'm having trouble reconciling your performance with theirs. Any thoughts there since your -- you work with those vendors and you play in those markets? Why are you doing...","James E. Cashman","Well, the first thing I'll comment on is we don't walk in their shoes, so it's -- I'm sure we don't see all the nuances there, they may have a series of different challenges. I mean we focus on the market that we excel at, that we know where we've got things identified. We're working with, well, there's over 40,000 customers, but there's several hundred in earnest that we're working on some pretty exciting things with. But they also tend to be slow, steady and multi-year type of aspects. And so from us, I guess we're kind of seeing, if you look at it, we're seeing kind of things in line with the multi-year and in-year guidances that we've been given, the progression that we've been going on. The only -- and so from our standpoint, which is the only part we can really comment on, we just see what we have been talking about for a long time. And I know some quarters that falls on deaf ears, and some people don't get the story and things like that. So to us, that's the same. As regard to what others are doing, the only thing that we do notice sometimes is if there's a common link, the issues where we see the most headwinds seem to line up with areas where they see the most headwinds. But I don't know if there's -- I don't know the causality of that overall. So I just can't contrast to specifically. It's just we're focused and we're in a different market where we tend to have a very strong position.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then I want to ask you for my follow-up. With your share repurchase, it was a pretty large amount. I hadn't seen as large a quarterly repurchase. I went back to '05, I think, and I didn't see any large...","James E. Cashman","Well, it's close to that last year, Steve.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Oh, okay. Yes, yes, in the full year. On -- in the full year. But it does look like you're doing more there. I'm just wondering, are you kind of changing your approach or maybe ramping that up a little bit?","James E. Cashman","No, no, it was opportunistic, and quite frankly, the opportunity presented itself in Q1. We'd like to thank the market because we availed ourselves of the opportunity, and we think it works out well for our stockholders. But no, it was one of those opportunistic things. And we do not do things programmatically. We do have a philosophical direction, and then we try to manage that throughout the year. And that -- there's really nothing different along those lines. But a great opportunity occurred for us, much as it did when the stock was at 18, 19 several years back. And we actually happen to really believe in the story and the potential, so when that opportunity comes, we grab it.","Operator","And our next question is from Matt Williams of Evercore Partners.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just -- the sort of 40 new additions in the quarter, just wondering if you could provide some color on how much of that was in sort of the sales and marketing related area, and just a general update on sort of where your hiring plans on the sales side are relative to sort of what you thought at the beginning of the year?","James E. Cashman","Yes. Yes, well, it largely -- look, we always, in our infrastructure, we always add key components. And there were some of that going on, that happens all the time. But the lion's share of it, because we're largely about creating and promoting software, it was -- there was some in the development area, but the ongoing sales and support are probably the key aspects. They were more of the plurality of those additions. And I think, frankly, if we're talking 6 months from now, you'll probably see a similar thing leading up to our 2014 year. But that's where we continue to plan to evolve. So it's -- probably if I had to put it in order, I'd probably say sales and support first, with key developers as being a second. And then, like I said, throughout the organization, we added some key hires through there just to kind of strengthen and augment different areas of the business.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess, just as a follow-up, it would seem to indicate that the number of large deals was -- ticked down a little bit sequentially, no big surprise there, I don't guess. But given the results, it would seem to imply that sort of on the run rate side of the business or on the smaller deals side, that things were pretty good there. And just trying to get a sense around sort of how the recent additions on the sales side going back over the last couple of quarters, how they're performing, and if they're sort of impacting, I guess, the sort of lower end of the market as you might have thought.","James E. Cashman","Yes, well, the -- if you recall from the previous commentary, we talked about with the growth we've been experiencing, we had quite a few new salespeople, but we also had existing salespeople who had graduated into sales management position and were starting to get their sea legs under them on that. And yes, I think you'd -- probably what you saw this time was evidenced by a steady ramp-up. It's not like in 3 months, people then are fully -- they continue to grow, in our case, for some times over multiple years. But we saw that ramp-up actually take course. So other part of the question? Okay. There was a second part to that, that I missed, I'm sorry. I want to make sure I...","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","No, no, that's it. I mean, I understand there's some sort of time to ramp there. I was just curious if those sort of recent adds over the last couple of quarters are sort of ramping according to plan because it just seemed like outside of the large deals, the sort of small and midsized deals were pretty good in the quarters. So I was just curious.","James E. Cashman","Yes, the small and midsized deals were good. I mean, again, sequentially, it's a little bit difficult because of the renewal cycles. So I mean, things tend to follow different patterns. However, the large deals continue to accumulate on a comparable basis. That was the part that I thought that I might have missed. Now obviously, I mean, since we said that at the end of Q1, things had ramped up a little slower than we had hoped for, I wouldn't say that it's all according to plan. But now, if the curve shifted a little bit, we're kind of on the right slope now, albeit a little bit later. There's a little slower initiation of that, but now it's -- but I just want to say that we're -- everything is -- everything didn't happen in the first part of the year.","Operator","And the next question will come from Barbara Coffey of Standard & Poor's.","Barbara Coffey - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","When you take a look at what's going on in the electronics market, to some degree, you may have a bit of a different competitive landscape. Can you speak to why you think you're seeing such growth there? And sort of is it dislocation of existing competitors or new needs that you're meeting?","James E. Cashman","It's mostly greenfield for things where we think where we've enabled from a process and a breadth standpoint, people -- able utilize that. Now I think the thing is, again, when you say electronics, and I guess, when anybody says electronics, it -- that is getting to be such a pervasive term because some people might say, okay, well chipsets are doing this. Well, sometimes even when chipsets are in between releases, there's a lot of people that are trying to get a lot of electronics functionality. So when we talk about mechatronics, when we talk about fly-by-wire, when we talk about a whole range of things like that, they push toward mobility in personal devices and things. Then people are actually saying, okay, now, how can I get new generation of products either from new custom systems on chip type of things or from using existing building blocks to give additional functionality? The other thing is that with the electronic, something that's going on is it happens in cycles that are so rapid that sometimes they don't have the history, or sometimes the luxury, of doing these massive prototype and testing cycles. So in some cases, they actually tend to rely more on simulation. They tend to be more leaders along that line. That's probably about the only singularities that I see on the electronics side.","Barbara Coffey - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","And speaking to the competitive landscape on that?","James E. Cashman","Well, the competitive landscape, we really -- it's-- I think that's the one thing where just the depth and breadth of the product lines, it really -- the external competition really doesn't play much of a factor there. What does play a factor is internal company's organizational agility and the evolution of their processes and things like that. It's getting into things where the increased convergence of all the physics and increased complexity of their products actually start to manifest problems that historically weren't there before because they had kind of a beat on the old trajectories of technology. But as you start combining electronics and mechanics, all the battery technology, you can see that appearing in the headlines every day as to product issues that come. And they're largely driven around these increasingly complex new materials, new electronics, things like that going in. And in some cases, it's -- the pace of complexity is outpacing the ability of, if you will, traditional engineering wisdom to map. And it only takes a couple of outliers in your bell curve to create negative headlines.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.","Saket Kalia - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Saket here for Sterling. A few if I may. A quick question for you actually on the annual guidance. I guess the second quarter results came in about $7 million better than the midpoint for second quarter guidance, and full year is going up by about $3 million to $4 million. So is some of that from some of the pull forward effect that Jim spoke about earlier, or is there some other item that's maybe impacting that?","James E. Cashman","Oh, yes, no. Obviously, some of it did. I mean, yes, we talked about the pipeline, and just cause we -- things were pulled forward, a lot of times it's not that -- sometimes we're able to help affect it, and sometimes the customer just wants it quicker. And predicting how that will come, but -- so the bottom line is a portion of that, I'm sure, was affected by it. But keep in mind, each time we do a refresh on that, we do -- we continue to evolve our bottoms up forecast. We continue to build off of all of that. So it's -- part of it is net improvement and part of it is pulled forward.","Saket Kalia - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then in Europe, it sounded like your business there is still feeling some effects of a wobbly macro, if you will. And we're just starting to see manufacturing in Europe starting to stabilize. So how long do you think it'll take before your broader base of customers, I guess, starts to invest a little bit more consistently in Simulation?","James E. Cashman","Well, yes. Well, first of all, when the economy is good and things stabilize, that's a high tide that is like good for everybody. But I mean, even the standpoint of Europe, if you look at constant currency for the quarter, it was in that mid to upper teens range, too. So I mean, it was basically a pretty good story. I mean, again, it tends to be more, actually, I guess I'd say trifurcated in terms of the stable, bigger entities, the kind of the wobbly Mediterranean areas, as you mentioned it, and the developing and new territories. I mean, there's actually kind of 3 different stories all playing together and they amalgamate in. But there's no doubt that I think, yes, the environment, the headwinds have been strongest there, but our team has responded pretty well. And we are anchored by a pretty strong cadre of multinational customers that even if internally, Europe may be seeing things from an overall standpoint based about companies that are producing and marketing on a global stage. And from that standpoint, there's still a demand -- an inherent demand that keeps pace with that.","Saket Kalia - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then last question, if I could squeeze it in, and apologies if I missed it. But how many remaining open RECs for hiring do you have for the rest of 2013?","Maria T. Shields","I don't know. I would say it's probably at least 50 on the low end. I haven't looked recently, but no doubt, one of the things that we are planning for the second half is given the volatilities and the uncertainty around the first half, we are going to continue to hire because we've got a lot planned for 2014 and we want to make sure that we've got as much of the foundation built before we head into 2014 as we possibly can.","James E. Cashman","Yes, we have open RECs, but the other thing is as you get to the last half of the year, you're starting to bleed over into the operational planning for the ongoing year. And at that standpoint, we kind of re-factor everything. And some of those RECs may mutate into something else, some of whom will continue to be steady, and some of them may be obviated. And so it's -- that's why the numerics, as you get into the end of the year, is a little bit. But for ballpark, the number that Maria gave is a good working number.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions. I will turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, so in close, thanks, everybody, for the attendance and the questions. So kind of summarizing here, the emphasis for the remainder of 2013, it's going to be an ongoing focus on sales execution. We've got a major delivery of our software, ANSYS 15, so obviously, focusing on bringing that over the goal line. We're going to continue to navigate through, I don't know, whatever the new normal is, balancing short-term volatility against really, the long-term opportunity, which I think has been manifested over the last few years, the last decade, whatever. Because the one thing we do know for certain is that the customer receptivity and enthusiasm for the long term vision just continues to strengthen. So in fact, actually, a side note here is that many of us just spent the last quarter, as I mentioned, traveling to our annual user group meetings, and we had a chance to engage with somewhere around 15,000 of our customers and partners from around the globe. So the confidence comes directly from these -- those interactions. I mean, this is not just a generic thing. There's a lot of specific bolstering that came from our own user community. So basically, continue to be propelled by a strong combination of steady vision, a strong business model, again, those loyal customers and partners, obviously, leading technology, and of course, that base of technology and employees that have grown over the last number of years with us that have made it all possible. So I guess, I'll just thank you, all, for your time and we'll speak to you again next quarter.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

With us today are Jim Cashman, President and CEO; and Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Cashman. Please go ahead.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Good morning. And again, thank you, everyone, for joining us to discuss ANSYS' fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 financial results. So again, consistent with the -- our standard protocol, all of the general information and key topics relative to the quarter and the full year business results, as well as our future outlook, are included within this morning's earnings release and in the prepared remarks that we posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. So before we get started, I'll introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, for our Safe Harbor statement. Maria?","Maria T. Shields","Okay. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind you that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the world and our business as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","Consistent with our standard practice, during the course of the call and in the prepared remarks, we will be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K.","And one last housekeeping item, I'd also like to remind everyone that the ANSYS team will be hosting our Annual Investor Day here in Pittsburgh on March 12 at the Fairmont Hotel. If you're interested to learn more about it, please see our website at ansys.com for further details about the event. So now, Jim, I'll turn the call back over to you.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Thanks, Maria. Well, before we get to the Q&A, I'd like to briefly highlight a few important points about our Q4 2013 results and also some key assumptions underlying our Q1 and fiscal year 2014 outlook. So I'll begin by saying that 2013 was an important year for ANSYS in many respects. We finished out the year with a steady Q4 close that was directly in line with what we said on the last call. Revenue was at the midpoint of our guidance at $236.7 million. And as we predicted, there was no appreciable year-end budget flush. Operating margins and earnings were both above the upper end of the guidance. Now will note that our Q4 earnings included $11 million of incremental tax benefits or about $0.12 per diluted share. But even without these benefits, earnings were above the high end of our range.","In constant currency, that worked out to 7% revenue growth in Q4 and annual revenue growth of 9% for fiscal year 2013. We also reported constant currency revenue growth in all 3 of our major geographic regions for both the fourth quarter and the full year and in both major categories of revenue, the software license and the maintenance and service for the full year. The top line growth in turn yielded strong margins, cash flows and earnings for the quarter and the year.","We finished out the year with a total deferred revenue and backlog balance of $409.5 million, which is a new record year-end high for us. In the fourth quarter, we continued to return excess cash to our stockholders through the repurchase of a little over 500 -- well, 506,000 shares, which puts us at 1.5 million shares repurchased for 2013. And as you might have seen earlier in the week, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our existing program to a total of 3 million shares. So we're committed to continuing to repurchase shares in 2014 as one element for effectively deploying capital. I will note though, strategic acquisitions remain our top priority for this, however.","So in December, we heightened our dedication to partnering with our customers to achieve their visions by delivering ANSYS 15. This release provided a number of new and advanced multiphysics capability that were seamlessly brought together within the ANSYS Workbench environment. It's really a key milestone in delivering a simulation-driven product development that we've been talking about for a number of quarters and years. It's built on that platform that streamlines the workflow among different simulation applications, so it's really allowing us to keep on our path of redefining comprehensive simulation. And I think this puts us in a unique position to continue to increase footprint with our -- in our extensive installed base. Without a doubt, the depth and breadth of our simulation capabilities, coupled with the power and scalability of the Workbench platform, allows us to expand relationships, as well as solve new classes of problems at enterprise, at SMB and start-up levels.","So as we look back on our progress over the course of 2013, we continue to make some important strides with a vast and pretty broad array of customers spread across all geographies and industries. We're continuing to see the growing importance of product innovation, integrity and quality as being the really critical business issues requiring the use of advanced simulation and driving our prospects. I think if we take one little -- some other pieces of data here, it's evidenced by 33 customers in Q4 with orders in excess of $1 million. And actually, for 2013, we had 4 customers with orders above the $10 million range. So these are customer relationships that have been built over many years and, in some cases, many decades. And we'll continue to work to grow those relationships over time.","The key customer engagements are at the heart of what drives us in both our internal R&D roadmap, as well as those acquisitions that we'll be pursuing. Most recent example, of course, being the addition of EVEN and Reaction Design, which were small technology add-ins to the ANSYS family.","So everything that we accomplished in 2013 is largely aligned with what we discussed as key priorities and commitments at Investor Day last March, and we'll spend some time updating you at our event in the next couple of weeks.","So really, the key point here is there should be no doubt that driving double-digit organic top line growth has been and will continue to be one of our key areas of focus we as we enter into 2014. The array of global uncertainties and customer caution throughout 2013 posed challenges, but there were also some internal execution issues. We've discussed these on previous calls, and we've been diligently addressing those, particularly in our Asia-Pacific business. So we've made some important leadership changes for the region overall. In addition, over the last few months, we've added new sales leaders and other assets in Japan and India. And we're certain we believe that these are critical steps toward building a foundation for improved growth and customer engagement in the future, but they'll take some time to bear fruit.","So really, the result of all this is that we've initiated our outlook on revenue and EPS for Q1. So we've got this at non-GAAP revenue in the range of $212 million to $220 million and EPS in the $0.73 to $0.76 range. We've also reiterated and expanded our fiscal year 2014 outlook with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $939 million to $969 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.37. So there's more details around currency rate and other key assumptions that are contained in those prepared remarks that we posted on our Investor Relations homepage earlier this morning.","From a qualitative perspective, our Q1 guidance takes into account a few 7-figure deals, which can easily slip from one quarter to another, but still fall in that year. As the year progresses, we see a ramp-up of growth rates based primarily around 3 key factors. First, we're cognizant of the fact that our relatively new sales leadership team in Asia-Pacific will need some time to ramp up and for us to see some impact on the top line as the year progresses. Second, we've seen expanding global pipeline and forecast numbers. And finally, even some of the early stage ramp-up of our expanding on-demand options, both for private and public clouds, the latter actually was featured in the high-performance computing track of IBM's recent event regarding their platform computing cloud services.","So in conclusion, while there are certain compelling certainties that continue to drive us, the first is long-term confidence in the vision that we've been pursuing. The second is our commitment to invest from a long-term perspective in the realization of that vision. This can be seen in the investments that we made in 2013 and continue into 2014. So with this in mind, as always, we'll continue to be cognizant of the short-term realities, and we'll factor them into our business plans and guidance as we go forward.","So with that, we'll now open up the phone lines to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to drill into Japan. So if you set aside for a moment the kind of sales execution issues, we're seeing very kind of choppy results from a number of different companies if we kind of look at design broadly. Just wondering what you're seeing from just the end market demand and interest level separate of the sales force items.","James E. Cashman","Well we're seeing -- well, obviously, we're seeing the same kind of choppiness, and some of it is macro. And as we've talked about it, we think that some of it were things that we could do in response to that overall standpoint. So we talked about that. We talked about even the structural changes that we made the end of last year that will take some time to ramp up. With that being said, obviously, the government changes and some of the different policy changes, we'll have to see how those map out. There's no doubt that most notably I'd say that we've seen the electronics industry being challenged as that plays out on the global stage, and I think those are the things that are obvious to everybody so we don't need to really -- we can go into them, but I don't think we need to here. On the other hand though, we have been seeing some -- we have been seeing the signs of some pickup in Japan. And it's still going to be -- it's a long tie. You'll feel it'll take time to get out of that, but particularly in the industrials and the automotive sectors, just to pick a couple of those. So yes, we're seeing some of the same things, but we're at least seeing some glimmers of hope as opposed to a continuing stagnation or decline.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then my one follow-up would be, in terms of the Reaction acquisition, can you give us a little bit more color there and, especially, a little insight as to how much revenue is being included here for 2014?","James E. Cashman","Well there's -- first of all, there's very little revenue. It's pretty de minimis. It's along the lines of a plus or minus kind of in the $4 million kind of range. The real key thing is that, as we've mentioned over the last couple of years, there's been a lot of -- we talked a lot about automotive over the last couple years. Obviously, there's one element that relates to hybrid, but there's also things that relate to conventional internal combustion engines. We've also talked about the same thing when it comes to power generation and diesel engines and all the new clean standards going on. And we've also talked about the importance in the aero industry for increased fuel efficiency. What that's led us to is increasing demands. Remember I talked about ANSYS 15 being driven by our collaboration with partners. Well sometimes, that collaboration with partners is not about the next release. It's about developing capabilities that are not only for this year, but need -- are going to be growing items over the next few years. And obviously, one part of increased efficiency when you're talking about increasing the CAFE standards of automobiles, when you're talking about reducing fuel costs for airlines and things like that, it gets into the general field of combustion. And combustion now starts to bring in the chemical reaction of thermodynamics simulations in addition to some of the other ones that we've done, and it's part of that overall system modeling strategy. So with this, we've gotten what we think is the best technology going forward. We -- more importantly, we've gotten some really great expertise that will augment what we had inside and is a very difficult thing to find out. But we're -- I mean, we're working with customers specifically right now. And in particular, as you might guess by some of the industries that I've mentioned, these are key customers. These are global leading customers and they're the ones that are driving the next band of technology. And that's really what's behind it. So it's much more of a technology, people and long-term growth play with our customers than opposed to, clearly, a revenue thing, which at this point is relatively minimal.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird & Co.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","You referenced in your comments that you would look for improving growth next year, and one of the things you did was just improve pipeline, improve forecast. With Sterling's question, you talked about Japan may be seeing a little bit of encouragement in the pipe there. Are you seeing -- maybe you could expand that a little bit and talk about are you seeing it in other markets as well.","James E. Cashman","What you -- by other markets, I assume you mean outside of Japan or you mean outside of...","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes.","James E. Cashman","Okay, okay, thanks. So no, the bottom line is one thing is, yes, we have seen the numbers improve. We've seen positive signs. However, when we've been talking about something that is as important as Japan and some of these markets going forward, we're -- it'll be a long-term proof of the pudding. And we should see -- we should -- but we should see that kind of ramp-up that we've been -- that we're seeing right now, but that should apply to Japan. Japan is a very important market to us. Yes, as mentioned on previous calls, it's an economic cycle kind of in flux and everybody's going through different issues. Nevertheless, it is a particularly important market. If we look at other aspects, basically -- quite frankly, there's a mixed bag across many things. You can sit there and we can look at parts of the U.S. market and say \"Well, defense spending is going in this direction, but other things are going in other directions.\" If we look at Asia, you'll find if you look at a lot of things, if you can pierce the veil of the numbers of the Chinese macro situation, you can see that there a lot of things at play there. There's a lot of potential, but there's a lot of question marks. Likewise India, but we're seeing positive signs in each of those. There's always a lot of discussion about Europe, but we've -- our mainstays at Europe have been doing very well. Europe's been growing well with us. And apart from anything that might be happening within an intra-euro GDP, we're still driven by global-leading companies that are competing on the world market, not just within a euro bubble. With that being said though, we also see that some of the emerging markets in there that there's positive. But again, with any emerging market, there can be spurts and lags and things like that. And those are all factored into our forecast. So I think we're very much in the standpoint of some of our new capabilities, some of our investments are starting to show positive signs, but there are fits and starts across all parts of the global economy. And but based on the things we have, that's why we still see this discontinued ramp-up, which, of course, is then factored in to the guidance that we have going forward.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. Now that you referenced your on-demand options that you've been offering gaining more traction. And you've talked about them in the past, can you refresh us as to what they are and how that's playing out?","James E. Cashman","Yes, absolutely. And I will tell you, just like the Internet boom of the late 90s, and just like anything that's really spinning up there, there is -- there are these cycles of hype, followed by disillusionment, followed by reality, followed by growth. I mean, it's a pretty interesting dynamic if you look at anything that's entered the market. But as we've mentioned, there -- a lot of this is how you provide increased availability to customers. Now embedded in that is people have to be comfortable that -- and certain applications fit the model currently better than others. Simulation due to its high compute intensity, high bandwidth, sensitivity over the data that's in there and also the fact that the non-predictability of cost of a certain simulation. That changes kind of the commercialization model. Nevertheless, the things that we've been involved -- of course, as you know, we've had a Software-as-a-Service offering since way past -- over 10 years and running. But this is a different evolution of that. When I talk about the on-demand, it comes in a couple of different flavors. Note that I said private and public. Now the private gets around the issues of the unpredictability of the -- well, it mutes the unpredictability of cost and it handles the security issues. But what that is, is where customers may say, I'm going to embed a number of licenses, but I've got periods of peaks and valleys and things like that. I'd like to host the ability to kind of like pay for my steady state. But then if I want access to it, I want to have ready access to it and I'll pay almost -- I don't -- I hate to use this term, but like an electric-meter basis, but it's on-demand as I need it. And so we've actually engaged with some customers on that to come up with those plans. On the public side, think of it as version 3.0 of the old SaaS offering, where, actually, we launched it many years ago. We have several partners throughout the globe that also provide their own hosted on-demand applications through a public type of cloud. But then, as I mentioned just recently, we've been working with many leading companies, but there was one event just recently related to IBM's platform computing cloud services. And there were white papers and things like that available on the IBM website. Actually, we have copies, yes. So I mean, there's actually one here that basically is a white paper IBM application-ready solutions for ANSYS. So it's really based on an architecture that allows those things to have access. Now again, this will be one of those things where, first, it becomes available, and then people become getting used to it, and then they figure out what it means, and then they go through all the budget stuff and all the things that normally happen any time a company adopts something new. Nevertheless, it is one of those things that ramp up. And the reason we -- the reason we point that out is that, long-term, it's a very good thing no matter at what level it progresses. But we may have one of those things where someone that might have been thinking about buying in the short term, might have been thinking about buying a perpetual license. You might see them rolling with this. So you might see things where the lease numbers might go up. And the bottom line is if we get more users utilizing the software, increase the availability, to us, it's really just removing one barrier to people being able to get their wheels rolling on adoption. I'm sorry I went a little bit long, but since there are multiple dimensions to that, I just wanted to parse it into different sections.","Operator","Our next question is from Ross MacMillan of Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Jim, just trying to square what you said about some signs of improvement with one metric or a couple of metrics that we look at, which is looking at underlying billings and underlying bookings of the business, which don't look as if they've inflected yet. And normally, those would potentially be leading indicators because of your business model. I guess, the question is, if we don't see it in the aggregate bookings number, is it visible, if you could sort of parse that by regions or geographies? So, for example, if you look to the U.S., are you seeing that inflection already and we just don't see it because of the blended effect? Or maybe you could help me understand that.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well there's a couple of things. So for instance, if I start at micro and then we can expand out, if I look at Japan, we talked about the structural changes. We put those in place the latter part of the year. Keep in mind, Japan cycles tend to run a little bit off-skew of a normal calendar year. So Q4 is typically a really huge number -- Q4, I'm sorry, is their Q3, and it tends to be one of those little kind of dips in there. So we would expect to start to see maybe that first sign of things, given a little bit of maturity of the new assets we have in place there, combined with normal cycles in more in that -- this current quarter and upcoming quarter range, okay? So that's one thing. And it may sound like I'm always focusing on one market, but given the fact that Japan is in the teens in terms of total business for us, it can be pretty important. The second thing is, think in terms -- now we talked about what the choppiness might mean in terms of, as you get these bigger and bigger deals, and we said \"Hey, some might lift a couple of weeks just because it takes that long to get through the internal paper cycle of a customer,\" that really doesn't affect anything even though it might appear to -- it's trying to equate the temperature on a given day with climate type of thing. So you have to kind of balance and integrate over the time frame. So when that happens, it's also happening on the bookings. Keep in mind there's a couple of things that are happening. First of all, the numbers are getting larger, so the lumpiness can affect -- can seem to affect things. The other thing is deals -- some of the bookings, as evidenced by some of the changes that we've done in some of our reporting to highlight short-term and long-term backlog and deferred revenues, remember we've had discussions on that the last few quarters, because of this trending partially driven by Apache and partially driven by some other customers for longer-term bookings. You may get now this lumpiness on a booking basis that can actually expand over multiple years. I mean, those would be my initial takes on that. I know -- Maria, do you have -- I mean...","Maria T. Shields","I think that covers it.","James E. Cashman","Okay, okay. So does that make sense, Ross?","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. It definitely helps my thought process. Maybe one, just maybe for Maria. So just curious, obviously, when we came into '13, you had a revenue guide, which you ended up doing slightly less, but there was a fairly significant foreign exchange shift against you. But on earnings, you obviously did better. And this goes back to a margin -- I guess, predominantly a margin question, which is, how do you think you fared in terms of your hiring plans or your cost structure in '13? And as you think about '14, how are you thinking about hiring? And what's going to change, if you will, to '13 with regard to cost structure growth?","James E. Cashman","Hey, Ross, I'm going to butt in and let Maria think about that. The one thing I want to say is if you look at that, if you look at -- first of all, because Maria might not say this, but on the G&A side, we've been very, very effective and efficient, okay? But with that, because of that, even though we kept the margin strong, if you look at the last few years, we've actually continued to increase our R&D spending as a percentage. We've also talked about the increasing emphasis that we put on both the -- on both sides of the customer-facing aspect, the sales and support aspect. So we still have been able to continue to increase investment in what we think are the long-standing billing aspects. So, I mean, I just want to jump in. Maria, go, if you have anything.","Maria T. Shields","Yes, Ross, I will say that no doubt hiring -- and we talked about this throughout the course of many quarters now, hiring continues to be a challenge in certain areas. Just given the uniqueness of what we are looking for on -- but we are continuing and if you go and look at the website, you'll see there are many open positions. We are continuing to try to ramp up our hiring, as Jim mentioned, on particularly early in the year, relative to our customer-facing assets. Jim talked about some of the changes that we've made in Q4 and coming into Q1 relative to Asia-Pacific. So -- and if you take a look at our guidance for Q1, you'll see that the margins are slightly muted in anticipation of some of that hiring and the fact that we've added Reaction Design, which is not going to be a positive contribution to the margin early on, and a couple of events that we've had that we have already had in Q1 around our international sales conferences. So all of that's kind of factored into the lower margin.","James E. Cashman","But that's comparable to what we had last year.","Maria T. Shields","Yes, but we are...","James E. Cashman","I mean, in terms of...","Maria T. Shields","Yes, we are going to continue to invest because the reality is we totally understand the long-term opportunity, and there are things we have to invest in now to make sure that we can capture that opportunity as the market's ready for it.","James E. Cashman","And, Ross, the only thing, I think -- I know we've said this before, but since Maria mentioned the fact that, yes, it's a continual difficult hiring environment, but the other thing is because we don't view this as being something to help us get through a 1-year need. This is a -- to us, this is a 10-year building process. And because of that, we have to look at building from strength. And so when you tend to be a little pickier on the quality of people, it tends to take a little bit longer. That's a continuing reason for that.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Jim, you've mentioned a number of your key vertical markets, such as automotive, and that ties directly to the question I'd like to ask first, which is when we do the arithmetic on how much of your business is coming from some of your specific verticals, and you target 11 in all, it looks like you're somewhat dependent on a handful of those markets, at least recently for growth. It looks like electronics and semis together by far your largest business now did pretty well again in Q4 and for the year as a whole. Automotive looks like it did okay. Industrial equipment looks like it came back from an easy comp a year ago and from earlier last year. But would it be fair to say that you are somewhat tied to a relatively small number of verticals that need to do well for you? And how are you thinking about that into 2014 and perhaps, to correlate that, if you could, to some of your specific functional areas in terms of the mechanical and fluids businesses? Then a follow-up.","James E. Cashman","Well, keep in mind, the -- first of all, one thing if you look -- if we look at different trends, one thing the semi and the electronics together really doesn't work if you look historically with our buying things. So if you -- I mean, I guess, if you lump together enough things, you can come up with a really big number. But in reality, electronics gets into a whole range of different things from consumer electronics to diagnostics to a range of that. And those things will happen even if there might be a down-trending in the -- in various chip things [ph]. However, chip, there's a number of a big push now for, if you look at the communication standards, if you look at the dropping into the lower nanometer ranges, if you look at the ongoing requirements for power and stability and things like that, it continues on. But the one thing, since you broached over into other physics, keep in mind, when we mention a major electronics company, and I don't want to mention any specific one by name. But it's not just electronics stuff. They're worried about structural vibration. They're worried about thermal. They're worried about -- so they tend to be big customers from the electromagnetic side, from the electronics side, from the fluids and mechanical side. So they really are -- and in fact in some cases, they actually become the leaders, if you will, in pushing the multiphysics because of the short design cycles that they have, the rapid product obsolescence and generational turnovers of products and the like. So with that standpoint, the other thing I'd say is even if you see percentages, even when we talk about growth in one industry, we're usually talking about relative growth because it's -- apart from the defense sector, it's hard to think of an industry where we have an industrial decline. Now if we talk about the energy sector, we've talked about how oil may rise, and the oil and petroleum industries may rise and fall, but those ultimately tend to be replaced by alternate energy, by wind, sometimes nuclear. But depending upon, if you will, political and other kinds -- and environmental kind of concerns, those can change. So it's kind of like -- and that's why you never see the sector of the pie really swing by manic amounts. I mean, when we see growth in the industry, it might -- that might creep from 13% up to 14% or 15%, but you don't see these manic kind of swings.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Understood. My follow-up has to do with Apache, which has clearly been a very significant source of incremental revenue and growth for you since you bought them, including last year. And looks like they're now, and correct me if I'm wrong, at about an $80 million or so revenue run rate per year. But historically, within the EDA market, which you're now in with them, it'd be very difficult for a specialty company in that market to get much past $100 million of revenue when they address this very specific niche as they do, and they already have half of their addressed category as best we can tell. So is it your expectation that the growth from Apache will necessarily have to slow, as well as they've done just because of the somewhat natural limitations of the end markets? And if that were to occur, what other brand or functional areas you think might be able to compensate?","James E. Cashman","Well, first of all, natural tendencies like you say, yes, those have been observed over the decades in the industry. Second of all, clearly as denominators get larger, the standard if we're going that changes. So yes, I would think you would look at that, but still being a strong part of our business, if you look at the long-term customer relationships, if you look at the strengthening relationships, I mean, actually there's probably more involved in the different ebbs and flows of specific winners and losers in the customer industry space than that. However, your premise is not faulty in terms of generalities, but if you talk about now bridging beyond just the -- primarily a heavy chip focus and starting to blend that into how it interacts and trades off with other things, we're actually -- in the first couple years we really helped -- we tried to help progress the business but also not impede the natural flow of it. Over the last year, and we talked about this last year, we're now starting to branch into the combination of getting away from a heavy chip orientation to a chip package system orientation. When you get the package system, all of a sudden you get to now component suppliers, you get into systems, you get into OEMs and you get into broader range of things. Now those will take some time to gestate, but the good news is we're already on the road of doing that and working with a couple of -- adding new customers to the base. So there was an element of maintaining their own internal trajectory. Second of all, linking between places where both they and we were strong. And the third phase of this is now introducing these kind of capabilities into an overall system multiphysics kind of approach. And that's really kind of the generational phase that we're in now. But again, if we just went status quo and did nothing and did nothing to leverage it, yes, your basic premises are what's happened many times in the industry.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Let's see, I guess, I'll ask 2 here. So my first question, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I do want to clarify -- verify something here on electronics. Jim, in your remarks, you alluded to the idea that electronics is difficult right now. And then in Jay's question, it sounds as if you're saying it's actually doing as good or maybe even better than other sectors. Can you just clarify how is that doing globally [indiscernible]?","James E. Cashman","Well the other second part of what you said, when I was talking to Jay, I was answering globally. The earlier comment you're talking to might have been when I was saying we were -- I was focusing on Japan.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it is doing pretty well globally compared to the other sectors?","James E. Cashman","Yes, yes. But like I said in Japan -- but the Japan thing I was saying, that wasn't an ANSYS Japan-specific thing. That was a\u2026","[Technical Difficulty]","But on the Japan thing, we were noting that while automotive and industrial and some other sectors were starting to show some begrudging improvement, the electronics is one that on a global stage we've seen the traditional Japanese dominance being somewhat supplanted by other regions of the world. And we in turn have felt some of those effects ourselves in Japan. So that's maybe the differential if I'm hearing you right.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, so I'll ask one follow-up and then I'll mute here. Talk a little bit about the logic of the share repurchases. It looks as if it's becoming more regular. So is that kind of what we should expect going forward? And how does that relate to your priorities for the use of cash?","James E. Cashman","Well, like I tried to say in some of the talking bullets -- I might have not done it as well as I like, but strategic acquisitions continues to be our #1. But again, when it's strategic, then there's lot of factors actually bringing those in. It's not just -- I mean, it's not just piling anything on that we can. But with that in mind, we also -- if you look at as we've increased our own scale the cash flows are pretty healthy, and there are a number of ways that we'd like to return that element there. So what we were really signaling was that this continues to be a strong albeit secondary element of our shareholder return strategy. We're not going to let too much pile up. We're always cognizant of what we might be doing over the next upcoming quarters and years on acquisitions. But so we have to be mindful of that. But the other thing is that we've always said that we're going to do it very studiously and pragmatically. And when the markets are volatile, it tends to provide -- it provides a multitude of opportunities, and we try to fit in with those amidst the volume trading restrictions and blackout periods and things like that. But it just becomes -- really, I guess, it's just more of the same, but in this particular environment, there were more opportunities and we were -- if we look at the long-term prospects, it was a good supplemental use of our cash. Maria, do you have -- if you want to add anything that you think I...","Maria T. Shields","Yes, and I'll just say as to reiterate to Jim's point, we are going to continue to pursue acquisitions. Some of them will be larger in nature, but those tend to take a little bit longer to gestate and bring together because I think if you look historically, we believe that's what's provided the greatest stockholder value. But we are also cognizant that there are times in the market where the price is extremely attractive and given our cash position, that we feel it's a really good opportunity to offset some of the dilution from our own equity grants and to return some cash to our stockholders.","James E. Cashman","And of course, the other thing is, I mean, we'll also say that some of the valuations are tending to be -- even looking at recent news, can tend to be pretty all over the map. So that always tends to complicate the process.","Operator","Our next question is from Evan Clark [ph] of Canaccord Genuity.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","It's actually Richard Davis. Hey, how do you think about the mix of when you're kind of thinking about kind of you're talking about growing the business faster and things like that? I mean, part of it is seat count growth, part of it is selling to existing people more stuff. Is it 50-50 or how do you think about that because, typically, the number of engineers grows, I don't know, 3% a year or something like that?","James E. Cashman","Right, yes. And keep in mind, there's -- in our mind, it's not so much the number of engineers growing, but there's a latent pool of engineers that would be able to get to that. Now actually, I think we'll talk about a little bit at Investor Day coming up, just as a cheap teaser. But if you look at it, yes, the cross-selling is one aspect. That tends to take longer because that has more organizational barriers versus traditional silos of usage. We've talked about high-performance computing, the intensity aspect. That one has been growing quite a bit as people were a little reticent to -- or hesitant to hold -- to hire new people. But the new users and, as I mentioned, we start to see that now over the past couple of years when things were a little bit slower. We talked about the fact that the enterprise customers were growing a little bit more. We're starting to see more surge -- not surge. That's a strong word. We're seeing more of a pickup in the SMB, and even in some of the introductory levels. And that's where some of the -- in addition to our traditional ways, where starting to crack the sieve a little bit with the on-demand for private and even moving into public provides a little bit more. I think what you'll see continually is that the multiphysics will probably pick up a little bit more over the next 2, 3 years than it did. And I think number of users also will see -- start to pick up also. I mean, the biggest issues right now, and we've talked about this for a couple years, is really now that the technology has kind of proven itself and the leaders have demonstrated the value of it, but now you get to the point of organizations' abilities to actually bring it in. And that gets to process changes and sometimes, organizational adjustments. And those are some of the things that tend to be ones that we have to work through. But that's the way that I prioritize them right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Schappel of Benchmark.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Jim, back to Reaction Design. They appear to have a particular focus in combustion reactions, internal combustion engines. And I was just wondering if their technology would be transferable to other chemistry-based areas like, say, that sort of continuous reactors?","James E. Cashman","No, no, absolute -- well I don't know about that particular one, but we've -- I've even talked to them over the last few weeks about you look at some of the -- you look at another hot topic is like battery. I mean, there's some different physics and different phase-related things. But we look at -- there's a lot of chemical reaction going on in there. It's just that the expertise has been built up in the customer. I mean, any small company has to focus their assets to what makes the most sense. That also tends to highly align with where our short-term growth aspects are going on. But the one thing that I think is undeniable is just like a few years ago, people thought we were a little bit loopy for trying to combine the mechanical and electronics world. And I think we've kind of demonstrated the early phases of that. And then people said, \"Well, why are you doing embedded software?\" And I think we've started to show some of that. I think now you look at some of these other aspects, I'm not sure exactly what order we'll be attacking some of these things, but I know teams are already looking at this overall aspect of saying, \"Well now, let's look at the chemical reaction world and kind of combine that with the physics world because that does play a major factor in the performance and the environmental issues related to complete systems.\" And after all, we're about complete virtual prototyping. So I mean it all plays in, but right now, we've got a short-term need that we can harvest over the next 2 or 3 years. And we've got a base of people that can actually start to crack the next set of nuts based on what our customer base will tend to want to partner with us on because some of these things will be advanced research, and we'll want to take our pure calculational aspects and combine that with things that they've experienced in the field and problems that they're trying to solve. But yes, we will see that move on right now, but that's something that we can develop over the next few years. But again, think of this as one more branch of science that goes into improving product quality. And it just happens to be driven by a couple of very topical, important issues that companies are struggling with right now. And they happen to be our top customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Williams of Evercore.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just, I think, kind of one for me. You mentioned some of the success you've had in getting those 4 customers over to $1 million in annual spend. And I know increasing users and increasing your footprint in some of the larger accounts has been a focus for a while. So I'm just wondering how transferable or repeatable are some of the steps that you're doing to sort of really step up usage within some of the larger accounts? How does that opportunity look over time and, I guess, sort of how repeatable is sort of the sales motion around that?","James E. Cashman","Okay. Bottom line is, I mean, I can say, and people who know me know I don't say this very often, but I'm like 100% certain that it's transferable. I mean, let's say it's 99.97% or how many sigma you want to throw in there. The big question is time. And that relates sometimes -- sometimes, that relates to governmental and regulatory pressures being put on. Sometimes, it's related to competitive velocity in there. Sometimes, it's related to the individual company and the mindset. Some companies will go after this very defensively and quick to follow, and others will go at it -- seize it as a competitive advantage. So the applicability, let's just say, it's incredibly broad-based. Now the other thing I'd say is, building up to that level, it tends to go over time. And most of the time we're talking about 7-figure customers, we're talking about people that have just built up and they tend to be -- continue to repeat and then gradually people get over on the -- over time, then that has given rise to the advent, which is totally new to us for getting into 8-figure customers. The only thing I would say is on the 8-figure customers, it's a very small sample size. One can do that with a huge paid-up license in 1 year, and it may not repeat. They may just be only a high 7-figure one next year. But it would still be a growing base going forward. So I'd just put that caveat in there for people that think that just everything statistically goes up. The net massing of that is still positive. We actually see more and more customers starting to move into that range, but it is a long process. All of those big customers I talked about, most of them we've been building for 10, 15 or maybe even more years, if you count the first seed planting going on. And I would say right now, there still is a large, large part of our market that is still somewhat transactional based. I mean, there are still a large part of our customer base that is highly focused around a single physics. I'd say an increasing number of them are saying, \"Well, you know, we like the endgame of how these things can all play together,\" and that's tended to increase our prospects. But if you look at the reality -- and that's some of the things we'll try to dig into a little bit more and with the advantage of some graphics at the Investor Day.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. I appreciate the color. Maybe just one quick one on Esterel. I know you guys have been fairly measured in how you go to your customers with that product. How -- and I know the reception has been very positive. So just maybe a quick update there and then maybe how you're thinking about driving that business going forward.","James E. Cashman","So the bottom line is they've been growing faster than the company average. The bottom line is we've been investing a little bit higher than the company average, as you correctly noted. And for conscious reasons that we did was we didn't want to swamp our entire organization over their limited but growing support base and actually paralyze them. So we had taken targeted accounts in different regions. We had put where places where we had prequalified opportunities going forward. I'll tell you, those things have progressed really well. I mean, not every one of them was a hit, but we had a lot of success, and that's borne out in every metric we can do. So what do we do in this next year? Well, we've actually kind of expanded that footprint. But now we're tending to build capacity to be able to fill up with that. But we're still doing it on a targeted basis. I mean, it's really kind of, if you will, it's just now the next plateau of something that we've kind of outlined a few quarters ago when we were first talking about coming in league with Esterel.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe more a request than a question. We still got lots of questions over what the active user base looks like. Didn't know if you could comment here or if that might be something you can dive into at the Analyst Day, but that would be great.","James E. Cashman","Well, I think I would like to try to dive in because, I mean, apart from the stuff that we've been telling you, I don't want to just kind of, like, guess numbers here. And the other thing is the one, as I've mentioned over previous years, when everybody talks about installed base and user counts and things like that, that somewhat tends to be -- people tend to use different metrics for it and it tends to be the abused kind of aspect. So I'm not even sure how to really parse that down, but I don't want to just start spinning out numbers here. But I understand the issue, it's not a -- I mean, we know it's large. We know it's -- I guess, I'm really not sure how we actually count when we have package seats and things like that. The enterprise pricing model and availability, the on-demand aspects tend to make it very difficult. So I think it's one of those ones that can't be covered in a quick question on the call. But I've heard the request and what we'll try to do is at least come up with a more evolved representation of what some of these things mean and start to pick that up starting with the Investor Day and try to build that up over time. I mean, I understand the issue.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Now that would be great. And even if it's the active licenses because we know that you've got users out there that are using multiple licenses to try to run multiple simulations, et cetera. So we're not trying to -- we just want to see what that active base looks like.","James E. Cashman","Understood. No, it's not an unreasonable request. It's just there'll be so many conditions of saying here's how we define things, here's how it maps up, here's how we count and things like that. So if we just give a number right now, maybe 90% of the people here will probably misinterpret it or apply a different filter to view it.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Cashman for any closing remarks.","James E. Cashman","Well, I don't know what else I can say after that question, I think. But again, thanks, everybody, for bearing through the Q&A session. But thanks, actually, thanks for the questions. In closing, what else can I say? 2013, another solid year for ANSYS, closed it out as we predicted. If you haven't guessed already and then the questions may have helped us, we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for 2014 and beyond. Again, acknowledge there are going to be challenges along the way, not unlike 2013. But as always, the one thing we will say there is going to be a continued focus on technological expansion, differentiation of technology, as well as our operational execution, earnings growth, customer engagement. But again, the emphasis for 2014 will be that focus on driving towards that top line double-digit growth. So what's been with us for all the years we've been talking about this. We're continued to be propelled by a long, strong combination of our long-term vision. I think the business model has proven itself through a number of different conditions. Obviously, we've got these loyal customers who are growing with us. The partners have been with us for decades. Obviously, the technology speaks for itself and, of course, the exceptional employees that -- and team that have actually made all that possible over many decades. So actually, thank you for joining us this morning. Look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day here in Pittsburgh, or we'll catch you the next cycle around at the next call. Thanks again.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"2199":["ANSYS, Inc.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Annette Arribas, Senior Director, Global Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Annette Arribas","Good morning everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks document have been posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all the key financial information and supporting data relative to our third quarter financial results and business update as well as our Q4 and full year 2019 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. In addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website.","Additionally, the company\u2019s reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information.","During this call and in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. Please take any reference to revenue to mean revenue under ASC 606. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures under ASC 606 is included in this morning\u2019s earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.","I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO Ajei Gopal for his opening remarks. Ajei?","Ajei Gopal","Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was another exceptional quarter for ANSYS. We surpassed the high-end of our guidance in both revenue and earnings per share. Our annual contract value or ACV, came in at a robust 14% growth in constant currency. Based on our continued outstanding financial performance and the ongoing strength of our pipeline, I'm excited to announce that we are again increasing our 2019 revenue, EPS and ACV guidance. Maria will provide the details in a few minutes.","Q3 was about execution across all aspects of our business and all our normal routes to market. This strong across the board performance highlights the robustness and the resilience of the ANSYS business. Considering sales activity from a geographical perspective, the Americas have contributed strong consistent performance throughout the year. As we had expected, Europe had a slower first half of the year, but Q3 was strong and we expect Q4 to also be robust based on some larger deals in the pipeline.","Asia has also performed well this year, but full year growth in China is expected to be muted as a result of the ongoing trade restrictions. Our guidance, of course, takes this consideration into account. Our channel, which continues to represent about a quarter of our sales activity, grew consistently with our direct business. From an industry perspective, the semiconductor and high-tech, automotive and aerospace and defense verticals continue to lead the way.","As has been the case for many quarters, our larger deals are driven by the strength of our multiphysics portfolio. In fact, over 80% of our largest deals in Q3 included four or more products across our physics suite. Our enterprise and strategic accounts performed well and included three customers with orders in the eighth figure range. Let me share a few of our Q3 successes. A leading innovator in high tech materials and processes signed a $12 million multiyear agreement to develop next-generation OEM component. With increased access to simulation, more engineers of the company can use ANSYS to provide tailored solutions for its customers. Through a new multi-million dollar deal, ANSYS multi-physics solutions are enabling and electronics leader to be the first to market. This company has demonstrated that ANSYS can materially reduce the number of physical prototypes saving $5 million in one of its business groups alone.","Another large technology company signed an eight-figure agreement to drive innovation in new markets while growing its footprint in existing business segments. The company is using ANSYS from silicon through the entire platform to innovate, reduce time to market, and mitigate the risk of next-generation mobile phone and data center chips. Only ANSYS could fulfill its demand for fast, high-fidelity, multi-physics modeling resulting in a nice win over our competition.","On our recent call, I've highlighted specific product or solution areas in the ANSYS portfolio. For example, in Q1, I discussed our leadership in electronics with products such as ANSYS HFSS and ANSYS RedHawk. On our last call, we discussed our multi-physics autonomy solution, which includes core products like ANSYS HFSS, coupled with leading technologies that we've obtained through recent acquisitions including medini and OPTIS.","With so many recent advances in ANSYS Mechanical, as well as the acquisition of LSCC, on this call I'd like to focus on our mechanical and structures products. ANSYS was founded as a mechanical and structural simulation company, and nearly 50 years later that product line continues to accelerate. Customers use our mechanical simulate to validate the design, structural integrity, and the performance of their product across a broad spectrum of applications, from jet turbine blades to offshore oil pumping platforms and everything in between. That's due in part to our ongoing focus on accuracy.","We are also consistently driving new functionality and ease of use into ANSYS Mechanical including innovations that we added in Q3 for streamlined and simplified workflows, as well as the prediction of electronic hardware failure gained from our acquisition of DFR Solutions. Those enhancements and many more are resonating with new and existing customers.","Our recent acquisition of LSTC is further broadening our footprint in the structure space. LSTC is the world's premier provider of explicit dynamics and other advanced finite element analysis technology. LSTC\u2019s flagship product, LS-DYNA is used to simulate high speed, short duration events, for example, a cell phone drop or an automotive crash. In fact, the automotive industry has widely adopted LS-DYNA to accurately predict a vehicle's behavior and the effects on occupants during a collision.","Over the years, LSTC has evolved its solutions from a leading explicit dynamic solver to a broad multi-physics suite that can solve a range of use cases, from automotive impacts, to airbags, to aerospace and defense applications, and beyond. The LSTC technology and customer use cases are complementary to and dovetails nicely with the broader ANSYS Mechanical products which solve for longer-term phenomena like structural loads and vibrations.","While ANSYS has partnered with LSTC for nearly 25 years, we had focused on a limited set of LS-DYNA used cases and not on the primary used cases such as automotive crash testing. Now that LSTC is part of ANSYS, our comprehensive go-to market capabilities will enable us to better serve the automotive, aerospace and defense and other markets with the full breadth and depth of the LS-DYNA suite. And by combining our product portfolios, we will be able to solve even more challenging customer problems than either company could individually.","Industry legend, John Hallquist founded LSTC and he will remain part of the ANSYS team. Both LSTC and ANSYS share a similar culture. Based on a profound respect for technology and an unwavering commitments to customer success. And I'm excited that the combination will allow ANSYS customers to deliver more sophisticated products faster and more efficiently than ever before.","We also called on our acquisition of Dynardo, a leading provider of multidisciplinary analysis and optimization technology. An existing ANSYS partner, Dynardo developed a state-of-the-art solutions for optimization, uncertainty quantification, robustness, sensitivity analysis and data mining. And while this acquisition isn't financially material, adding Dynardo\u2019s products into the ANSYS portfolio will give customers access to the full suite of process integration and robust design tools.","Empowering users to identify optimal product designs faster and more economically. I'm delighted to welcome the LSTC and Dynardo employees into our ANSYS family. We also continue to make strong progress with integrating technology from our earlier acquisitions into our portfolio, as we saw in our newly released ANSYS 2019 R3. On the materials side, we introduced ANSYS Granta materials data for simulation, which increases the number of off-the-shelf materials available directly in our flagship products. With DfR solutions, we have upgraded the preprocessor and core solving engine using ANSYS technology. Our sales teams have embraced these upgrades, helping us to expand existing accounts, open sales opportunities at new customers and accelerate pending deals.","On the partnership side, we recently announced an alliance with Microsoft to help mutual customers improve operations through Digital Twins. This collaboration will empower customers to more accurately predict an assets future performance and reduce unscheduled downtime expenses using Azure Digital Twins and ANSYS Twin Builder.","We also announced an exclusive partnership with Motor Design Limited to distribute its Motor-CAD software. Motor-CAD enables design engineers to evaluate motor topologies and concepts across the full operating range. And to produce designs that are optimized for performance, efficiency and size. By combining their electric motor design software tool with our multiphysics analysis capabilities, we are extending simulation into the design phase of the electric machine product lifecycle.","Our previously announced partnerships continue to build momentum. In its most recent earnings call, PTC reported 126 transactions, a 66% increase in the number of deals from the previous quarter for Creo Simulation Live, its CAD solution powered by ANSYS Discovery Live. PTC expects the adoption to further accelerate in its next fiscal year.","Turning now to our environmental, social and governance initiatives, STEM Education remains a key element of our ESG focus I was excited last week to attend the opening of ANSYS Hall, a new engineering building complete with state-of-the-art space on the campus of the Carnegie Mellon University here in Pittsburgh. As part of our partnership with CMU, we are providing students with access to the ANSYS portfolio, enabling them to prepare for life outside of academia by solving real world engineering challenges.","We have also expanded our Women in Technology effort through a grant to the Lila Poonawalla Foundation which provides scholarships and training for aspiring female engineers in India. These initiatives are incredibly exciting to all of us at ANSYS as we help to train the next generation of engineers and scientists.","In summary, I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in the third quarter, and frankly, for all of 2019. We recorded another quarter of double-digit top line growth and best-in-class margins. We are in a growing market with a winning strategy of pervasive simulation and a world-class product portfolio bolstered by a strong pipeline and an established track record of execution. That gives us tremendous confidence as we close our 2019 and prepare for 2020.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. Maria?","Maria Shields","Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Now, let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our very strong third quarter financial performance, and provide color around our outlook and key assumptions for Q4. Consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.","Before we dig into the details, I'd like to point out that we have increased our 2019 guidance, not only to include the impact of our recently closed LSTC and Dynardo acquisitions, but also to take into account the strength of the stand-alone ANSYS business and our improved outlook on the organic pipeline of opportunities.","Our record Q3 results reflect continued customer and business momentum combined with solid execution across the enterprise. We finished the quarter with constant currency revenue growth of 19% and operating margin and EPS results that were also above the high end of our Q3 guidance ranges. The revenue performance in Q3 was driven by strong sales execution including a larger dollar value of multi-year lease transaction than we initially forecasted coming into the quarter. This is reflected in the strong lease revenue growth that we reported for Q3 and a continuation of the growth trend that we have seen throughout this year.","The combination of our success in delivering on our 2019 financial commitment and the strength of our sales pipeline gives us confidence that we are on a path to continue to execute against our strategic priorities and to deliver another year of record financial performance in 2019.","Key financial metrics for the quarter begin with total revenue of $345 million. Q3 ACV totaled $291 million or constant currency growth of 14% with 73% of ACV in the quarter coming from recurring sources. The increase in software lease license sales, combined with strong maintenance renewals, contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q3 total of $650 million, a 19% increase over last year\u2019s comparable balance.","Moving on to profitability, in Q3, we continue to build on our great first half financial performance with strong top line result that helps to drive a third quarter gross margin of 90%, and an operating margin of 43%. We also reported record third quarter EPS of $1.42, which increased 8%, despite an $0.08 tax benefit in the prior-year quarter related to entity restructuring activities.","With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q3 was 21%, and, for Q4, we expect our rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Our cash flow from operations grew 9% and totaled $120 million for the third quarter and $360 million for the first nine months. And we closed Q3 with the total $733 million in cash and short-term investments.","Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. We are pleased to yet again increase guidance for the full year, while also initiating our Q4 outlook. First, focusing on the existing business, we have increased our full year outlook to reflect the very strong performance in Q3, combined with positive business momentum and our ability to continue to execute and deliver on our commitments as we look ahead to close out 2019.","Second, we've incorporated contributions to our full year guidance from the recent acquisition of LSTC and Dynardo, deals that have both closed in the past week. This includes an incremental $10 million in revenue for 2019, as well as the impacts from both the use of the capital and the issuance of new debt and equity to fund the acquisition.","In connection with the acquisition of LSTC, we recently added $500 million in term debt at an initial interest rate of approximately 3% and we also issued 1.4 million shares. Before I get into specific numbers, let me just provide a brief comment with respect to the impact of the ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China.","Consistent with what we had previously communicated, our outlook for the remainder of 2019 takes into consideration our reduced expectations from China. We are also assuming that the current export restriction and the entity lift will remain in effect throughout the remainder of this year. Moreover, we remind investors that China accounted for less than 5% of our total revenue in 2018 and accounts for approximately 4% of our revenue in the first nine months of 2019.","Now, let me move to the details of our outlook. For Q4, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $454 million to $479 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $2.05. For the full year, we're increasing both revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.515 billion or constant currency growth in the range of 16% to 18% and EPS in the range of $6.20 and $6.38.","We are also increasing our ACV outlook for 2019 to a range of $1.460 billion to $1.480 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 12% to 13%.","With respect to annual operating cash flow we are also increasing the midpoint of our outlook by $7.5 million for 2019 to a range of $485 million to $510 million.","Looking ahead the Q4, we're expecting operating margins of 45% to 46.5%. And for the full year, we're increasing our forecast for annual operating margin to a range of 44.5% to 45%. Further details around specific currency rates and the other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q4 as 2019 are contained in the prepared remarks document.","Just to close this out on the topic of guidance, our outlook for the remainder of 2019 factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussion, geopolitical situation, and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry diverse customer base.","It also reflects continued investments related to several business infrastructure and digital transformation project, increased sales commission and personnel-related costs as well as the financial impact of the two most recent acquisitions.","As we look ahead into 2020, I'd like to remind you that our recent Investor Day, I've shared our longer-term financial metrics in the form of an ACV target for 2022. Given the increased variability in revenue under ASC 606 due to the accounting treatment of multi-year leases, we provide ACV as a supplemental financial matter to help evaluate the performance of the business.","Coming over the long-term, ACV and revenue lead to the exact same number. However, it is important to know that there will be years where ACB growth lags revenue growth, as we will see in 2019; and other years were ACV growth will lead revenue growth. Consistent with this dynamic, we will continue to encourage you to gauge the operating strength of ANSYS by focusing on our annual ACV performance in addition to our other key financial metrics. In line with our practice from the past few years, we will provide more detailed guidance on 2020 once we finalized our annual planning process and close out 2019.","And in summary, we delivered another quarter of excellent financial performance with strength across our key financial metrics: ACV, top line growth, operating margin, EPS, operating cash flow, and deferred revenue and backlog. The strong third quarter and year-to-date results give us confidence that we are on a path to deliver on our increased 2019 financial commitment as well as our longer term 2022 financial target.","And, operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Talanian","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maria, could you give us a sense for the inorganic contribution to ACV in 3Q? How you're thinking about for 4Q and how much of the ACV guide increase was organic versus inorganic?","Maria Shields","Yes. So, with respect to Q3, the ACV was you had about 3% to 4% of the quarterly growth was from the acquisitions. You saw we broke out relative to the two new acquisitions were for the remainder of 2019 we broke out separately in the prepared remarks. So, with respect to their contributions, it's about $10 million from those two for the remainder of the year.","Kenneth Talanian","And you're looking at it from a perspective of both revenue in ACV for the $10 million or\u2026","Maria Shields","Yes, yes.","Kenneth Talanian","Okay. I mean just as a quick follow up on that. It looks like LSTC was more in the range of $60 million in terms of ACV. I would have thought the ACV portion in 4Q would be a bit higher than what we're recognizing on revenue?","Maria Shields","It's only two months. It\u2019s only two months.","Kenneth Talanian","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Ken Wong","Hi. Good morning, guys. This question is for Ajei. So, we all get asked about the sustainability of the (inaudible) momentum that you guys have been having. Any reason to think that the surge in activity these past 18 months would impact next year\u2019s pipeline and beyond?","Ajei Gopal","Thanks for the question. And so, as you \u2013 as I said at the Investor Day, which we had in September, we have started to focus on these larger accounts or these so-called enterprise accounts. And we've increased the of the number of those accounts from just a handful, a little over a dozen a couple of years ago to around 85 today.","And as I mentioned during Investor Day, and I think I walked through a case study of a particular customer, which shows how by focusing on that customer as we would with an enterprise \u2013 as we do with enterprise accounts, by focusing on the customer, we were able to deliver significantly incremental value to that customer, a customer based upon the capability and the full suite of our portfolio. And that translates into incremental growth opportunity.","So, for that particular customer that I walk through, we had a modest growth for a number of years. And then as we started to focus with them on an enterprise account, we grew ACV by about 10% in the first couple of years as an enterprise account. And then, subsequently, we've grown ACV at about 17% CAGR over the couple of years afterwards. And there's still a significant opportunity ahead because of \u2013 in the case for that particular customer, there are opportunities of that in a number of other areas. And we're seeing the story being repeated across our enterprise account base. By focusing on the accounts, we can deliver incremental value to our customers, and, of course, that translates to incremental growth. So, that's the dynamic that you're really seeing taking place in our business as we look forward.","Ken Wong","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Saket Kalia","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Maybe for you, Maria, this might be a tough \u2013 this may be tough to break out because so much of what ANSYS does is multi-physics. But a couple of the big deals this year feel like they've been geared towards sort of a semi space or have been very electrical tool, heavy. So, I guess, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the general growth in the business maybe segmenting between the electrical portfolio versus all the other physics if that makes sense.","Maria Shields","Yes, Saket, but what I'll say is we don't report on any individual physics family because that's not really the lens through which we view the opportunity. You mentioned in your in your comment about multi-physics and that\u2019s really the strength of the breadth and depth of our portfolio and how we think about our go-to-market opportunity. One data point I'll point you to is the comments that Ajei had in his prepared remarks is that if you think about the large deals in Q3, 80% of those deals included products from four or more major, physics families. So we really are going to market in enabling our customers to solve incredibly complex problems because the problems are really multi-physics and no longer single-physics-oriented.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, let me start with you and ask how do you see any or all of your newer businesses being leading indicators of or leading-edge drivers to new business meaning specifically Minerva for SPDM, Granta for materials, and even LS in the mechanical area. Do you see any or all of those, perhaps, becoming the good leading indicators of new business?","And then secondly, just a follow up on a comment you made regarding the channel business. It's quite interesting that proportionately it's staying the same in spite of your obvious focus on large deal business. So, what have you done or what do you intend to do to sustain that momentum in an SMB to continue to grow that business particularly from a multi-business perspective and not just a single solver perspective in the SMB market?","Ajei Gopal","So, Jay thank you for the questions. So, if I just focus on the second one for a moment and talk about the channel, you're absolutely right. The channel has grown consistently with the direct business. And as you would imagine, the channel partners, the channel partners tend to \u2013 given our go-to-market, some of them tend to be more transactional in nature. It\u2019s smaller deals in nature. Some of them, of course, have very strategic relationships with their customers. It really depends on the channel partners.","And as Rick may have mentioned again and during our Investor Day when we were talking about our go-to-market strategy, we continue to invest in the channel partners and we have continued to increase the number of channel partners as well as for the channel partners are seeing significant opportunity.","So, they themselves are increasing the number of people within the individual partners of selling our technology. So, there\u2019s more feet on the street in the aggregate from the channel partners selling our technology which typically ends up at a \u2013 at sort of these lower transaction levels up.","Furthermore, as you know, our go to market is differentiated. And so \u2013 so, we have \u2013 we have a \u2013 an opportunity to yet address the enterprise accounts. But with our momentum motion and our inside sales activity, we can address more of this volume business more of the transactional business.","And so, we have \u2013 our go-to-market and one of the hallmarks of the state of the business is the fact that we have this pretty sophisticated and well-developed go-to-market that allows us to address needs of the largest customers as well as the more transactional business that we've discussed. And they're both very important to us, and we continue to make sure that we're successful across both of those motions which you saw this year and I made clear in my commentary.","With respect to your first question regarding the products, certainly some of the newer products that we have in the marketplace and perhaps some of the acquisitions, you're absolutely correct. Our strategy as I've described is to make simulation pervasive which means we want to make simulation capabilities. We want to inject them into multiple ecosystems into multiple use cases.","If you look at some of the work we've done with our platform and in particular with Minerva that allows us to take the ANSYS simulation capabilities and to inject it into other phases of the product lifecycle, and to be \u2013 and to drive the broader use simulation and certainly our acquisition of Dynardo fits right into that. So, that gives us access to more customers, helps us solve more problems.","And some of the acquisitions that we've done, you mentioned Granta, I think material is a very important aspect of the end-to-end product equation. In many ways, material is a lifecycle unto itself. It's very closely related. It's almost a platform unto itself so it's very closely related to a Minerva activity. But materials gives customers a real understanding of where the true costs are and what the design implications are, and that exposes us at the different levels in an organization in a customer as well as the different sets of customers.","You mentioned LSTC, and I was pretty broad in my comments. I think in my script I went through this in some detail. But the fact is that the LSTC technology because of the nature of the technology and because of our go-to-market, we have not been focusing on the core LSTC use cases that like for example automotive crash testing.","And now that LSTCand LS-Dyna is part of the ANSYS portfolio, we have an opportunity to position the breadth and the depth of LSTC across industries \u2013 of LS-DYNA across multiple industries and by putting our technologies together we think we can solve \u2013 we can help our customers really solve the most amazing problem and do so very efficiently.","So we're excited about those acquisitions. They all fit with our strategy of pervasive stimulation. They fit with our go-to market and our go-to market supports the acquisitions and then their relationships that these customers have with their own channel partners with their own customers further supports our go-to market. So it's a mutually reinforcing outcome that we are excited about.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matthew Hedberg","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. There's there's been a lot of consternation over the macro environment but clearly I think the breadth of your portfolio and global diversity was able to offset any of that weakness. In your prepared remarks you talked about China. It seems like that's factored into your guidance. But I wanted to dig in a little bit more in the UK, obviously there\u2019s a lot of questions on Brexit. But then Germany we\u2019ve had some really strong results. So maybe a little bit more on European results relative to sort of that and what's factored into your outlook.","Ajei Gopal","Yes, so as I said in the \u2013 and I\u2019ll let Maria also jump in, but as I said again in my script, the second half of the year \u2013 I mean Europe had a pretty decent Q3 from a sales activity perspective and the second half of the year in Q4 we're expecting to see \u2013 we have some more larger deals in the pipeline. The revenue, when you look at it from a revenue perspective, because of the volatility of ASC 606, you'll see some variations in revenue which may not necessarily align exactly with sales activity. But to give you some perspective as I said, we expect the second half of the year to be stronger in Europe, and with some large deal activity. As I said the Americas have been pretty strong throughout. Asia has been pretty strong. Maria, do you want to add in?","Maria Shields","Yes and I think if you just look at the UK, it\u2019s a comparable. So, it is indicative of what you're going to see relative to some of the variability that ASC 606 introduces depending on the timing of when deal take. So, I would not read into the UK. And as Ajei said, our plan all along as we've been communicated since we first guided on 2019 back in earlier in the year is that the pipeline and the deal opportunities were really back end loaded, and a lot of the those are just aligned with the year-end planning and budgeting cycle of our large customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jackson Ader","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. The first thing as a follow-up to an earlier question on LS-DYNA, and Ajei, you mentioned \u2013 so you weren't necessarily partnering with them or in the use cases of their traditional craftsman solvers. So, can you just help us maybe understand, if you were to go into an automotive or an area of customer or potential customer and say and look to sell kind of a broad-based deal, what would the conversation actually look like once you came to crash and impact? What was the work-around there previously?","Ajei Gopal","So, thanks for the question. To make sure that you understand the context, our focus, as I said, from a go-to-market perspective was not really on the automotive \u2013 on the automotive customers or the automotive crash testing. A lot of that activity was effectively taken by DYNA through some of their other channel partners. And we had (inaudible) throughout the channel partners. It wasn't really a focus of ANSYS. So that wasn't our primary business.","And so, in those areas, as you could imagine, because we were \u2013 we would partner where we would work with the customer. They would take advantage of the technology \u2013 of LSTC\u2019s technology, DYNA, perhaps, working with another channel partner and that's how we would kind of our customer. The automotive crash test use case wasn't really something that we were majoring in, but that wasn't our focus and that wasn't where the ANSYS LSTC business was. And that obviously is an area of tremendous strength for them. And they come with not only amazing technology, but they also come with great relationships and customer relationships in that space.","Operator","Our next question comes from with Richard Valera from Needham & Co. Please go ahead.","Richard Valera","Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, based on your prepared remarks, it sounds like you're continuing to see really good demand from the auto industry, but I think a couple of your design software peers have called out at least selective weakness with some of their auto customers. Can you just give us an update on your review of your auto customers and your opportunity in the auto space and your sense of how that's going to look over the next one to two years?","Ajei Gopal","Thanks again for the question. We can \u2013 I can address it from the perspective of what we see in the marketplace. And perhaps, I can set the context, as I talked about some of the conversations that we are having, that I personally have had, and certainly our sales people are having with our customers in the automotive space.","When you consider the aggregate of what the automotive customers are dealing with, with electrification \u2013 and, by the way, electrification is not uniquely something that's being driven by the automotive companies in and of themselves. There's also government regulations and other activities that are driving their desire to meet certain deadlines, and dates, and so forth. But if you consider electrification, you consider the opportunity with autonomy.","As just two examples, there is a profound change taking place, and there is a significant level of investment that we are seeing and interest that we're seeing in making sure that they can address these upcoming needs or these upcoming demands for the portfolio. In many cases, a \u2013 an activity, a focus on electrification might \u2013 isn't just about the battery. It's a much \u2013 it's about a broader outcome. Because building an electric car requires different points of optimization than building an internal combustion engine car. The transmit \u2013 everything is different or many things are different.","And so, there \u2013 and that opens up incremental opportunities for us. So, from our perspective, the fact that we've identified electrification autonomy, and we have compelling solutions in those areas in addition to the rest of our multi-physics solution, we believe, positions us very well. Those are growth areas. People are spending R&D dollars in those areas to be competitive in the future.","And we have technologies and solutions that addresses those customers. And so, when I talk to automotive customers, the conversation often starts with electrification or autonomy. We may eventually get into other conversations of traditional \u2013 that we've traditionally had with them about structural integrity or air flow and combustion in other areas. But, certainly, we start with those areas. And those can \u2013 we see those as continued areas of interest for the automotive companies.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Steve Koenig","Thank you. Appreciate the middle initial too. Congratulations, ANSYS, great quarter. I'm going to focus my question here on Maria. So, maybe just some housekeeping first, Maria. Any changes in Q3 duration of contract length and billings terms? And any trends that you might be seeing there? I have a few companies that are seeing more annual billings and less multiyear.","And then just, also, can you remind me what approach you're taking to the larger deals, particularly here in Q4? Are they probability weighted? And more generally, what are the puts and takes that you factored into the Q4 guide? Thank you very much.","Maria Shields","Yeah. So, with respect to duration, Steve, what I would say is we're not seeing any extension duration. Just to give you a couple data points, at the end of Q3, if you look at deferred revenue, the current is about 5.2 months, which is about the same as it was last year at this time. The long-term deferred is about two months.","And to some of those larger deals that Ajei spoke to in his prepared remarks, those, on average, are two to three-year deals. So, the larger enterprise deals and the strategic accounts, we're still seeing that they are choosing multiyear as opposed to annual. Annual, we are still seeing though in the momentum and the more traditional SMB space. And when you think\u2026","Steve Koenig","Got it.","Maria Shields","About what we are bringing to Q4, obviously, we've got a pipeline. Rick and his team are very seasoned. And so, some of them, they balance some of the risk around holidays and around how many people need to be involved in the approval process and so, we try our best given that the larger these deals get, if one slips to Q1 for whatever reason, it can have a significant impact under ASC 606. So, we try our best to factor in everything that we know about macro as well as individual deals that really could have any impact on the quarter and try to use the best judgment we can when we're formulating our guidance.","Steve Koenig","Great. Thanks, Maria. Congrats again.","Maria Shields","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead.","Rob Oliver","Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Appreciate it. My question is for Ajei. Ajei, just around Discovery Live, I appreciated your comments relative to the PTC partnership and I know Discovery Live is an important part of your goal to be more pervasive within large accounts. I just wanted to get a sense for the progress of Discovery Live and any early signs on penetration within some of the larger deals. Thanks.","Ajei Gopal","Thanks for the question, Rob. So, again, I hate to go back to the Investor Day but we had a pretty robust discussion about Discovery Live at Investor Day that was about a month ago, a month and a half ago. So, the dynamic remain \u2013 remains the same with we\u2019re tremendously excited about the technology.","Our customers are excited about the technology. We've got \u2013 we've got initial penetration into the enterprise accounts and something like I think 20% of our enterprise accounts in terms of that initial penetration and we continue to develop against an extremely aggressive roadmap.","And where \u2013 the technology is moving in the right direction. We're excited about adoption. It's just very early in the cycle of the product. It's a brand new product. It's creating a category in a marketplace that historically relatively conservative in terms of adoption of new technology. So, as we've said repeatedly, it will take time for this product to develop. But all indications so far are positive and we are excited about where we are in the marketplace with this essentially breakthrough technology.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi with Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Andrew DeGasperi","Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to switch gears into HPC. I think at the Investor Day you mentioned 100 customers on Azure. And I\u2019m just wondering if you're thinking about opening that up to other hyperscalers?","Ajei Gopal","Thanks, again, for the question. Yeah. So we have \u2013 our technology is able to work across the different providers and we're not tied to any individual cloud provider. That being said the answer is cloud itself is running on Azure, but we have the capability to run on any type of provider.","Andrew DeGasperi","Got it and then maybe just a quick comment on PTC acquisition of (inaudible) Does that mean anything in terms of your relationship with them on Creo?","Ajei Gopal","Well, I mean, I think that firstly, I think it\u2019s tremendous technology and capabilities from what we understand. Obviously, we're not in that space and we're not in that market so I can't really \u2013 I don't really have \u2013 we don't have a formulator opinion per se on the technology. But from everything that we've seen it's amazing technology. It's a great \u2013 it's a great product. And it's certainly as PTC absorbs as I think they just closed the acquisition a few days ago. As they absorb this we'll continue to have discussions and conversations with PTC about our relationship and how our relationship broadens to take into account whatever changes they may have made to the portfolio.","But that being said, PTC has an aggressive roadmap with respect to Creo Simulation Live. They continue to see traction in the marketplace that we've talked about. And then I talked about that Jim Heppelmann has talked about in his calls. And they have a robust roadmap that includes that includes the next generation of CSL. So, for example, I think in next year or March of 2020, they're going to expand to include CFD use cases from where they currently are. And that obviously expands the applicability of Creo Simulation Live.","So we're very excited about the relationship with PTC. We think that they're executing as they need to. And obviously, we'll continue to discuss with them as they start to absorb the terrific Onshape acquisition.","Operator","The next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.","Tyler Radke","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping that you could just expand a little bit upon your commentary and expecting strength here in Q4 in Europe. I think a lot of companies have called out kind of the opposite with some of the macro challenges, but is there a specific end market or vertical you're seeing the strength? I know you had a pretty large deal with a large automotive company over there last quarter. You\u2019re kind of expecting the strength to continue from that market, or is it more across the board?","Ajei Gopal","So, yes, we obviously \u2013 my comments are based upon our understanding of our pipeline. So it's not \u2013 it's not a general comment about macro conditions. It's very specifically about our pipeline.","So perhaps our pipelines are different from other vendors\u2019 pipelines and that might account for the differences that you're pointing out. That's point number one.","With respect to your second question about is any particular area, again my expectation is that we will see next quarter along the lines of where we've seen in the past in terms of the split across industry verticals. So we're not seeing a particular vertical change dramatically. And it's highly unlikely that these changes are going to happen in a month over month as we look at the end of Q3 to the early part of Q4.","As you can imagine, many of these customers who are in our pipeline for Q4 have been in our pipeline for some period of time. These are not new deals that come into the pipeline in Q4 and close in Q4, especially these larger deals. And so, we have pretty good visibility and a finger on the pulse of some of those deals. We're not expecting any profound change in the industry verticals as we look forward to Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schappel with Benchmark. Please go ahead.","Mark Schappel","Hi. Good morning. Congratulations on the nice job in the quarter. Ajei, question on Dynardo. I was wondering if you could just provide a couple of real world examples of how you expect customers to use the solution.","Ajei Gopal","Hey, Mark. Thanks so much for the question. So, as I said Dynardo is a process integration and an optimization tool. And their flagship product is something called optiSLang, which is essentially a design optimization solution. And so, the idea is as a designer you can provide \u2013 you can try to solve for a multi-objective optimization problem.","So you can establish a set of boundary conditions and use cases and you can use Dynardo to drive the simulation to get to an optimal point where you're trying to get to with sensitivity, reliability, design capabilities, and so forth. So you can drive that optimization and you can you can use line to be able to change these simulation flows so you can automate the design space exploration.","So effectively, what it's allowing you to do is very rapidly chain together different elements, different simulation elements, solve for a point of optimization that you're trying to get to in an automated way and that allows you to reduce development time and of course it can accelerate product design. So that's the nature of the technology and \u2013 engineers will use it to try to rapidly get to a conclusion that they're trying to drive but it drives an enormous amount of simulation, it triggers off an enormous amount of simulation in order to get to that design point.","Mark Schappel","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Adam Borg","Great. And thanks for taking the questions. I just have two quick ones. First, just it's great to see continued momentum with you called out three eight-figure deals. Any way to quantify the type of (inaudible) you're seeing in total contract value of these deals versus these deals previously? And then secondly just on the motor-CAD OEM relationship, really interesting, what led you to look to OEM CAD software around electric motor design and are there other areas to OEM, other types of CAD software as well? Thanks so much.","Maria Shields","Yeah. So with respect to your first question, yeah, relative to the largest accounts I would say double-digit growth, absolutely, especially as we expand our footprint across more users and more applications. And with respect to the OEMs, we've been OEM-ing and partnering not just with CAD players, but with many other technology companies throughout our history. As you heard, LSTC as an example, has been partner of ours for 25 years. And we've got others and the Motor-CAD design opportunity was just one that \u2013 where we've got a used case scenario with common customers and it made sense for them to be able to leverage their technology and our global go-to market.","Ajei Gopal","Yes. And just to amplify what Maria said, I mean with Motor-CAD, that technology helps us in the electrification space. And we talked about electrification as being one of the important growth drivers. And they've developed upfront design capabilities that are in the area of electric machines. And that integrated with our technology will really allow these electric machine designers to rapidly \u2013 yeah, to be able to build the \u2013 to build electric motors and machines more quickly.","So, to give you an example, they can do things like fast thermal analysis from their front-end. So, it's a more -- it's a pretty sophisticated technology. It couples electromagnetic thermal mechanical modeling capabilities. It's really designed for the rapid design and deployment of electric machines across these different operating conditions. And what we can do is dovetail our technology really nicely in -- with what they have. So, our customers can benefit from a more streamlined electric machine workflow.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Ajei Gopal","Thank you, operator. So our strategy which is to make simulation pervasive is working as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit revenue and ACV growth combined with best-in-class margins and continued strength across the business. That, coupled with the exciting opportunity to unite the incredible technology, talent, and customer relationships of LSTC and Dynardo with our global distribution platform and resilient business model, gives us confidence for the future. Our continued focus on execution, our investment in the business, and a healthy sales pipeline provide a solid foundation for us to deliver another year of record financial performance. And they set the stage for us to execute against our recently announced 2022 financial targets.","I want to thank my ANSYS colleagues from around the world for once again delivering these outstanding results. And with that, I'd like to thank you for listening and please enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. With us today are Ajei Gopal, Chief Executive Officer; Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer; and Annette Arribas, Senior Director, Global Investor Relations.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks.","Annette N. Arribas - ANSYS, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks document have been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to our third quarter and year-to-date financial results and business update, as well as our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 outlook, and the key underlying assumptions.

Statements made on today's call are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.","I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. During our recent Investor Day in mid-September, my team and I discussed how engineering simulation, what we do, is at the center of a profound transformation, in which digital technologies are changing the way products are designed, manufactured and operated. Simulation helps our customers lower cycle times and reduce costs, increase quality and decrease risk, and drive innovation while managing complexity.","We described our vision of Pervasive Simulation, in which engineering simulation is embedded in the entire product lifecycle from ideation, to design, to manufacturing, to operations and in actual products. We discussed some of our core strengths, the scalability and the accuracy of our solvers, the power of our electronics and embedded software solutions, the integrated multi-physics nature of our portfolio, the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of our platform, and the depth of our technical relationships with our customers. All of these strengths are highly valued by our customers and, as you will hear in a moment, helped contribute to our successes in Q3.","We also discuss our investment in key adjacencies, including additive manufacturing, digital twins and the Internet of Things, which will broaden and expand our core product capabilities. We believe our vision of Pervasive Simulation will continue to give us access to a large and growing market opportunity, will allow us to broaden and deepen our relationships with our existing customers, and will continue to propel the broad adoption of ANSYS solutions.","Our performance this quarter is another excellent proof point that our growth strategy is succeeding. Driven by strong execution and deepening relationships with large customers, we delivered an outstanding quarter of double-digit revenue growth and exceeded the high end of guidance for both revenue and earnings. Q3 was also an excellent bookings quarter with 38% year-over-year growth, which illustrates that customer demand for our products is very strong. In fact, we have grown revenue double digits for the first nine months of this year, all the while maintaining industry-leading margins. This is the strongest growth in the third quarter and in the first nine months since 2012.","I'd like to spend a few minutes illustrating how our strategy of Pervasive Simulation and the core strengths I mentioned earlier are helping us win in the market. Our scalability and accuracy drive the use of our solutions in the most demanding of applications.","The U.S. Department of Energy, acting on behalf of its contractor, Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation, signed a seven-figure deal to bring in ANSYS technology to be used in the research and development of nuclear propulsion systems for the U.S. Navy. Bechtel is a longstanding ANSYS customer who will use ANSYS Fluid Dynamics and high performance computing software to extend their robust design optimization simulation capabilities.","The breadth of physics and the multi-physics nature of our Pervasive Simulation strategy, coupled with our investment in key adjacencies, allows us to expand existing relationships with customers. In Q3, we closed a multi-year deal with longtime customer, Cummins. Cummins, as you may remember, has embraced simulation as part of its product development process through a practice it calls Analysis Led Design. This new agreement will further expand Cummins' use of ANSYS technology across every area of physics, as well as the systems and engineering knowledge management, to put more advanced tools in the hands of more engineers. This tight collaboration will help Cummins innovate around its emerging strategic initiatives in electrification and functional safety.","Also in Q3, a leading supplier of automotive propulsion products significantly increased its adoption of ANSYS simulation solutions through a new enterprise agreement. The company moved from using a small portion of ANSYS products to a broad agreement, giving them worldwide access to ANSYS' full-suite of structures, fluids, electromagnetics, embedded software and system solutions. They will also provide designers and non-analysts, who historically have not used simulation, with access to ANSYS' products. In other words, they will use ANSYS technology pervasively in the product design cycle, from ideation, to detailed product verification.","This quarter, we also closed a multi-year seven-figure deal at one of the largest social media companies. This deal includes the full ANSYS portfolio of solutions to support the development of virtual reality, Internet of Things, networking applications and other hardware products. ANSYS' Multiphysics was key to addressing their upfront design considerations for complex thermal, signal integrity, power integrity and antenna design challenges.","The strength and completeness of our electronics and embedded software solutions are critical to our many successes in an increasingly digital landscape. Honeywell, a world leader in cockpit display and flight management systems, has invested in ANSYS SCADE Solutions to create the next-generation ARINC 661 compliant cockpit display platform. By using the SCADE model-based solution, Honeywell will be able to develop the next generation platform four times faster than current processes. Honeywell's use of SCADE is a strategic decision that will allow them to expand market share and remain a leader in both the business and regional jet industries.","A North American provider of networking solutions for data center, cloud and high-performance computing adopted ANSYS' Multiphysics solution for electronics cooling and board reliability in Q3. ANSYS' coupled electrical and thermal analysis will enhance their simulation workflow, predicting reliability issues early in the design cycle, with potential savings in the millions of dollars.","And finally in Q3, a global semiconductor customer in Asia increased their long-term commitment to ANSYS, adopting our next generation RedHawk-SC solution, as well as adding our new Path FX technology to analyze the interaction between power integrity and timing performance to optimize their next generation semiconductor designs.","Now, let me shift to the performance of our three major sales regions. I am pleased with our North America performance, with Q3 revenue growth of 18%, lease revenue growth of 18% and perpetual revenue growth of above 20%. I am also delighted that in Q3, our North America team signed the largest deal in the history of the company, a three-year lease contract of over $45 million. Shifting to Asia-Pacific, the Q3 results reflect overall revenue growth of 11% that include a 12% growth in maintenance and above 10% growth in each of lease and perpetual revenue.","China and Taiwan continue to deliver a strong revenue growth, both in excess of 30% for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. Our Asia-Pacific indirect business continues to demonstrate strength with double-digit revenue growth resulting from the ongoing focus and the investments that we have been making over the past few years. Our slowest growth region in the quarter was Europe, delivering revenue growth of 5% in Q3. We continue to see strength in France for the third quarter in a row, up 20% in the quarter and 18% year-to-date.","The UK showed significant improvement with 16% revenue growth in the quarter, albeit off a weak year-over-year compare. Although our channels business in Germany continues to be strong, the revenue performance of our direct business in Germany has lagged. As I have shared with you on previous calls and as we discussed at Investor Day, we have a recovery plan in place for Europe. We are making good progress and I am confident that our rebuilding efforts will set the stage for improved performance in Europe in 2018 and beyond.","Looking at our performance across industries, sales in electronics and semiconductors, automotive, aerospace and defense, and industrial equipment continue to be steady drivers of growth across all geographies. In automotive, we continue to see R&D investment in disruptive technologies such as autonomous systems and electric vehicles. In aerospace and defense, initiatives around reducing costs and environmental impact are leading to the increased use of simulation in aircraft engines. The space sector remains strong for ANSYS as the disruptive Space 2.0 companies continue to drive innovation through simulation. The resurgence of the defense sector continued in Q3, especially in North America and Europe. Although, oil and gas remains weak, the energy sector as a whole continues its steady recovery from the oil price crash and we saw increased customer investment in Q3, particularly in North America.","Now, let me move to the innovation coming from our business units. We recently released ANSYS 18.2, which continue to improve our solutions for autonomous vehicles, additive manufacturing, electric machines, and smart connected products. Also in Q3, we gave users a technology preview of an exciting new product called ANSYS Discovery Live. At Investor Day, you heard about this new breakthrough technology, which revolutionizes the speed and ease of use of engineering simulation, to make digital exploration available to all engineers. The Discovery Live announcement was the largest event in ANSYS' history and the technology preview had more than 10,000 downloads in the first month alone. User feedback from the technology preview is being incorporated into the commercial product, which we're expecting to offer next year.","Also in Q3, in an industry-first, ANSYS and industry giant TSMC published a Joint Automotive Reliability Guide that provides an exclusive ANSYS Multiphysics simulation methodology to address the market needs for high-reliability semiconductors and electronic systems for automotive applications. TSMC also recognized ANSYS as a Partner of the Year.","As we look beyond Q3, it is important to note that Maria, Rick Mahoney, our Head of Sales, and I have been working closely together in our respective roles for only just over 10 months. As we refine our operational cadence, I believe we can tighten up the variance between our guidance and our actual performance. We have good visibility into our expected performance in Q4. Our pipeline has strengthened considerably and a couple of large deals are already in. As such, we are raising our Q4 guidance by $6 million at the midpoint. Because of our increased confidence in Q4 and the over-performance in the third quarter, we are raising our 2017 guidance by $20 million at the midpoint. Please note that currency is not a factor in our Q4 and 2017 raise, since the dollar has strengthened slightly against the yen since our last guidance.","Now, before I hand over to Maria, I'd like to reflect for a moment on our long-term prospects. As you recall, at Investor Day, we told you that we plan to achieve sustainable double-digit revenue growth by 2020. We ended 2016 at just under 5% revenue growth. With our strong performance thus far in 2017 and our expected results for Q4, we're on track this year to approximately double last year's growth rate. Our fiscal year guidance implies revenue growth of 9% to 10%. This is exciting news, indeed, and it's validation of what we told you at Investor Day that the strength of our core business can get us to double-digit growth. It is also a testament to the commitment of our employees to our mission and to our internal focus on execution. However, I believe that we still have work ahead of us before we can achieve our target of sustainable double-digit growth.","Let me explain, first and obviously, with improved performance, year-over-year growth comparisons become more challenging. This is the case with Q4 2017, which suffers because of the year-over-year comparison with a strong Q4 in 2016. As an aside, by the way, our Q4 2017 comparison additionally suffers because of the disproportionately high perpetual license content of Q4 2016, it is a strong comparable for perpetual licenses that is primarily affecting growth in Q4 2017.","Second and most importantly, as we discussed at Investor Day, we must make some key investments in product and engineering, go-to-market and infrastructure. The results of these investments will take time to come to fruition. And when they do, we will have both strengthened the core of our business and expanded the core of our business into key adjacencies. We will have put in place a well-architected multi-channel go-to-market motion that will allow us to efficiently sell to and support customers of all sizes across the world, and we will have created an infrastructure \u2013 a strong infrastructure that effectively supports the growth we have ahead.","In short, these investments are needed to allow us to deliver predictable, superior performance on a sustained basis. While we do have a lot of work ahead of us, I am more confident than ever in ANSYS' long-term prospects. I believe that we have the best products and the best people in the industry, and I know that we can solve some of the most challenging problems faced by our customer. The future looks bright for ANSYS.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financial results in a little bit more detail. Maria?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Ajei shared a few of our financial results, but let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our Q3 2017 operational performance, financial metric highlights and also to comment on our outlook for Q4 and fiscal year 2017. Also, just to note, I will be commenting in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise. The results of Q3 reflect strong execution across most aspects of our business. This enabled us to deliver record Q3 results with both revenue and earnings, well above the upper end of our guidance.","Key financial highlights begin with total third quarter revenue of $276.8 million a year-over-year growth of 12%. The over-performance on the top line was driven by a number of factors, including a higher-than-expected perpetual mix as we closed out the quarter. The strength in North America, China, Taiwan and the indirect channel also contributed to the strong revenue performance. The Q3 results include a positive currency impact of $1.2 million. Recurring revenue for the quarter totaled $207.4 million or 75% of total revenue, and grew 11% over last year's third quarter. The company's ability to maintain its solid base of recurring revenue has been one of the hallmarks of our business model for decades.","Sales bookings growth significantly outpaced revenue growth in Q3. This was driven by a combination of the 25 seven-figure deals, which were closed in the quarter, including three customers with orders in excess of $5 million, two of which were in excess of $10 million; and as Ajei mentioned earlier, one of which was the largest deal in the company's history, a three-year lease deal, totaling over $45 million. We also reported increases in software license sales and solid maintenance renewals, both of which have contributed to deferred revenue and backlog of $669.3 million, representing a new record high, and 38% growth as compared to Q3 of 2016. This positions us well for the remainder of 2017 and as we continue to work through our plans for 2018.","In Q3, we achieved a gross margin of 90.7% and an operating margin of 48.7%. These were both slightly ahead of the margin guidance that we had provided for Q3 and largely driven by the revenue over-performance in the quarter.","We reported EPS of $1.05 for the quarter, representing 11% growth over last year's third quarter earnings. Q3's GAAP earnings included approximately $500,000 related to our previously announced workforce realignment. In line with what we had previously communicated, as of the end of the third quarter, the company has completed the realignment initiative that we began late last year, and we do not anticipate any further charges related to this activity. Our operating cash flow for the quarter and the first nine months of 2017 totaled $89 million and $327 million, respectively. And we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $926.6 million.","Now, let me turn to our current outlook for Q4 and fiscal year 2017. We have increased our outlook for Q4 with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $284 million to $293 million, and our non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the range of $0.99 to $1.05. With respect to 2017, we're increasing our outlook to factor in both our Q3 over-performance and an increase in our Q4 guidance. This translates to non-GAAP revenue in the range of approximately $1.079 billion to $1.088 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of $3.93 to $3.99.","We are targeting a non-GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 90% for the quarter and the year, and non-GAAP operating margins of 44% to 45% for Q4, and 46.5% to 47% for 2017, in line with what we have been communicating for our annual targets throughout the year. I will also highlight that the fourth quarter margin targets include increased sales commission expense, the impact of a full quarter of the additional 100 employees that we hired in Q3, as well as our plans around hiring to better position us for a fast start as we head into 2018. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that we have factored into our outlook for Q4 and fiscal year 2017 are contained in the prepared remarks document.","I would just like to remind everyone, as I communicated at our recent September Investor Day, we will be providing our outlook for 2018 in February, when we announce our Q4 and 2017 results , and after we finalize our 2018 planning process, which is currently underway.","In summary, in Q3, we delivered another very solid quarter with strength across all of the key financial metrics that we track and measure; top-line growth, operating margins, earnings, operating cash flows, bookings and deferred revenue and backlog. This strong performance allows us to not only increase our outlook for 2017, but it also gives us confidence that our continued focus on execution and investing for the future with financial discipline, combined with the strength of our portfolio and sales pipeline provides us a strong foundation to deliver on our near term and recently announced 2020 financial targets.","And with that, operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Ken Wong with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Hoi Fung Wong - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Ajei, I wanted to maybe ask a little bit about the $45 million deal there. Could you, perhaps, give us some color in terms of what were some of the expansion components that were able to push that deal into record high territory?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So, firstly, the deal was with a customer who is a longtime ANSYS customer and this reflected their success so far with the ANSYS portfolio and a broad expansion of the opportunity that they are driving across all of the physics. So, it represented essentially an expansion across all of our physics and a significant broadening of their usage of our capabilities.","Kenneth Hoi Fung Wong - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I guess one sense I'm trying to get is how much of that was, were you able to kind of push down into \u2013 when I think about the strategy of Pervasive Simulation, were you able to kind of push down to their designers, were you able to move into some of the operational applications that you guys have talked about in terms of IoT? I just wanted to get a sense for kind of how that customer may be using you guys differently than what they have in the past?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So, firstly, it is, as I said, Multiphysics. And secondly, you're absolutely right, they are broadening the usage up earlier in the design process as we discussed. So, it's moving earlier in the design process. The details of exactly what they're doing, they are somewhat coy about us actually sharing that in public. So, I have to be a little bit careful about. I can't mention who they are and I can't mention exactly the applications.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ken Talanian - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, first off, I was wondering could you talk about how we should think about head count growth going forward. I know it's typically been flat and the additional heads this quarter came from acquisition, but some color around that would be helpful.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. Ken, I'll take that. So, while we had some additional heads from the CEI acquisition, we also added, net, almost 100 people that we hired in Q3, for which we will have the full impact of that burn rate in Q4. And we are continuing to aggressively hire in all areas across the company, in line with what we communicated at Investor Day, relative to the changes that we're making in the go-to-market, the focus on not only the core technology, but some of the adjacencies that Ajei mentioned in his prepared remarks, and also in the areas of infrastructure, and particularly in the go-to-markets, as we talked about at Investor Day, also increasing our investment and focus on expanding the channel as we did initially in Asia-Pac to other parts of the globe, particularly Europe is where our focus is now as we exit 2017 and enter 2018.","Ken Talanian - Evercore ISI","Great. And I guess, following the large deal that we saw this quarter and your continued traction not only with the mega-sized deals, but with large deals in general, could you frame the magnitude of the potential impact of these deals on your long-term growth assumptions? And how we should think about those impacting that double-digit growth?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Absolutely. We definitely see the opportunity to continue, as we've seen over the past five years, for these enterprise deals to play a larger role. And as we think about those targets and that sustainable double-digit growth that we are looking at for 2020, these continued expansion in our largest customers across Multiphysics and to align with all of this \u2013 the, I'll call it, new problem challenges that they have from electrification, to IoT, to autonomous, all of these trends are significant opportunities for us to drive deeper penetration within these important customers. And the beauty of these customers is many of them have been ANSYS customers for literally decades. So, we have a strong foundation and partnership that's been built that will allow us to leverage that strong foundation and trust that we've built with these customers.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","And as Rick mentioned at Investor Day, we're making investments in these relationships with our large customers. What they value is the technical relationship that we have with them. We're certainly investing in that, in those relationships. They also value the nature and the completeness of our offerings. And so, as we go to market with these customers, we have a new organizational approach, Rick mentioned that in Investor Day, and that allows us to bring the right and relevant experts to be able to have these conversations in depth with our customers.","And certainly, when you see the expansion capabilities within our portfolio, no one's going to show up on day one and never having been a customer with ANSYS and sign a multi \u2013 double-digit-million-dollar deal. That typically isn't going to happen. What instead will happen is the customer will come on board. They'll have some success with some set of technologies and some capabilities, we'll prove ourselves out in a project and that activity has been going on, frankly, for years with some of these customers. Now as they're seeing these additional pressures where businesses are now having to respond to digital technologies, electrification, areas, for example, they may not necessarily have been historically participating in, they're now recognizing that they have to take this broader multi-physics approach to being able to address their product lifecycle.","And as I said earlier, it isn't just about sign off. It's about the entire lifecycle of the product. And so, we're able to have and engage in these conversations and then work with customers on a long-term map that allows them to be successful. Because ultimately, as I said, what we're doing is driving and helping them compete from a top-line growth perspective and helping them be competitive in a very challenging marketplace. And so, that translates into, obviously, larger deals and deeper relationships.","Operator","The next question will be from Rob Oliver with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning. This is Matt Lemenager on for Rob this morning. Question around, were there any deals that were perhaps pulled or perhaps landed in Q3 that you had previously thought might land in Q4 and this drove some of extra upside in Q3. I guess what I'm wondering is, do the strong bookings in Q3 have any implications to Q4 pipeline or bookings, just given how strong the third quarter was?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So, what I'll say is, the reality is given the number of transactions that we process in any quarter, there are deals that move from quarter to quarter. The good news is that we have really focused in the past year on improving our visibility and our forecasting and understanding the mix as we make our way through the quarter. So, I wouldn't say that there was a huge trend of things coming in early. And what I will say is, no doubt, the strength of the deferred revenue and backlog balance headed into Q4 definitely gives us confidence and improved visibility around the business. And we're also expecting that Q4 bookings growth will also probably not be quite as robust as Q3, but given the number of salespeople that we see in the opportunity to close out with a very strong year, that's why we built in the increased anticipation of higher sales commissions for Q4 because we are expecting to have a strong close, perhaps, not quite as strong on the bookings side as we did in Q3.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, and that's very helpful. And Maria, is there any update to the full year cash flow guidance?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yes. We've updated our full year cash flow guidance now to $400 million to $425 million, mostly in line with the strength of bookings that we saw in Q3.","Operator","The next question will be from Anil Doradla with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Congrats from my end, too. Couple of questions. So, Ajei, when I look at the results, and maybe it's a little tough to answer this, but I'll try, can you decouple your execution versus, perhaps, some more benign demand environment? Clearly, the tech space is seeing some very positive trends from a demand point of view. But on top of that, you guys are executing. So, can you help us understand how you could kind of separate the two?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","I mean, it's very hard to say quantitatively this percent is because of this and this percent is because of that. At the end of the day, Anil, when I look at the market, there clearly is demand for our offerings and it starts from there. If we didn't have \u2013 if what we were building and what we were offering to customers was not valuable, then we wouldn't really be able to sell anything. Obviously, what we do and bring to market is incredibly valuable. They need it. We happen to be well-positioned in this time of change with the digitization of the industry and we're well-positioned with the ideal portfolio. We have a singular focus on simulation. We're not being distracted by chasing after a number of different elements. We're not selling a basket of goods across wide variety of areas. We're incredibly focused on simulation. And I think all of that translates into a comfort and value to our customers. They see the value of what we provide and they're able to get benefit from what we do. In addition, of course, we have improved our execution. We have improved our capability to reach and support our customers. And I think that also has a huge impact. So, it all works together synergistically. I couldn't tell you specifically what percentage comes from what. But I feel like we're in a great position, both from a market perspective as well as from an execution perspective.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","And as a follow-up. Maria, you talked about providing 2018 guidance in February when you guys come back. But given our recent Analyst Day, given some of the targets that you've laid out over the next couple of years on margins, there is a potential that you guys may blow out of those targets in the near term in terms of growth and everything. So, the question I have is, is there a potential for you guys to come back and revisit your margin targets, which you guys gave out, two- to three-year targets, based on what the near-term trends are playing out?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Anil, what I would say is, right now, we are still very comfortable with the 2020 targets that we've laid out. We're finalizing our 2018 plan and we will have all the details around that and the metrics that are going to be the key metrics that we will measure and communicate as we exit 2017 and head into 2018. But nothing has changed relative to our targets, our outlook and the things that we're working towards since we communicated at Investor Day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham. Please go ahead.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Appreciate the comments on Discovery Live. I was wondering if you could give any more color in terms of the potential timing of when that would be in sort of production release and a little more color on the feedback you've seen so far that might give you the confidence that this is the product that really sort of gives you that democratization that you've been looking for, for I guess a number of years in the company's history? Thanks.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, as I've mentioned in the call, I mean Discovery Live is currently available as a free technology preview. And during this technology preview, anyone can download and use the software for free. And as I also mentioned in the call, we've had multiple people who've downloaded it. I think we have 10,000 downloads in the first month alone. As you can imagine, many of the people who have downloaded the software are very avid users. They're giving us a lot of feedback and we're working through our plans right now as to when we would release the commercial version and exactly what that would look like. So, that's software is (38:08) currently being made. We will, of course, have a product in 2018, but we're working our way through that through the planning right now.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. And just a quick follow up. Maria, can you say that computational engineering had any material revenue in 3Q or 4Q guidance?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","It was about $1 million, so nothing material.","Operator","Our next question will be from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, I'd like to refer back to a couple of things you talked about at the Analyst Meeting, as you did in your prepared remarks, specifically, the following. You mentioned at the meeting that you do a couple of things with regard to R&D; refocus on the core, spend 80% of R&D on the core, R&D have been spread too thin and so forth. Can you give us an update on the progress you've made there or how you think about that in terms of getting to those objectives in 2018? And then relatedly, Rick, in particular, talked about your investments in AEs as part of your account relationships. And the question there is, when we go through the financial details on your newly public competitor, Altair, they showed that they have over five AEs per sales rep in their head count breakdown, which seems a fairly high ratio in the industry. And I'm wondering, as part of your thinking of investing into AEs, as per Rick's plan, is that a ratio that you contemplate for yourselves or how are you thinking about those kinds of investments, and a follow up? Thanks.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Sure. So just, firstly, with respect to the investments in R&D, I think the discussion that we had a little over a month ago remains in place. So, we talked about the 80\/20. That's exactly what we have in mind. So nothing has really deviated from the conversation we had at Investor Day with respect to priorities in the R&D organization. And obviously, we're going through the final planning for next year to take that and to put it into the actual operating plan for next year.","With respect to your question about AEs, Rick mentioned that we are definitely going to be continuing to focus on these relationships that we have with our customers and we are certainly increasing our number of AEs that's been part of our Q3, Q4 hiring that we talked about. But we certainly do not see a 5-to-1 ratio, as you articulated, in our future. We don't think it's necessary. We think that we have fantastic products and our customer is able to take advantage of our technology. And obviously, we've built a deep relationship with them, but we don't need a 5-to-1 ratio of technical salespeople to our salespeople.","Operator","The next question will come from Monika Garg with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, I understand you'll provide 2018 guidance on the next call. But just wanted to understand is, coming back to your comments in the beginning, Ajei, you provided, what are the reasons to think 2018 growth could it be lower than 2017? And if you just can, a little bit talk about that.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. Monika, I'll just say, we're in the midst of finalizing 2018 plans. So, I would rather save that commentary for February when we've completed that activity and we've got the best visibility to provide numbers that we have confidence in.","Monika Garg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","What I'm trying to understand is, is there any reason to think that growth could be lower than 2017?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","I would suggest at this time you shouldn't think that, but the reality is we need to finish out 2017 before I can opine on that with confidence.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Ross MacMillan with RBC. Please go ahead.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you very much, and congratulations from me as well. I just had a couple of questions on the large deal, the $45 million deal, two specifically. Did that renew in line with the scheduled renewal date? And was the three-year term of that deal consistent with the prior term? And then I had one follow-up.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah, Ross, that particular customer has asked us to not get into specifics of that deal outside of what we've already talked about in the prepared remarks document and in the script. So out of professional courtesy at their request, we're not going to give further details around that.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Maybe as a follow-up, though, historically, your traditional lease terms for your electromagnetic and semi-related products have been longer than, I think, the other products in your portfolio. And I'm just trying to get a sense for whether, in general, you're seeing elongation of term deal contract length as you get deeper into customers. In other words, is the TCV going up because of extended duration of terms as well as \u2013 and your contract value going up because of broader usage, broader consumption, more users, et cetera? Just trying to understand that dynamic.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yes, I would say, Ross, as we get into, I will call, the second and third cycles of the expansion of our relationships with these customers, we are definitely seeing both, because they've now proven and have been able to measure the success and the value that they've derived from the first and second deals. And so, now, their confidence level rises. So, they are expanding across the portfolio and across their enterprise. So, we're seeing both, a willingness on the customers' part to do a longer deal as well as to expand the size of that deal.","One other indicator that I'll point you to is, if you take a look at the long-term deferred revenue, it is up from 2016 to 2017. It was $75 million in 2016 and now it's up to $196 million in 2017. So, that's an indicator of the trends that we're seeing, to your point.","The one other last thing, I'll say, Ross is, I believe, on your previous question you asked on that $45 million deal, I will tell you that the revenue impact for Q3 was about $1 million.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will be from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. If I could start, let me start with Europe. So, Ajei, maybe just a little bit more color, remind us again or tell us what's new here in terms of Europe. Why is the execution so much different than the other regions? The contrast in the outperformance is pretty stark. I understand it's more Germany. What needs to happen in Europe or what's underway that's going to change this?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Sure. So \u2013 and I think I've alluded this in prior calls, but let me summarize, if you don't mind, just quickly, and this might be material that we discussed earlier. As you recall, I've been with the company for about a year now. And one of the early things that I did in the Q4 period of last year, when we did not have a head of sales, was for me to personally get involved and to spend time with the sales leaders of the individual regions. And one of the \u2013 looking at Europe in particular, I felt it was necessary at that point to make some changes, and we did. We now have \u2013 within our European organization, we have a new leader of sales for Europe, who has been in place since almost a year now, a little bit less than a year.","And he was certainly \u2013 he has been working with Rick Mahoney, who is now our new Head of Sales. The two of them came up with a view of how to think about the European structure. So rather than the previous structure that we have, we rationalized the structure. We went to the UK, France, the German-speaking countries, Germany, Austria and Switzerland \u2013 DACH. And then we have a Northeast region and we have a Southwest region. So, we went to five regions in Europe that normalized the way in which we were doing it. We drove alignment across the organization between marketing and sales and so forth, which was previously misaligned across regions. We made some changes at country management level as well.","And in addition, we supported our European team by placing a couple of worldwide positions within Europe. So not only now is the head of Europe based out of our Munich offices, but we also have our worldwide head of major accounts or enterprise accounts, who is a new hire to our company. He is also based in Germany and brings his network of individuals. He's a German national, brings his network of individuals as well to the table in some of the largest companies around the world and certainly in Germany as well. And these are just sort of some examples of the changes of personnel. The culture, I think, is really focused on winning. There is a clear change in the tone on the ground within the organization. There is also an investment in the channels. And as you'll see, in some of the areas, for example, in Germany, we have a very strong performing channel relationships. But in other geos, we don't necessarily have that level of channel relationships. We're making investments in the channels accordingly so that we can replicate the success of the German channels elsewhere.","The focus I mentioned on organizational structure that I talked about earlier on large accounts is translating into a major focus on major accounts. And the early evidence is here. We have seven customers with orders of over $1 million in Q3, which was in our prepared remarks. And so, you can see \u2013 I mean I can go to chapter versed on each one of these things, but we have a lot of eyes on this. This was the subject of a fair amount of discussion during the recent review I had with the sales organization. We feel very confident at this point that the team has a good handle on it. And as I said in my comments, we're expecting to see improvement in 2018 and beyond.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay. Thanks for that, Ajei. I'll move to my second question then. It's almost habitual on earnings calls these days that vendors will say something about cloud. I can't count the number of times I hear that on earnings calls. But you guys are unusual in that, you don't talk that much about, at least on earnings call. Is that because simulation is still largely a desktop activity or is it because you still have work that you need to do in this area before you surface what's going on? Maybe just give us an update on cloud and how important is it really?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Sure. And if you remember, at Investor Day, we had a commentary from CIMdata, and they also talked about a cloud adoption by customers of simulation. And what we're seeing is that, that cloud adoption for simulation, essentially, it lags other areas in the market. So, this is just the reality of what we're seeing. Customers are perfectly willing to take advantage of their private clouds, HPC environment. That's something they've done for a long time. But broad-based public cloud adoption for simulation lags other application areas. And it's in part due to the complexity of the problems, maybe it's concerns about security, it's workflow, there's a number of reasons why, but that's the fact.","Now, we however do have offerings that we can offer to our customers. I mean, we have, as you know, with our Open Cloud Strategy, we have a network of over 10 partners, 11 partners around the world who can help our customers get to the cloud, take advantage of cloud resources. And that can be both for short-term-burst capacity or it could even be for longer-term situations. We don't force our customers to just run their compute on prem. They can certainly and are perfectly capable of running the same technology and the licenses in the public cloud and some choose to do that. And for customers who need burst capacity, we've got an Elastic Licensing capability for customers who are looking for just a few more licenses and few more capabilities to take advantage of whatever project or to get ahead of whatever project they may have in front of them.","So, it's really a combination of, yes, we're capable, but the industry for simulation and the usage isn't quite there. Obviously, this is a long-term trend. We certainly see that the industry will continue to embrace and take advantage of cloud and will continue to be a bigger and bigger factor, but it's not yet that big transformative activity that you're seeing in some of these other application areas that you've talked about.","Operator","The next question will be from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I want to tie together, in some of the prepared remarks, looking at the large deal activity in the U.S., can you give us a sense how much commonality in terms of industry or the lead product, meaning the thing that they're trying to solve, you saw in those large deals?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of industry, I mentioned the industries already \u2013 it's pretty much in line with the ones that I mentioned. It's aerospace and defense, automotive, industrial and certainly electronics. So, those represent some of the industries. In terms of the lead product, in some cases, obviously, it's the electronics portfolio. But in other cases, it's really a discussion about Multiphysics. And while the customer may start with one particular area, they may be a long time structures customer, a long time fluids customer. They can certainly move into a different area and it goes to Multiphysics.","We're also seeing with \u2013 by the way, with the electronification, we're seeing an increased demand for our SCADE offerings and our functional safety offerings. And so, as people are looking at smarter products, they're trying to do safety analysis. That's where some of our work in our embedded software capable organization comes to play. So, that's driving both a new business and it's also a growth vector within existing customers. So, it's really these megatrends, I think, that are driving things forward in automotive, obviously autonomous vehicles is pretty strong. The aerospace, I talked about a couple of trends. But once again, in the Space 2.0 companies, you'll see this, electric vehicle. So, these trends tend to pull a number of products.","But it's important to realize that even when we go after \u2013 even when we talk about a particular industry like, for example, electronics, it isn't just about our products that address electronics, because when you think about electronics and you take the journey all the way from chip package board, it brings in a variety of offerings, the semiconductor offerings, it's electronics offering, signal integrity, but you're also dealing with structural integrity, thermal analysis, heat transfer, that all of these physics come into play. And so, it's a pretty robust conversation that we're able to have with our customers, primarily because we have representation and presence across the entire gamut of physics that they're interested in.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then the on follow-up, Maria. Looking at the jump in maintenance revenue quarter-over-quarter, it's much larger than what I would have expected given the paid up performance, even though that was strong. Was there something in particular, did you pass through a price increase on those renewals?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","No, Sterling. No price increase outside upside of the normal activity. We did have some customers that came back on to tucks (56:03). As you can imagine, in certain geographies, maintenance may not be part of their natural annual cadence, but when they want to get on to the current version, then they may have to pay for the lapse in maintenance. And we also \u2013 as I commented in my remarks, we also had a very strong renewal rate for maintenance in the quarter. So \u2013 but nothing outside of the usual relative to pricing.","Operator","The next question will be from Alex Frankiewicz with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alexander Frankiewicz - Berenberg","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering, looking at the pipeline for the next couple of years, how many more mega deals are you seeing? Will they become more regular or is this just a one-off situation?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","As I said, we have a focus on increasing our relationships with customers. We see the opportunity for what we're doing out there in the industry being very strong. And so, suddenly, we see strong robust demand for our customers, where we're working with them on taking advantage of our solutions. So, absolutely, we're excited and looking forward to seeing deals in the future as well of size. If you look at the seven-figure deals, for example, as just one metric, we've been announcing the seven-figure deals since 2007. So with \u2013 we have 10 years of history. And what you can see is, we continue to increase the number of seven-figure deals as we have been going forward year-over-year. And so, we're very excited about our large deal pipeline and our capabilities to address those deals.","Alexander Frankiewicz - Berenberg","Okay. Thanks. And then one follow-up on Discovery Live. What type of pricing are you expecting for that product and what type of TAM expansion are you expecting, based on addressing designers rather than just engineers with your traditional simulation offering?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","We're still working through our pricing on that. But obviously, it's a product that's addressing a different market. And so, the price point is going to be significantly lower than the flagship price points, because it's a different kind of product, it provides different capabilities, and it gives people a different level of insight, it focuses on ease of use as opposed to the other features that you would expect from the flagship products.","It provides real-time simulation. The flagships are significantly more accurate, of course, but they represent a different use case. So, we do see this as TAM expansion, because it's a different cadre of users, but we're working our way through trying to understand exactly what our penetration would look like within the user community that we're going after. And that's something we're actually working throughout, as we speak.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Karlsson with IBP (59:07). Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. It's Erik Karlsson of IBP (59:12). Thanks for taking my question. I would love to hear a little bit more about Europe where you talked about different alignments in different subparts of the region and you shaved (59:21) some country management, et cetera. We'd love to hear how you think it's looking now in terms of quality of the management teams and also how your sales force turnover is looking at the moment? That would be very helpful. Thank you.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, I think, firstly, I have to say that I'm pleased with the leadership team in Europe. I think that the team there has a good handle on what needs to be done and I think they're focused on the results that we want to drive. So, I'm excited about the management team. Obviously, if you looked at the performance in Europe, you saw that in France, for example, we've had a good performance for a few quarters. Obviously, we've had some short-term improvements in the near-term improvements that we've had in Q3 in the UK. But as I said in my remarks, it was off a relatively weak compare from last quarter. So, we are seeing early signs of improvement. Germany, as I said, we have some challenges with our direct sales revenue numbers, but we certainly have strength with our channel partners. And of course, revenue, in many cases, is a trailing indicator of what the activity is within the region. So, I'm pretty pleased with the management. I'm pleased with their focus on demonstrating success in Europe. And I'm looking forward to improvement, as I said, in 2018 and beyond.","Unknown Speaker","Maybe as a follow up there. When you talked about Europe at the Q1 and Q2, you said that it will take some time for this to improve and so on. Would you say that your view has changed either that it can take a bit longer time or happen a bit faster now?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","No. I think it's \u2013 we had to bring in people there, people had to come up to speed. So, I continue to be \u2013 stick by what I said earlier, which is 2018 was a year of transition for our European business with a lot of changes, and we see the improvements in \u2013 being demonstrated in 2018 and beyond, and that's when we're expecting to see the results.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, I'd like to close by expressing my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners. And to the ANSYS team, I am so proud of what we have achieved as one ANSYS. Thank you all for your efforts and thank you for another great quarter.","Thank you all for joining the call today. I look forward to our next call.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

With us today are Mr. Jim Cashman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Cashman for opening remarks.","Jim Cashman ","Okay, good morning and thanks everyone for joining us to discuss our First Quarter Financial Results.","So as usual before we get started, I'd like to introduce Maria Shields, our CFO for our Safe Harbor statements. Maria?","Maria Shields","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks document have been posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website this morning. And they contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to Q1 business results as well as our current Q2 and fiscal year 2015 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I'd like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. And additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call and last prepared remarks, we will be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K.","So Jim, I'll now turn it back to you.","Jim Cashman","Thank you Maria. So let\u2019s start with a recap of the results that the ANSYS team achieved in Q1. Obviously I\u2019m saying that Q1 was a solid quarter on many fronts, it was highlighted by strong cash flows of 114 million, record differed revenue and backlog balance of over a 477 million and non-GAAP operating margins are 47%.","Our non-GAAP revenue growth for the quarter was 8% driven by 11% growth in the North America, 9% growth in Asia Pac and 5% in Europe, all in constant currencies. Our recurring revenue for the quarter was very strong at 76% and our growth came from our broad base at industries which are highlighted actually in more detail within the quarter\u2019s prepared remarks which are posted on our website. But as an [indiscernible] team the quarter end the upcoming year is still in the range and the parameters that we set out on our last call in constant currencies. ","Our recorded revenue was in our guidance range but a bit before the midpoint this was consistent with the currency rates that were also generally at the lower end of or slightly below our guidance range, we never the less achieved non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 for the first quarter in line with the midpoint of our expectations. We also accelerated the pace of returning Capital to our shareholders through share repurchases during the quarter. During Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at an average price of a little over $83 leading 4.4 million shares in our authorized pool as of March 31, 2015.","While our primary use of access capital is for targeted acquisitions, we remained committed to returning capital for our shareholders while simultaneously growing our top line. ","So operational highlights in the first quarter and shortly thereafter include -- well we had 22 customer orders and access of 1 million as compared to the 32 customers with orders in excess of 1 million for Q1 and 2014. Now the comparative change of the number of large deals in Q1 to 2015 is attributable to a combination of fairly obvious factor. The main one was timing including both year deals that closed in Q1 of last year that are simply not scheduled to renew until future years. ","Deals that call earlier in Q4 of 2014, we mentioned some of those on the last call. And of course there were all those inevitable deals that pushed out Q2 of 2015. Also the currency headwinds manifest themselves particularly in Europe and that depressed us on transactions sizes to slightly below the $1 million for the quarter. But one thing I like to notice that while the numbers of the seven figure deals was lower for the quarter, the average size of those deals was up 26% over a last year first quarter which is consistent with the general trends that we've hence changed. ","So other highlights for the quarter, well, actually at the top of it would be the release of ANSYS 16 in Q1. Now this new release delivers major advancement across ANSYS's entire portfolio including structure, fluids, electronics and Systems Engineering Solutions and it really just further increases our technological leadership than again our main goal of providing ANSYS ability to validate their design with complete virtual prototypes. So, we also have a another release plan in the very near future so stay tuned for additional announcements and really come check it out at our investor day.","Secondly, there was continued momentum in our initiative to drive the hiring of our sales teams. During the quarter we had 35 employees on a net basis, the majority in sales which positions us with a 115 more employees than we had year ago. This accelerated pace of hiring really as an important lever to drive the increase sales execution capacity in growth that we've been talking about for 2015. ","Now towards the equity end of Q1, ANSYS was also recognized that company at the year of 2015 Engineering Symposium Simulations awards that were held in Derby, UK and criteria for winning the award includes having a strong market presence and an outstanding reputation for quality and innovative approach to business so kudos to the ANSYS team and my colleagues here for that. So in summary I'm pleased to report that we continue to solidly execute our strategic growth plans and our results despite the negative impact from currency. Our goals for 2015 remain intact to achieve double digit constant currency revenue growth and we remain committed to adding the sales capacity and making changes in the organization to capture the near term and the longer term opportunities that we know exist. One final item I might say before turning it over to Maria is for the last few quarters we've been talking about a systematic approach toward evolving ANSYS for accelerated growth that we've been talking about. ","We first rolled this through Asia and more recently through North America and the results both qualitatively and quantitatively have been encouraging in those regions. So in early 2015 we've begun focusing on Europe historically a good performer. We've already bolstered management ranks in Germany our largest market in Europe. As a second step the global sales capacity ramp up has been a little slow to take hold in Europe and this is being addressed. And then finally we're doing the same examination of workloads and skill sets in Europe as we have recently done in North America and Asia to attain the goals that we've set for ourselves.","So with that, those opening comments I'll now turn it back to Maria to discuss our Q2 and our 2015 guidance before we move into Q&A. So Maria?","Maria Shields","Okay, thanks Jim. As Jim highlighted in his remarks, our results for the first quarter reflect continued solid execution despite the currency headwind. While our first quarter revenue fell slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range, non-GAAP EPS was at the midpoint as a result of our continued rigor around management of expenses, our focus on capital return and ROI also helped us to achieve those results. As we look out towards Q2 in the balance of the year our outlook excluding currency remains unchanged. We expect to continue to execute against our strategic initiative just as we have in the past several quarters. With respect to currency we've outlined revised functions for rates for Q2 and the balance of the year in the prepared remarks document accompanying our press release today. As a result of the updated assumption our outlook for 2Q is non-GAAP revenue in the range of 230 to 238 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $0.78 to $0.82. ","With respect to fiscal year 2015 we're updating our previous outlook for the full year to reflect the strengthening of the US dollar particularly against the Euro. Those updates translate to our revised outlook of non-GAAP revenue in the range of 943 to 968 million and non-GAAP EPS $3.40 to $3.49. From a qualitative perspective our Q2 guidance takes into account the currency updates that I just mentioned. For 2015 we're assuming no significant changes either way in the overall macro climate. We also see sales and revenue growth rates ramping up as the year progresses, particularly as the new sales heads that we've bought on in Q4 and Q1 begin producing and as our recently announced general initiatives begin to take hold. As we mentioned in this morning's earnings announcement our Q2 and fiscal year 2015 guidance includes charges of $0.01 to $0.02 related to organizational changes that will primarily incur in Europe. So with that operator we'll now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen at this time we'll begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anil Doradla from William Blair; please go ahead with your question.","John Smiths","Hey guys, this is John Smiths on for Anil, thanks for taking my questions. First one, want to start up with ANSYS 16.0, it's been several months now since the release, just hoping you can maybe provide some additional color on maybe any customer feedback regarding specifically the ease of use initiatives and maybe talk a little bit about the expansion to the number of users you're seeing so far.","Jim Cashman","Yes, well, keep in mind this is pretty early in the cycle but the -- I mean the anecdotal proof points we have on that are related to -- you know first and foremost I think from established customers that maybe we're already -- they know it's -- I mean they appreciate some of the increase in usability, but I think the increase in the customization toolkits that allow them to taper and tailor some of that to their specific needs is probably been the thing that we heard the most information on.","Keep in mind that on the, on some of the new paradigms we have for usage we've talked about this in the past as being a tiered step approach so you have like along the lines of Windows 1, Window 2, Windows 3.1, you have several steps there but you have to get that first step in there with the production release that people can continue to move on, but the general result there have been positive also.","John Smiths","Great, thanks. And then just a quick follow up, regarding the, you know $0.01 to $0.02 impact from the restructuring. You know is this something that we could expect to see potentially happening again in the second half of the year, is this kind of going to be one time charge related to the Europe restructuring?","Jim Cashman","Keep it in mind, these are things that we do not do [indiscernible] and in fact the only thing I\u2019d say is if you go back -- I mean you can test us against thing that we mentioned on the last few earnings call which is part of public record, it\u2019s just that we weren\u2019t going try to simultaneously effect all changes at once. So, we worked in a specific methodology was very structured, we called out at Asia -- about a year and half to almost -- about a year and half-two years ago and I think you've seen all pretty significant numerical changed there but it was involving all those aspects, in terms of leadership, workload balancing, sales capacity, support building and even some infrastructural building. Now, when we've had that pretty well as late we've talked about that, we said, we're going to do some similar things in North America and I think we saw in the recent once. I mean, it's very early but -- some of the numerical impact of that has been seen and now like I said, over the years Europe been a strong performer. But now we want to put the attention there, we want to have that changed methodology. So this is a very systematic sequenced approach, it just we didn't want to have everything in plus all at once. Because it take that, it takes what focus and takes management then so with that mind, these are fully major systematic steps. And I don't -- we don't anticipated drip, drip, drip kind of asset to those and that assuming that general economic factors stay somewhat in league, but this is part of a structured plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Maria first for you, could you update us on your cash flow expectation for the year, if its changed from the 360 to 380 range, that's you've talked about a quarter ago for 2015?","Maria Shields","Yes, I said mostly related to currency, Jay, I'd say probably a range of 340 to 360; it's comfortable for us, right now.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. And for Jim, you eluded in your remarks to a forth coming new release post ANSYS 16, I assume that you're eluding to your forth coming Cloudy and EKM updates and perhaps some other new initiatives as well and is there anything to say but that now or is that continued at the analyst meeting.","Jim Cashman","Yes, first of all, at that the what you've mentioned as a subset -- all be it a significant subset for the more relief, I am going to leave that as a teaser to investor day but it's most of you know, we've software service offering for almost 15 years continuously. But the cloud is different thing, it's not just about sticking any kind of software out there and say, now you have the access, there are lot of things we did with regard to partnership, with regard to pricing and demand elasticity and things like that and as you also eluded we\u2019ll let the cat out of the bag, the way that it links in with the engineering knowledge management system to provide a framework to that. So this is just not dialing and you getting access to single agent capability, so more holistic approach and we want to make sure that as we talked our long chaining software and service, that we brought it up, but again I think, there will, we say that for the June timeframe and -- we're pretty excited about it. I think it says long-term trend, I mean the trends for driving simulation in this usage, they are a little bit more complication as we've discussed in a lot of typical cloud applications, but I think we've got very good go forward plan on that. But that one we have to wait and then apart from that all the others stuff in \u201916, it\u2019s kind of the natural thing that you would expect in the point release, which it's going to be a ton of features, which we\u2019ll be able to go into but we're also list on the website as you know, mostly audience here their eyes might glaze over if we go into very deep later.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Understood. One last if I may, you mentioned the recent segmentation of your channel including a class of what you called a [indiscernible] qualification, I understand this still relative early for having put that in place, but how do you think this will play out over the rest of the year and into next year in terms of perhaps changing the proportion contribution from the channel versus direct?","Jim Cashman","Well, that get into crystal ball territory, but the one thing I'd say, okay -- the one thing is numerically, you can see channel performance among those the elite performers actually was pretty strong for Q1 and we would expect that to continue on. Now what might be hot behind that, I want to stay because the numbers are the numbers, but qualitatively what might be helping those numbers and also what making just the all quite half in at least the direction we're going is I think the new ground rules the coordination of those things, the system is systemizing on a global basis of that, at least from all the channel partners I've talked -- I had chance to talk to most of them, was it just gave them confidence to invest on a longer term basis which means they are also upping their sales capacity and their support capacity and I think the other thing that\u2019s most telling is that you look historically a lot of these companies have come up from a single physics background and that's really kind of a tied one hand behind your back, when you look at the power of the portfolio and the platform and we actually have people now that are extending their portfolio and that can only really serve to provide more opportunity. How quickly that comes in, we're pretty, I'll say almost bullish on what can happen over the next few years but how quickly that happens, the ramp up -- we'll just have to quietly wait and see.","Operator","The next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your question.","Saket Kalia","First on bookings, we can all sort of see how perpetual license is done, just looking at the revenue. Can you talk about how leaf license and maintenance bookings performed in a constant currency basis?","Maria Shields","Roughly about 9% higher than what the number that you can probably do back of the envelope, now Saket. About a $20 million negative impact from currency. So if you're work in constant currency and in sales booking about 6% growth.","Saket Kalia","Okay, got it. And then, a little bit more qualitatively -- you saw nice growth in North America, which seems a little different than what the manufacturing data would imply. Could you talk about it Jim, in terms of what you think is driving that?","Jim Cashman","Well again, understand that the issue of the manufacturing data but at the heart of it -- and this even true in 2009 where we maybe weren't hit quite as severely as some of the other company. That's because the -- even the manufacturing and some consumer sectors were down a little bit, people were still innovating and trying to drive new products and our sector was being driven more from the R&D spend, if you will than just the pure manufacturing spend and we continue to see those kind of pushes going forward. Now we did see some sectors frankly in North America like the oil industry where even long term investment patterns tend to somewhat [ebb] and flow with the barrel price of crude and things like that but it was, you know and that some of that also being affected with some of the currency.","But in general we saw a push toward large innovation, a lot we\u2019ve got detailed in our prepared remarks which I had mentioned or posted on Website, but when you get to some of the electronics and the automotive and some of the aerospace type of activities, the common things we've actually been talking about maybe for a couple of years, that's really what's been driving that. And that's even in light of, when you see some of the growth there, keep in mind from that growth in North America, actually, even slightly depressed for how we normally would had said because we talked about the tendency towards some of the larger customers now moving into time-based, multiyear time-based licenses when they might have done the big lumpy perpetual. But that's also the reason why I mentioned this record deferred and backlog balance which is approaching a $0.5 billion. So, I mean, the numbers all kind of weaved together when you look at them in that holistic sense.","Saket Kalia","Got it, that's really helpful, thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Buncovar","This is Jason Buncovar on for Steve. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question -- I was wondering if you could comment on success that you're seeing selling to design engineers, and which products are you selling to them? Are you going to those users with our the SpaceClaim or the core ANSYS product?","Jim Cashman","Well, keep in mind, that if it's actually both and if you look at it, they're -- I mean when we talk about ease-of-use, which is the main thing toward being in their desired market outlook. I will plug in here is that just dumbing down the product is not going to solve designer problems when they're solving complicated product-release issues.","But given that it to the ease-of-use, just like we saw with what happened with the home PC and portable electronics that ease-of-use is necessary, but it comes in many different flavors. So first of all you got to have the overall power. Second of all, you have to have the usability. Third of all, basically the mechanics of interacting with the software, you have to be intuitive and straightforward, now that latter part I said, we've been incrementally doing that over many releases and this actually post, ANSYS 16 is one of the first one, where on platform basis we kind of been able to release some new usage paradigm in addition of customization as I mentioned. But you mentioned a second thing which is also very key and there is no doubt that the blending of some of the intuitive direct modeling space claim kind of capability, and also weaving those in, it used to be geometry was a step, and then making the math model was step and then running the model was a step and we've actually been able to make dramatic progress in terms of converting those first two steps of geometry and the math model in terms of just making the model, of something the people can quickly interact with and from the usability standpoint that may be one of the most significant things that came both in the early part to 16 and the upcoming releases as well as the integration of SpaceClaim in general going in the technology basis. So [indiscernible] and they get continued to progress again as you think that your own PC over the last 20 year and how it evolved into tablets and wearable devices, you can see how that ease of use paradigm never release stalled, it just continued to advance; and you're going to see the same thing with our software, but at the heart of it is always going to be software that accurately reliably gives people the information they need to committed major profit releases.","Jason Buncovar","Great, that's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on that. You mentioned integrating some of the SpaceClaim functionality in ANSYS16. I just wanted to make sure-- are you also selling standalone SpaceClaim product or you getting traction selling that as well? ","Jim Cashman","Yeah, in fact and here we you might have noticed that in previous quarter we\u2019re saying that it was a little bit slow on the uptake and we're not really to that -- that\u2019s really not been a talking point. We did put -- there are a couple of different aspects to it, first of all there is a CAD aspect of SpaceClaim and that's really not our focus. We said that from day 1. We love the inherit technology, so there's been an influx of different smaller channels that have been interested in that capabilities and that's fine, we are going to focus on the simulation, innovation, virtual prototyping. However, with than mind, I mean from day 1, we always had geometry creation, geometry integration with other CAD partners and players and things like that and some geometries always leads sub rule that innovation process and this is just the main reason why we -- SpaceClaim was [indiscernible] to take that to a new level with us and we found that actually did the benefits succumb from somebody being able on the fly and your speed of thought, be able to generate innovative designs and concepts very quickly, has been something to really unlocks this overall person simulations, so again early on in the process those are the things that we\u2019ve seen right from the get-go. ","Jason Buncovar","Great thanks that's very helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question ","Sterling Auty ","Thanks, hi guys. I'm wondering to start with can you give us -- what was the SpaceClaim contribution in the quarter?","Jim Cashman","It was somewhere in the -- I thinks about the 2 million to 3 million range.","Sterling Auty ","Okay. And the 115 headcount increase that you mentioned year-over-year. I want to make sure that I'm clear -- was that 115 all in sales or that was the total net increase? And what portion? ","Jim Cashman","115 was the net increase, the majority were in sales, but it wasn\u2019t before 115.","Sterling Auty","Okay and looking at how you've layered in the hires and noting that it's mainly Asia and North America to start with, how should we think about when that productivity ramp is really going to hit? It seems like with that level of SpaceClaim contribution, that the organic constant currency growth in March looks to be about the same as what it was in December, so haven't seen the impact yet.","Jim Cashman","Well, we're really looking at the second quarter -- second half, we are looking at it and that\u2019s always been built into our guidance. So, Auty, you've added very early statement as I said were -- if you look at what we said three months ago, I mean what with currency impacting out there, what we saw in the quarter and what we are seeing for the end of the year, it\u2019s pretty much in our projection of course we want to include Europe, we want to as I mentioned roll Europe in there, it was little bit slower on the uptake of adding the sales capacity and alike of that was something that we started addressing very early on. But answer to your question the adjusting isn\u2019t really -- that really is in a whole change in the dynamic of sales ramp up. ","It's typically in its six to nine months to the marginally productive. I mean there is early on, they are still producing sales and things like that but I'm talking about when they target ramp up and then quite frankly they -- we charge that over as you really doesn\u2019t go have some topic until about it year three or four year, when they start to get up to the full competency which then price had dictate the sales productivity on a go forward stand point from there.","Sterling Auty ","And last question -- I think you mentioned FX actually shrunk some of the deal sizes. What I'm curious about is, whether you are seeing some of the FX actually -- forget about the translation of the contract value -- but actual demand impacts from FX. I personally would have thought to get to double-digit constant currency growth this year; I would've thought we would have started a little bit higher than where we did. So I'm wondering if there is that indirect impact on demand from FX in some regions. ","Jim Cashman","Very-very little that we can see from the indirect. You might have some in some of those smaller market, the Eastern Europe of course we've talked about the issue of -- we have a very subdue with you of Russia, which you know couple of years has been a very significant one, but the effects that we are talking are really like a fewer translations type of impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Koenig from Koenig; please go ahead with your question.","Steve Koenig","I think I get the picture on quota carriers, they were up quite sharply year-on-year as of the Q1 call but mostly, just to confirm, that occurred in Asia-PAC and North America really not so much in Europe is that correct?","Jim Cashman","Yes, disproportionately and that was again a lot, that was happening -- a little bit happened at the end of last year and a lot was happening in Q1, throughout Q1.","Steve Koenig","Okay, and then I want to ask then really the questions related to that. The reorg of sales into a named accounts group that was pretty significant in size. Where did this occur and what regions?","Jim Cashman","First of all, it wasn't a holistic approach; it was a bifurcation of the sales force, because there are still a lot of things related to developmental work in the smaller medium enterprise. However it was -- so we always did a really good job at those major accounts. You could see the statistics of those; you know the top 20-30 of those really major ones. However the rest were in kind of a more of a territorial [m\u00e9lange] and so we broke it, so first of all I want to paint the picture that it wasn't just all named accounts but that tells you about the additional, I'm sorry, go ahead. ","There is a push toward to the focus of those major, of the major accounts and that focus really is -- actually the one thing I can tell you is that it has allowed for a lot more interaction and specific activities within those named accounts. So in other words I guess that focus has led to some very targeted type of things which are -- actually been pretty encouraging and in the meantime kind of fun.","Steve Koenig","Okay so, maybe for my follow up, I want to clarify that and that's the follow up. So I'm asking specifically what regions did you create the named accounts group in and was there any disruption from that and then do you expect -- when do you expect to see acceleration from that, is that also a second half phenomenon?","Jim Cashman","Absolutely, because it takes time to get to build those relationships, know the different things and if you will just break the status quo of how the customer has been interacted with, sometimes on a very tactical level. Now how it played through, I mean obviously it's one that's very set, very well matched toward North America, there are areas where it's also being used in Asia but there're other things where we have to take into account. So for instance you might take somewhere in China and the split or might be along the line of state owned enterprises versus multinational companies involved there and other types. So, the main thing has been toward getting specific people focused toward a specific short term and a higher return type of activity, and one more thing I want to say is, the one thing is, numerically encouraging to us is, we have seen the gross pipelines increase as a result of this overall activity but gross pipelines there can be a gain in numbers so, at the end of the day if it doesn't flow through the pipe and ultimately turn into sales then it's largely hyped so. But we have seen those numbers and we're now expecting to see some of that move through the pipe again over that same two-three quarter timeframe. ","Steve Koenig","So just to clarify Jim, it sounds as if from your commentary you didn't really see any disruption from this reorganization in the areas that you did it, and you're expecting it to become productive in a few quarters, is that a fair understanding?","Jim Cashman","It's a fair assessment, I have to say I would also expect there would be a little bit disruption, but sometimes you have to do that just to get things moving. However it was not, it was not noticeable and it was not one of those things where we said, oh my gosh, you know things have -- so I'm sure there was growing pains and disruption out there but nothing that on a total basis which caused us any pause or concern. So it's pretty much along the lines we assumed. Does that help?","Steve Koenig","Yes, certainly does, thanks a lot. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Rogers from Great Lakes Review; please go ahead with your question. ","Jason Rogers","Hello. Looking at North America, the weakness in the oil and gas sector that you saw have a material impact on the growth rate for the quarter?","Jim Cashman","Well, I don't know if it had an impact I guess you have to define material, was it a 5% change? No. Was it a point or two? Very possibly. Keep in mind the one thing we've got is, we've got in this very early going, we've got a very broad based industry composition and therefore, we don't have any one industry that really accounts for more than 20% of our business, so even when there are those kinds of dislocations in there, it's tough to move the overall number. It was noticeable and it did have an impact on the growth rates.","Jason Rogers","All right, and if you're able, would you be able to quantify the number of seven figure deals for the quarter if you were to exclude FX and include those that have been pushed out to 2Q?","Jim Cashman","We would be able to but I didn't run those numbers -- we're still building the base so, we'd have to kind of like of sort through it on the fly. I don\u2019t have that number but I mean, there was not that we knew that, that was one of the three things but that's first and foremost one is, when you have a four year deal with somebody and you can see this it's expanding the differed backlog balances, you know you're not going to be -- you know that that is not going to be in the renewal account and that's really not disconcerting think it all and as I recall we even talked about the couple of things -- fairly significant that pulled into Q4.","So, the fact is we're going to have a revenue ramp up from that; it just won\u2019t count as that to be very cardinal number of numbers in there. So, what would we want to do is, we want to look at that kind of balance over the long-term we\u2019ll be looking at renewal rates and growth rates in those, which is one reason why highlighted the growth rate in those average orders that did come up because that\u2019s something that seems to be something that follows with every one of these major deals that involved time-based licenses long-term kind of progression. And so the fact is if we can continue to have our largest customers increasing at a total population and growing disproportionately to that the company growth rate, we consider that very good, while we're also developing that small-medium enterprise and designer elements of the business.","Jason Rogers","All right. And the percentage of these seven-figure deals that have moved to time-based licenses was that percentage similar to the previous quarter?","Jim Cashman","It's a little bit higher, we're seeing like we said. It's not like there is a student body write-on here but we're seeing a continued trend and like I said even company that for decade have been purchases of periodic lumps of perpetual licenses, they are some of people, they're also doing that, I guess if anything, make it partially that provide a control over ramp and understanding of their own usage and look at as a manageable asset.","Jason Rogers","All right and finally, I wonder if you could comment on the current environment for acquisitions, what opportunities you're seeing and evaluations. Thank you.","Jim Cashman","Well, valuations are kind of all over the map but they're tending more toward the richer once. We're seeing a good population -- again the once that we've looked, we started talking more about things might be in the 50 million to 70 million kind of revenue range and another [indiscernible] very distinct technology that are relatively good growers, but there are may be in the 1 million to 5 million revenue standpoint, they're important from the technology standpoint but it's not as if it actually moves the dial. So, we're seeing a reasonable population of those but it is calculated around the evaluations which I've say are too rich and even above that.","Operator","Our next question is come from Ross MacMillan of RBC. Please go ahead with your question.","Ross MacMillan","Maria I just want to confirm, do you have the sequential impact on deferred revenue from foreign exchange in the quarter?","Maria Shields","Yes, it's about 8.6 million Ross.","Ross MacMillan","Thank you. And just given what you are seeing in terms of either billings, or current bookings or however you think about order intake into the business, I was just curious as to, I think you're guiding to that sort of [9%] constant currency revenue growth this year. Do you think the order intake, however you measure that, will be about the same rate? Or do you think it could be higher or lower? How do you think about that metric?","Jim Cashman","Actually, we would expect that it probably will historically be a bit above, the revenue growth however what can affect that is, you got multiyear deals, you got the timing of those, how many years as they involved and things like that and as we mentioned on the last call, we had some where people went and said okay we want to go multiyear and they said well okay so here\u2019s our framework for four years, but contractually we're only committing to two years. Now in reality are they going to pull the plug on all software that point, no, we don't count that in our numbers? So, the way that those we're coming and under what terms are ready to do that. But if you look at everything is being on apples-to-apples basis, I'd anticipate that the order rates would actually outpace the recognize revenue rates, Maria, is there anything?","Maria Shields","No, that's fine.","Ross MacMillan","That's really helpful. And then Jim, just two for you quickly. I think you did mention you saw slightly higher percentage of time-based or flexible license deals. Do you know what those actually were in the quarter out of the 22 over 1 million. Is there a specific number you can highlight?","Jim Cashman","I don't have that parts, in front of me. That\u2019s something I think we can take a look at.","Maria Shields","The only thing I will comment Ross is and we eluded to this on the last call is that the largest deal in the quarter came to us and we've been working on this obviously for the past couple of months but historically if you look at last year's Q1 or the year before, it manifested itself in a large perpetual. This year it manifested itself in ratable recognitions, so helping to contribute to the buildup in that deferred revenue and backlog number.","Ross MacMillan","Understood, that's helpful. And then Jim, last one. On Europe, if we go back -- you'd taken a charge in Q4 for headcount reductions, and I just wanted to make sure I understood what the charge was that you're anticipating for Q2. Is this equivalent to what we saw in Q4, but for Europe this time around as opposed to a different region?","Jim Cashman","Yes, essentially that is the nuts and bolts of it. Maria?","Maria Shields","Yes, I said you know as Jim in his script talked about how we've been systematically going across the globe making changes, because quite frankly what got us here is not going to get us to where we want to go and so there are certain skill sets, that quite frankly we need to hire in. But it's not going to be at the cost of just instrumentalism to bring down the margin. So we're trying to balance investing in the business and bringing intelligent skill sets that don't necessarily exist that we need to continue to grow the business and at the same time being cognizant that there are some that just don't align with where we're going in the future. So now it\u2019s -- we're taking a look at Europe and we\u2019re going to market strategy and similar things that we did in other geographies.","Ross MacMillan","Understood. So, as the portfolio has become more complex. There's different skill sets and, therefore, you're trying to invest in the right skill sets given the portfolio of product set today?","Jim Cashman","Yes, that's correct, I mean keep in mind we've always talked about that we have to have extreme deep knowledge. So that's an important part, however on the part that\u2019s expanding also is that you need to have the understanding how the portfolio and multi-physics work together and how systems can actually be optimized, not just, sub-pieces of that. Now those are some of the major things where we need to bolster those and now we are turning our attention to that.","Ross MacMillan","Perfect. Thanks so much and congrats.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Williams from Evercore. I advise please go ahead with your question.","Matt Williams","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. On the multi-year engagement in contracts gradually shifting in that direction, can you give us a little bit of color in terms of how much of that activity is being driven from your end, in terms of actively engaging and starting to walk people down that path? And how much of it is really customers coming to you and saying we have [indiscernible] and we like to do it with you guys.","Jim Cashman","Yes, it does. Really it's a collaborative, it's really had a collaborative approach where customers are looking at what they are sane long term acquisition thing as opposed to a transactional kind of a relationship and we're looking at what is the proper rate at which we can instill that software in there and it actually turns into a collaboration process and I think the only thing that\u2019s happened as opposed to over the last few year, I mean we just gave a handful of customers did, and now it's becoming a little bit more broad based and we have to continue to put a systematic rigor around how we do that, but it's not like we created a forced march for the customers and not the like the customers are pounding on the gate for pitchforks. It's just more along lines of as we expand and they expand their usage, they had to be able to do that in a controlled managed way and we also want to be able to help provide that to them.","So, if anything I think that the healthiest aspect is, as opposed to treating each one as a purchase transaction, it's actually been more of a charting, if you will, of a multi-year implementation strategy.","Matt Williams","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just at a high-level, one of the themes that you guys have been talking about has been the Internet of things and what that could potentially mean for the business. So, I'm wondering if you could just give sort of high level update around IOT and maybe any particular segments where your solutions are particularly resonating with those customers.","Jim Cashman","Yes, there's actually few aspects for one; One is the Internet of Things as an infrastructure, so if you look at all of things where you got to have a lot of connected devices, a lot of times they have antennas and they have got electronic content, but they have to have structural and mechanical survivability, in other words, you have to have that connectivity, if you got a billion devices connected up you can't be having a billion service calls for failed components, so helping companies get involved in that kind of information in terms of helping to build out the infrastructure is one aspect of it. There's actually another thing that I'm particularly excited about is when you have all these connected things, they're going to tell you what's going on, but they're not necessarily will be able to tell you what you do about it or what does that imply in terms of, you're getting all this feedback of operational data and things like that from the real world, it might be well, how close you would get in to schedule maintenance or failures, so that concept of linking it in with the design intent of the product and how it was designed and how the real world is comparing to the assumptions of what was designed for.","Now taking all that information and tying that into a simulation backbone is very key. But that's something it'll take a little bit more time over time but just helping companies get out there with products that can -- that can have the connectivity and survivability to fit into that framework is one where we see a lot of early movement.","Operator","And we have follow up from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead with your follow up.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Very good, thank you. Jim, I would like to ask about two of your larger verticals and your expectations there. First, when we take the percentages of revenue by vertical that you shared with us, the combined electronics and semi's are typically about one third of your revenue. And you've had some pretty good growth there over the last couple of years, mid-teens it looks like in 2014. The proportion was a little bit down in Q1, again on a combined basis. And so it does look as though electronics and semi's may have slowed a little bit for you in the quarter. Could you talk about your expectations for that over perhaps the remainder of the year in terms of the capacity and so forth?","Then the second question, I'll just get that in is, there's a view in the industry that in the automotive vertical, one of your larger ones as well, that over the next 2 to 4 years, there are going to be some potentially important new selections or re-selections by many of the car companies, particularly outside of the United States and a lot of it having to do with, perhaps, new or re-done PLM and systems engineering decisions and I'm sure you're aware of all that. My question is, to the extent that this process occurs in automotive, what could be the corollary effects on simulation, in terms of pulling through some perhaps new simulations selections by auto as they go through these other selections as well?","Jim Cashman","Well, it obviously helps to drive that mean again as you noted our growth in automotive has been fairly strong and in some ways -- maybe back in the 80s some of the analysis capabilities kind of went hand-in-hand with some of the CAD, CAM kind of capabilities but there has been lot of individual account level improvement along those lines and I think that we\u2019ll continue to see that and how they're actually get reconciled during the annually PLF re-factoring -- that I really don't know and maybe few people ultimately do.","Now, in the electronics side, the reason we separate those is there is a fundamental difference in the cyclical nature of what's happening at say maybe the those top 20 or 30 chip manufacturers, which are heavily Apache oriented versus what are people doing maybe even with set parts of chips, they're already developed in determining and creating overall electronic devices whether it's for consumer whatever. And then the other thing is that keep in mind, the automotive thing, there are many companies that we're traditional electronics names and they're scored that way but they're shifting major parts of their business toward specifically serving this need you noted or this demand that's emerging in the automotive and avionics kind of world. So, it's kind of a continue moment that's why we really segment out what's going on in that shifting because what's happening in automotive in general is it's help by its related with what might be happening with moving to the smaller or nanometer chipsets and the 3D chips and things like that. So, they really kind of even though there both electrical in nature, it's the same thing as automotive and the oil industry both deal with mechanical structures, but they don't -- the industries even though they deal with similar physical phenomenal, it's not exactly the same thing. We basically expect those two sectors to kind of still be linked but operate independently but there definitely is going to be a push in that dynamic; we see the continued growth on the automotive side and in those nontraditional ways relate to the electronics, whether it's for safety systems or controls or whole range of different activities.","Operator","Again ladies and gentlemen, at this time we've reached the end of today question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Cashman for any closing remarks.","Jim Cashman","Well, I think we just about covered it everybody, but again thanks for the questions and your time. So, I guess honestly, I'd like to thank everybody for the participations in the call and the continuing interest and support of ANSYS. So, also I'd like to do my normal shout-out to the entire ANSYS team for the execution in Q1 and just that commitment to all the things, we just talked about in this call.","So, in short we believe that we're well positioned to drive growth and achieve our goals in the coming year. Basically I'd say for two very significant reasons, the first is, we've increase stability from some of those larger multiyear enterprise opportunities and second we've been successful in our more aggressive approach to sales hiring that we left reference to in the last two calls. And we're also expanding as we've mentioned with focus on Europe and we expect that will have a positive implication for driving a sales and revenue growth that particularly as we mentioned in the second half of the year. So, when you back that up with the fact that an unparalleled product offering and the longevity that we have with our customers and to some of the basics in terms of high recurring revenue and those type of capabilities, we remain pretty bullish on that.","So, we're committed basically to driving operating cash flow and continuing to generate significant returns to our stockholders. So I'll put one last one again, we look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day, that's at June 2nd just outside of Detroit and it will be held in conjunction with the Automotive Simulation World Congress, so it'll be a unique opportunity for you to learn more about the exciting growth prospects available to us and we hope to see you there, so thanks everybody and we'll talk to again next quarter. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference call, we do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your telephone lines.

Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the ANSYS 2012 Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Cashman. Please go ahead.","James E. Cashman","Okay, thanks, Amy. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us discussing our 2012 second quarter financial results. So again, consistent with our normal protocol, all of the general information and key topics relative to both Q2 and the first half of 2012 business results, they're included in our earnings release and in some prepared remarks that we posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning.","So, but as always, before we get started, I'll introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, for our Safe Harbor Statement. So Maria?","Maria T. Shields","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd just like to remind you that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are available via our website.","Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the world and our business outlook today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum. Also, consistent with our standard practice, during the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release, the related materials and the Form 8-K.","So Jim, I'll turn it back over to you for some opening comments.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Thanks, Maria. Okay, so before we open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to briefly highlight a few points about our Q2 results and the updated 2012 outlook.","So -- and now, I'll begin by saying that Q2 was really a strong quarter for us, but it was also a pretty busy quarter. And it ended ahead of what we originally expected on earnings and above the midpoint of the revenue range. And this was even factoring in some additional currency headwinds that we observed, that we had actually absorbed during the quarter.","So as we demonstrated over many years, the strength of the revenue performance, combined with our own discipline around spending, drove operating leverage and earnings beyond what we had originally guided.","Overall, we achieved double-digit growth in reported and constant currency in both software license and maintenance revenue, and of course, this yielded a new all-time high in deferred revenue balance. This in turn, as usual, drove strong margins and cash flows from operations.","So also consistent with what we've outlined about use of the cash, even dating back to the Investor Day we had in early March, during Q2, we repurchased 1 million shares of stock, which leaves around 2 million shares remaining in the authorized pool. We also continued our strategy to expand breadth and depth in our multiphysics portfolio, with the addition of Esterel, which we announced during the quarter and actually just closed yesterday.","Speaking back to that Investor Day, many of you might recall when we met in early March at that time in New York City, we laid out some of the key themes of our long-term strategy, including the opportunities that lay ahead for the future of Simulation Driven Product Development. The Esterel acquisition is just another step forward that enables us to respond to our customers' new reality, and that's a business environment where they simply can't afford to compromise on depth, breadth or quality of the simulation tools that they're using to solve their own increasingly complex design challenges.","But it also uniquely positions us to provide embedded systems simulation with certified cogeneration further differentiating our solutions. So other comments, you can find in there, but our industry composition, it remains averse with continuing success in areas in this particular quarter, such most notably things like automotive, aerospace and defense and material and chemical processing.","So the result of all this is that we reiterated our outlook on fiscal year 2012 non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP EPS. This also translates to Q3 revenue in the range of $197 million to $204 million, an EPS of $0.67 to $0.69, with revenue for the full year in the range of $810 million to $830 million, an EPS of $2.78 to $2.87.","And before we wrap up, I'd like to provide some qualitative context around the guidance. First and foremost, first and foremost, the fundamentals of our business and the customer interest and market demand remain intact. And although we are maintaining our original revenue range, we've not just slapped an even probability across that range for a number of obvious reasons. First of all, the variance that we're experiencing over this protracted period carry through for the first couple of quarters of results, and it's demonstrated the current unevenness in the macro environment. So as compared to our revenue outlook, while we're on our guidance range, we wound up in the lower half of guidance in the first quarter, in the upper half for Q2. So there's a lot of variance in that.","Secondly, as we pointed out in our Q1 call, during these kind of times, our lease license ratios can be more volatile and that affects short-term impact. There's just an ocean of uncertainty regarding the resolution of the Eurozone and other global issues. The volatility of the currency rates remain, and there's also a continuation of just general macro uncertainty around the predictability, timing and composition of deals. Now what does this mean? I mean the bottom line is, there -- the timing of deals are difficult, but there's a greater probability that buying cycles extend rather than compress in this time frame.","So the sum of these factors would favor probably a heavier probability below the midpoint of the range. But while the growth demand stays relatively stable, this is the primary tenet for us reiterating that range.","Now in addition, we've also updated our currency rate assumptions to be in line with the current rates and added in the impact of Esterel for Q3 and the remainder of 2012. And they -- and essentially, the 2 of these things, one's a slight increase, one's a decrease, so essentially the 2 of these net each other out.","So the outlook also assumes an increased ramp in our second half spend in connection with the hiring resources for 2012 and preparing for 2013 and beyond, and also some marketing activities around the release of ANSYS 14.5, which we're really excited about and of course, the inclusion of Esterel, even in the early stages.","So to net it all out, our long-term enthusiasm remains intact. We believe now is the time to invest in our business, to prepare for the long term and the opportunity that we see over the next 3 to 5 years, but we're also cognizant of the world around us.","A final point that we'd like to add in there is that -- talk about some of the thoughts concerning the uses of cash, and I think we've been demonstrating that, particularly over the last couple of quarters on many fronts. But consistent with what we've been saying for the past several calls, several years, and we highlighted in our Investor Day, first and foremost, we plan to continue to invest in our business for the long term. Nothing's changed on that front.","Second of all, we'll continue to pay down the outstanding debt, of course, which steps up a little bit to over $26 million in quarterly principal payments beginning in Q3. Then, number three, and not necessarily third in terms of importance, but as the Esterel acquisition demonstrates, we have been and we will continue to look at opportunities around strategic M&A that allow us to accelerate the realization of our vision and extend and elevate this overall thing in our customer engagements.","So with those brief words, Amy, I think we'll be prepared to begin with the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Perry Huang at Goldman Sachs.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask a follow-up question for the Esterel acquisition. Jim, you mentioned that essentially, FX and macro was offset by the Esterel acquisition in terms of guidance. But could you provide anymore color around the revenue and earnings contribution for the September and fiscal '12 guidance?","James E. Cashman","Well, yes, somewhere in the $5 million, $6 million, $7 million range for the remainder of the year. There are some interesting issues there in terms of the revenue recognition, which is why we've got to cover this very carefully. Because in general, the way it was set up, we may have to actually recognize things on a pro rata basis over an extended period, which will stretch out. So they may wind up a little bit depressed. And of course, we just closed, we'll be getting into some of these details. But this is our -- and we'll be able to refine that over time, but we don't want to get premature. So that's one of the big things. And of course, you can also infer the contra impact of rates from the guidance, the published rates that we posted compared. So they are roughly awash. Keep in mind, the other thing is that when you factor in the Esterel, the fact that we'll have to kind of stretch it out, I mean, almost on a quasi-lease kind of basis, even if it was a paid-up license, it's a VSOE kind of issue, the main thing is that if you look at the way some of the structure of these companies -- Apache included, and Esterel, you look at the year-end impact. And when you look at the back end loading of commission rates, it's actually -- even though it's a good business over the next 12 months and we'll be able to build it into our business model, it will be relatively flat in terms of earnings contribution for the next 4 or 5 months.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, if I could ask a question about the performance in Europe. You highlighted sort of continued macro issues in certain markets and also longer sales cycles. I was wondering if you could provide any more color on the U.K.? I think last quarter, you mentioned there were some execution issues there. But for this quarter, it looks like revenue was up sequentially, just wondering if those issues have been largely resolved?","James E. Cashman","I get -- in this environment, first of all, there are always the things that we can do better internally and there are the things that are around us that we just have to -- if the sea is chopping around, we have to navigate them the best we can. The things that we've done on the internal front, yes, they are showing to -- they definitely are showing some of the causal relationships to some of the results you observed. With regard to the other things related to the overall environment, there are so many ups and downs over the next few months, which we see on a global basis, not just England. And we haven't heard this yet, but I mean, I remember back in 2008, all ChiNex slowed down for a quarter because of the Olympics. Now will England slow down because of the Olympics? Haven't heard it. But I mean those type of things always have been slow. Those things are factored into the overall view. So I can't -- I really can't speak to all the puts and takes that are going to happen in the macro environment. But we're relatively pleased, I'll say, guardedly pleased about some of the steps and some of the progress that we're seeing. I wouldn't -- I never -- for years, I've never claimed that we've ever been all the way there in any markets that we've been in. So I won't make that stretchier. But the direction factor is definitely in the right direction.","Operator","The next question comes from Sterling Auty at JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So in terms of Esterel, I didn't hear in your answer, and I'm sorry if I just misinterpreted it, but where is that going to be placed in terms of which part of the sales organization is going to be pushing it? How, if any, integration of their technology is going into any of the other product lines? And who makes the purchase decision at your core customers for their set of solutions at this point?","James E. Cashman","Well, first of all, it's going to be relatively kept separate because it really -- there really is not a lot of overlap with our existing technologies, and that's a very positive good thing. Now the second part is, just like we've done in every integration that we've done, we actually -- it's not like done in one 100% chunk all at once. We actually take the very important parts. And where we focus first on this one is, for obvious reasons, how embedded software affects system functioning. So it's going to be in our overall system, our overall system portfolio type of solutions and connecting up with that. So we can actually see the impact that the software functionality will add to the inherent design inputs of the more traditionally physical aspects of the hardware design. So we're going to keep it in that particular direction. Yes, the -- and the other thing is, one thing that's very interesting is we haven't been able to do much of it because we hadn't closed until yesterday. But the minute we announced the deal, the number of majors, major customers that were actually coming and asking to participate in that, I mean it was very evident right off the bat, I mean to the point where we actually had to rein things in until we really legally could function at that. We had to function really as continuing 2 separate companies. So okay, that's speaks to integration. I think there was a third element of that question, wasn't there, Sterling?","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I think that -- no, no, actually that basically covers it. And then, my follow-up question in a different topic is, as you look at the guidance for the full year, what needs to happen in terms of organic growth for you to deliver on the guidance here in the back half? Does organic have to further accelerate, stay the same or, what's embedded in that part of the guidance?","James E. Cashman","It's roughly the same and as you can tell, I mean, we've been plunking along at that -- around -- continuing to push up, even over the last few quarters, pushing up toward that mid-teens kind of thing. And you know what, again, there's an awful lot of uncertainty. I mean it gets down to everything of how European governments are going to react, how elections are going to go, how all sorts of things like that. But you're probably looking at that kind of 13%, 14% constant currency kind of standpoint. And of course, our guidance, of course, assumes certain currency situations. So all of those things will factor in. And the only thing that makes us a little bit trickier and the reason why I talked about you just don't put a bell curve over the guidance range, is the fact that orders slip and slide. One order that slips out of Q1 into Q2 still count in the annual guidance. An order that might slip extend out to Q4, it's still there, or if it turns to a lease, all the goodness is still there, it's just that the snapshot of how it's recognized is different. And we just want to be cognizant of that and basically, upfront. So those are really kind of the basic overall assumptions. And of course, if there's a complete meltdown or if it goes supernova, of course, those things will change. But nobody can really predict those because we can -- so we can really only go off the forecast, the upside and other factors like that, and then try to bounding box it with the -- with all the other exogenous factors.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well we're all hoping that there's no supernova then, in the back half.","James E. Cashman","Well, supernova would be good, meltdown would be bad. Supernova is where we're really eased up, meltdown is we're kind of...","Maria T. Shields","Supernova is people unleash their budgets for year-end sums.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Simple question on Esterel, is it logical to assume -- I mean I know it's a small part of your overall business, but is it logical to assume that it will grow organically on a constant currency basis faster than kind of ANSYS overall, because it's -- you've got a bunch of fresh-faced people to cross-sell it and things like that?","James E. Cashman","No, the first thing is, with a smaller denominator, apparent growth rates can be numerically higher. The -- but I tell you, the overall assumption is that it would grow a little bit ahead of the overall base. And you're absolutely correct, one of which is that the increased reach of our channel basically provides opportunities that a smaller company that's operating financially soundly just can't plug the market with that. Now on the other hand, it's a combined technology that fits in with the engineering buying centers. However, it tends to happen sometimes with a higher group and in the system side of things. And as a result, there'll be some latency in terms of the sales force getting adopted or getting up to speed on it, being able to communicate with customers. So it's not like it's going be throwing on a light switch and a step function. But like I said, there was immediate interest that we've actually had to hold the reins in on. So I think over the next year or 2, you'll see a combination of things. First of all, you'll see the margin depression that we always see with any acquisition we do start to get built into the ANSYS model, and within a couple of years, we've got things operating pretty well. And that kind of defines the wait-and-see in there. So, yes, they're definitely -- on its own basis, I think it would grow above the base rate. But with the expansion of the channel and being able to link that in, we do see that growing higher.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Got it. All right. Now this is kind of a -- maybe it's a weird question. But a few software companies have priced their software in dollars, so they don't then have the worry about the excitement going on in Europe. And I realize that, that would put pressure on guys in your customer side. Does that -- why would not you do that? I mean why would -- why does that not make sense? Or is it just would that make you less competitive in competitive environments and stuff like that? Or would that ever work or not?","James E. Cashman","Well, actually, at one time, we kind of came from that and it somewhat filtered through our indirect channel that might bear the burden of it. But the bottom line is, we've been saying if you look historically, there are ebbs and flows in currencies in all parts of the world, and we look at this from a long-term perspective. So frankly, with the employees we have over there, we don't confuse them by paying them in dollars because they have to live in local currency. Likewise, when customers overseas are buying in local currency, we don't want to have them sit there and think they have a certain budget amount that's improved and then find out that their budget got blown apart because of the change. If we've got that in there, first of all, it makes it simple for the customer, it all balances out over time and particularly if we can -- we just don't want to create obstacles to people in acquiring the software. And we think that extra kind of turning them all into currency wizards really causes a bunch of unintended consequences into it. Long term, we've got more users that way, and long term, the currencies kind of balance out. And when you figure out how much even a paid-up license contributes long term into our recurring revenue base, it really is a good stable flow for us. So if anything, we kind of come in the other direction and then we just have to manage amongst that.","Operator","Next question is from Ross MacMillan of Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jim, your large deal count over $1 million is a really very, very strong number this quarter. I think relative to normal seasonality, I don't think we've ever seen such a strong Q2, and on absolute numbers, we've never seen such a strong Q2. Can you just talk to the large deal activity in the quarter? Because it didn't look like March was particularly soft on the large deals. So it just -- it strikes me that it's a very strong number after a very strong Q1.","James E. Cashman","No. Well, Q1 was strong from a big deal standpoint comparatively but in a -- or relatively. But from an absolute standpoint, if you look at the trend, actually, Q1, we were -- I tried to make that point earlier. That's why you don't just put a normal to bell distribution over a range. Q1, we're actually in the lower half of the range. And basically, some of that was for orders that were delayed, partially because of some of the issues that we saw on the macro and geopolitical environment. So actually, maybe a little bit of that's spillover. But keep in mind, if you look at what's going on, first of all, there are several other factors. Apache is playing an increasing role in these things and particularly, the cross-termination or the cross-buying of those 2 phenomenon with the rest of our main lines, just speaking to the integration, that's actually going forward. The second part is that you look at -- a number of you've talked, yes, we're growing across all sectors of our business. But since this is relatively new in its adoption, I'm talking about just the overall concept of the proliferation of simulation, we actually are seeing our major customers growing actually in a slightly higher rate than the aggregate of the rest of them. What that means is that in these big deals, you will actually start to see accumulation of that, that comes on. So that number does bump up. But on top of it, Q2 was not a bad quarter. So I mean you put all of those factors together and then our -- finally, our customers are just -- the same thing we've talked about for a decade, but it's really been in earnest the last few years under this stressful environment. It is -- this is viewed as a means to competitive survival and excelling. So I think, though, all of those factors come together. But the one point I'd also say and I've been saying it for 10 or 15 years, we may be hitting some home runs, but we're just trying to get good level contact, continual contact. It's not like we're trying to live and die by big deals. It's just that it's happening as a natural consequence of our business model and the execution that we're doing out in the field.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That make sense. And just on the paid-up, I think your comments, both today and previously, is you may in tougher environments have deals slip from paid-up to lease or maybe even push if they're paid-up, they could move across quarters. The paid-up number this quarter was certainly, I think, better than we saw in Q1. Do you just put that down to timing mostly?","James E. Cashman","Yes, it was timing, like I said, and some of it was -- when we tell you that sometimes the thing can slip across, that's not a euphemism for we lost it. No. You're seeing some of the Q2 effect was a slight amount. I mean, we were still in range in Q1 but a little on the lighter side, and now we are on the stronger side. So again, it's one of these things if you try to just live in quarterly snapshots, you can get some small perturbations. But when you're integrated over the long term, it pretty much stands out.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then, pulling this together, last thing, just -- I heard you say earlier, I just want to go back and make sure I heard that. You talked about your guidance for the year, but then you said, I think, a line probably favor growth below the midpoint of the range. I don't know if that was just -- if you said that meaning you'd be having us think at the midpoint or lower is the most likely outcome or whether I just misinterpreted that comment?","James E. Cashman","Well -- no, essentially, if you look at -- the way we look it, we take all the factors we've got, and of course, there's a certain amount of Sigmas on either side of the range. But the bottom line is, it just -- I was just saying don't slap an even distribution for this is not just an evenly distributed curve there. And if you look at the various factors of where currencies can go, if you look at the, like I said, the one impact is the effects of timing stretching out is  disproportionately higher than the chances of timing compressing and squeezing in. And when you put all those things out, I'm just saying it doesn't look like just a normal curve centered around the middle. I'm just saying -- I was trying to provide a little bit of color. The range is intact because our customer demand functions are basically statistically the same. Same thing, when something changes from -- tweaks from a license to a lease, again, you're going to -- the business is all there but you're going to -- what you recognize and show is going to drift out into outlying quarters or in this case, outlying years. So all I'm saying is that, that you don't just pick -- I was just trying to give you a mental image, don't -- I wouldn't picture that bell curve. And by the way, those are things that we'll look at on an ongoing basis as we continue to look at our investment patterns and things like that. And finally, there's no saying that in terms of what's happening with either the European situation, recent elections there, upcoming elections here, these are cycles that tend to -- will tend to have significant impacts. So I mean, all of those factors together, it was just -- I was just trying to get away. Sometimes, people like to fit a nice even normal curve over the range, and that's really not the way we're looking at it, although, we find that our ongoing range to be a statistically valid construct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Ashley at Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I think I would just like to try to reconcile the change in the full year guidance. You've taken it down by $6 million to $9 million. You said that Esterel will contribute $5 million to $7 million  and you still need to hash through some rev rec there. But your best guess today is $5 million to $7 million, but did FX probably change by an equal-ish amount, $5 million to $7 million, suggesting...","James E. Cashman","Yes.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Suggesting that just organically, you're taking the core business down $6 million to $9 million. Does that all sound right?","Maria T. Shields","No, we haven't changed the outlook on the core business. It's basically Esterel's addition nets out FX headwinds that are greater than what we had guided to back in May. So we're still at $810 million to $830 million, which is where we were back in May.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it, got it. Okay, I guess I was looking at GAAP numbers.","Maria T. Shields","But, Steve, we're not looking at GAAP.","James E. Cashman","That would, of course, make a difference.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, okay. And then, my other question was Esterel, you paid $53 million. Do you think that's the new normal in terms of size of acquisitions we might think about for you guys making in the future?","James E. Cashman","Well, actually, if you look at from last -- I think actually the last 2 years because everybody was after -- it was like every 3 years, we'd do some that might be like a few hundred million purchase price. And first of all, we made the stunning observation that there are a lower number of those available over the last decade. And that's the case. And I think I even made the point starting 2, 3 years ago saying, I would start to look at things in the basically $50 million range, clumps of those things that really have significance. But the other thing is, if you chart everything we've -- the few we've done over the last 10 years, you couldn't find a normal. I mean there isn't, and I don't really think there's a normal per se. The only thing I'd say is the population of these larger ones right in the sweet spot of our technological vision, they're just fewer, because you can just look at all the tombstones that have happened on that and it's a lower number. So I think statistically, it's just safer to say that. But you will see us sometimes, I'm sure, do tuck-ins. You will see us do these midrange kind of things. I mean, so it could be all over the map. And it's -- I just don't know how to clarify it because even when we eye something, it doesn't always happen at the exact time, at the exact price, at the exact anything that would be perfectly ideal for us. But it all turns out to work for the long-term good.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer at Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Jim, I'd like to ask you about the competition. With your results and with those reported last week for the sohs -- Somoa [ph]  brand, you comprise, the 2 of you together, the majority of the market and would appear to be doing well collectively. But they appear to be growing more quickly than you, both in the second quarter and for the half year-to-date versus your core CAE business. And by our calculations, they are now the equivalent of roughly 3\/4 of your core business size. So the question is, given the compatibility between your size and theirs where you compete, where are you seeing them, and could you just overall talk about competition?","James E. Cashman","Well, we -- I mean, we really don't see them any differently than we've seen them over the last few years. So -- and all I can say, I don't know how they -- I have no idea how they internally account and divide up growth inside there. So I mean, I really can't speak to that. In terms of what we can see about ourselves is it's been significant. Simulation basically is our focus. It's critical to our customer base. It's what we live, and the things have been pretty much along the guidance that we said. So it's really not much change. I'd say the only major change on the overall competitive front is if you look 10, 15 years ago, we were $40 million, $50 million, and we were much narrower, and we would kind of get involved in a lot of micro-transaction kind of things, and we'd go head to head more often. I'd say, as of recent, it's not like -- there are probably literally dozens of people that we see midge competition from and really, there's nobody we see across the entire spectrum. And that really hasn't changed. I mean, we still have technology providers. We still have the major CAD\/CAM or PLM companies that are also getting in and trying to create names themselves. And then there are always new startups. And that dynamic, really -- that's really not been the major story for us in anything that we've encountered.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, what's your thinking long term about the correlation of your services capacity and revenue to your Software business? We've talked about this before, but services are a fairly low percentage of your business. But you've also talked about it having to become larger in connection with growing the software business, perhaps update us on that thinking. And just a clarification on Apache. Could you talk about the number of new customers they're gaining. At around the time you bought them, they had 120 customers. And I'm wondering are they adding significant number of logos over the last year or are they largely growing with existing customers like Intel?","James E. Cashman","Well, the thing is, first, let me tackle the service one. Yes, and as I've mentioned, we think that, that now is one of the longer pulls in the pan in terms of helping customers jump the chasm, if you will, in terms of doing that. And right now, it's the lowers. It's been in the lower single-digit range. But we've also mentioned that we were investing along those lines. And the actual service business has been -- the pure service business is overall starting to grow fairly nicely. But we'd like to get it at least in the next 3 to 5 years up into that mid-single-digits kind of range. On off the top of my head, I mean, I can only -- I can't speak holistically with regard to the Apache integration, but I can think of situations where we were both strong, but were in different buying standards and the same customer, and we've actually elevated those customers like in -- I know that there are some that we've introduced Apache into. And I know there are some that even with our broad footprint, Apache was probably relatively more significant in that customer. We've actually been able to use that to leverage in new capabilities. But I think other than that, we'll have to mine the data in kind of a different way to give statistically meaningful information on the raw numbers of new platforms and things like that.","Operator","Next question comes from Blair Abernethy at Stifel.","Blair Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Jim, I wonder if you can give us a little more color on vertical performance this quarter in sort of standout positive quarters versus -- verticals versus maybe some that were lagging a bit?","James E. Cashman","Well, again, it's one of those things where the lag -- the one thing we try to do -- I want to be kind of really clear on this. If you look at it, we've still got a high degree of diversity in the business. And I want to be -- sometimes, just for color, we try to tell you what sectors were doing well in a quarter. But that's not to say, oh, here's a big overwhelming trend that's significant for the next 3 to 12 months and going forward. So first and foremost, so all -- I mean, all sectors are doing okay. But as I mentioned, first of all, I would -- if you haven't had a chance to look, we try to put a lot of commentary and some numbers into the prepared remarks that are posted on our IR website. So I clearly think you'd get a real good picture on that. But the -- I'd say some of the interesting things, I think we mentioned automotive, I think we have mentioned aerospace and defense. A relative newcomer was in terms of material and chemical kind of things, and that's just kind of popped up. It's the first time for that. Again, we're not saying long-term trend, we're just seeing that. But automotive, there seems to be kind of a sea change in there in terms of what people are doing in terms of fuel efficiency and AGB and the likes, as well as the increasing competition from overseas manufacturers, many of which are the relatively newer places in Asia. In aerospace and defense, that -- in some cases, we said, \"Well, maybe that's a little bit counterintuitive,\" but if you think about it, all the advanced research is going into unmanned surveillance and electronic countermeasures and the things like that. Those are all new research as opposed to refining the next-generation of battle tank or something like that or the next strike fighter kind of project. And with those things, whenever they tend to be R&D and highly innovation-driven, wow, that creates at least an uptick for simulation, even if those markets weren't traditionally used to using it in that standpoint. So those are really the main things. And again, I invite you to look at some of the prepared remarks because it will give that. But in terms, we still have -- we're still seeing the balance. We still see growth in sectors. It's just that any one quarter, there's -- if you got an average, there are going to be a few that are above the average and a few that are below the average. I don't know, Maria, do you have anything you...","Maria T. Shields","Yes, the only other thing I'd suggest is our industry guys are constantly posting updates about customer successes and innovation within each of those important verticals, so check out ansys.com.","Blair Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great, and I did get the industry highlights. Can I also, Jim, just ask you to -- how about the electronics vertical in particular, how did that perform in the quarter?","James E. Cashman","Well, it performed -- it actually performed pretty well. Now there's also some regional things where you can see there are -- particularly over in Asia, there are certain countries and companies that are kind of in ascendancy. There are other big names that are going through some more difficult stretches and things like that. But in general, the push toward the denser chips, 3D and basically, just the overall drive for electronic system-on-chips, things like that, it's intended to increase, which by the way, is yet one more reason why we're very excited about the long-term prospects embodied in Esterel in terms of looking at embedded systems. Because now you've got some of these microprocessor system-on-a-chip things and now you've got this drive in our customers across a wide range of industries for Smart Products. Well, this is where an awful lot of the smart comes from is in that embedded software. But for the system to properly function, you've got to have a unity of performance between the traditional, mechanical hardware, electronic hardware and the software that's operating in it. And if they don't all work in concert, you can kind of have a dud of project -- a dud of a product out there.","Blair Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And, Maria, just on the tax rate in the quarter, Q2 was a little bit lower than we're expecting. Anything going on there? And sort of do you have a view yet for what the tax rate might be next year?","Maria T. Shields","Next year? No. Let's see what happens in 95 days and then maybe I can give you a little bit more color on next year's tax rate. But as far as the most recent quarter, we did file some tax returns for Apache in some of the foreign locations and ended up resulting in some slightly greater benefits than we estimated coming into the quarter. So for the second half of this year, we're looking at 31% to 32% based on everything we know right now.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Rogers at Great Lakes Review.","Jason Rogers","Looking at the number of open positions you have, just wanted to get a figure for current open positions and how many were added in the second quarter?","Maria T. Shields","I think probably around 50-ish in the second quarter, and we've got probably over 100 right now.","James E. Cashman","The 100 is all functions -- I mean, that you can check if you go to ansys.com and just find about positions. But that's total positions across the company.","Maria T. Shields","Yes, that's total across the company, across the globe.","James E. Cashman","Disproportionately, the high-end R&D technologist types and the customer-facing types, probably the disproportionate portion of that.","Jason Rogers","Okay. And what was the performance of Japan on a constant currency basis x Apache for the quarter?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, Jason, I think we spelled that out in the prepared remarks.","James E. Cashman","I think we spelled that out in the prepared remarks, too. You want to just clarify that and then we'll...","Maria T. Shields","Yes, Japan, total combined in constant currency was 13.5%.","Jason Rogers","Does that takes out any contribution from Apache? I'm just trying to...","Maria T. Shields","Well, Apache wasn't there last year, so...","Jason Rogers","Right. I'm just trying to look for the core performance if you take out Apache.","Maria T. Shields","Yes, 10% plus a little bump for currency.","Jason Rogers","Okay. And do you anticipate that to improve a little bit for the coming quarters given the sales force changes that you've made as they get up to speed?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, absolutely. We highlighted that we were going through some net sales management issues in Q1. We kind of worked through that. We on-boarded a new team and so we have a lot of confidence that the second half will look better for Japan than the first half did.","James E. Cashman","Don't think -- I mean we're not guaranteeing what the ramp-up rate will be. But the -- again, the direction factor being in the -- going in the right direction is definitely there.","Jason Rogers","Okay. And finally, Jim, I wonder if you could give your best guess on the potential size of Esterel's market?","James E. Cashman","Well, the problem is, again, this is almost kind of like saying you're -- again, this is like trying to predict the size of the PC market. When you're sitting in 1990 and you're trying to predict how it will -- what it will be in 2010. And all I can say is that it's so many orders of magnitude bigger than what Esterel currently is that, that's really not the long haul and the time for us. I mean if you think of the amount of microprocessors going at all Smart Products, if you look at the amount of software that's required for those, if you look at the amount of certification that's required for everything from nuclear plant operation, to aircraft, to maybe running these smart train systems and things like that, cars that drives themselves and the like, I mean it's -- I think there's the really big opportunity for it to go viral over the next 5 to 10 years. So it's so much bigger that trying to pin it down, it's just not where we put the attention. Because right now, the pull demand that we're getting from inquisitive customers is virtually enough to totally swamp us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Dan Cummins at ThinkEquity.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","I apologize if this was asked previously. I wanted to see if, Jim, if you could give us kind of sketch Esterel as compared to Wind River and Green Hills and the embedded OS companies on the one hand, but also, something like Symyx, which a piece of simulation software that Intel acquired I think to pair with Wind River, where is Esterel positioned competitively? And then a question about optimizing your direct, indirect model over the next 2 to 5 years.","James E. Cashman","Yes. On some of the things -- I wouldn't pretend to have the in-depth knowledge of all those different companies. I can only tell you why we were interested in Esterel. And I know when sometimes when people say embedded software, even after we announced Esterel, I started getting a bunch of inquiries from all sorts of \"embedded software companies\". Again, we're focused -- there are many aspects of that. That's not necessarily just the operating system. With us, we're more interested in the functioning code that affects the functioning of an overall smart product. So you'll see a level there. Now there are people that will dice it. There are some people that manage the product life cycle, if you will, of embedded code. And there are other people that will deal with the infrastructural aspects of it. Again, we're staying true to the simulation aspect and as such, treating embedded software as one of many components that comprise a functioning system, all of which have to interact together. I'm sorry, the second part of the question, Maria, did you...","Maria T. Shields","Optimizing the...","James E. Cashman","Optimize a direct, indirect, yes. Well, I mean that's something that we continue to look at on an ongoing basis. The truth of the matter is that having the balance between the 2 is very important as anybody has seen over the last 10, 15, 20 years of our business in terms of providing the resiliency, the recurring revenue, all of those kind of aspects. However, it's not easy to find high-quality new salespeople for the direct side, and it's even more difficult to percolate these indirect channels that you built a 20-year history with and you trust them and you know they'll provide quality software and they can actually perform. That's the thing that takes a long -- that's not just to go out and recruit. That's a long-term building process. So if you look at it, we would still like to increase the rate at which our indirect channel can represent the full portfolio of products. So obviously, there's the luring process of that, but we want both of those to grow. And frankly, over the last few years, you've seen that we've kind of reached a pretty good balance point where in fact both sides are growing somewhat symmetrically. And that's a very positive thing. We'd like to see those kinds of things going. If we can continue to get additional reach to everything from OEM partnerships, which sometimes are problematic to increase indirect channels, in addition to continuing to grow our direct channel, we're interested in all aspects of that. And basically, the whole situation will probably continue to change and evolve because the distribution landscape of today looks very different from the one of 20 years ago. And it's going to look different 10 years from now. And you start throwing things like the evolution of the cloud as it starts to become more significant for this massively parallel world that we operate in. There's going to be a lot of changes going in, but there's also a lot of things that have to happen for that to come into effect.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","So when you say balance, you don't necessarily mean 50-50 but just some equilibrium?","James E. Cashman","Yes, yes. In other words, we don't want to see one where there's a big trend line that shows that one or the other is dropping off a cliff.","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Koenig at Wedbush.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I wanted to -- let's see, my main question here is deferred. It looks like it was up pretty sharply in Q2 more than just seasonally typical. And I'm wondering, is it FMC, what other factors come to play and any color on that you can give?","James E. Cashman","No, the bottom line is, the fact is, both on an organic and on an overall standpoint, the business intake grew at a faster rate than the revenue that we recognized. And when you have those things happen, it has to go somewhere and it goes into deferred balance. But we actually view that as being a very positive thing. And frankly, that's one of the aspects that even though there's a lot of uncertainty towards the end of the year, and I talked about the skewing within the range, it still is one thing that speaks to the -- basically, a statistically stable kind of demand function. So really, there's really kind of no real surprise. I don't know, Maria, sometimes we balance for FX. I don't know if there's any of that kind of thing.","Maria T. Shields","Yes. And the only other thing...","James E. Cashman","And we had strong renewal -- yes, the renewal rates were stronger, actually improving.","Maria T. Shields","Right. Good strong renewal rates. A portion of those 19 deals that we highlighted over $1 million certainly contributed to that deferred revenue.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the flip side, I want to ask on services, you -- they were -- looked a little light. You mentioned the core services was growing. So education and training, sometimes, we see that as -- that tends to drop off when people are worried about the macro. Was that light and is that any sort of alarm or indicator to you?","James E. Cashman","No, actually, training was actually up quite a bit. And again, that's not -- your core assumption is actually valid, but the thing is that when people were starting to continue to invest in the technology, in some cases, what they were doing was they were training existing known resource when you might be a little bit more reserved in hiring of new ones. And a lot of times, when we expand and add new logos, we do that. So actually, the training was relatively strong. It's just that even if it grows in the higher double-digits, it's not going to move the dial a whole lot. But that's been a pretty good portion for us.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Cashman, would you like to make any closing remarks?","James E. Cashman","Oh, certainly, always, but I've got to think of some. Okay. So basically, let's just summarize. So the emphasis for the remainder of 2012, it's obviously going to be in the initial integration of the Esterel business; continued integration of the Apache, basically with a focus on in those with execution growth customer engagement; continue our investment patterns, basically, the customer receptivity, the long-term vision, it just continues to strengthen; we're going to focus of course on the release of ANSYS 14.5, which is expected toward the end of this year. But with the addition of Esterel solutions, the breadth of this portfolio strengthened even further. And bottom line is, again, it's almost becoming like a mantra here, but we're continuing to be propelled. It's a strong combination of the vision. The business model is resilient. But, golly, our customers are great, and they've been with us for a number of years. Same thing for the partners. And not only partially because of the strong technology we have and frankly the, I'll say, the growing base of employees that we think are just really exceptional. Thanks to any of them that might hear -- listen to this playback. But now, it also includes a very, very talented team with new core competencies from Esterel.","So that -- those are the things. Yes, we've got some uncertainties out there in the world, but everybody's got those, we just try to do with customers, technology, employees and a solid business model, those things that allow us to make the best of whatever comes our way.","So with that, I'll just thank everybody for your time, and we'll look forward to seeing you next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] This presentation is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Cashman, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Good morning. And again thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss ANSYS's 2013 first quarter financial results. So again, some housekeeping. Consistent with our standard protocol, all the information of the key topics relative to Q1's business performance and our updated 2013 outlook are included within this morning's earnings release and in the prepared documents that we posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning.","So with that in place, I'm going to ask -- first I'll introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, and ask her to go through our typical Safe Harbor statement. So, Maria?","Maria T. Shields","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind you that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of the GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K.","So Jim, I'll now turn the call back over to you.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Thanks, Maria.","So before we get started with the Q&A, I'd like to briefly underscore a few important highlights regarding our Q1 results and our updated fiscal year 2013 outlook. So let me begin by saying that Q1 was a solid quarter on many fronts, but it also finished a bit softer than it started or than we had planned. From my perspective, the most important aspect of our performance for Q1 is despite a variety of issues, including macroeconomic challenges and currency rates that were towards the lower end, and in the case of the yen, outside the range that we provided, we continued an important multiyear trend for us as a company and as a management team, we delivered on our earnings commitment. We managed the business in a disciplined fashion and finished with earnings above the range that we had guided coming into the quarter. In addition, we achieved revenue growth in all 3 major geographies, as well as double-digit constant currency growth in both Europe and GIA, Asia-Pacific. Our recurring revenue was very strong at 74%. Our operating margins remain slightly above guidance at 48%. Deferred revenue and backlog grew to an all-time high of $399 million. We generated $95 million in operating cash flows, which is a 14% increase over Q1 of 2012. We welcomed EVEN, the company named EVEN, to the ANSYS family on April 2nd. This is a company that actually gives us a very good positioning into the advancing world of composite materials in our simulation space. And on the hiring front, we netted about 50 employees.","So there were many positive aspects in the quarter, including relatively strong constant currency revenue performance in the United Kingdom and in GIA, most notably. But we also acknowledge that there were some pockets of sales ramp up issues. For all those new hires that we talked about in previous quarters that impacted the quarter Q1. And they are top priorities for us in Q2 and the remainder of 2013 to continue to expedite that ramp-up. Our industry composition continued to be diverse while exhibiting strength in automotive, industrial equipment, electronics and the biomed sectors in particular. We added really a host of new logos and continued to see new sales and strong renewals in our existing account base.","Now as we look forward to the remainder of 2013, we are revising our full year outlook based on 2 primary assumptions. Well, first of all, we're expecting a continuation of the business climate similar to that which we experienced in the first quarter. And secondly, we're adjusting our currency rate, most notably for the significant weakening of the Japanese yen.","With this in mind, we've updated our full year outlook for 2013 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $855 million to $875 million and EPS in the $2.96 -- $2.96 and $3.04 range. For Q2, we're targeting non-GAAP revenues of $206 million to $212 million and EPS of $0.69 to $0.72. Now, I'd also like to -- one thing I'd like to note is that our Q2 EPS guidance includes additional costs related to user group meetings that historically occurred in the second half of the year, but due to some product timing things, we've actually moved that forward into a Q2 thing. So it will be non-comparable, but nothing surprising there.","So netting this all out, we continue to focus on driving increased productivity from those recent sales investments that we talked about, while also balancing our investments for future growth against basically the realities of what continues to be a challenging macro environment which, in turn, leads to some fairly cautious customer sentiments. So basically, that's the scoop.","And with all that, I'll now open up the phone lines to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Matt Lemonager [ph] of Robert W. Baird.","[Technical Difficulty]","We'll go on to the next question which will come from Richard Davis of Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Two quick questions. I saw you hired as, I think, Chief Product Officer a fellow named Walid. Is there going to be any change in kind of product direction under his stewardship and thoughts there? And then just a more broad question, on the competitive front, have you seen any changes in dynamics?","James E. Cashman","Well, the first part is, obviously, any time we get new talent, we want to continue to add those new perspectives to that. However, the basic main line product direction and vision of that, that really isn't changing. Now, some of the things -- you have to look at some of the benefits. First of all, we've gotten to the point where, obviously, the strength of the individual products continues to be important. And that's been a major emphasis for us for many years. But also, there's increasing emphasis on that portfolio and having, basically, full-time attention [ph] to drive toward unifying those in a rational manner over a number of years and pick that right aspect is particularly good. But also, bringing in some additional perspectives into the changing world of computing and delivery and interaction when you get from everything from mobile to cloud. We talked about cloud many times over the last few calls. And there are certain short comings to the kind of computing we do with what cloud delivers. But those -- that's not a long-term kind of thing. And so we're making sure that we're fully prepared for that. As well as, over the years, we've grown from, as everybody knows, we've grown from adding a couple of seats for customers and, in some cases, having thousands of seats. And that gets us in a different form of enterprise computing delivery and, obviously, coming -- adding that background of computing delivery is an important aspect. Now you also -- I didn't know if you were pre-signaling your discussion about competition, or if that's -- the competitive environment or if that's your follow-up question, so I'm going to turn it back. And if you want to repose the question, I don't want to let that one lie?","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I just -- have you seen any changes in the competitive environment? Those are 2 questions.","James E. Cashman","No, actually, absolutely not. I mean over the last few years, as we've gained success and helped develop the market, that obviously will always bring in new classes of competitors. And they ebb and flow during various aspects of that. The one thing that probably is the most telling and I mean, I want to really kind of couch this so it doesn't come off as any form of hubris, because it really is anything but that, but obviously, in any quarter, particularly in this environment, you have sales that slip out, sales that slip in and things like that. So we actually did, since we were on the softer side of the range we had provided, we actually wanted to look at all the things that got in there and you can't -- we can't talk about the multitude of all of the major and minor sales. But of the large ones, the interesting thing was the ones that slipped, there were a couple of projects that just got canceled by the customer, but there were none that turned to competitive standpoint. At least when we look at the -- at that top 100 classification. Which is one thing, obviously, we would have been turning an eye toward. I can't tell you below the 100 if there were like some spot tactical ones. But really, the competitive environment really hasn't changed. So the main story here right now is twofold, one of which is the macroeconomics and I'll throw the currency volatility in with that. But the second part is, we talked about the investments that we were going to be making and ramping up the sales team. We actually did that, but as we've also talked about in the first 3, 4 months, we don't get a ton of productivity even out of the quickest learners. And that's something that you tend to cultivate in the 6 to 12 months and then it kind of grows from that standpoint. I don't know if there's anything else. That's kind of like the broad brush look.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Looks like you did -- it looks like you had an increase in deals over $1 million. So it didn't look like big deals were an issue. If I piece things together, it looked like North America paid-up licenses, deals under $1 million. So kind of the meat-and-potatoes business was the issue in the quarter. If that's correct, just kind of curious what we can read into that and read into how that might come back as the year progresses?","James E. Cashman","Well, first of all, we'll give a little bit of qualitative aspects here. But again, the first thing I say is everything I tell you right now do not read a long-term trend, at least not yet. There's not enough to indicate that would happen. But, yes, the fact is that first of all, with regard to the number of large sale aspects. Keep in mind, those are additive with our major accounts but they also reflect the building up, accumulation of continually ramping up business with those. So it's not like a bunch of $1 million instantaneously appeared. Some of that was renewal business, some of that was new business. Now if you look at -- I'd say the one thing about this economy is that, a, nothing happened in monolith. So even though we talked about all the major geographies grew and we had the double-digit currents -- constant currency grow in Europe and in Asia-Pacific. But in each of those regions, it wasn't like they monolithically moved in one direction. There were segments in each one of those that specifically performed very well and others that performed fairly softly. So Southern Europe, not a major part of the business but it was -- that was soft. But other parts were particularly strong. We could go through each of the geographies. Same thing, from a, you segment business as we also look at it, in major accounts and maybe the small, medium enterprise. But neither of those moved monolithically. We had certain customers that -- major customers that actually held back and are very judicious on their spending, and others that went ahead. And likewise, at the small or medium end. So again, but I wouldn't look at that as being trend. I view that as being more of a speaking to the individual excellence or foresight or whatever's going on individually in each company. Now, there was also a slight -- this is one I don't want people to react to -- but there was a slight tweaking up toward lease versus paid-up. But again, I'm not -- these are not these wholesale repeat of 2009 type of things. But as you mentioned paid-up versus -- yes, that was an element. We did see those particular things. But we also see a growth -- why do we look -- what do we look for in the second part of the business? First of all is the basically, the maturation of the recently hired salespeople. Second of all, we've got our baseline recurring business to build off. Third of all, we've got our major known customer engagements. And then finally, if you look at some other statistics that we've looked at, we've been -- we looked at the things like what's happening and, just as a specific statistic, over the last 6 weeks, the gross pipeline in North America for instance has actually grown 10%. So it is starting to accumulate a little bit. These are -- these aren't major -- and we're not expecting that -- we're certainly not expecting a major turnaround in the economy or major bumps there. We're assuming a little bit more of that going in. But you put those factors, combined with the fact that the overall velocity through the pipeline, people are continuing their judicious spending pattern, they are continuing to be very guarded on that. As I mentioned, there are a couple of projects that were just actually put on the table in -- till 2014. Now those are -- with the size of our customer base, we looked to other places to remove -- to actually overcome those things. And they're relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. But those are the changes that we see moving forward. And really, the motivating force behind the guidance, after we sift through quite a bit of volatility in the currency and some things like that.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then my one quick follow-up for Maria. Can you give us a sense the change in yen FX assumption? How much did that contribute to the full year revenue cut?","Maria T. Shields","About $10 million.","Operator","The next question will come from Perry Huang of Goldman Sachs.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a question about deferred revenue. I guess compared to last year, it looks like there may have been a mix shift between deferred revenue and backlog for both current and long-term. Could you put out any more color here, especially for the current backlog piece? Perhaps whether the increase here may have been back to license revenue for the quarter?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, Perry, essentially what we did is we commented on this last quarter but we continue to work with our independent advisors relative to wanting to be in the mainstream from a GAAP perspective. So what they suggested we do to kind of get in line with other of our software peers is to leave on the balance sheet basically the current billing cycle. And everything else has moved off and is now reflected as backlog. So if you take a look in the prepared remarks, you can see that the total of deferred revenue plus the backlog for the year -- for the -- at the end of the quarter is $399 million. And that compares with a year ago, the same comparable number would be about $333.5 million.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Yes, that makes sense. So there weren't any sort of any changes to contract terms?","Maria T. Shields","No. The contract terms haven't changed. It's just the application of GAAP and wanting to be more in line with other peers who have billings of our nature that are a combination of annual, from the legacy business. But a growing amount of these multiyear leases that come as a result of Apache. But also, as we have started to see, as we are cross-selling other products into that Apache base, they tend to like to keep that model of time-based licenses. And we're happy to work with them in any way that makes sense for them. Whether it's having as part of their operating budget or, in other cases, as a CapEx.","James E. Cashman","And likewise, we've been trends -- it's not just the Apache account with historical. Historically, we always provided annual leases, and it wasn't like this was any master plan many, many years ago. But it was just one that we flowed into when we found that there are a class of customers that actually like that longer-term perspective, but on a time-based or a release type of basis. So we've -- that's just one more way we've talked for years and we just want to provide the maximum number of avenues or remove the number of financial hurdles for customers to acquire the technology because it all works for us over the long-term with our recurring base and the growth elements.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And I guess, for the follow-up question. Again, also on large deals. I think, Jim, you just mentioned that some deals were canceled. Is there any more color you can provide here, for example, were these due to budget constraints? Were these new engagements? Or were they relatively well-seasoned before they got canceled?","James E. Cashman","Well, first of all, when we talk about the big deals, none of those got canceled, okay, I mean, just to be really clear. And like I say off that bump up there, I mean, we have a number where continue with the high renewal rates, and then with additional businesses, companies tend to graduate up into that level. I meant when I talked about the engagements, none of these were really major ones. Some of them are actually related to service engagements. And in fact, it was the service revenue, a little bit down but particularly in Europe, where the stronger part of our service business is, the economic realities of what were going on there tended to affect that disproportion. Now, I know we're talking about a small portion of a small number, but it all speaks to the macroeconomic hypothesis under which we're using partially to rig the sales on this business.","Operator","The next question will come from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I'd like to take a look at your guidance reduction of about $25 million to $30 million or so. And so we know how much is from currency, kind of how much is organic, you've talked to that. If we take the non-currency part of it, so call it $20 million or whatever, I'd like to correlate that with kind of 2 things. First of all, how much of that would you attribute to the macro environment versus the challenges with North American execution ramping that staff?","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, first of all, I'd say that roughly, if you want to look at the Q1 shortfall, if you want to finger in the wind, it was probably mid-single digits. It might have been around that $5 million, $6 million, $7 million, and that's the ramp-up thing related to the new wing [ph]. We talked about $10 million from -- $10 million, a little bit north of that maybe, from the Japanese yen currency. We also talked about some of the other ones might soften a little bit. And then from that, you probably have another close to $10-ish kind of million that we think that, particularly in the 4 signs that we see in the environment, that we're gaining the business toward, if you look at the remainder of the year. I mean, that's just -- that's kind of the way it breaks down. Of course one of those things I'd say is that there is like we've always said, we run the business based around those things. But in the short-term, if the economy would pick up and demand picks up, we have no problem e-mailing new keys to customers with existing software. There's about 50,000-plus of them out there. And so we can definitely harvest that one, but we want to make sure we don't lean too far out over the edge if in fact there is something over the horizon on that. That's kind of the reasons why when we were a little bit soft on the Q1. We still had the decent earnings performance, actually above, and the like. So that's really the way that we kind of dissected the issue. Long-term, no real concerns apart from you don't want to see this kind of macro environment continue, it's been several years and to have it continue on for several more wouldn't be to our liking, but we'll adjust accordingly.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, it makes sense. It's -- I don't think anyone would ever describe your planning as not being prudent. I do want to ask though then, of that, of the stuff that's non-currency-related that you broke down for us, when you correlate that with your quantitative analysis, how does that fit with your quantitative analysis about assumptions concerning closed rates or pipeline? What are the quantitative factors that link to that reduction in guidance?","James E. Cashman","It will -- keep in mind, as I mentioned before, the pipelines are actually growing. Now part of that is because they're actually growing and part of it is because if it doesn't come out the spigot in the current quarter, it accumulates. So there is an accumulation but there is an actual growth involved in that also. But the overriding factor is the overall velocity of that pipe. If you look at closed rates, the closed rates over a longer period of time are about as good as they've been. However, they are slower. So if you take rate as the proportion that closes, no problem. If you look at the rate at which they close, that's the part that slows down. That's the part that's totally related to customer sentiment. Does that cover you?","Operator","The next question will come from Ross MacMillan of Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just want to go back to something you said earlier and it's in relation to hiring the Chief Product Officer. You said certain shortcomings to applied delivery model exists, but that's not a long-term thing. And maybe I'm reading too much into it, but this year was a dot release on the ANSYS product, 14.5 rather than a 15.0 release. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but I'm just curious as you think forward, do you think that there's a chance that we could start to see ANSYS introduce products that are delivered in a different way? Perhaps more cloud-centric offerings? And if that's possible, what would you have us think about in terms of time frame?","James E. Cashman","Well, keep -- first of all, I want to clarify one thing. On the cloud thing, it's really the concept between the typical cloud applications are scatter-gather. And with ours, you have tightly-linked co-processing with thousands of processes. You've got issues of bandwidth, you've got issues of latency and things like that. That's why the model works perfectly well in an internal cloud environment, behind a firewall, and our customers -- many are using that model right now. For us to take it out to the broader range, which would make it much more accessible to a broader range of users, those are ones where there's going to be some technological advances in the general industry that's going to facilitate it. What we want to do is we want to take basically about a 12-year -- a 12-year running software-as-a-service offering that we still have right now. But now bring that up to the new realities of modern computing. And we want to be prepared for that. Now what that all translates into is, I think, is more of an overall growth model where it won't signal a fundamental shift in the way we deliver software, but it will signal a significant augmentation or flexibility to the way we do it. And that flexibility may be, as an entry-level point for people who might just have never entered, it's a relatively low-cost way to try or buy, which they can use our software, the service offering for right now. It also can be a way for companies to build up a certain level. But also very easily, switch to, if I can call it this, surge capacity for either unforeseen or temporary major increases in the usage pattern. So it's really one more kind of aspect of you buy it, sometimes you buy it, sometimes you short-term rent it, sometimes you long-term lease it. It provides a broader span of being able to buy that. The other thing that we've also seen that I think is going to be interesting adjunct is, obviously, while we have a good leadership position in each of our individual product lines, one thing that's very appealing long-term is the long -- is the basically, the co-utilization of that by customers. And we talked about that being a longer-term trend, but it's one that takes a long time for companies to absorb, reorganize, adjust processes to. And this is 1 model that makes it very easily for companies that may have centered on a subset of our technology to either experiment, expand or slowly wade into some of those other forms of simulation that they've had an interest in, but they just haven't gotten over that threshold point of using it.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Maybe 1 follow-up. Maria, can you just remind me Esterel, roughly speaking the mix of revenue between Europe and other regions? And then, just on the EVEN acquisition, anything to think about there in terms of revenue contribution?","Maria T. Shields","So on Esterel, they're still largely -- the majority of theirs is European in nature.","James E. Cashman","Well, keep in mind, it was also a very small number, which is like -- kind of like pretty inconsequential. Small companies start near where they can build so being a European-based company that was their major outreach. I'm sorry, go ahead, Maria.","Maria T. Shields","Yes. And then on the EVEN side, there's not going to be much change. If you read some of the language describing EVEN, they actually were a partner of ours. And we've been basically their channel for revenues. So not -- neither material nor is it going to have a significant change on the reported results. You're basically going to have the same volume of revenue and you'll have, instead of royalties, we'll have an increase in R&D expense.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","A clarification on what's going into your guidance for the quarter and for the rest of the year. When we look at your direct and indirect revenue splits for the first quarter, looks like your indirect revenues were, in absolute terms, were about flat year-over-year. So what's your thinking in terms of the progression of indirect for Q2 and the rest of the year? And as well, last year in the second quarter, you had quite sure on growth in your perpetual revenues, up 16% year-over-year and Q2 of '12. Does your guidance for the current quarter encompass the possibility that perpetual revenues might be flat to down in the second quarter?","James E. Cashman","Well, first of all, I'll back up a little bit first part. First of all, again in this environment, with the turbulence and in particular areas where the currencies was most volatile, yes, the indirect channel did feel it a little bit more in Q1. It was probably not flat, but it was a net lower -- lower mid-single digits kind of -- lower single digits kind of range. So that part is absolutely correct. Now on the issue on the perpetual thing. Perpetual, likewise, it should be -- we're projecting it will be up in Q2, but still probably subdued in -- still in the below-double-digits range. So you're like in the single-digit kind of range also. So that means -- but that's already incorporated in. Some of that's related to macro. Some of it related to the slow, but continual upgrade or up ramp of the maturation of some of the new sales structures that we put in place. And if there was another aspect to that question, I'm sorry, I lost it. So you can repose it, I'll try to cover it.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","No, that was it for the first question. As follow-up, but staying on the subject of license mix, when you look at your business by either vertical market dimension or by your 3 business units, MDU [ph] and so forth, are there any appreciable mix difference in terms of perpetual as a percentage of revenue, either by business unit or by vertical, if you could?","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, by vertical -- by vertical, really no substantial change. And really from product line, no real change, particularly if you segment the electronics business where the contour of the Apache business stayed about where it was, and the contour of the slightly different business model mix of the rest of the electronics simulation product stayed about where they were. And I guess, when I talk about the dimensions of the fact that geographies weren't monolithic, that company size wasn't monolithic, and for the large part, really, industries weren't monolithic. Even the industry variations we had weren't that supreme. Really they were weren't -- there weren't those kind of tie-ins either with our major product lines. So it -- I think there was some confluence of the natural concentration of industries within different regions of the world. And therefore, we'd see different physics lines that might have a greater predominance in different areas. But all of the physics lines were pretty much on par, but there were different levels of strengths across geographies and across industries in that.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I could just cheat a little and ask one more just to clarify your comments on employment. You mentioned you hired about 50 people in the quarter, or added 50 people in the quarter. And you're now focusing on sales productivity. When we look at your website, as of today, you're looking to hire about half as many sales-related positions as you had open 3 months ago in your report of Q4. Is that reduction in the open positions for sales, mostly a function of your having filled many of the prior positions and you are now focusing on productivity? Or you're just taking the gas off -- your foot off the gas anyway?","James E. Cashman","I'm sorry, your original hypothesis is correct. It was through the filling of those. And as we recall -- if you recall, we even signaled that we were going to actually be doing it before the start of the year. And of course, that didn't mean that we filled every one before the start of the year. But in fact the reduction there is largely related to that. And then the other thing is, what I'm saying is, we're not putting on the brakes but we don't have -- we're not pedal to the metal either on the acceleration based on things we're seeing.","Operator","The next question will come from Matt Williams of Evercore Partners.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just real quickly, you touched on it in your remarks but I guess, is there any more commentary around sort of linearity in the quarter? And if there was anything specific to what you're seeing in North America relative to the other geos, just around linearity?","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, around different -- regions had different performances. But linearity, slightly skewed a little bit. Because like we said in the remarks, and I'm just trying to be totally open on this, that it wasn't as high -- like I said, it wasn't as high as in our initial range or what we saw. So it did tend to soft -- the softening manifested itself more in the latter half, even the latter 1\/3 of the quarter, okay. So that -- those are things that continued. So we definitely did see that and it was really just a stretching out of the cycles that happened there.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just quickly, we've touched on it a little bit, maybe more so on the Esterel side, but just talk a little bit about the Apache performance and Esterel in the quarter, and any change to your outlook relative to those 2 acquisitions over the rest of the year?","James E. Cashman","Okay. The first thing I'd say is that -- and if I may just put a binary statement out there. The performance of those 2 were kind of right on target, as to what we said. Now the one that I always talk about for over a decade on this is the manner in which we go about the integration tends to now blur the lines of what was specifically one and what was specifically the other. So some of the things we did in terms of -- you've heard us talk maybe about combining our other offerings with Apache to do a comprehensive chip package system kind of simulation. So there are some blurs as to how things get -- how they get scored vis-\u00e0-vis the old methodology. But in aggregate, they were pretty much on target, pretty much on expectations.","Operator","The next question will come from Jason Rogers of Great Lakes Review.","Jason Rogers","Looking at your guidance through the quarter or the year, does that include any future share repurchases and what are your thoughts on the share repurchase, given your large cash balance and the current level of the stock?","Maria T. Shields","Jason, we've always said and we'll continue to say that to the extent there is a pullback in the stock price and it's attractive, we are absolutely going to use the cash to return shareholder value via share buybacks so...","James E. Cashman","It's not assumed.","Maria T. Shields","Yes. I don't think we've assumed it but I think if you look at our behavior historically that we'll see how things shake out today and to the extent that there is a pullback, we're definitely going to go in and use some of that cash.","James E. Cashman","Yes. But it wasn't built into -- it's not predicated on doing x million shares.","Jason Rogers","All right. And as a follow-up, the 50 new sales people that you added...","James E. Cashman","50 total people, not just new sales people, some were added in Q4, I mean, just to clarify, but go ahead.","Jason Rogers","Well, are they mostly towards the quarter end or spread out throughout the quarter?.","Maria T. Shields","Spread.","James E. Cashman","They were spread. They were spread.","Operator","The next question will come from Matt Lemonager [ph] of Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Well, it's Steve Ashley. So I was just going to ask, in terms of -- you mentioned the linearity that towards the last half or 1\/3 of the period, things started to slow. In what geos did you see that slowing as the period came to an end?","James E. Cashman","All of them, most notably, Asia Pacific. But and then Europe, North America, little bit. It was everywhere. So and I'm talking about really shades of distinction here. So it was pretty much across-the-board. But if you had to kind of put a photo finish on it, I'd probably say the overseas locations were just -- were slightly more tilted.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Perfect. And then you talked about the new sales recruits and maybe some disruption around that. Is that due to accounts being reassigned and the people getting new account coverages? I'm just trying to get a little color around that.","James E. Cashman","Well, I mean, first of all, whenever you add new salespeople, you have to put them in certain areas. And yes, there were -- those accounts were covered before. So obviously anything they get addressed to there will be some new sharing on there. But the lion's share of it is just how quickly somebody can build that personal relationship, make the first contact, actually effectively communicate things. And on top of it, the same thing. We had salespeople that had actually proven themselves and they've grown into sales management positions. And so you actually have a little bit of newness there, people who were very good at doing and now they have to help others do. And if those others are a mix of new and veteran people. And again, nothing non-standard here. This is just a normal maturation of a growing standpoint, but it was something that we could measurably and demonstrably see.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Terrific. And then just lastly, can you comment on the renewal rates you saw in your maintenance and license business?","James E. Cashman","Basically no fundamental change.","Operator","The next question comes from Barbara Coffey from Standard & Poor's.","Barbara Coffey - S&P Equity Research","Yes. I have quick questions. I'm trying to get my arms around sort of the slowdown at the end of the quarter. Was it industry-specific, where there's sort of bigger projects just getting pushed off or stalled? You kind of spoke to a little bit of that, but could you give us some more color?","James E. Cashman","No, well, I mean, there wasn't any geographic specificity. I mean you can look at some things. For instance, in India, there's a lot of turmoil around the -- let's say, the government versus legal versus industrial and all will be -- all the things that are going on there. But I mean, those are all spot kind of occurrences. So no there really wasn't anything that tracked along those levels. Like I said, none of these things were monolithic and we saw evidences, different threads, if you will, in each aspect, whether we were looking at industry or geography.","Barbara Coffey - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And were there any sort of hold-out industries that just continued to execute through everything?","Maria T. Shields","Electronics in certain geographies.","James E. Cashman","Well, again, but that wasn't monolithic either. I mean...","Maria T. Shields","No.","James E. Cashman","So yes, in general, the industry that we talked about, it wasn't like they monolithically moved. And in fact, the separation between them and the lesser-performing industries wasn't as great as previous times. But automotive continued to push, electronics continued to push. And we mentioned biomed plus a relatively smaller but growing aspect of what we're moving on. But we also -- we saw, and this might have been counterintuitive, but in the industrial equipment side, we saw a number of decent things. But that was also more tightly tied to, if you will, the Pareto 20% of companies as opposed to everybody in the industry. I don't think we saw any industry where it was kind of like just by virtue of being in that industry, it automatically implies that they were going gangbusters.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jim Cashman for his closing remarks.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Thanks, Denise, and thanks, everybody, for -- I know we went for a long time on the Q&A, but we also want to make that time available to you guys. So basically I'll just say, in closing, I'll say the emphasis for Q2 and the remainder of 2013, like we've said throughout this call, is it's going to be on continued growth, customer development and really improved execution across all aspects of the business, including that ramped up maturation of the sales engine.","So no doubt, there's still a tremendous amount of long-term optimism here. It's driven by continued positive customer receptivity to our vision. But we also -- keep in mind, even with all the stuff we've talked about, I think we've demonstrated yet one more chapter of our resilient business model. And, of course, a major hallmark of that is that we've got great, loyal customers, good partners. Obviously, we've got superior technology and as we've mentioned, a growing base of exceptional employees. So -- however, in the environment, we're balancing this with the short time -- short-term kind of caution that we've talked about.","So thanks to all those people that have participated in getting us to where we are and where we're going. And thanks to you for this call and we'll see you all next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"2195":["ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) Q3 2018 Earnings Call November  8, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Annette N. Arribas - ANSYS, Inc.","Ajei S.

With us today are Ajei Gopal, Chief Executive Officer; Maria Shields, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Annette Arribas, Senior Director, Global Investor Relations. Please note the event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks.","Annette N. Arribas - ANSYS, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks documents have been posted on the homepage of our new and improved Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to our third quarter and year-to-date financial results and business update, as well as our updated Q4 and fiscal year 2018 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum.","During this call, and in the prepared remarks, we'll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. Please take any reference to revenue to mean revenue under ASC 606 unless we explicitly note that we're referring to ASC 605 results. Note that all references to growth will be in terms of ASC 605 results since we have no baseline for last year under ASC 606. A discussion of the various items that are excluded in a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures under both ASC 605 and ASC 606 are included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.","I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal for his opening remarks. Ajei?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was yet another exceptional quarter. We exceeded the high end of our Q3 revenue and our earnings per share guidance by $8 million and $0.24 respectively. Our revenue growth as measured under ASC 605 was 12%, leading to record third quarter ASC 605 revenue and earnings per share. We recorded $762 million of deferred revenue and backlog as measured in the ASC 605, which represents a 14% year-over-year increase. Our ACV growth in constant currency was outstanding at over 13% for the quarter and 11% year-to-date. This reflects strong customer demand for ANSYS solutions and our ongoing success in the market.","Given our robust performance to-date in 2018 and the strength of our pipeline going into the last quarter of the year, we are increasing our revenue, our EPS, and our operating cash flow guidance for the full year. We're also raising ACV guidance at the midpoint. Maria will provide more details in a few minutes.","In Q3, we recorded numerous six figure deals across several major verticals. With the race to 5G in high gear, the high-tech vertical performed well with leading communications companies choosing ANSYS in part because of the multi-physics design capabilities enabled by our Chip-Package-System workflow. Our market-leading capabilities and enabling electrification and autonomy drove customer investments across the automotive sector. The aerospace and defense sector performed well as investment is increasing in the U.S. and Europe. The industrial equipment vertical, particularly the rotating machinery market, is also benefiting from the recovery in oil and gas.","In Q3, we also saw an increase in investment from the healthcare industry. We work with healthcare leaders such as Medtronic for many years on the use of in silico medicine to advance medical device design. At the September meeting of the Avicenna Alliance, a global alliance of healthcare industries and researchers that was set up at the request of the European Commission, Medtronic reported that modeling and simulation helped them release the product to market two years earlier, treating 10,000 patients during this period, and saving an estimated $10 million.","From a geographic perspective, ASC 605 revenues grew double-digits in the Americas and Europe, while Asia Pacific grew 9%, all in constant currency. Our three largest markets, the U.S., Japan and Germany, led our performance in the quarter each with double-digit revenue growth. Our new go-to-market strategy, which we described at Investor Day last year, is seeing success. Our approach enables us to effectively grow and close large enterprise deals, while efficiently addressing the large volume of our transactional business. We're intelligently matching our customer size, location and level of simulation sophistication with our routes to market, which include the use of strategic sales teams, territory sales, indirect channel partners and inside sales reps.","For our largest global customers, we're employing a higher touch direct sales model. In Q3, we had 30 customers with orders of over $1 million, which is a 20% increase compared to last year's Q3. About 80% of these customers licensed solutions from at least three of our product lines. Our top 100 customers year-to-date, represent over 40% of our total sales, illustrating our success and more deeply penetrating our largest accounts. One such account is Airbus Defense & Space, a global leader in its industry who extended their use of ANSYS core solutions to reduce their time to market from 15 years to 7 years, while accelerating their development cycle. Leveraging our solutions for autonomy and digital twins, Airbus Defense & Space is relying on ANSYS solutions to enable the future development of their autonomous innovations.","Our investments in incremental field engineering resources have also been instrumental in helping to expand our relationships at the enterprise and strategic account level. This is reflected not only in the overall growth in our software and maintenance revenue, but also in the over 30% growth of our services revenue for both the quarter and the first nine months of 2018. Services can help with enterprise adoption and more challenging customer solutions, and will be an ongoing area of incremental investment. However, we expect services revenue to remain a relatively small portion of our overall revenue even into the future.","While large deals are important to us, remember that close to 60% of our total sales comes from customers not in the top 100. So, an equally important aspect of our go-to-market is the use of direct territory sales, inside sales and channel partners to efficiently reach a large number of smaller customers. We've seen success in that effort by bringing in numerous new commercial logos in Q3 with particular strength in the electronics, industrial equipment and automotive industries.","In addition, our Startup Program, which provides qualifying businesses with our solutions at a discount, has enrolled over 550 companies. Working with these exciting young companies ensures that ANSYS will play a key role in their product development processes as they grow and require additional simulation solutions. Our indirect channel, which currently represents 24% of our total revenue, continues to perform well and saw an increased volume of smaller deals.","We're continuing to execute on our channel expansion plans, adding eight new channel partners in Q3, including KETIV Technologies and Rand Simulation, two of the largest Autodesk resellers in North America. Globally, we're seeing great collaboration between our inside sales and territory account reps as well as increased investment by our channel partners, which enables us to rapidly expand our reach. One of our longstanding channel partners, ESSS in Brazil recently closed a large deal that strengthens our relationship with global energy leader, Petrobras. The agreement with ANSYS allows Petrobras to leverage the latest enhancements to the ANSYS simulation platform and gives Petrobras access to leading edge products for engineering simulation as well as local support from ESSS. Engineering simulation tools and HPC capabilities are essential to Petrobras' oil and gas exploration and production R&D activities.","Let me now shift to partnerships, which are a key component of our growth strategy. Through deep collaboration with our partners, we're able to provide customers with greater value in solving new classes of problems. Furthermore, we can expand our addressable opportunity by reaching new customers and potentially new markets through our partners' channels. In March this year, Synopsys released their ICC II with integrated ANSYS RedHawk power integrity and reliability signoff technology. This will enable robust design optimization for next generation, high performance computing, mobile and automotive products. While it is still early days, we are pleased by the response from their customers.","Our partnership with SAP is based on a new offering on SAP's Cloud Platform called SAP Predictive Engineering Insights enabled by ANSYS, which incorporates the ANSYS digital twin technology. The long-term opportunity here is very exciting, although we expect customer adoption to be deliberate as they go from an initial pilot to deployment at scale. Our partnership with PTC is based on a new offering from them called Creo Simulation Live that embeds the breakthrough simulation capabilities of ANSYS Discovery Live into PTC's Creo CAD solution. The development is on track and PTC will soon be starting early trials of the new offering. Finally also during Q3, semiconductor giant TSMC honored us with three Partner of the Year awards for our work with them on 3D ICs and 7-nanometer process nodes.","Switching gears, I would now like to talk about how we are continuing to drive innovation across our business. In Q3, we released ANSYS 19.2, which includes numerous advancements across our product portfolio. We improved speed, reliability, and usability, and we introduced our new patent-pending Mosaic meshing capabilities for fluids that delivers high quality results that's faster than before. In one use case, our Mosaic mesh required 34% less memory and delivered a solution 47% faster than previous solutions. In addition, we announced a new fluids task-based workflow, which guides the engineer through the simulation process providing best practices as defaults. The first release allows users to prep and mesh watertight geometries using 70% fewer clicks and 50% less hands on time than before.","In ANSYS 19.2, we added several important capabilities to our electronic solutions. We enhanced our Icepak electronics cooling solution to include faster modeling of IC packages and support for connecting heat sources from multiple analyses. Our HFSS 3D component library was expanded again to help collaboration, save time, and improve accuracy. We added the TDK RF Chip Antenna library and we just signed an agreement with Modelithics, a third-party model vendor to create a library of 3D-encrypted components targeting 5G design.","ANSYS 19.2 furthers our vision of making simulation pervasive across the product lifecycle. As we move from product design to manufacturing, with ANSYS 19.2, we have fully integrated the technology from our 3DSIM acquisition giving ANSYS the only complete design to analysis to print additive manufacturing simulation workflow. Additionally, our additive solutions now include physics-driven lattice optimization. And we're seeing customer success. A leading aerospace contractor invested in ANSYS Additive Print to help optimize their additive manufacturing processes and a major medical device manufacturer shows ANSYS Additive Suite to reduce failed bills.","As we've highlighted since its release in Q1, our Discovery family of products is also helping us make simulation pervasive by extending our reach to the early part of the product design phase. Our newest Discovery release features the first near real-time 3D parameter studies, enabling designers to analyze hundreds of design points in minutes. We're seeing strong interest with the number of initial purchases by major and strategic customers significantly increase in Q3 over Q2. Discovery is being used by customers in ways that we did not expect. A large automotive supplier was struggling to improve its bidding process for customer RFQs. The problem was that bid submission was bottlenecked waiting for skilled analysts to validate the bid through simulation. The company purchased Discovery for the design engineers, so that the required simulation could be performed by the designers without having to wait for an analyst. Based on a pilot with Discovery, the customer estimates that it can reduce RFQ response times by up to 75%, allowing them to bid on more business, leading to increased revenue.","Finally, I would like to introduce the newest member of the ANSYS executive team, Dr. Prith Banerjee, who recently joined us as our Chief Technology Officer. A brilliant technologist, Prith, brings an exceptional blend of experiences to ANSYS. He's had very successful careers both in academia and in industry, and has earned multiple honors. Prith was a chair professor and a dean of engineering. He led one of the most iconic industry research labs and he served as CTO at two of the top global industrial companies. He also founded two startups in the electronics space. This unique mix of experiences makes him the perfect person to help guide our technology innovation and long-term product strategy.","Before I turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financial results, I would like to acknowledge the most recent milestone in her stellar career at ANSYS. This is Maria's 20th year as CFO of ANSYS, and today is her 80th earnings call. Congratulations, Maria and over to you.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you so much, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ajei, we delivered another quarter of outstanding results. This is quite an accomplishment for our team when you consider the comparable of Q3 2017 in which we reported both, double-digit top line and EPS growth. I'll take a few minutes to add some additional commentary around our third quarter financial performance and we'll close with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q4 and 2018.","Just as a reminder, during this first year of adoption of revenue recognition under ASC 606, we have been and will continue to provide financial results and outlook under both ASC 605 and ASC 606 through the end of this year. Beginning in 2019, we will transition to only reporting our financial results under ASC 606. In addition, any comments that I make relative to growth rates, we'll be comparing 2018 to 2017 results under ASC 605 and in constant currency. I'll provide key financial metrics under both ASC 605 and ASC 606, and consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.","Our Q3 results reflect continued strong momentum and execution across the business. We reported total revenue under ASC 605 of $308 million or constant currency revenue growth of 12%. Operating margins and EPS were above the high-end of our guidance under both ASC 605 and ASC 606. Our ongoing record of execution in the quarter and the first nine months gives us confidence that we are on a path to continue to make progress against our strategic priorities and to deliver another record year of financial results in 2018.","Key financial metrics for the quarter begin with constant currency ACV growth of over 13%. Third quarter revenue under ASC 605 and ASC 606, totaled $308 million and $293 million respectively, both results include a negative currency impact of approximately $2 million as compared to the prior-year quarter. The increase in software license sales combined with strong maintenance renewals contributed to our deferred revenue and backlog under ASC 605 of $762 million, representing a record Q3 high and a 14% increase over last year's comparable balance. Deferred revenue and backlog under ASC 606 totaled $545 million.","Total recurring revenue for the quarter under ASC 605, grew 15% in constant currency to a total of $238 million or 77% of total revenue. Lease and maintenance revenue each grew 15%, indicative of strong renewals and expansions within our global customer base, as well as the value that our customers place on the ongoing investments in innovation and the high quality of our support services. This increase in our recurring revenue streams was fairly balanced across each of the three major geographies, each of which delivered double-digit constant currency growth in both lease and maintenance. Under ASC 606, recurring revenue totaled $218 million or 74% of total revenue. Under either accounting methods, our large base of recurring revenue gives us good predictability around our future performance.","The strong top line helped to drive a third quarter gross margin of 90% under both ASC 605 and ASC 606 and an operating margin of 46.7% under ASC 605 and 44% under ASC 606. The Q3 operating margins were above the high-end of the guidance ranges that we previously provided and were positively impacted by a combination of strong revenue results and the slower pace of hiring than we had planned for the quarter. These hiring delays were attributable to the summer season and a relatively more challenging hiring environment for certain positions and geographies. It is our intention to continue to aggressively recruit and hire according to our plans to ensure that we have a solid foundation for continued success as we enter 2019. We reported record third quarter EPS of $1.46 under ASC 605 and a $1.31 under ASC 606.","With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q3 was 14%, which was below the lower end of the range that we had guided coming into the quarter. As we had previously communicated, the Q3 rate was positively impacted by a non-recurring net tax benefit related to certain subsidiary activities including entity structuring that were finalized in the third quarter. The total net benefit recorded in Q3 was $7 million or $0.08. The Q3 tax rate also benefited from an income mix in the quarter, which was much more domestically weighted and additional R&E credits that were above what we had forecasted. Looking ahead, we have updated our estimates and expect our effective tax rate to be in a range of 21.5% to 22.5% for Q4, which would translate to a range of 19% to 20% for the full-year.","Our cash flow from operations totaled $110 million for the third quarter and $354 million for the first nine months. We closed the quarter with a total of $729 million in cash and short-term investments of which 77% is held domestically. In line with our previously communicated capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares during the quarter and 1.2 million during the first nine months at a total cost of $75 million and $193 million respectively. Currently, we have 4.3 million shares available for repurchase.","Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. We are updating guidance for the fourth quarter and expect non-GAAP revenue under ASC 605 in the range of $337 million to $347 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.26 to $1.32. Non-GAAP revenue under ASC 606 is in the range of $352 million to $372 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.55. For the full-year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS outlook for ASC 606. Under ASC 605, we are also increasing our EPS and maintaining our revenue outlook, while absorbing some slight currency headwinds.","These increases in our outlook reflect a strong performance in the third quarter combined with our confidence and continued positive business momentum for the remainder of the year. This translates into our updated guidance for 2018 of non-GAAP revenue under ASC 605 in the range of $1.229 billion to $1.239 billion or constant currency growth of 10% to 11%, and EPS in the range of $5.18 to $5.24. Non-GAAP revenue under ASC 606 is in the range of $1.237 billion to $1.257 billion and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.41.","With respect to the contribution from the OPTIS business, our outlook remains largely in line with what we had communicated since we closed the acquisition in early May, or a range of $25 million to $26 million of revenue for 2018. We are also updating the midpoint of our ACV outlook for 2018 to factor in both, the strong Q3 results as well as our increased confidence since we last provided guidance. Our increased outlook for ACV is a range of $1.262 billion to $1.282 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 11% to 13% over the 2017 baseline. And we're also increasing our outlook for annual operating cash flows to a range of $455 million to $480 million.","For modeling purposes, we are expecting fourth quarter operating margins of 40% to 41% under ASC 605 and 43% to 45% under ASC 606. Fourth quarter operating expenses reflect disproportionately higher sales commissions and increased personnel and department structuring expenses, including an expectation for an accelerated pace of hiring as compared to Q3. For the full year, we expect operating margins of 44% to 45% under ASC 605 and 44.5% to 45.5% under ASC 606. I would like to highlight the fact that on an annual basis, we plan to finish largely in line with or slightly ahead of the operating margin target that we've committed to coming into the year. The importance of annual as opposed to quarterly margins will become a more important consideration as we transition to solely reporting under ASC 606 in 2019.","Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q4 and 2018 are contained in the prepared remarks document. I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be providing our initial outlook for 2019 in February when we announce our final Q4 and 2018 results, and after we had finalized our annual planning process, which is currently underway.","In summary, we're pleased to have delivered another excellent quarter with strength across all of our key financial metrics: ACV, top line growth, operating margins, EPS, operating cash flows, and deferred revenue and backlog. Our strong third quarter performance combined with the business results from the first nine months give us confidence that our continued focus on execution and investing in the business supplemented by the large base of recurring business, strong customer relationships and a healthy sales pipeline provide a solid foundation to deliver on our 2018 goals as well as our longer-term 2020 financial targets.","Operator, we will now open the phone lines to start the Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Hoi Fung Wong - Guggenheim Securities","Hey, Ajei. So, you guys saw a nice uptick in ACV growth. Can you maybe dive in a little deeper on kind of what the key drivers are, was it attach, pricing, better utilization? And then on the flip side, maybe help us reconcile the solid ACV growth with the 13% decline in bookings for the quarter?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, let me address \u2013 let me ask Maria to address the second part of the question first and then I'll come back to the first part.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah, so, Ken, I think if you take a look, we've gotten away from disclosing bookings because of the volatility that ASC 606 introduces. But the short answer is, if you take a look at last year's Q3, when we announced at that time the largest deal in the company's history, that drove bookings to a 38% growth, which it should come as no surprise that because those multiyear deals are going to have a tendency to fall in different quarters, that can drive the volatility in the bookings number. And that's why we've been communicating that we think it's better for people to focus on ACV as a leading indicator of the health of the business and how we're doing against our sales performance.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","And as far as the drivers for the ACV growth are concerned, I think I addressed some of them in my comments in the script. Essentially, we saw strong performance across all of the geographies and we saw really good performance in the verticals, in the industries pretty much across all of them and I called out a few of them. And I think that's reflective of two things. One is there is tremendous market demand for the kinds of solutions and products that we offer our customers and obviously our customers think that we have terrific capabilities to bring to market as well. So, I think you put it all together. Great demand for our offerings, great technology, great capabilities, we were able to execute against that. And then as I finally said in my comments, the go-to-market that we introduced about a year ago is successful, we're seeing results and that's also contributed to our success this quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question, either for Ajei or Maria, a question on the macro. The results in your commentary suggest that the environment out there is pretty stable, so I'll ask the forward-looking question which is, what are some of the leading indicators in your business that may or may not indicate any type of slowing? And how do you think about the sensitivity of the business if some of your customers do come under pressure into next year? Thank you.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, obviously, we can look at the overall pipeline that we have in our business and we have a pretty deep level of conversation with some of our customers. As I explained in the call, we have some amount of our revenue that comes from large customers and we're deeply engaged with them and we have a certain amount of the business which just drives through the more transactional channels that we have in the market.","We are currently seeing a very strong pipeline, as you know, over three quarters of our business, I think 77% of our business comes through recurring revenue, so that is very stable. And we continue to see good demand for what we're doing. So with that high recurring revenue, the strong diversity across the geographies that I mentioned, the diversity across industries, the good technology, the multiple routes to market, we feel very confident in our business. We're not seeing any slowdown in the pace of customer interest, we're not seeing any slowdown in the sense of customer urgency. And in fact it's quite the contrary if you start to look at some of these broader conversations that we're having with customers, it's about how their business is going to get transformed.","We're having conversations with automotive companies about helping them with ADAS and self-driving vehicles. And the market demands for those are so high, customers are investing in those areas. We're having conversations with customers about electrification and we're having success in that space, 5G, all of these are areas where customers continue to make investments. And with the breadth and the depth of our technology, we're addressing some of the most pressing problems in product design today. And so, we are very excited about our future.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Matthew Charles Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow-up on the margin commentary, and so you expect operating margins to come at the high end, or perhaps, better than where you originally expected coming into the year. So, just perhaps some commentary on what's driving that? Is it just a factor of delayed hiring or there are other factors involved in margins coming in better than expected? Thanks.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So, I would say for the quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, it was really two things. One, the reality is the summer season and a third of our business comes out of EMEA, which tends to have a \u2013 even extended time off period, which caused delays in primarily hiring, which is about 70% of our spend today. So, the combination of the summer season as well as the unique talent that we're looking for, whether it's in R&D or field engineering in particular, which are two areas that we are disproportionately targeting to hire into, it is a bit more challenging than say three or four years ago. So, we will continue to aggressively hire so that we can position ourselves well as we head into 2019 given all the opportunities that we see ahead of us.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, when you look into Q4 and perhaps into 2019, could you comment on how you're thinking about growth by end markets in the \u2013 most recent trailing 12-month period, you certainly had quite good bookings growth for Aero and A&D. But the comps for auto are going to get increasingly difficult for the next few quarters anyway. So when you look at your other verticals, could you comment perhaps on how you think industrial materials, that's electronics and so forth, might perform, in terms of your assumptions for the next period.","Also on the hiring front, you're not alone in looking particularly for AEs. All of your engineering peers Cadence, Synopsys, PTC and others are looking to do the same thing. So there is clearly a race on for that kind of personnel capacity measuring now across the industry at least in the hundreds. So could you comment on the availability and perhaps how you're targeting your AE hiring by BU?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So to the second question about recruiting, obviously, we are looking for highly skilled individuals across a number of physics \u2013 a number of our areas of physics and we are investing across the board. And so, yes, it is competitive and obviously we feel like we have a great value proposition for our employees and it's driven by a number of things. One is we think we have really exciting products and we serve really exciting customers and I think that that's a factor that causes people to want to come here. We've also continued to build out academic relationships from the purposes of recruiting. We're a quality place to work. We're building the right level of relationships that we need. So, while we're continuing to be as Maria said a little bit behind the curve in terms of recruiting, we have been recruiting and we're excited about our opportunities to continue to be able to recruit in the future. And we're cranking up the engine as we go into next year.","So that's the first piece of the question \u2013 the second part of the question. The first part of your question was around the verticals. And I think as I said in the comments, we see activity across all of the different verticals, I mentioned high-tech, you mentioned automotive in your question, we also mentioned \u2013 I mentioned high-tech in the comments. We've also had aerospace and defense, a fair amount of activity this quarter and we see that in our pipeline as well. So, I'm actually seeing a relatively broad industry split. And I don't see any particular area that we would look at and say hey, this is an area of concern.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Talanian - Evercore ISI","Hi, thanks for taking the question. To follow-up on some of the subject matter earlier, I realize it's early but I was wondering if you could rank some of the factors that might positively impact ACV growth in 2019, and then contrast that with some factors that might represent a headwind?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","So, I would say the same factors that are impacting ACV growth this year, we expect to continue into next year. So at the top of the funnel we will continue to see progress relative to our enterprise and strategic accounts as they continue to expand usage, adopt new users, we think Discovery Live as we continue to see broader adoption of that product in our enterprise accounts will drive ACV growth. And in the momentum and territory accounts, we're seeing good progress as well and our channel is very strong and delivering good new business growth. So I would say the same factors that we're seeing driving double digit ACV growth this year. We will expect as we enter into 2019 and we'll talk about more of that in February when we get deeper into our guidance and outlook around 2019.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","And just to amplify the comments that Maria just made and I talked a little bit about this in my comments as well. We're taking a thoughtful approach to go-to-market and for the larger accounts where we see more opportunity, we're investing more with those customers and that includes with certain customers doing a little bit of incremental services. And what that's translating to is, our opportunity to deliver broader-based solutions to these customers, which means larger deals, it means multi-physics deals and it means multi-year or deeper levels of engagements. So all of that drives customer activity, it drives the size of the opportunities and obviously it drives the annualized view of what the numbers look like and that's reflected in the ACV. So that's one piece of it.","We've also made investments in our ACE organization this year and we continue to make investments in the ACE organization. And even though it is \u2013 there is a war for talent we've been successful in recruiting people. I think in the last quarter we grew our business by a net of 100 people, which is quite considerable given that we are relatively small company in terms of head count. So the engine is moving, we're able to bring people onboard and our field engineering organization is able to engage \u2013 our ACE organization is able to engage with customers at the right level and of course that helps our customers be successful but it also drives more business for us.","And so there's a number of different dimensions that we've been driving and setting ourselves up for in the last year, essentially along the lines that we talked about in the go-to-market transformation messaging that we gave you guys a year ago at Investor Day. And what you're seeing right now in the results is the success of what we said we would do and obviously we see the momentum of this continuing as we move forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. Wanted to follow-up on in terms of the hiring piece, but I wanted to ask from this standpoint. As you embarked on the effort to improve the overall growth of the company, you mentioned the need for the incremental hires AEs as Jay was mentioning et cetera. I just wondered where you feel we are in the progress of where you think you need to get to in terms of head count staffing to be able to drive the kind of growth that you want?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","I think, we will talk about our plans for next year and go through our head count plans for next year when we talk about next year's guidance in our \u2013 when we announce Q4, and so that will be in February I believe. So I think we'll go through more details on that. What I can say is that we made a conscious decision this year to bring on board incremental ACE resources significantly more than we had in previous years and we've made good progress towards doing that.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple of regional questions, understanding you guys just put up a strong quarter in Germany. There's been some fairly cautionary comments coming out of the German auto OEMs and likewise, the Chinese auto OEMs. Just wondering if you are seeing any hesitation from that kind of perhaps end-market weakness they are seeing. And then on South Korea last quarter, you had mentioned you thought that would pick up in the second half and wanted to know if you thought that would pick up in 4Q since it looks like it didn't pick up in 3Q? Thank you.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, let me address the question about automotive. As we've said I think pretty consistently over the last few quarters, maybe a year, some of the areas of investment in automotive have to do with ADAS, autonomous vehicles, electrification. Those are all the big areas where the OEMs are making, I would say significant levels of investments and it's not just the OEMs, it's the entire supply chain.","If you think about the transformation this represents, it's people retooling to take advantage of different technologies, moving from an internal combustion engine to electric solution requires a significant change, starting to think about automotive, the testing that's involved, how you validate autonomous vehicles. All of those are significant changes from business as usual. And that's where the investment is taking place in the automotive industry. And frankly, all of that plays directly to our capabilities in our sweet spot. So, we feel very confident that the technologies and the solutions that we provide are in demand not only by the OEMs, but the entire automotive supply chain.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. And on the South Korea question, as we mentioned on the last call, we've been working relative to changes in the go-to-market and working through account assignments because we do have a hybrid model in South Korea. And so as you can imagine working through go-to-market changes don't happen in one quarter, but we are confident based on what we're seeing relative to the pipeline and the progress around those that transformation that we will continue to see positive results in Q4, and as we enter 2019 as those go-to-market and account assignments are completed.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Oliver of Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. It's Matt Lemenager on behalf of Rob this morning. I had a question on the partnerships. So there's a slew of them now and the number of them has kind of ramped over the past 12, 24 months. Which of the partnerships, whether it's PTC, SAP, maybe Synopsys are expected to have the earliest impact on the P&L? And does late 2019 feel like the right timeframe to think about that for that kicking in and having an impact? Thank you.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, I think the way you should think about these partnerships is that in each one of these \u2013 each one of them is different. And in the first year of the partnerships, we're really building out the product. So you should really expect relatively modest contribution as the partnership starts to get into high gear.","As you well know, these kinds of relationships are multi-year relationships, and these are not quick wins that result in incremental revenue overnight, because you're talking about new products being brought to market, you're talking about training additional sales forces and so on and so forth.","So I would just urge you to be \u2013 well, the way we think about these partnerships is that these are strategically important, but these are long-term activities. And as we think about our business, they represent an adjacent avenue for growth for us in the long term.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi ANSYS, thanks for taking my question. Congrats to Maria here on your 80th earnings anniversary. I got a ways to catch up with you, Maria.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","I'm \u2013 oh, yes. So, Rob, kind of got at some of \u2013 I was going to ask about kind of the sequencing of the adjacencies in terms of what's most significant. Currently I imagine OPTIS is fairly significant, the autonomous is contributing somewhat. And then what's the longer \u2013 how do they sequence longer term in terms of what looks potentially the largest down the road. But if I could just maybe add to that as well, I'm wondering what, if anything, is the opportunity to apply more IP in the area of machine learning and AI to any of these adjacencies, and also more broadly in the domain of comp sci type IP. What sorts of things would you like to see to accelerate your roadmap?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, couple of quick questions about \u2013 so the ordering of some of these adjacencies. Obviously, we have products in the market with respect to the Discovery family of products today. Again that's early. But I gave a couple of examples of customers and obviously our relationship with PTC as I described is based upon them bringing a product to market actually relatively soon. Jim Heppelmann, who is the CEO of PTC, has described the Discovery Live technology as being jaw-dropping. And I think that they're very excited about that as they bring the technology to market.","So, I think that that's obviously something that we see happening in the shorter term. We did an acquisition of OPTIS earlier this year, and OPTIS gave us some really important technology with respect to optics, lidar, radar. And we also have now as a result of the OPTIS solution, we have a closed loop simulation environment that allows us to be successful we believe in the ADAS testing space to allow our customers to validate miles without having to physically drive miles but use testing \u2013 and use simulation as a way of being able to validate the functions of an autonomous vehicle. So that's another area where we've made investments. We talked about it last year. We've made investments and we're delivering product in the marketplace today.","So I think those are some areas in the \u2013 as you think about digital twin, those represent a little bit further out, I would say than some of these other areas because digital twin is still, I would say, a number of customers are very excited about the technology, but it represents a longer term rollout because it requires a change in the way people think about how they're maintaining their equipment, the way they're managing their businesses, and so there's a \u2013 I would say, that that's a little bit longer term as we think about some of these adjacencies. And so, that perhaps gives you some context.","To your second point about machine learning. Look, we believe that physics-based simulation and machine learning AI are very complementary. And we believe that our hybrid approach is quite viable and could be very valuable. And we've embraced and we've used machine learning methods and tools for quite some time, actually well before the current buzz around this area. And as with everything that we do, our objective is to make sure that we can advance the capabilities of the physics-based simulations that we bring to market. And so to give you a couple of examples, so our RedHawk-SC product, it's based on big data and machine learning techniques to enable rapid design iterations. And the whole idea is that using this technology, which combines machine learning and physics-based simulation, engineers can now make better design decisions than they could before.","We're also making use of machine learning techniques, for example, in specific use cases \u2013 for example, we're looking \u2013 we're figuring out and inferring the optical properties of materials, where we're using machine learning in some of the ADAS scenario generation. So to be able to do automated testing for ADAS, you want to automatically generate the road scenarios, we're using machine learning to help do that. We're using machine learning to help design smart assistants to gauge HPC resource usage and so on.","So we're very confident about where we're going. We think that AI machine learning techniques will complement what we're doing, and our traditional simulation technology, physics-based simulation and for our customers we think that means that they can just be more efficient and effective when designing their products.","Operator","The next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Maria, I just wanted to ask, if we look at ASC 606 and ASC 605, obviously ASC 605 revenues are tightened but maintained for the year, ASC 606 are going up. And I think I understand the implications of a shift to lease versus perpetual and how that impacts ASC 606. But is there anything else happening on lease that is having an influence rather than just that mix shift? And I guess specifically, anything happening on average duration of these deals that would also be impacting the amount of revenue that gets booked to perpetual with that shift?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Relative to duration, Ross, no, there's been no change in duration. What I'd say is on the ASC 606 front, as we've been saying all year that the multi-year lease deals, particularly in the larger accounts, are heavily skewed to Q4, mostly around customers, yearend spending and budgeting and planning activities. So the disparity between ASC 605 and ASC 606 is largely driven by the difference in revenue recognition, as well as the timing of the larger deals that drives some of the volatility depending on the timing of when they close under ASC 606.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Frankiewicz of Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Alexander Frankiewicz - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a question on Discovery Live in terms of general adoption. How is that going versus the plan so far? And do you see any potential competition arising from Altair's recent acquisition of SIMSOLID?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, we're actually very pleased with the adoption of Discovery Live. We continue to see good customer traction. I gave you an example and there are a couple of kinds of customers who are looking at Discovery Live or \u2013 one is of course the larger customers where we've historically had some technology and they are looking at the use of Discovery by their design teams, and that leads to a subsequent purchase and then larger purchases down the road.","And then the second area is we're seeing customers who have previously never used simulation before being able to use Discovery, because it's just so easy for them to use. So, I'm actually \u2013 I think we're pretty much on where we expected to be with respect to our internal milestones, both from a customer adoption perspective as well as from a product release perspective. And since the launch in February we've had two major product releases and we continued to add technology and capabilities to our products. So, I'm very excited about that.","You asked to comment about competition, it's perhaps helpful to sort of just reflect on exactly what Discovery Live is. Discovery Live is fundamentally trailblazing technology and it sets the bar for a transformative user experience for design engineers. Now, we know that others see that \u2013 they recognize the same opportunity that we see. And this is an opportunity where ANSYS can fundamentally change product design by democratizing simulation.","And while we see competitors incrementally improving existing tools and technologies either by organic activities or through acquisitions, we have yet to see frankly anything as transformative as Discovery Live. We believe Discovery Live is in a class of its own. And I referenced some of the comments from PTC for example earlier on this. You've got to realize that Discovery Live builds on a whole new solver architecture that's based on GPUs.","It's essentially orders of magnitude faster than traditional 3D method. And it supports multiple physics and multi-physics simulation, and that gives design engineers the intuitive insight that they're expecting. I mean, it essentially makes simulation as easy as a video game for a designer. So we don't \u2013 we are excited by the technology, we don't see \u2013 we think the bar is very high and we're not seeing anything else in the marketplace that's like it right now.","Now I am really excited about the portfolio that we have. With Discovery Live, we've got speed; we've got interactivity with our flagship solvers. There's an enormous breadth and depth and accuracy. Taken together, our portfolio frankly is simply unrivaled in the industry today.","Operator","The next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe just one because most of my questions have been answered. Ajei, maybe for you, you talked about adding on other resellers, notably a couple that were some large Autodesk resellers. Can you just maybe give us some broad brushes on the strategy there and perhaps how Discovery Live could maybe work with other CAD tools in addition to PTC?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","I think the comment that you made about working with resellers, we have a pretty broad strategy for our reseller community around the world. And we're essentially looking to in key areas \u2013 and for key coverage areas, we're looking to bring resellers on board who are familiar with simulation, who understand what we do and are in a position to broaden our go-to-market. And the two \u2013 and the examples that I gave in my prepared remarks were examples of companies that have been able to satisfy those metrics and are able to help us, and of course we can help them with great product and great capabilities.","As far as Discovery Live is concerned, we believe that it's a simulation, it's a simulation solution. Discovery Live is not a CAD offering. It's CAD agnostic. We're not a CAD offering. The guys that do CAD do a number of things that Discovery Live has no intention whatsoever of doing. Discovery Live is a simulation solution and it works with CAD. It adds to CAD a completely different dimension. And that's why customers are excited about it.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thanks so much, Andrew. So I continue to be extremely pleased with our performance \u2013 our outstanding performance through the year and the progress that we're making towards those strategic initiatives.

Arribas - ANSYS, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks documents have been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to our second quarter and our first half financial results and business update, as well as our initial Q3 and updated fiscal year 2018 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I'd like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures and unless otherwise stated, for purposes of comparability, we'll be presenting results in accordance with ASC 605. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures under both ASC 605 and ASC 606 are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K.","I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you, Annette, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was an excellent quarter across all key metrics, which has led to an outstanding first half of 2018. In Q2, we delivered constant currency revenue growth of 10%, and our operating margins and EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance under both ASC 605 and ASC 606.","Our Q2 ASC 605 revenue and EPS are both second quarter records for ANSYS. Our deferred revenue and backlog increased 24% year-over-year to $816 million. Annualized contract value or ACV grew 10% in constant currency for the first half of the year. Both of these metrics are leading indicators of the robust health of our business.","Given our strong performance to date in 2018 and the strength of our pipeline going into the second half of the year, we are increasing our EPS guidance for the full year. We're also adjusting our revenue guidance to reflect an increase in our constant currency revenue outlook, but in the context of an adverse currency impact of about $15 million since we last provided guidance. Maria will provide more details in a few minutes.","Large deals helped to drive our success in the quarter with 35 customers recording orders of over $1 million, an increase of 25% over the second quarter of 2017. These customers tend to buy multiple products from the ANSYS portfolio and consistent with last quarter, over 75% of these customers purchase products from at least three of our product lines. Our largest customer this quarter had combined orders of over $30 million across four product lines.","Our success in engineering services in the context of our momentum with enterprise and strategic accounts is another highlight of this quarter. We reported Q2 and first half constant currency services revenue growth of 40% and 30%, respectively, albeit up a smaller denominator. This is evidence that we are succeeding in leveraging our world-class engineering services talent to drive customer adoption of our portfolio. This is a direct result of the focused and incremental investments we have made in our field engineering team and in our go-to-market strategy around this important class of customers.","I'm delighted with the performance of our North American business and with the ongoing recovery of our European business. Europe grew 11% and 10% in constant currency in Q2 and in the first half respectively, continuing the significant turnaround for that region. As we had planned, sales in Asia-Pacific are back-end loaded this year and hence APJ had a relatively slower growth for the quarter and the first half.","I'm excited that our key regions of China and Japan delivered solid revenue growth for the quarter. However, the slower pace of implementation of go-to-market changes in South Korea impacted performance in that country and some centralized purchasing of enterprise deals muted results in India. With an expanded pipeline of larger deals, the ongoing addition of incremental enterprise sales resources in the region and the completion of our go-to-market changes, we are optimistic about our Asia-Pacific performance in the second half of the year.","Representing about 24% of total revenue, our indirect channel is a key area of focus. During the first half of 2018, we added 11 new channel partners, including 8 in Europe. We also increased our Elite channel partners to 20 from an initial group of 5. Our channel partners' certification levels across our product portfolio has also increased and they continue to add sales capacity and technical resources and enhance their capabilities. From an industry perspective, automotive and high-tech continue to perform strongly, with notable wins driven by the rise in electronics and the push to autonomy and electrification.","We saw a wonderful example of the power of our electrification solution recently when our partner, Volkswagen Motorsport, shattered the time record at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb by nearly 16 seconds using an all-electric racecar. ANSYS was very proud to be selected as Volkswagen Motorsport's strategic technology partner of choice for simulating the mission-critical aspects of the electric propulsion system and the overall car design.","I'm also excited that we continue to make advances in our Startup Program. Today we have over 500 innovative young companies from around the world using the power of ANSYS solutions to build their next-generation products and services. Now last year we described our vision of Pervasive Simulation where simulation becomes critical across the entire product life cycle.","Our core business relies on driving innovation into our flagship solutions of mechanical, fluids, electromagnetics, semiconductors and systems. ANSYS 19.1 released during Q2 bolters our leadership across all of our key physics. This comprehensive release features advances across our portfolio to improve reliability, performance, speed and overall user experience. These dramatic improvements are driving high-value multiphysics sales across the regions and the industries we serve.","For example, Eldor Corporation, a global manufacturing leader for automotive systems, expanded their adoption of ANSYS electronics and HPC solutions to support next-generation electric powertrain development. Extending their adoption of a multiphysics platform based on ANSYS structural, CFD and electromagnetic products enables Eldor to further ensure the reliability of their designs, while increasing simulation efficiency or critical to responding to this rapidly evolving market.","Multiphysics was a critical topic at June's DAC, the major semiconductor industry conference. We were excited to have dozens of customers share their best practices on how they use ANSYS solutions beyond the traditional signoff area, leveraging the power of multiphysics simulations, big data analytics, and chip package system co-analyses to tackle the challenges of 7 nanometers and 3D IC design, just to name a few. This new functionality will help them to innovate by exceeding their power, performance and area goals.","A great example of our customers' success was outlined in a press release yesterday with HiSilicon Technologies, a subsidiary of Huawei. They are relying on ANSYS' suite of semiconductor and electronics simulation solutions for power integrity and reliability signoff to address complex multiphysics challenges. These include on-chip thermal effects, aging, thermal-aware statistical electromigration budgeting, electrostatic discharge, as well as the creation of chip power models for simulating the entire package and system.","HiSilicon is using ANSYS RedHawk-SC, our next-generation system-on-chip power noise and reliability signoff solution to enable design success for all advanced process nodes, including 7 nanometer and 5 nanometer. Our successes with RedHawk-SC was also showcased at DAC. I'm excited that all of our 7-nanometer RedHawk customers are using or deploying RedHawk-SC for signoff of their most complex products and design. These designs are at the heart of innovations in artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, 5G, mobile devices and so on.","Our successes with RedHawk-SC go beyond the Tier-1 chip makers. We're seeing rapid adoption by a number of hardware startups focused on chip development for artificial intelligence. But to become truly pervasive, simulation must move beyond the product design phase and move upstream into ideation and downstream into operations.","ANSYS Discovery Live, which we introduced in Q1, provides instantaneous 3D simulation and direct geometry modeling to enable interactive design exploration and rapid product innovation. We saw early success with ANSYS Discovery Live with China Southern Power Grid, which provides electricity to over 250 million people. This Fortune Global 100 company is using Discovery Live for digital exploration, resulting in a 3x improvement in tower design times.","The company also signed a contract in Q2 to expand its ANSYS usage across physics, including structures, fluids, electromagnetics, as well as high-performance computing. This expansion also enables their design teams to collaborate across engineering disciplines using an integrated workflow based on the ANSYS Workbench platform.","Also in Q2, we announced an exciting new partnership with PTC. They are developing a differentiated solution for their customers that embed Discovery Live's simulation engine into their Creo 3D CAD offering. With the combined solution which removes the boundaries between CAD and simulation, engineers will be able to see the real-time results of simulation during the modeling process. This will enable them to rapidly make tradeoffs and design changes in their models.","With PTC's significant presence in the designer space, our partnership broadens our reach to design engineers around the world. Although there's no impact on our 2018 revenue while the solution is in development, early customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.","Simulation can also play a critical role demonstrated in product operations through the use of digital twins. While digital twin adoption is still in its early stages, we're seeing significant interest from customers. Many companies have challenges in maintaining assets that are in remote or hostile locations. And so it's no surprise that companies in mining, energy as well as construction sites with heavy machinery are early adopters of the Internet of Things and digital twin technology.","In Q2, we released ANSYS Twin Builder, the only solution that offers a packaged approach for digital twins, enabling engineers to quickly build, validate and deploy these digital representations of physical products. The open solution integrates with any industrial IoT platform and contains run-time deployment capabilities for constant monitoring of every individual asset used during operations. The solution empowers customers to perform diagnostics and troubleshooting, determine the ideal maintenance programs, optimize the performance of each asset, and generate insightful data to improve the next generation of products.","Our longtime customer Regal is a great digital twin success story. Regal is a leading manufacturer of electric motors, power generation and power transmission products serving markets worldwide. Regal leveraged ANSYS simulation to build a digital twin, enabling them to iterate on the design, optimizing both software and hardware. Their digital twin helped them understand the performance impact of design changes within minutes and validate that the new design met market requirements. Likewise, Regal leveraged ANSYS' mechanical, fluids, embedded software and systems tools to reduce the design time from six weeks down to a few days.","I'm also delighted that in Q2, we announced an innovative partnership with software giant SAP. They're embedding ANSYS' technology for digital twins into their extensive digital supply chain, manufacturing and asset management portfolio, introducing a new product called SAP Predictive Engineering Insights enabled by ANSYS. This new solution, which introduces ANSYS simulation to operations and asset managers, ties together engineering models, manufacturing details and operational insights, including financial information.","Connecting these diverse data sets enables businesses to evaluate the real-time working conditions of physical objects and remotely monitor products and assets, empowering them to quickly detect and fix issues if something goes wrong, as well as to make design improvements to future releases. This relationship is particularly exciting for ANSYS because of SAP's enterprise product portfolio and extensive customer reach. Now while we're not expecting any revenue for ANSYS in 2018 while our engineering teams are working on the new product, initial customer feedback from customers has been very positive.","And finally, on the product side, we're seeing strong interest and increased opportunities from our recent acquisition of OPTIS. As you may remember, OPTIS is the leading provider of physics-based simulation software for light, human vision and visualization. This best-in-class technology helps to extend our industry leadership and drive full portfolio sales, particularly in the automotive vertical.","The $30 million Q2 deal I mentioned earlier was with one of the world's leading automotive companies. And like many of our automotive customers, this company is facing mounting pressures to bring new, autonomous and electric vehicle technology to market as quickly as possible. This industry leader who's also a customer of OPTIS realized that further investment in ANSYS' flagship solutions, including electromagnetics and functional safety, will increase their simulation efficiency which is crucial to rapid innovation.","Now before I close, I want to give you an update on our Board of Directors. First, I would like to thank two of our longstanding board members, Brad Morley and Pat Zilvitis who retired earlier this year, for their many years of dedicated service. And I'd like to welcome to our board two accomplished executives with extensive experience at leading technology companies; Nicole Anasenes and Glenda Dorchak. Along with Dr. Alec Gallimore who joined the board in December, they bring a wealth of thought leadership and experience to our outstanding Board of Directors and we are very much looking forward to the value they will bring to our growing enterprise.","I will now turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financial results in more detail. Maria?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Ajei shared a few key highlights from our results. And now let me take a few minutes to add some additional commentary around our second quarter and first half financial performance. I will close my prepared remarks with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q3 and 2018.","Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the first year of adoption of revenue recognition under ASC 606, we have been and will continue to provide financial results and outlook under both ASC 605 and ASC 606. Additionally, any comments that I make relative to growth rates will be comparing Q2 2018 to Q2 2017 results under ASC 605 and in constant currency. I will provide key financial metrics under both ASC 605 and ASC 606 and consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.","Our record Q2 results reflect continued strong momentum and execution across the business. Despite a stronger U.S. dollar that adversely affected our revenue by approximately $2 million as compared to our forecasted exchange rates, we posted revenue growth of 13% or 10% in constant currency. Operating margins and EPS were above the high end of our guidance under both ASC 605 and ASC 606. Our strong second quarter and first half performance give us confidence that we are on a path to continue to make progress against our strategic priorities and to deliver another year of record financial results in 2018.","Our key financial metrics for the quarter begin with Q2 constant currency ACV growth of 8% and 10% growth for the first half of the year. Second quarter revenue under ASC 605 and ASC 606 totaled $299 million and $309 million respectively, and include positive currency impacts of $6.8 million and $6.3 million as compared to last year.","The increase in software license sales combined with strong maintenance renewals contributed to our deferred revenue and backlog under ASC 605 of $816 million, representing a record Q2 high and a 24% increase over last year's comparable balance. Deferred revenue and backlog under ASC 606 totaled $587 million.","Recurring revenue for the quarter under ASC 605 grew 11% in constant currency to a total of $228 million or 76% of total revenue. Under ASC 606, recurring revenue totaled $225 million or 73% of total revenue. Under either method, our growing base of recurring revenue gives us good insight and predictability into our future performance.","The strong top line performance helped to drive a second quarter gross margin of 90% under both accounting methods and an operating margin of 45.5% under ASC 605 and 47.3% under ASC 606. The Q2 operating margin was above the high end of the guidance ranges that we had previously provided. Margins were positively impacted by revenue results finishing at the upper end of our revenue guidance when factoring in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar beyond the currency ranges provided with our previous guidance, particularly against the euro and the British pound.","The ASC 606 revenue and margins were favorably impacted by the timing of deliverables under a single contract that yielded $12.5 million of revenue in the second quarter. This revenue was originally anticipated to be recorded in Q3 of this year. This is a good example of contracts that can cause the increased volatility that we expect in our ASC 606 results. We also experienced a slightly slower pace of hiring than we had planned for the quarter. These delays were partially attributable to OPTIS integration activities that have been taking place across the teams since the closing of the deal in early May.","We reported second quarter EPS of $1.24 under ASC 605 and $1.35 under ASC 606. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q2 was 22%, which was at the lower end of the range that we had guided coming into the quarter. Going forward, we have updated our estimates and expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 21% for Q3 and 21% to 22% for the full year. This includes an anticipated non-recurring net tax benefit of approximately $5 million or $0.06 that we expect to record in Q3. This net benefit relates to certain subsidiary activities, including entity structuring, that are currently underway.","Our cash flow from operations totaled $111 million for the quarter and $244 million for the first half. We closed the quarter with a total of $696 million in cash and short-term investments, of which 76% is held domestically.","Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We are initiating guidance for the third quarter and expect non-GAAP revenue under ASC 605 in the range of $302 million to $312 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.25 to $1.31. Non-GAAP revenue under ASC 606 is in the range of $265 million to $285 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.93 to $1.07.","For the full year, we are increasing our constant currency revenue guidance. But due to the movements in currency rates that I mentioned earlier, we are also revising our outlook to reflect the estimated negative $15 million impact on revenue due to currency in the second half of the year. We are also increasing our EPS outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the strong performance in the second quarter combined with our confidence in continued positive business momentum for the remainder of the year.","This translates into our updated outlook for 2018 of non-GAAP revenue under ASC 605 in a range of $1.223 billion to $1.245 billion or constant currency growth of 10% to 11% at the midpoint, and EPS in the range of $4.97 to $5.09. Non-GAAP revenue under ASC 606 is in the range of $1.210 billion to $1.250 billion, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.87 to $5.14.","With respect to the contribution from the OPTIS business, our outlook remains largely in line with what we had communicated last quarter or a range of $25 million to $26 million of revenue for 2018. We're also updating our ACV outlook for 2018 to factor in the negative impacts from changes in currency rates since we last provided guidance.","Our revised outlook for ACV is a range of $1.252 billion to $1.282 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 9% to 12% over the 2017 baseline or approximately 10% to 11% at the midpoint. We are also maintaining our outlook for operating cash flows other than a slight currency adjustment and narrowing of the range to $435 million to $470 million.","I would like to remind everyone that our outlook for operating cash flow in 2018 includes our current estimated adverse impact of approximately $12 million to $15 million related to the acceleration of income tax payments under ASC 606 that is associated with deferred revenue and backlog credited to retained earnings that will never be recognized as revenue in the company's financial statements.","For modeling purposes, we are expecting third quarter operating margins of 44% to 45% under ASC 605 and 37% to 40% under ASC 606. And for the full year, we expect operating margins of 44% to 45% under ASC 605 and 43% to 45% under ASC 606. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2018 are contained in the prepared remarks document.","In summary, we delivered another solid quarter with strength across our key financial metrics: ACV, top line growth, operating margins, EPS, operating cash flows, and deferred revenue and backlog. The strong second quarter and first half performance give us confidence that our continued focus on execution and investing in the business combined with the ongoing growth in our recurring business, our strong customer relationships and healthy sales pipelines provide a solid foundation to continue to deliver on our 2018 goals, as well as our longer-term 2020 financial targets.","Operator, we can now open the phone lines to take questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Monika Garg of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maria, first question is your total revenue yearly guidance is unchanged in spite of currency impact of $15 million. But then you are reducing ACV guidance by $15 million due to FX, because I'm trying to understand if it's not impacting revenue, why it is impacting ACV.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","So, Monika, relative to the outlook for the full year on revenue guidance, it is slightly modified up after factoring in the currency impact of $15 million. And from an ACV perspective, the same thing, really the only changes to ACV at this point are factoring in the negative impact from currency in the second half of the year because of what's transpired in rate changes since we gave guidance in May. There was no other changes to ACV other than for currency.","Monika Garg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. I mean what I'm trying to understand is the upside you are seeing in the business in the revenue side, won't you also see in the ACV?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. The ACV range, Monika, we've given a wide enough range that we believe that some of the puts and takes that may happen, particularly in Q4 where some of those larger deals are heavily weighted towards. Sometimes, the reality is timing may move those into another quarter. So, we're trying to balance all the variables and factor in timing around large deals and the reality that as you get to the end of the year sometimes with holidays and things, you just run out of runway.","Operator","Thank you very much. The next question is from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to follow up on a few of the go-to-market initiatives mentioned in the prepared remarks, specifically the build-out of the channel partners and the hiring of technical salespeople. Maybe for Ajei, at a higher level, where are you in the cadence of these investments and how long is it typically between when you add a technical salesperson or a new channel partner, and when do you expect to see a contribution to the pipeline and bookings? If I could ask you also to comment on the in-progress changes in APAC that are mentioned in the prepared remarks. Thank you.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Sure. So, when you think about the changes that we're making and what we announced last year, we said we were going to go through a change in our go-to-market strategy and that would include a greater focus on channel partners and would also include a clear understanding and segmentation of the market with an incremental focus on enterprise accounts and then with our direct sales organization also taking strategic accounts and sort of territory accounts and then working with the channel to make sure that we have a clear segmentation.","As part of that process, we clearly recruited a number of new channel partners who've come on-board and that work is ongoing. Obviously, the rate at which channel partners come up to speed depends on their level of background and the amount of work that they've done in our space in the past. We are very diligent in how we choose channel partners and it can take some time to screen them to come on-board. And obviously, they have to come up to speed on our products and so forth. But again, the speed at which they are able to sell depends on their experience in our space.","As far as the technical resources are concerned, we continue to recruit and we have been able to add to our technical salespeople or our ACE organization. The pace is not exactly what we would have wanted because obviously we're looking for very, very high skilled people. And so, we're a little bit behind on that, but we still continue to be able to add to our ranks. I think those were the questions. Was there anything that I missed?","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just on the in-progress changes in APAC and then I have a follow-up on Discovery Live, if I may.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Oh, yes. In APAC, so essentially the point about APAC was, as I mentioned in the script, we have a year that's more \u2013 a little bit back-end loaded. And that obviously, the timing of deals obviously then has an overall impact on quarter performance versus year performance. That's number one. Point number two, I would say we were a little bit slower in implementing some of the go-to-market changes that I just talked about in South Korea and that had an impact, I would say, on our performance in that country.","And then, the other point I mentioned was around the centralization of some large enterprise deals. Essentially what happens is we serve customers obviously who are global in nature, they have workforces around the world. And we had a few deals where even with workforces in India, the customers chose to purchase at a different country and centralize the purchasing. So, that's the situation over there. It's obviously a multiphysics solution that these customers are going after as opposed to a historical kind of single physics deal. So, that's really the changes that are highlighted in the script.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you. A follow-up is on Discovery Live, what can you share at this point about unit economics? I think we've talked about a $2,000, $4,000, $6,000 price point before. With the PTC agreement, any color you can tell us on the gross margin line and the contribution that could have.","And one of the questions that we have is when you look at the price points of CAD solutions, historically they've also been in that same sort of range, the $2,000, $4,000, $5,000 range. When you've gotten customer feedback, has there been any concerns or pushback around while the price of adding on Discovery Live is almost equal or perhaps more than the price of the base CAD solution? And sometimes when you're upselling at that kind of price point, meaning double, that can be a little bit of an uphill battle. So, I would love to hear if any of the feedback from customers has touched on that at all and maybe been positive in spite of that. Thanks.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, firstly, this was our first full quarter of Discovery in the marketplace and we've seen trials increase. We have conducted or we've sold Discovery Live in every single geo, we've sold Discovery through multiple channels and the feedback has been very positive. We're seeing customer traction. I gave you an example in the script of China Southern Power Grid. So, there is clearly market demand for the product. There's validation that the product hits a sweet spot and there's validation that we have it right. So, I'm excited about that.","With respect to PTC, that's a royalty arrangement with PTC. So, to your point about margins, it's a royalty arrangement. As far as the revenue impact from the PTC relationship, at this point of time we don't have product in market and we don't expect to see any impact in 2018. We're expecting this to have an impact on the following year.","As far as customers' interests are concerned, they don't view this as a \u2013 this is not sort of a small add-on to a CAD solution. The Discovery Live, the simulation aspects of Discovery Live are extremely powerful and this is brand-new industry leading capability. So, we're seeing a lot of excitement from customers, especially in the PTC installed base as they think about their Creo users, for them to be able to get CAD we don't see any problem in maintaining the price point at all. So, we don't see that as a problem right now. Obviously, we'll have product in market later on and we'll have hands-on evidence later on, but right now we don't see the price point as a problem at all. And I think I addressed all the questions.","Operator","Thank you very much. Thank you. The next question is from Gal Munda of Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Gal Munda - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to ask one in terms of the large deals. Now you guys have done three large deals over $30 million over the last three quarters or so. Can you just give us a bit of a color about the opportunity, the way you see in terms of your existing installed base, how many of those customers are starting to look at a overall portfolio, maybe consolidate some of the vendors that are using simulation and what that means for the opportunity in the pipeline of your large deals? Just trying to get an idea, is that out of your customers, is that 20, is it 100s, just kind of if you can ballpark it for us. Thank you.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, one of the important metrics to consider as you think about our evolution for large deals is to think about the journey that we've been on. And if you look back at the history of ANSYS, we were historically selling single physics and our sales motions were around being able to sell an incremental solver at a time and we were operating very much at the lower levels of the organization.","We've obviously moved up over the years and certainly with the changes that Rick \u2013 in the go-to-market that I spoke about earlier, the changes that Rick has made, we have a very clear and thoughtful approach to being able to address the needs of our customers. We use channel partners where appropriate, we use inside sales where appropriate, and certainly we have also strategic accounts and enterprise accounts. These are accounts that we believe will be driving significant multi-portfolio sales and as I mentioned in my script, we have \u2013 something like 75% of these large million-dollar deals include three or more physics.","And so, what you're seeing in the evolution is customers who were previously single physics customers are now expanding their footprint and moving to multiphysics customers. No one shows up on day one as a non-customer of ANSYS and then buys multiple millions of dollars of software across multiple physics. Usually what happens is they'll come in and they'll grow. And so, many of our existing customers and many of these large deals come from customers who've had years of success with ANSYS who are now expanding their use of simulation.","The reason they're expanding their use of simulation is not just because we're building, we're reaching them in the best possible way we are. We're trying to meet the customers where they are. We're trying to adjust our go-to-market to address the needs of the customers. So, that's one. But it's also the case that the products that they're dealing with are becoming significantly more complicated.","So, if you take, for example, automotive and I mentioned an automotive sale whereas years ago we may have had a conversation with customers about structures or fluids or air flow. Today, the conversation is about electrification. I mentioned the example of Volkswagen Motorsport, it's about electrification, it's about electric drive trains. The conversation is about autonomous and these are all intrinsically multiphysics solutions that include our electronic solutions, our embedded software, optical solutions, we have OPTIS in the case of autonomous and so forth.","And so, the nature of the customer problems have changed. We're in the right place at the right time of the right portfolio. We have the right go-to-market and we're in a position to get to the customers as they need to, which is essentially driving the growth of our portfolio. The other point I made in the script is we've made investments in our engineering services organization and we're able to monetize that investment and that also drives adoption and it drives customer success. So, we're very excited about this movement towards larger deals, towards satisfying customer needs at a higher level and we're very optimistic.","Gal Munda - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. And just as a follow-up, when I look at your ACV growth around 8% constant currencies, deferred revenue and backlog still even in constant currencies must be growing above 20%. Can you just talk a bit about that mix shift that's going on still between the perpetual licenses and leases? How does that compare kind of year-on-year? Even, Maria, if you can comment on that. And how does that compare with your expectations that you had? Do you still see more and more leases coming in and are those large contracts mostly, likely to be leases in the future as well? Thank you.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So, Gal, what I'd say is, I commented in the script, I called out the fact that the recurring revenue streams are growing double digits in constant currency and, no doubt, perpetual licenses are single-digit growth this year. That being said, certain geographies particularly in Asia, as Ajei had alluded to, that are slated for second half tend to be paid up in nature. But no, Gal, as the enterprise and strategic accounts become a larger part of the quarterly business flow, they are choosing leases as opposed to traditional.","When they were more single physics customers, they tended to be paid up and now they are migrating. We will continue to have a flexible business model that enables customers to choose because that's the most important element, we believe, as customers migrate to truly broadening the use of multiphysics across the enterprise and adding new products to their portfolio of usage. We need to allow them to license the software under whatever model makes sense for them. And currently a number of those are choosing multiyear leases and we're okay with that.","Operator","Thank you very much. The next question is from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Talanian - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, first for a bit of housekeeping, could you tell us the inorganic contribution to ACV in the quarter and a rough estimate of what you now expect for the year?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah, it's about 4% to 5% for the quarter, and 25% to 30% for the year.","Kenneth Talanian - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. And I guess for Ajei, sort of bigger picture question, but given the big deal activity, I was wondering if you could help us understand what level of upsell you're starting to see on some of these deals as you expand the physics.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","What do you mean what level of upsell? Are you talking about expansion across physics or use cases? Could you clarify, please?","Kenneth Talanian - Evercore ISI","Well, simply, if you are revisiting a renewal with a customer and say they are paying $1 million, on average how much upsell are you getting above the prior run rate?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","It's very hard to give you a formulaic response, because the fact remains that each of these deals, it depends on the industry that the customer happens to be in, it depends on the geos and it depends on the specific initiatives that they have underway. And so, there's no standardized answer. The broad trends though that I've mentioned several times, the broad trends that we're seeing of smarter products, that's driving a lot of this conversation. And so, you'd get and I gave you the example of how we are having these broader conversations with a number of customers in the automotive space.","If I think about telecommunications, we're having conversations about 5G and those happen to be strategic initiatives and so on. I can pick the industry and whatever the strategic area is, that's the area that we're focused on to try to help them be successful using our technology. And that's what drives the incremental use of technology. And oftentimes you'll find customers starting to take a step away from some of their core areas of competence as they start to move into some of these new physics.","And in particular, customers have historically not used electronics heavily in the building of their products. When they recognize that you now need to build smarter products, they need more support for electronics. That depends on the level of staffing they can get and that depends a little bit on the broader support they're able to get together for themselves and, of course, we're in a position to help there, too. So, a lot of it really depends on where the customer is, industry, geo and so on.","Operator","Thank you very much. The next question is from Rob Oliver of Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.","Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and apologize for the bad connection here if I have one. Just given the push into indirect channels and partnerships and the success you guys are having there, I mean how should we think about kind of the longer-term mix of direct versus indirect business? I think traditionally it's been about three-quarters direct. And do you guys see that changing at all?","And then, I'll put my follow-up in now in case I get cut off again. This is the second quarter in a row where you guys mentioned it's been challenging to hire and that hiring would be back-end loaded. I was just wondering, is that a field technical sales issue and what gives you guys the confidence that you'll be able to hire in the second half of the year? Thanks a lot.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, in first as far as your question about the volume of business to the channel partners, we are not seeing \u2013 we don't fundamentally expect the numbers to change dramatically in the short term and it's been, as you rightly say, about a quarter \u2013 three-quarters and that's what we certainly see in the short term going forward.","As far your \u2013 about your question about hiring people, this year as you know we increased our hiring aperture and we were looking for significantly more people than historically have been in the position to hire. And it takes a certain amount of time to rev up the recruiting engines and that obviously adds latency to the process. And it's also the case that we're looking for very skilled individuals and some of these individuals are a little bit harder to find. So, we're building our recruiting pipeline which is, of course, both our internal pipeline as well as some recruiting partners and we have a key focus on making sure we can address and bring more people on-board. Maria, anything to add?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. Rob, I just wanted to add one thing. As with any time that we acquire businesses, it just has a natural slowdown, as we think through the integration, as we think through what talent do they bring to the table that may be able to fulfill roles that we had originally thought in the plan that we were going to go to market to fill. So, that combined with, no doubt, a more challenging hiring environment has slowed things down. But that being said, we continue to have an aggressive recruiting engine, in fact, we just recently hired a couple more additional people on that team to help us as we head into the second half, so that we are well prepared as we head into 2019.","Operator","Thank you very much. The next question is from Rich Valera of Needham & Co. Please go ahead.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Ajei, auto featured very prominently in your prepared remarks and I know that's historically been the large customers of your products. And just wondering, is there something going on specifically in the auto industry that's leading to kind of more activity, bigger deals that's somewhat unique to auto? Or is that something you expect to sort of see pervasively amongst your other verticals that you quote (00:48:23)?","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Well, one of the reasons I've mentioned auto is really they epitomize this change that's taking place towards smart connected products. The big trends in automotive which are autonomous vehicles, electrification and sort of connected, if you will, all of those trends, we have great technologies that support our customers through that transition. So, we have, for example, with the OPTIS acquisition that we just recently concluded, we have now an end-to-end simulation that allows our customers to be able to simulate driven miles.","And so, one of the big challenges with autonomous is you can't \u2013 it's very difficult to test autonomous vehicles and we can now with this integration across the OPTIS portfolio and the traditional ANSYS portfolio, we now have an integrated view of virtual miles driven as well as an integrated view of all of the sensors, including camera, lidar and radar as well as, of course, ultrasound for short distance. And we can kind of close the loop on the simulation process. So, that's a very exciting solution. It's completely relevant to what the car companies are dealing with right now and not just on road, but also off road. Similarly for electrification and I gave a couple of examples, and similarly for connected and we're talking about 5G and antenna design and so forth.","So, that's clearly making a difference for the end customer and then, of course, those changes reverberate through the supply chain. And so, we're having conversations and we're working with customers, for example, around the integration of our safety technology into semiconductors. And so, in fact, in Q2 a major automotive chip provider, they expanded their use of simulation \u2013 and who's the chip provider, they expanded the use of simulation to include ANSYS medini, which is our safety solution to get ISO 26262 functional \u2013 for ISO 26262 functional safety analysis, which is appropriate for the auto industry.","So, there's an enormous amount of reverberation through the supply chain from the automotive sector that you're seeing. So, I think that's one area. But these broad trends, I think, are applicable across industries. As I said, industries are at different levels of maturity and we expect to see these trends repeating themselves across other industries as well.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up for Maria. Can you reiterate what you said on taxes for 2018, what it was in the pipeline, too (00:51:13)? Thanks.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah. So, what I said was for Q3, we're looking at a range of 19% to 21% because we will have a non-recurring benefit of about $5 million or $0.06. And then for the full year, we are looking at a rate of 21% to 22%.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. For Ajei, first, with respect to making the simulation more pervasive via partnerships, in particular, if in the case of the PTC relationship you penetrate, let's say, the majority of the active Creo base, that would add about 100,000 licenses to the ANSYS space, perhaps more. When you consider your other partner opportunities, particularly in operations such as with SAP or ARRIS, are you thinking in terms of potentially tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of additional licenses added to your base, albeit at possibly substantially lower than usual ARPUs with the solvers?","And then relatedly, I'll ask you a question I asked PTC which is how are you managing or implementing the partnerships more deeply into the ANSYS organization, not just at the highest levels of the company. And then just for my follow-up in for Maria, your ASC 605 non-GAAP operating margin guidance suggests about a 200 basis point decline at the midpoint from 2017. Is the margin antimatter for the year mostly due to higher R&D, including the OPTIS acquisition? Or is it mostly SG&A as you add sales in AEs plus variable comp on the bookings growth? Thanks.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, Jay, let me try to address that multipart question. I'm not sure I have all of the \u2013 let me look at Maria's notes here. So, the first was around the number of users. So, look, it's much too soon for us to give you a revenue projection of where we'll be with some of those partnerships. It's obviously the case that we will be expanding the number of users to others who have just traditionally not been using ANSYS solutions. That's certainly the case, as you start to think about going downstream into operations and, of course, as you start to think about the designer community. And we believe that there's an opportunity to monetize that relationship going forward. Obviously, it'll depend on the kind of user and the industry they're in.","You're also absolutely right to suggest that the cost that we would charge or pricing for run-time licenses with digital twins will be different from our pricing for our traditional solvers. And that's obviously going to be the case because the use cases are different and the nature of usage across those two cases will drive a different level of complexity and solver need.","As far as investing in the relationship is concerned, I think that the relationship has multiple touch points. We have project management in place. We have multiple touch points up and down both from an R&D perspective as well as from a go-to-market perspective. From an R&D perspective, obviously, the teams are working together to make sure that we can sync up on deliverables and we get everything in place for product release by PTC, but our teams are working closely together.","And from a go-to-market perspective, obviously there's some planning involved to make sure that we understand what we're doing together. So, I think that that's well underway and obviously this is a working partnership with people rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done. So, I'm excited about that relationship and I'm excited about frankly the mobilization on both companies; both PTC and us to move things forward. Maria, there was another question, right?","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","Yeah, around margins, I'll take that one. Jay, if you look at our guidance for full year under ASC 605, we're saying 44% to 45%, which was pretty much in line with what we had communicated as we came into the year relative to our perspective for the full year. We are building in the impact of OPTIS, which is slightly negative as we had communicated last quarter.","And, no doubt, we are continuing to add investments across the business, particularly on the people front, R&D, field engineering, as Ajei mentioned. On the partnerships, we have added incremental people whose full-time job now is to focus on the success of those partnerships. So, we're investing across all the functions of the business to prepare ourselves to be able to continue to take advantage of the tremendous market opportunity that we see ahead","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Chris, do we have another question? Operator?","Operator","My apologies, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question is from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Ajei, I know it's early on Discovery Live, but the example of China Southern Power Grid suggests that it may be a way to engage with customers and then actually drive adoption of the broader portfolio into those accounts. I was just curious, is that a secondary effect, a trend that you think is going to be more pervasive. And then my follow-up for Maria, on the ACV growth that you've given us for both Q2 and first half in constant currency, I wondered if you had the comparable growth rates for ACV in 2Q 2017 and 1H 2017. Thanks.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","So, to answer your question, there are actually, I would say, a couple of important use cases for Discovery Live. And one as we've discussed is, of course, the \u2013 is the use of Discovery Live by individuals who have not necessarily been using simulation and those individuals could be at companies who historically have not bought ANSYS solutions. And so, that's clearly a use case.","But there's a really exciting use case which the Discovery Live, Southern China experience does bring to focus and that is that many of our customers who are historical users of ANSYS recognize the opportunity to be able to broaden the deployment of simulation through their engineering base by making Discovery Live available to their designers. And so, we'll go from the flagship into the designers.","But equally, we can go in from the designers into the flagships, because we have now the ability to provide this end-to-end coverage across the organization for people of different levels of skills and capabilities and understanding of simulation with the ability to be able to move and migrate work across the different product lines. And so, that's a dynamic that we're very excited about.","And we see this pattern continuing with customers and that's something that we're encouraging and, certainly, our enterprise sales force is excited about that because that g them an opportunity to engage with some of these large customers and they're seeing large opportunities for Discovery Live, but then they're seeing that driving further flagship sales. So, that's a symbiotic effect that we're very excited about.","Maria T. Shields - ANSYS, Inc.","And, Ross, to your question on ACV growth, ACV is a new metric that we just started reporting in 2017. So, we have not gone back to recreate ACV under historical data. So, I don't have the comparisons for last year to the same periods.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session. And I would like to turn the conference back to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks.","Ajei S. Gopal - ANSYS, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. I'm delighted by the excellent quarter and the progress that we've made. Our Pervasive Simulation strategy is clearly resonating with customers. And as I think about the rest of the year, our focus remains on execution. We will continue to strengthen our flagship products with ANSYS 19.2 that's coming out soon and we will continue to expand our ecosystem through additional partnerships. And, of course, we will continue to support and grow our customer base.","In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners and a shout out to my ANSYS colleagues, thank you for all your efforts and thank you for another great quarter. Thank you all for joining me on the call today. I look forward to our next discussions. Enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","Thank you very much, sir.

They contain all the key financial information and supporting data relative to our second quarter financial results and business update, as well as our Q2 2019 outlook, and the key underlying assumptions.","I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website.","Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","During this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. Please take any reference to revenue to mean revenue under ASC 606. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures under ASC 606 is included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.","In closing, I would like to remind everyone that our 2019 Investor Day will be held on Thursday, September 12th in Pittsburgh, with a reception and technology showcase event the evening before. Further details around location, logistics, agenda and registration can be found on our IR website.","I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?","Ajei Gopal","Thank you, Annette, and good morning everyone.","Q2 was another record- setting quarter for ANSYS. We surpassed the high end of our guidance in revenue as well as earnings per share, setting new Q2 records in each category. Our ACV growth was excellent coming in at mid-teens for the quarter in constant-currency.","Based on our outstanding financial performance, and the strength of our pipeline, I'm excited to announce that we are raising our 2019 revenue, EPS and ACV guidance for the second time this year. Maria will provide the details shortly.","Our success over the past several quarters is due to a number of factors including our strategy of making simulation pervasive across the product life cycle, that strategy is driving more simulation and therefore larger deals. We are operating across two vectors to increase the size of our deals.","First, by enabling deeper penetration of a single physics through new use cases and users; and second, cross-selling our broad multi physics portfolio to help customers address modern product challenges.","Let me give you an example of the first vector. In Q2, we closed a $49 million deal, the third largest in our history, with a South Korean high-tech leader, this, the largest single physics deal in our history demonstrates that we can significantly increase the size of our transactions with the power of our gold standard solutions.","Moving to the second vector, as products become more complex, companies are increasingly addressing product challenges that involve multiple physics. That creates significant opportunities across our market-leading multi-physics portfolio.","In Q2, we closed a large multi-physics deal with a U.S. Department of Defense prime contractor. In addition to our flagship physics solutions, our materials intelligence solution from this year's Granta Design acquisition coupled with the additive manufacturing applications built on a foundation from the 3DSIM acquisition were key considerations in the deal to help them modernize their workforce and accelerate the development of complex systems.","This is just one of many examples that demonstrates our technology leadership and the broad moat that separates us from our competitors. On the partnership side, I was excited to discuss our alliance with SAP and the value that we are jointly bringing to customers during a presentation at SAP's Sapphire Now Conference.","During the conference, we heard how SAP's Predictive Engineering Insights Enabled by ANSYS has helped the customer to streamline its order timeline from months to days. SAP representatives also joined me during June's Paris Air Show where we showcased the benefits of digital twin technology with leaders from the aerospace and defense industry.","Our partnership with PTC where ANSYS Discovery Live has been embedded into PTC's new Creo Simulation Live is also gaining momentum. During its most recent earnings call, PTC reported that it had closed 76 transactions with an average deal size above the previous quarter's level.","Our two companies collaborated at the defense contractor I mentioned earlier resulting in PTC landing the largest ever Creo Simulation Live deal and the ANSYS team closing a substantial Discovery Live order. ","That contractor is noteworthy because it intends to deploy both Creo Simulation Live and ANSYS Discovery Live to potentially thousands of users across multiple business units. That demonstrates the opportunity for Discovery Live at some of the largest enterprises where it complements traditional simulation and CAD offerings and drives even more value for users.","Staying with Discovery Live for a moment, I'm excited that this new product continues to garner accolades from the market as well as the media. The most recent recognition was from Fast Company, which in its September issue named ANSYS as one of the 50 best workplaces for innovators for our development of this groundbreaking product.","In past earnings calls, I've highlighted specific products or solution areas in the ANSYS portfolio. For example, during our Q1 call, I spoke about how our gold standard solutions like ANSYS HFSS and ANSYS RedHawk are driving success in their respective markets.","In Q2, I'd like to highlight the ANSYS Solutions that are making autonomous vehicles a reality. With an estimated $7 trillion impact on the global economy by 2050, the financial implications of autonomous vehicles are considerable and will dramatically impact OEM's and the entire supply chain.","Given the sophistication, complexity and safety critical nature of these products, it is clear that they cannot be developed without the extensive use of simulation. As a result, we are seeing increased interest from automotive OEMs, A&D companies and their entire supply chains to make these next-generation vehicles a reality.","And while there may be speculation around the timing of when truly autonomous vehicles will take to our roads and airways, the simulation work around autonomy is paying dividends in the form of ongoing improvements in vehicle safety, features and efficiency.","ANSYS' best-in-class multi-physics products coupled with leading technologies that we've obtained through our recent acquisitions including Medini and OPTIS are enabling automakers and aircraft manufacturers to virtually test their products to ensure safety and reliability for these future transportation systems.","In Q2, we announced a landmark deal with automotive leader BMW to create what we believe to be the industry's first holistic simulation tool chain for developing autonomous vehicle technologies.","The tool chain will optimize valuable test data by providing a development framework around rigorous safety planning, efficient test space exploration and data analytics in a virtual driving environment. Using this solution, the Company expects to launch its highly automated BMW iNEXT in 2021.","As part of this agreement, ANSYS will also assume exclusive rights to the BMW developed portion of this tool chain for commercialization to the wider market. Autonomy will affect multiple industries, including automotive and aerospace and defense.","In Q2, we also announced an agreement with Airbus Defence and Space, which will use ANSYS SCADE Solutions to enable safety critical controls with sophisticated artificial intelligence with the goal of fully autonomous flight by 2030.","Airbus plans to use our solutions to link traditional model based software development with new AI based workflows. Their goal is to drive the development and certification of drone flight control software to accelerate time to market and cut associated expenses. We further expanded our product leadership in the simulation of autonomous systems with the Q2 release of ANSYS 2019 R2.","In R2, we've expanded the capabilities of our VRXPERIENCE Driving Simulator to prepare advanced scenarios and run simulations with complete and accurate multi-body vehicle dynamics. This innovation is already being used by automotive leader Renault to reduce physical testing, shorten time to market and ensure safety for its autonomous vehicle initiative.","R2 also dramatically enhances capabilities crucial to the design and analysis of RADAR used in autonomous vehicles. Our new innovation around Accelerated Doppler processing provides more than a 100x speed up for the time it takes to simulate radar systems.","This new breakthrough capability delivers gold standard accuracy and enhances collaboration between radar sensor designers and the OEMs that incorporate the sensors on vehicles.","Autonomous vehicles have the potential to fundamentally reshape the way we think about safety, mobility, land use and our environment. With our powerful multi-physics solutions and partnerships, I am excited that ANSYS is well positioned strategically and can play a role in making the dream of autonomous vehicles a reality. This represents a significant long-term market opportunity for ANSYS.","Switching gears, I'd like to welcome Lynn Ledwith as our Vice President of Marketing. Lynn has more than 30 years of experience and brings an outstanding track record across digital and field marketing as well as corporate branding. She has held marketing leadership positions at Worldwide Clinical Trials, Qlik Technologies, SunGard, Siemens and HP amongst others. Lynn brings a fresh approach to how we market that will open new avenues to build demand and to branding.","In summary, I'm proud of what we've accomplished in Q2. Our excellent financial performance coupled with the increased functionality of our gold-standard solutions and our ability to help customers take advantage of megatrends like autonomy, electrification, 5G, IoT and others, give us confidence in our ability to achieve our goals for the remainder of 2019 and beyond.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. Maria?","Maria Shields","Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone.","Ajei shared a few highlights from our Q2 results and now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our very strong second quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and key assumptions for Q3 and the remainder of 2019. Consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP unless I state otherwise.","Our record Q2 results reflect continued strong customer and business momentum, combined with solid execution across the business. We finished the quarter with constant-currency revenue growth of 23% and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q2 guidance.","The revenue performance in Q2 was driven by strong sales execution, including a larger dollar value of multiyear lease transactions and the closing of a few deals that were originally forecasted to close in the second half of the year.","The combination of our strong second quarter and first half results, which have been driven by success, most notably in high-tech, automotive and A&D and the strength of our pipeline, gives us confidence that we are on a path to continue to make progress against our strategic priorities and to deliver another year of record financial performance in 2019.","Key financial metrics for the quarter begin with Q2 ACV of $326 million or constant-currency growth of 14%, and total revenue of $370.5 million. Key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our Q2 guidance.","The increase in software lease license sales combined with strong maintenance renewals contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q2 total of $717 million, a 22% increase over last year's comparable balance and a new record Q2 high.","The exceptionally strong topline results helped to drive a second quarter gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 46%. We also experienced a slightly slower pace of hiring than we had planned for the quarter.","That being said, we did increase our employee base by approximately 100 employees in Q2. It's our intention to continue to execute on our hiring plans throughout the second half of the year. We reported record second quarter EPS of $1.61 benefiting from the revenue overperformance and representing growth of 19% over Q2 of 2018.","With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19%, which was slightly below the range that we had guided coming into the quarter. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% for Q3 and 20% to 20.5% for the full year.","Our cash flow from operations totaled $89 million for the quarter and $240 million for the first half and we closed Q2 with a total of $632 million in cash and short-term investments. We repurchased 80,000 shares during the quarter, which leaves us with 3.5 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program.","Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. Coming off our exceptionally strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for the third quarter and increasing our revenue earnings and ACV outlook for 2019. Before I get into the specific numbers, let me just provide a few comments with respect to the impact of the ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China.","I'd like to remind everyone that in 2018, our China business accounted for less than 5% of our total annual revenue. And point out that our increased outlook for 2019 does take into consideration our reduced expectations from China.","Now, let me move to the details of our outlook. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $320 million to $340 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.15 to $1.28. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.460 million to $1.500 million or constant currency growth in the range of 14% to 17% or 15% at the midpoint and EPS in the range of $5.98 to $6.28.","We are also increasing our ACV outlook for 2019 to a range of $1.440 million to $1.475 million. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 10% to 13%. Our outlook for the remainder of 2019 factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions, political situations and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry diverse customer base.","It also reflects additional spending in the second half related to several business infrastructure and digital transformation projects, increased sales commissions and hiring costs that were delayed from the first half's hiring shortfall.","With respect to annual operating cash flow, currently, we are maintaining our outlook for 2019 in the range of $470 million to $510 million. I would like to remind everyone that our outlook for operating cash flow in 2019 includes higher tax payments that relate to the acceleration of lease license revenue and the related profitability under ASC 606, including additional tax payments relating to the strong Q4 finish in 2018, and the first year impact of the acquisitions that we closed earlier this year.","Looking ahead to Q3, we're expecting operating margins of 39% to 40% and for the full year we're expecting a slight uptick in operating margins in the range of 43.5% to 44.5%. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2019, are contained in the prepared remarks document.","The key takeaway from our Q2 and first half results is that our strategy to make simulation pervasive is working as evidenced by double-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines and strength across the business.","Part of our confidence behind raising our guidance for the remainder of the year is based upon the continued momentum that we see from our diverse customer base. We believe that the megatrends that Ajei mentioned along with industry-wide recognition that simulation can drive a competitive advantage for our customers are bolstering demand for our products and services.","We remain confident that our continued focus on execution and investing in the business, combined with the ongoing growth in our recurring business, our strong customer relationships and healthy sales pipeline, provide a solid foundation to continue to deliver on our 2019 goals, as well as our longer-term 2020 financial targets.","Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Ken Wong","And another great quarter. On the topic of China, could you tell us whether or not you guys saw any immediate impact in Q2. And then as we look ahead, you mentioned in - you guys have factored in some conservatism in guide. Any chance you guys can help quantify what that headwind is. And as far as kind of recent headlines, obviously there's a lot of currency headlines right now, was that also already considered in the outlook?","Maria Shields","Yes. So, Ken, I'll take that. Yes, we did see a little bit of positive impact from the China situation in Q2, which helped to drive some of the overperformance in revenue. That being said, it wasn't material to the quarter. We have factored in a reduction in our expectations from the China business in the second half. I would say somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range. And yes, the - what transpired relative to currency is all factored into the outlook that we gave last evening in our earnings announcement.","Ken Wong","And then maybe - for Ajei. You mentioned the large single physics deal, the $49 million multi-year deal. When you think about kind of similar type transactions in the past, is there an opportunity to turn this into a multi-physics type of a transaction and typically what kind of uplift, something like that deliver in terms of future results?","Ajei Gopal","Yes, there is - there is always an opportunity for us to convert single-physics deals into multi-physics deals. Obviously some of it depends on the use cases some speaking in generalities, but it depends on the use cases of the customers are half of a specific application, but I said in general, as I said in the call, we're trying to expand deal sizes, not only by focusing on single-physics, as is the case with this one, but we're also trying to drive the multi-physics cross-sell across the organization. And those two work together.","So even as we deepen single-physics, we're continuing to look at broadening the multi-physics and even in the organization, which has a multi-physics sales there is opportunities to deep individual holding. So they're both kind of working parallel with each other but absolutely, it's the basis of our ability to drive larger deals.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Good morning. Ajei. Two questions for you. You noted the strength in high-tech, which is quite evident. And we're also seeing momentum the aero and auto. But you do seem to be see not quite the same growth in industrial equipment for the last couple of quarters or more, perhaps you could talk about that end market and what you're thinking is for the intermediate term, in terms of the industrial market showing some improved momentum that's a shorter-term question. Long-term question, at the Design Automation Conference two months ago in Las Vegas, ANSYS Management, including the new CTO, gave a very interesting presentation on ANSYS' long-term technology vision and there were references for example to things like new computational methods in new business areas, collaboration in cloud, services-based architecture including interestingly at least for me SPDM services.","So the question is with regard to that technology vision, how is that today in forming your internal investments in R&D and perhaps even in sales and marketing to effectuate that longer-term vision.","Ajei Gopal","So let me start with the second question first. As you know, we at ANSYS fight ourselves on the nature of our technology, the accuracy of our solutions and the effectiveness that we have in bringing new ideas and new technologies and new techniques to market, and we continue to make investments.","And obviously, Jay, what you're referring to, and what you saw, is a glimpse into some of the work that we're doing within our organization to continue to drive innovation, you mentioned the cloud, obviously, we continue to make investments in the cloud, we continue to drive product - product capabilities in the cloud.","We have most recently an announcement, I think a couple of quarters ago, for ANSYS' Cloud, which is obviously driving - which is driving Cloud usage as well as of course HPC usage within the traditional data center. We've talked about investments that we're making in computational techniques that result in faster speed up of our algorithms, we continue to make investments, in fact I referred to one of those investments we were able to get 100x speed up in some of our capabilities in my script.","So I think that there is a significant amount of investment that we're making in a different set of vectors you mentioned, componentized architectures and that obviously reflects the next generation as we invest in our platform activity.","We have an industry-leading platform in the form of ANSYS Workbench and we continue to make investments in that technology as well. So there is a number of different investments we're making in machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, all of which we think support our business and make us most successful. So that's obviously the case, and you're seeing some of that and I'm glad you were able to look at that presentation.","As far as the industry verticals are concerned, what I'm excited about of course is the growth that we're seeing in the high-tech markets, aerospace and defense and automotive and all of these areas are drive - there is a significant level of industry focus on those areas and frankly those constitute tailwinds that are driving the growth of our business and we're excited about the activity that's taking place, and the activity that's taking place really permeates the entire supply chain an.","And in many cases as you know, when we think about the end markets we refer to customers where they belong even though from an electronics company might be supplying other companies elsewhere in the supply chain as well. So I hope that I answered your questions.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Matt Pfau","I just wanted to get some additional detail on how you're driving deeper penetration with single physics products within your customer base, and I guess I'm trying to understand, are you gaining additional business units, are you getting new types of engineers to use ANSYS or are they competitive displacements some additional detail there would be helpful. Thanks.","Ajei Gopal","So usually what happens is, firstly, obviously two vectors, one, is there more users using the technology and there is more usage of that technology and that might be in more use cases that may be in more complex products that require greater amounts of simulation.","Our sales team is engaged with the customers, we try to understand the nature of the technologies, the nature of the problems they are trying to solve. And we are obviously effective in positioning simulation as the way of being able to address some of that challenges. And so as they take on more and more different products, in some cases across different departments, across different parts of the organization, the success that we are enjoying in one part of the organization starts to become infectious across that organization.","And so I think that that's one important dimension. The other thing to realize is as products become more complex, the amount of simulation required to validate or to effectively launch those products increases and that requires more - more simulation to be run. So that's greater use of HPC, high performance computing and that translates obviously into ultimately more business for ANSYS, and so it's more users, it's more use cases, it's more HPC, all of which drive to use within a single physics.","And then of course as I've said before, problems tend to be multi-physics in nature for - especially for larger companies that are looking at season and broader products and in that case, we're able to then leverage single-physics into a multi-physics sale.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jackson Ader","This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling this morning. If you could just touch maybe going back to industries. If we take autonomous driving out of the automotive sector, how does the, maybe traditional simulation in the automotive space, particularly in the U.S. look, in the first half of 2019 and then for the second half?","Ajei Gopal","So when we think about the automotive industry, the two broad trends. I would say are perhaps addressing and changing the way that the automotive industry thinks the first is electrification and the use of electric power to drive these cars. And the second is - the second is autonomy and the use of - and the creation of safer and smarter cars leading ultimately to autonomous cars. And both of those are massive - there is massive levels of investment in both of those areas.","And if you have a conversation with an automotive company, those two areas tend to be huge areas where they're spending - they're spending money, they're retooling, they are trying to make sure that they can stay ahead as the industry goes through this transition.","So those remain big, but at the same time car companies are building cars, so they're still worried about the fundamentals that they've worried about for many years, which include how do you deal with - how do you deal with structural analysis and integrity, but to give you one example; the problems of structures and vibration analysis and noise is an area that we've been in for a number of years, we've helped customers solve that problem.","Well, when you move to an electric car that problem becomes even more pronounced and so what might have been okay with an internal combustion engine, which was drowning out the noise in a car is no longer okay, when you're dealing with an electric car which might be much quieter.","So the problems that they're dealing with and they're trying to solve in some cases are even more complex because of this new technology. And so, absolutely, we see an ongoing demand for simulation to be used, not only where it's historically been used, but also for these incremental new use cases like electrification and autonomy.","The other thing that I would draw your attention to is materials, I mean companies are starting to look at the use of different materials and understanding the role of materials and the nature of the interaction between the materials they use and the outcome that they get, that's also important. And of course that's where some of the acquisitions and technology that we got through Granta come into play a role.","So when I think about the automotive industry, every single one of our technologies and techniques whether it was original ANSYS Mechanical which was the heritage and the foundation of the Company to the most recent acquired technologies that we have, are all relevant for the automotive industry and are solving problems that are absolutely pertinent and center for them being successful as they go forward in the industry.","Jackson Ader","One quick follow-up for you, Maria. Just on the cash flow. I think we want to make sure we're clear. So the - are these large lease deals that you signed in the first half or particularly in the second half, are they leading to larger tax payments than you previously contemplated and that's why the operating cash flow guidance has remained unchanged?","Maria Shields","No. So just to be clear, that deal was actually in our forecast, it wasn't an outlier. But that being said, as we began to articulate in Q1 that under 606, no doubt the tax payments have increased. So as a result, the combination of the increase in tax payments under 606 as well as about a 2% headwind for the full year and the dilutive impact on cash flows from the acquisitions that we did earlier in the year, all lead to us deciding that it's probably prudent not to take up the cash flow guidance until we get a sense of the timing around closing of those larger deals in the second half to see whether or not they will impact 2019 cash flows or move into Q1 of 2020.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ken Talanian","I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how are you thinking about organic ACV growth for the remainder of the year.","Maria Shields","Yes, I would say the impact - the inorganic impact of the acquisitions that we did this year are about 3%. So the remainder is all organic.","Ken Talanian","And then Ajei, it sounds like R2 offers a more integrated workflow than available before. Could you discuss were you're more broadly in terms of technical integration for both your existing products and recent acquisitions?","Ajei Gopal","Well, as you know, we've had a strategy for a number of years that we've been executing against to integrate our products together through the ANSYS Workbench and that continues to be - that continues to be the strategy, it was a very innovative solution that make - that made simulation dramatically easier, and it gave us a framework and a mechanism by which new technologies could be integrated together.","And frankly, our strategy continues to be to drive that level of platform integration both through Workbench and as I said earlier, we continue to invest in our ongoing platform work to componentize the platform to make it easier for people to drive that level of integration, because we believe an open strategy here is in the best interest of ANSYS and our customers.","So we define APIs, we allow third-parties to integrate in, we certainly integrate our technologies together when we define workflows and we continue to do that and that's part of the strategy that we've had for a number of years, of course, we continue to increase our level of investments in that. When you think about some of these next-generation challenges that we're addressing with our customers, I mentioned electrification, I mentioned autonomy, 5G, et cetera.","These are also intrinsically multi-physics solutions, which require an integrated workflow and we're able to position and provide those to our customers as well, based on the integration work we've done across our products.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Steve Koenig","Perfect, thank you very much. Hi ANSYS, congratulations on a great quarter.","Ajei Gopal","Thank you.","Steve Koenig","I got one for Maria, and a follow-up for Ajei, if you don't mind as well. So for Maria, we've been hearing from some other companies about maybe selected weakness in certain countries, maybe towards the end of the quarter and in some - some sort of kind of non-linearity from some people in certain - certain countries. Did you see any pockets of weakness or was everything pretty much good across most every country and how did your linearity look like?","Maria Shields","Yes, so I would say the linearity was about the same as we've experienced throughout 2018 and Q1 of 2019. I can't speak to any specific country that we saw weakness at the end, obviously the tariff situation in China, but we've got enough resiliency in the model from our geographic and our vertical distribution that - that we were able to execute against our forecasts, and closed successfully.","And as you saw, each of the major geographies delivered double-digit constant-currency revenue growth, so we feel good about our execution in Q2, and obviously as we've taken up our guide on all of our key metrics for earnings, ACV and revenues for the full year, we still see a lot of momentum and we've got a healthy pipeline. So now we just need to focus on execution for the remainder of the year.","Steve Koenig","And for you, Ajei. Could you give us some color on the Discovery Live activity that you're seeing and like what's the value proposition for Discovery Live and maybe distinguish that from the value prop or the situations in which you're selling as part of the PTC CAD workflow.","Ajei Gopal","The value proposition for Discovery Live is really unchanged from what it's been and what I've described in the past, namely Discovery Live offers an individual a very quick way - a real time way of getting a directionally accurate solution in - or an analysis of a particular problem that the real-time nature of Discovery Live is what makes it so valuable and the fact that make it's so intuitive to use and so easy to use, is what makes Discovery Live accurate.","Now, we found - we found that there are use cases certainly, where customers or users are completely new to simulation, we'll see the benefit of use of Discovery Live and there are - we have cases where that's the case.","And we also have other cases where Discovery Live is being used by much - by people who are much more adept, who have used simulation in the past, in fact are able to use the ANSYS flagship tools as part of their day-to-day work, but by using Discovery Live to give them a directional idea of where they need to apply deeper levels of simulation.","And obviously as I said, the value proposition for Discovery Live is it gives them that immediate - it gives them that immediate feedback without having to do the deeper analysis. And then they can use that immediate feedback to figure out whether they should start looking to do deeper analysis.","So we see both of those kinds of use cases. Certainly, when you think about enterprise customers, you see exactly that because there are people in within larger enterprise organizations who are users of ANSYS and you see people in there who are taking advantages of relive who are not currently users of the ANSYS suite but take advantage of Discovery Live to give them insight simulation-based side.","Now as far as the co-existence with PTC and - is concerned, as an example in CAD or in general with CAD. There is a cadre of users who are using CAD from their vendor. And what we are in a position to do in that model with PTC of course is to make Discovery Live capabilities visible to the CAD user natively. So someone was those laying out of CAD design will be able to use the PTC Creo simulate live solution to be able to quickly iterate and that gives them obviously an integrated workflow within the PTC solution and so that's an advantage.","But there are also users, as I pointed out in the case of the defense DoD contractor that I referred to in my script. There are also users who are not currently CAD users. And we have a situation where, in that case where the customer made a decision to purchase both Discovery Live, as well as PTC Creo simulate Live.","They are trying to strategically drive upfront simulation across the supply chain, both internally and externally, and what they want to try to do is to get every single engineer to be able to run their own simulation, whether they're a simulation expert or not, so that they can get to more rapid and informed decisions early.","And as I said in that situation, we expect to see potentially hundreds or thousands of engineers across multiple business users - taking advantage of simulation, some case there'll be CAD users using the PTC solution, in some cases, they won't be CAD users they will be taking advantage of the Discovery Live solution. And of course, if a customer is using another CAD solution, we have natural interconnections between Discovery Live and the other CAD Solutions, where you have the ability to take advantage of both technologies in parallel.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.","Tyler Radke","So I am free to ask question here. You touched on China and obviously you sounds like you didn't see much macro weakness broadly in Q2. I guess my question is, you seen any changes here in the first month or five weeks since you've closed Q2 and how are you just thinking about the ability to close large deals in the second half of the year relative to the first half, just given a potentially weaker macro backdrop? Thank you.","Ajei Gopal","I mean, I think the Maria\u2019s comment actually said - said it very clearly. We have looked closely at our pipeline and given where we are. The guidance that we're giving takes into account everything that we understand about our pipeline and what we understand about the macro and the situation and the trade discussions between the U.S. and China, as well as the broader macro. So we are in a position, our guidance is based on what we know now and what our analysis is based upon the circumstances that we see in the market today.","Tyler Radke","And then you talked a lot about kind of some of the autonomous and electrification trends, in the autos and high-tech end market in addition, you talked about 5G. I guess just how far do you think we are through that opportunity, is this the multiyear opportunity to come or how are you thinking about just - where we are through the various stages of that? Thank you.","Ajei Gopal","All of the ones that I mentioned, autonomy, electrification, 5G, IoT all of these I think are very early in their development. We think were broadly very early in their development. We certainly see customers who will make significant levels of investments in this over multiple years as products get better and better, and as technology starts to improve. Certainly in the case of Autonomous, as I mentioned, and I alluded to, I think in my script.","I don't think you can get experts to agree on when the Level 5 full autonomy is going to be ready in the marketplace. Some people will say sooner or some people will say later, but the fact remains that on the path towards Level 5 full autonomy there are all kinds of innovations which are being created that will make vehicles better and safer and even partial autonomy starts to significantly improve the safety capabilities on the road.","And simulation plays a significant role. So this is a multiyear journey that the industry is on, where simulation is going to play a huge role in autonomy. And I would make the observation of course that it\u2019s not just in automotive, it's aerospace, it's other industrial equipment. I think I talked in an earlier conference call about undersea equipment as well, so an autonomous submersible.","So there are all kinds of areas where autonomy is applicable and there continues to be enormous amounts of work ahead of us as an industry. Similarly for electrification, I could go through it in similar detail and equally for 5G, equally for IoT, all of these are major, major mega trends that we believe to be multi-trends trends that are frankly driving the growth of our core business.","And so, I think we're in a very enviable position as a company to have a core business that's in a very strong and actively growing part of the market and with products that are leading edge products to be able to address customers' problems in these multiyear mega challenges that they're facing.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gal Munda with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Gal Munda","So the first one is just for you guys in terms of the ability to forecast those large deals that are coming in. Now you've had the fourth deal above $30 million coming in less than a year and a half. What have you learned from those deals and what is - when you look at your pipeline and the potential for those deals to close, kind of, towards the end of the year but even going forward. Are you able to say more is it more confident in kind of having the ability to predict when those deals might close considering the fact that we've only really started a year and a bit ago?","Ajei Gopal","I think that - anytime you're looking at pipeline and trying to predict exactly what happens in the pipeline, especially for some of these larger deals. It varies on an individual customer by customer basis. We're not assuming, we obviously the ANSYS business if you think about the overall volume, we do have a certain number of large deals and larger customers.","But of course we have a large amount of the business that's much smaller more transactional in nature. And obviously that's easier to predict because we know we have a law of large numbers of volumes working as when we're dealing with be the more transactional piece of the business.","For the larger deals of course we understand exactly what the customer problem is. We know what the value proposition is. In many cases we've been working with the customer for a while, we understand the challenges that they're dealing with. And we understand the compelling event that's driving them to spend the money with us. They're trying to make a particular product launch. They're trying to get some particular technology out to market. They are trying to compete in a different way in the market.","All of these are major drivers and they're spending money with us to help achieve these business objectives. And so, when we link these business objectives with our understanding of the value that we can provide, and we put it together, given the nature of the relationships we have with some of these customers. We can predict and we factor that in, into our prediction of the pipeline. So it's a more - it\u2019s a thoughtful analysis of where we are and that results in the guidance obviously that - we give to you guys.","Gal Munda","And then just as a follow-up, got a question on Discovery Live it seems like from both commentary around you and what PTC has said recently it's getting more traction definitely. We understand that there is nothing material in the numbers, especially for this year. But could it become more material driver of growth in let's say, a year or so. Do you have expectations for that, did you think that Discovery Live will take another few years in order to really ramp up in terms of the volume to move to the needle?","Ajei Gopal","Yes, we will obviously be able to give you a longer discussion during Investor Day when we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about Discovery Live and the technology, but I think a quick way to think about it, Gal is that in our industry, our customers tend to be quite conservative. And even for a breakthrough product like Discovery Live, our internal expectations are that it will take time for customers to take advantage of these technologies.","And so, as you rightly point out, it's not really a material part of our business as we think about it this year or in the short term. So we'll give you more insights, perhaps be able to address these questions and others during the Investor Day presentation in a couple of months. Next month.","Operator","And our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Adam Borg","Regarding services, so it's great to see the continued strong services momentum as you sell a broader platform to customers. Are you just curious about your plans to continue getting partners involved with services and how sustainable the recent trends in the 30% to 40% growth is?","Ajei Gopal","So one of the areas, one of the reasons why customers are looking to ANSYS on more services is that they've got to solve some of these more complex problems were able to help them understand using services capabilities, using our services capability, how to solve some of these next-generation problems. So they're looking to solve some of these complex problems, reaching out to us to help them to do that. And that's where we provide services.","But as you know, our business model is not to be a services company, we are a software business and yes, services is not a big portion of our business and it's not going to be a big portion of our business, going forward.","Our plan is to, our plan is to work with - continue to work with third-parties and partners as appropriate, and we're continuing to evaluate third-parties to take to take on responsibilities to some of these newer solution areas that customers are looking to.","And we will continue to drive our investments in our business where services drive license revenue. So that's the way you should think about the services business, and obviously, we don't see that services ratio really changing as a percentage of our overall revenue in the term.","Adam Borg","And maybe just a quick follow-up for Maria. Could you just remind us for what the percentage of lease deals are that are one-year versus multi-year and what's the average duration for the multi-year deals? Thanks.","Maria Shields","Yes, we don't bifurcate between one year and multi-year. Today, the one-year tend to be at the transactional level and the multi-year obviously tend to be at the enterprise and strategic level. And the second part of your question?","Adam Borg","Duration.","Maria Shields","Duration hasn't really changed. I'd say those multi-year deals still tend to be between two and three years.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Nate Hitchcock","This is Nate Hitchcock on for Rich, thanks for taking my question. Thinking about the simulation tool chain tech with BMW, other release note that ANSYS will assume exclusive rights for commercialization and where we were wondering, if you've begun marketing this product, marketing this tech to other auto OEMs or if you can share anything regarding vision or plans in this space. And then I do have one follow-up.","AjeiGopal","We will talk more about autonomy in general perhaps at our Investor Day and you'll have a chance to understand a little bit more about half the technical detail about what we're doing in autonomy in general. But no in ANSYS, direct answer your question that we're not marketing that externally at this point of time. We are working with BMW as they lead up to be to the launch of the BMW iNEXT which is expected to launch within the next - with the next couple of years.","Nate Hitchcock","And then also in 2Q we saw very strong revenue year-over-year growth and other Asia Pacific up 74% constant currency. And considering the following the prepared remarks regarding some of the second half deals closing earlier ahead of schedule, we're wondering if some of the strength and the other Asia Pacific geography as a result of company is buying ahead due to trade relations or if you can provide really any additional detail here?","Maria Shields","Yes, I would say it was driven by two things. Yes. Some companies buying ahead, but that was a smaller portion. The other was the large transaction that Ajei referred to in his prepared remarks. So the impact of both are what drove the performance in those numbers that you referred to.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Jason Celino","When I look at Q3 guidance for operating margins, it kind of suggests 400, 500 basis points of operating margin compression. Can you just talk about some of the investments we plan making or at least the increase in spend just a little more color.","Maria Shields","Yes. So I would say first of all, it's lower revenue is really the primary driver. But no doubt if you heard my commentary in my remarks, we are in the second half contemplating, continuing to hire and making up for some of the slower pace in the first half. We've got a number of digital transformation projects underway that we will continue to invest in heavily across the business. And of course the impact of the acquisitions that we closed earlier, so a combination of all of those, or what's driving the operating margin outlook for Q3 and the remainder of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Simmons with RBC. Please go ahead.","Robert Simmons","So like you just mentioned, you've been behind on your hiring both Q1 and Q2, sort of a few questions on that. Are there particular areas that you're behind on or is it kind of across the board, and then kind of what's the bottleneck? ","Maria Shields","Yes, it's across the board, as I spoke on the last earnings call Q1 was a combination of not only, I'll call it a challenging hiring environment and that's not just a domestic issue that's really globally. But that was also impacted by, as you can imagine, when you do two acquisitions in a quarter before we just keep the hiring pipeline open, we take a look at the new talent that is joined ANSYS to see if there is opportunities to fill open positions and to broaden some of our new teammates responsibilities. So that slowed down some of the activity in Q1.","As I said, we did hire 100 people in Q2 and the reality is we are going to continue to aggressively pursue our hiring plans throughout the remainder of the year, and we are recruiting for physicians across the business.","So there is no single function or part of the business that's disproportionately impacted. It's really across the business and it is a more challenging hiring environment than we've seen at least, I've seen in at least a decade.","Q \u2013 Robert Simmons","And then, are you seeing turnover, you be liquidating rising or is that been pretty steady. And are you seeing wage demand is growing up or is it just harder to find people?","Maria Shields","Yes, no, we still got single-digit turnover, so we are able to retain, but it is the recruiting efforts that just takes longer. And as you can imagine, sometimes when you have very highly talented employees who go to their existing employer and announce they are going to be leaving, their existing employers are getting more aggressive relative to what do they have to do to retain those people.","So it's tricky. We're continuing to find people as you also know, we are looking for highly selective candidates in what we're hiring for. So it's not always easy to find them. But we are confident that we can continue to attract and retain our talent as we've done for almost 50 years now.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks.","Ajei Gopal","I thank you all for your questions. Before I sign off, I'd like to once again thank my colleagues at ANSYS as well as our channel partners around the world for all of their hard work and their efforts that are leading to our success. Thank you all so much. And for the rest of you, thank you for joining the call and please enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

With us today are Mr. Jim Cashman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Jim Cashman for some opening remarks.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Good morning, and again, thank you, everyone, for joining us to discuss ANSYS' 2012 first quarter financial results. So consistent with the standard protocol we've been keeping, all of the general information and key topics relative to Q1's business performance and our 2012 outlook are included within this morning's earnings release and in the prepared remarks document that we posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. ","So with that, I'll introduce my cohort here, Maria Shields, our CFO, who will go through our Safe Harbor Statement. So Maria?","Maria T. Shields","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd just like to remind you that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum. During the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and the related Form 8-K. ","So Jim, I'll turn it back over to you.","James E. Cashman","Okay, great. Thanks. So before we get started with the Q&A, I'd like to briefly underscore a few important highlights regarding our Q1 results and the continued commitment to delivering our 2012 outlook. So let me begin by saying Q1 was a solid quarter on many fronts. I guess from my perspective the most important aspect of the performance for Q1 was that despite some challenges, we continued an important multiyear trend for us to the company and the management team, and we delivered on those key commitments. So both revenue and earnings were in line with the range that we have guided on coming into the quarter. ","In addition, just hitting some highlights here, we achieved double-digit revenue growth in all 3 major geographies as well as double-digit growth in our software license and our maintenance and service businesses. The Apache financial results were slightly ahead of our projections, and we made good progress in our integration efforts, but of course, there's a lot more work ahead of us. Our recurring revenue went to 72%, our operating margins remained strong at 50%, our deferred revenue grew to an all-time high of $299 million. We generated $83.6 million in operating cash flows. And on the hiring front, as we have mentioned on previous calls, we added a net 40-plus new employees for the quarter, and there's more planned in Q2 in the second half of 2012. ","So with that, there are many positive aspects in the quarter. In addition to that, including strong revenue performance in Germany and North America, most notably. And then as always, there were some isolated sales execution issues that impacted the quarter and have been the top priority for us in Q2 and the remainder of 2012. ","Our industry composition continues to be diverse while exhibiting particular strengths in a few sectors like automotive, aerospace, energy, industrial equipment and electronics. We added new customers and also continued to see new sales and strong renewals at our existing account base, where we're in virtually all of the top 100 industrial companies in the world. Most importantly, this was accomplished while we maintained the core tenets of our long-term vision, and it was supported by an environment where our customers that just can't afford to compromise on the depth, breadth or quality of the simulation solutions that they're using in the processes to solve their own complex design challenges. ","So the result of this is as we look forward to the remainder of 2012, we're slightly raising and tightening our range. This consists of maintaining the upper end of our range while absorbing some minor additional currency impacts. We're also raising the floor of our previous guidance. And so netting all this out, we will remain committed to our full year outlook on non-GAAP earnings and the revenue for 2012, with revenues in the range of $810 million to $830 million in revenue, and earnings in the range of $2.78 to $2.87. And for Q2, we're targeting non-GAAP revenues in the range of $192 million to $199 million, and EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.69. ","So with all that to just kind of highlight and bracket the things, we'll now open the phone lines to any questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Ashley from Robert W Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm surprised by this, but I wonder if you could give us some more color on the sales issues you talked about, where they were and maybe a little bit more color on what they were.","James E. Cashman","Well, I mean, the only thing is -- I mean, first of all, I mean, for the last 10 years, every quarter, we've talked about the areas that we're going to continue to focus on and raising all those levels. But we did mention in the other commentary that for instance, in Japan, yes, there were some macro issues, there were some things related around the electronics sector and there were some things that we felt that we could turn the gain up on in terms of execution, so nothing earthshaking. It's just kind of the standard process of continuing to grow and reenergize a business on an ongoing basis. So I mean, it's really kind of that. And we mentioned -- I think we probably mentioned the U.K. but obviously, there are some things going on there with some of the austerity measures and getting there -- the fiscal house in order, overall. But that tends to put a dampening effect, which does hit in the short term. On the other hand, we talked about a variety of pockets of strength. So if it's really that same litany, where there's always areas that are performing well and you want to turn the gain up on that, and other where you sit there and say, \"Hey, we think there's opportunity for more.\" And that's -- so things that we continue to do behind the scenes and again, just in trying to keep us as transparent as possible, we\u2019ll spell those out.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Terrific. And then maybe you could comment on linearity on the quarter. I know DSOs were just a little bit higher than last year.","Maria T. Shields","Linearity. Steve, linearity is about the same.","James E. Cashman","There's no really appreciable change in linearity now on the DSOs, I mean, we can dissect, though.","Maria T. Shields","No significant changes or concerns, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Jim, in Q1, it appears that you're -- ANSYS-only growth in constant currency x the Apache acquisition was in the high single digits, and I'm wondering if you're assuming that for the remainder of the year, you can return to double-digit constant currency growth for the ANSYS business, again, excluding the Apache business.","James E. Cashman","Okay. No, no, no. I got you on that. And the first thing I'd say is that in general, we were right in line with the guidance that we set for Q1 with all the things that we saw, the various timings of major account renewals, a whole range of things that are tied in with our business. So we tied in pretty well on that. I think we did note that -- and we're not calling out any kind of a trend here. We're just noticing a piece wise of data is that even in the organic business, our lease business climbed up a bit. Now I don't -- we don't see anything anecdotally that says it's a long-term trend here. But one thing that does do is it tends to solidify longer-term revenue pattern and it tends to have a slight dampening on the short-term base. I mean, even as you go -- when you look at the organic deferred revenue, you'd see that, that grew in excess of the rates, which kind of bears all that out. Now to -- so everything kind of like pretty much as we have said. And as I said going forward into the guidance, we went into -- so the guidance is really looking at about 12% to 14% constant currency for the organic standpoint. I think that was the net crystal of what you're talking there. And in our guidance, like I mentioned, we've been absorbing additional currency impacts, so actually raising that guidance. We've also tightened the range a little bit, raised the floor. So all of that kind of plays into that 12% to 14%. But 12% to 14% constant currency organic for the year.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. My follow-up then is with respect to your vertical markets. Are you seeing across the verticals, including the ones you mentioned, any appreciable differences in terms of either license growth as measured in seats, or as well, are you seeing any appreciable differences by vertical in terms of lease or maintenance renewal rates?","James E. Cashman","Okay. The first question, the easiest one to address is on the lease renewal rates. Basically pretty uniform across all industries and again, staying in that mid- to high-90s kind of range that we've historically talked about. Now when you talk about the individual industry participants, there does tend to be a high correlation, of course, between the additional growth. And so those areas that are a little bit more vibrant or in stronger renewal cycles -- not renewal, but renovation cycles, you'll see that kind of rise up. So -- but I'd say that it's fairly linearly a portion to all of the industries, pretty much in relative proportion to how they've grown. I would say also, though, that the trend that we talked about on top of other calls, you will see that the HPC aspects continue to grow, so that can tied of, whether you count that as a seat or a user or things like that, that gets a little bit different. The one thing that was interesting is, if you noticed, there was one thing that I mentioned and I might have created a paradox here, but talked about the -- in an earlier question, talked about the macroeconomic and particularly, the macro in the electronics sector in Japan as being a factor in Japan. However, we talked about the relative strength in North America with double-digit growth, and they were actually quite strong in the electronics. Likewise, some of the other giants that you'd hear are the upcoming names in Electronics, Korea was particularly strong and, of course, that is heavily influenced by the electronics sector. So there's really kind of like no oddball data that would poke you in a different direction. Those industry sectors in general went well. Sometimes they were metered by a local macroeconomic sectors, but in general, it was all pretty linear. And then like I said, the foundation across all that was, regardless of the industry, the renewal rates were right in the target range that we maintain.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Davis from Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Maybe kind of following up on what Jay asked. Do you have a sense on what the organic growth rate of the core ANSYS bookings are? You mentioned deferred revenues bumping up and for some companies, that's helpful; some companies, it's not. Because I don't know how much is services or maintenance renewals, but if you have something along those lines to kind of -- that would help people understand kind of how [indiscernible] change.","James E. Cashman","Well, basically, I don't have that number off the top of my head. I mean, other than the fact that we did do that check on there to make sure that yes, we're looking at -- basically, we're also in the -- if you look at the deferred revenue for organic only, it went double digits, correct into the double-digit things. So above the rate we had for the revenue originally, which also was the guidance revenue we had. So I don't have that specific number, so I don't want to take a wild stab at it. But the fact is, you could see that, that increase, that influx to lease, which I say is a slight shift right now, you see some of the other things. But it really didn't relate. One thing you mentioned there in terms of service, it didn't relate to bookings for pre-service or anything out of ordinary there because all of the renewal rates were basically in line. So really, we just see this as more of a net positive overall for the long term of the business.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Got it. And then I guess a follow-up would be, competitively, it sounded as if most of your -- again, adjusting for natural enthusiasms of private companies, but it sounds like most of the private companies with whom you competed had a pretty good quarter. Do you have a sense as to any changing customer matter competitive dynamics out there?","James E. Cashman","Well, basically, absolutely not in terms of any changing dynamic. I mean, there's always going to be a collection of people. I mean, none that compete across the broad spectrum that we have, that have individual solutions occurs. Obviously, the law, the denominator can work for or against you in that standpoint. I mean, the relative size of things. But if you look at the scale we had, everything was kind of in line with, again, in line with our guidance and in line with the normal booking and renewal and addition cycles of most of the customers, there wasn't any new competitor that popped up as being either numerically or anecdotally more on the radar screen. And frankly, we added a ton of new license business ourselves on top of it, which plays into the overall long-term strengths. So really, no significant changes. And really, if you look at the guidance, the projections and what we've been talking about, no surprises. That's just more validation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blair Abernethy from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Blair Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two quick things. Maria, I wondered if you could comment some more on the headcount, the 40 that you added this quarter, so where did you fill holes there and sort of what are you looking like going forward?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, the 40 are probably maybe slightly less than half of that in the sales force. The remainder of that, a scattering of R&D and some G&A.","James E. Cashman","It was across all sectors. We did hire on the platform of what we were planning on for sales. Of course, when you do that, you have a little bit of the support thing that comes along. And we did the aforementioned, things that we talked out in previous calls in terms of continuing to ramp up the R&D engine, so we had key ones there. But again, we really only go for the cream of that -- of particular standpoint. But then, underneath that, there was basically across all sectors. And I mean, you really don't go much further than look at -- go to ansys.com and look at the position list that are even publicly quoted there, and you'll see the ones that we're continuing to look for as we go forward.","Blair Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And the other question I had is for you, Jim. Can you give us a sense of what the magnitude of the shift was this quarter from what you would've expected to be paid up that shifted to lease? And then are you still seeing a larger trend here of major or long-time customers continue to come off lease back towards to paid up?","James E. Cashman","No, not really on the second one. On the first one, probably talking about a couple of million. Of course, that makes the -- I mean, we were still in the bit of the original revenue range. But that was that. If there was a minor, minor surprise, that was part of it. But again, that works out well for us long term. But that was about the level, the shift that we are looking at. The fact is that we're still business in hand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to start with the SG&A expenses. When you look at the spending level in the quarter, how did that come in relative to what you kind of had thought originally coming into the quarter? Because relative to the seasonal trends, it seems like it's a little bit lighter than what we would have seen.","Maria T. Shields","Yes, it's lighter, largely due to hedge.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just for headcount, I was going to add -- the follow-up question would be around that. How much of that was variable expenses coming in lower than seasonal?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, the other thing that -- this was probably the lowest quarter in a very long time for ANSYS where we basically had no bad debt expense.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. It is my backhanded way of asking you when you look at the commission revenue around it, I know you have the leased versus the purchased, but how was the variable expense around commissions in the quarter?","Maria T. Shields","Commissions, commissions were maybe a little bit lower just because if you don't have the salespeople here, you can't pay the commission.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. And in terms -- but to your point being light on heads, you hired into sales, where was the turnover? Was it proactive [ph]?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, some of the sales positions, particularly in Japan, while they're higher, the problem is they have long notice periods. So they're \"higher\" but some of them didn't start until the end of the quarter or won't start until Q2.","James E. Cashman","A couple of people we mentioned, of course, were like partial entrants into the quarter, not across the whole quarter, but they...","Maria T. Shields","Yes, not everybody started in January.","James E. Cashman","But they'll show at the whole Q2.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you'll start to get a little bit -- obviously, it takes a couple of quarters for them to ramp, but you'll start to get a little bit of contribution from them in the second quarter?","Maria T. Shields","Yes.","James E. Cashman","Yes, you'll start to see that.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on the lease versus purchase discussion, how much of that shift was just shifting in greenfield new customers coming in deciding to go lease versus purchase, versus existing customers that, as they're adding additional licenses for HPC or something else deciding to lease them instead of purchase?","James E. Cashman","The majority of it was new. I mean, anecdotally, there might have been a few a little threads of things that people were picking up something to try to -- because they can get it more quickly than they could going through the capital purchase long term. But if the majority of it was new from almost everything I could see, I don't know, Maria, do you...","Maria T. Shields","Yes. I would say it's more newer business, newer names than our long, traditional enterprise accounts.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And last question, when you talk about electronics in Japan, is this specifically CE? We saw a lot of news with Sony cutting heads, for example. Is it more consumer electronics that...","James E. Cashman","Oh, yes, yes. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. But yes, it definitely was more consumer electronics. And on the other hand, when I talk about some of the versions [ph] of pockets of strength, there were some of those that were driven up by strength in some other geography locales. And it somewhat mirrors the headlines you'd see about who's driving in current electronics growth and who's having a little bit more difficulty and things like that. A recent write up in The Wall Street Journal on some things along that line. So yes, it's heavily driven along those lines. It tends to be more micro in this case than macro. In other words, geography and\/or even account-specific.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Cummins from ThinkEquity.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Let's see, first question regarding the revenue guidance for Q2. The sequentials are pretty strong in the guidance, I think 4% to 7.5%. My model goes back to I think 2004, and I don't have an organic in that range. I'm just curious what you're seeing or counting on or maybe you have already seen business that wrapped over. And then I had a follow-up on your reference to customers switching preference toward term in Q1.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Yes, just give me -- Q2 is really based on that bottom-up forecast and then we got a pretty good visibility on a lot of that business. So really, this represents the grassroots that gets down to a named account kind of basis scoured by geography, and that's really what stays long and it tracks along with our earlier statements, it tracks along with the -- it dovetails nicely into the longer-term annual guidance. So it's been basically just one more piece of that in that puzzle, and hopefully, we demonstrated that over a long period of years. And then, I'm sorry, you had a second question on the time on the period licenses versus paid-up?","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Yes, actually. And also -- I just wanted to also clarify that all of Apache is term, ratable term?","James E. Cashman","I mean, like, yes, high 90%. I mean, I'm saying there may be a couple of odd ones out there, but it's all time-based.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Okay, right. On the prepared remarks slides, Page 3, it says, \u201cCertain customers electing to switch their Q1 orders from paid-up to lease.\u201d I'm curious kind of what's the case color on those examples? What's coming back from your field salespeople? What do you think is the change there on the customer side?","Maria T. Shields","Choppiness where people are perhaps being a little cautious with their capital, especially in the SMB world where credit\u2019s not always robust and cash is king. Sometimes at the begin of the quarter, they're feeling better, and maybe just like we see, choppiness is parts of the business due to macro issues, maybe they felt the same thing and they decided that they\u2019d go with leases versus paid-ups.","James E. Cashman","Yes, and when we go into this -- I mean, we've talked over the years, we're relatively agnostic when it comes to which kind of purchase or acquisition mechanism they'll use. So a lot of times, you'll have that in the forecast that we know that an order is good, and it's coming in, but it can shift slightly. Normally, we have an idea what form it's coming in. But not all the time. Sometimes it gets down to the wire and the customers says, \"We want to get a kick on this project, but we will have to acquire it in a different way.\" And that's kind of what we saw here. But again, relatively small. This is not -- I want to highlight, this is not the kind of impact we saw back in the 2009 or 2002 timeframes, where you could see wholesale -- and I wouldn't call it migrations, I just call it temporary dislocations that 1 year or 2 later sell themselves out. This is just one quarter of things that did amount to a, not insignificant amount of information but it's -- or business transfer, but it was something that we want to -- that we said that we needed to kind of highlight. We'll be keeping an eye on it. But at the end of the day, we're still adding those customers, they're still using the software and again, our deferred base continues to -- and recurring business tends to keep rising on that, so it certainly helps as another aspects of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Koenig from Longbow Research.","Steven R. Koenig - Longbow Research LLC","Just a quick clarification, housekeeping before the main question, if you don't mind. Maria, the deferred revenue in the print says $282 million. So I'm just wondering the discrepancy with the $299 million. Is that the -- is the print the current deferred or what's the difference?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, the $282 million is current and then there is $17.7 million deferred revenues. It's classified on the balance sheet in the long-term section.","Steven R. Koenig - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, great. And then what I'd like to inquire about is Europe here, looks like it grew about 10% constant currency organic. You had really strong results in Germany. The PMIs in April really declined in Germany, did not look good in that country and for Europe overall. And so I'm wondering, can you comment on, number one, linearity at the start of the quarter here in April. And secondly -- particularly Germany. And then secondly, what are you assuming about Europe and your guidance going forward?","James E. Cashman","Well, the guidance is still based again on the existing relationships we have and the short-term in forecast. The linearity, no real changes to highlight on that. The key thing is, again, we've -- I've witnessed this pattern probably about 3 or 4 times where -- and usually Germany was at the epicenter of it, where people\u2019s idea was, here is the German GDP and why are you growing way above that? It just turns out that there's a lot of multinational companies that are supplying infrastructure, energy, a whole range of things to other places in the globe, and as such, they're having a huge influx of business, and those are the ones that we continue to do quite strongly with. So while macros can be a -- I'm sorry, while the macro economy of a sub-region can be a factor for us, it's more often transcended by the markets that the companies in there are serving, because we're not really like a consumer entity within those geographies. And that's why even on the Japan situation, I mentioned the fact that you're looking at some micro -- some companies that are having broader range issues on a global competitiveness issue, and those are the ones that are being written up in the papers. So while it's certainly is a factor, it really isn't a necessary -- it isn't necessarily a barrier to the ongoing growth, again, because we're serving companies that are serving not just European markets but serving global markets.","Steven R. Koenig - Longbow Research LLC","So Jim, is it fair to say your Europe assumptions are about the same as a quarter ago?","James E. Cashman","Yes, I mean, broadly speaking, yes. I mean, there's always going to be some puts and takes across the board, but yes, it's -- and in fact, that's why it's reflective again in our guidance, which, again, we've kind of strengthened and tighten the range on for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schappel from Benchmark.","Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Jim, you recently highlighted your strategic agreement with FMC in the recent press release. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit further on that relationship, and whether we can expect similar type of partnerships down the road?","James E. Cashman","Well, first of all, looking at those kinds of partnerships are actually things that we've been seeing in increasing amounts. With regards to these kind of announcements though, the more strategic they get, actually, the more, I don't want to say cloak and dagger, but the more secretive they get. Because the fact is, the customer you mentioned was a long-standing customer. They\u2019ve continued to grow with us over time. And in fact, it's just another one of those things -- we've been talking about this at the Analyst Day, those long-standing customers that are actually expanding and elevating. They're starting to move up our quintessential S-curve, if you will. Now the nature of what's involved in there, the more strategic those relationships get, actually, the more secretive they become in terms of what they're doing, because more often than not, they're doing it to -- for some increase in strategic advantage and they normally don't like to talk a lot about the details of what those are. So really, it's an overall strengthening. The other thing you've mentioned is that these customers as they extend and elevate, they tend to get much broader in the product portfolios that they're using. So these are the ones -- we've talked about this where everybody loves the concept of multi-physics but it's a long time to get it built into the process of individual customers. You'll see, if you look at some of these customers, that they actually are also increasing the breadth of products and the interactivity with which they're using them. And all of those are kind of in our wheelhouse. They're really good portends for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Perry Huang from Goldman Sachs.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question around gross margins. It looks like for the full year guidance at 87% compares to the prior outlook of about 87% to 88%. Should we think about the outlook as reflecting a higher contribution from services revenue, which I think had a strong quarter sequentially, I'm sorry, or maybe lower license expectations given the shift in the quarter?","James E. Cashman","No, no, no. There's 2 primary things. You hit one, and again, these are all very minor things. But again, when you're talking about 88%, 87% -- going to 87%, that's really -- that's not a seismic -- that's not a tectonic shift. Yes, we've talked over the past few quarters about using services as a means of accelerating some of those hurdles to the advanced adoption of it. I'd say the other thing is -- so you will see that that's already incorporating into those trends that you correctly seen. The other thing is that there's another element in that gross margin line that relates to royalty content and some of the components that we might be using. So there\u2019s going to be a small contribution of that in there. But again, nothing really apart from what we've been talking about for the last few quarters.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And sort of as a follow-up around HPC, is there any color that maybe you could provide around the momentum of the business in the quarter? For example, last year, I think commentary was that it was about 10% of total sales. I'm just trying to get a sense of the business momentum as we start this year.","James E. Cashman","Well, the thing we've been talking about that's kind of a metric here that seems to be growing at about 2 to 3x of the license growth, which means that people, while we're adding new users, the intensity of the previous users is continuing to increase. That means they can solve larger problem sizes and more complex things. They can get things in a lesser amount of time. So if you just extrapolate those multiples, yes, it's creeping up there. But again, if you look to the pie chart, they'd probably be largely un-differentiable because you have that smaller component growing at a larger rate. It's not like it's, oh now, it's 15% or 20%, but it just continues to edge up there, and we are seeing it continue to grow disproportionately.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Rogers from Great Lakes Review.","Jason Rogers","Looking at your growing cash balance, I was interested in your thoughts on both the acquisition environment, as well as share repurchases, given your recent increase in the authorization.","James E. Cashman","Well, the -- we always -- I mean, the reason we authorized that increased share count was to have more latitude on when the previous plan which was starting to get a little bit tighter. So that's always on there. And according to the same metrics that we've always talked about how we do that. With regard to the acquisition environment, of course, those -- the very large ones in the tangential spaces aren't as much, but there really are a number of tech tuck-ins and things, I think for every quarter that I can remember for over a decade, we talked about those. Those are always on the radar. Now they don't always come. I mean, it's not like you decide that you decide to do them and a week later, you announce them. So there's always a lot of work in terms of due diligence and things like that, that are going on. But that is still the number one thing that we are utilizing, that we're looking for the utilization of cash on. Secondarily is, it would be yes, we are looking at that opportunistic share repurchases. And frankly, over the last few quarters, couple of years, the -- any kind of acceleration of debt paydown has really just not been high on that pecking order of best uses of cash. So it really does get down. But there are some interesting technologies out there. Ones that we're interested that would be great acquisitions, great partners, a whole range of things. And what makes it a little bit trickier is the -- sometimes is the, in the turbulence of today and what's going on, there's always -- bridging those valuation or even defining what is a good valuation sometimes is a very interesting challenge for all sides of the equation.","Jason Rogers","And could you provide an update on your CRM system? Where you are in the implementation of that?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, that's fully implemented. And in fact, in Q1, we brought Apache on relative to order processing and financials. So they are now fully integrated from a system perspective relative to sales forecasting and ordering and processing and financial segment.","James E. Cashman","The one thing we continue to do, this is an organic system. It continues to grow with the business. And as such, yes, every year, we're doing things to enhance it in terms of the tie-ins with marketing, the robustness of the forecasting mechanism, a range of different things and interconnectivity with some of our other infrastructural systems. So I mean, we'll continue. But in terms of, is everybody using it? Are we using it on all products? We continue to say at that point, we're able to quickly, as Maria mentioned, quickly do that even on recent acquisitions. So we've gotten to the point where it's a pretty vibrant standpoint. But just like we\u2019ve got really good software that we provide our customers but they're always asking for additional things, our internal groups here are going to be continuing to ask for additional things and we\u2019ll continue to progress that. But in terms of the breadth of its coverage and the uniformity of it, we're essentially there.","Maria T. Shields","And having look things behind.","James E. Cashman","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Barbara Coffey from Brigantine.","Barbara Coffey - Brigantine Advisors","Actually, I have 2 questions. Can you speak a bit about how you're continuing to penetrate some of your large accounts, and if possible, give a breakdown of how much revenue came from sort of existing accounts versus new accounts? And then, this is more a refresher for me because I just don't seem to have it anywhere in my notes. When you sign up people for the HPC-type programs, how are you charging and sort of what kind of adoption are you seeing off of HPC solutions relative to sort of revenue growth?","James E. Cashman","Yes, well so the -- let's see, the first part of that is the major accounts were -- first of all, we're growing in the existing divisions. We typically -- that's happening through increasing number of users and increasing the number of projects. So for instance, if a project was a midstream, they might not try to inject us but as that rolls off and it roll on new projects, that comes on. Secondarily, we've seen that then bridges over to sister divisions, and what it also tends to do is either sister design groups inside the same entity or these are multidisciplinary major account groups that are in like multiple industries, they will actually now start to spread that across different ones, whereupon we\u2019ll actually sometimes formalized the arrangement by which we actually meet and interact with them. And FMC, which was alluded to earlier by one of the questioners on this call is kind of a really nice example of how that happens. So it continues to grow along those lines. In general, the major account activities continue to grow, but none of our staff\u2019s along the #1 customer, the top customer, no one being more than 5%, the top 50 or so being just around that 20%. So it's in those ranges, none of those things have really changed. And I think the final thing you had was on the HPC. And I said the HPC gets -- I don't have a precise number for it but it gets -- it just get implemented at higher levels in the more mature accounts. So the major accounts tend to adopt it a little bit more, like I mentioned before. If you look at the additional incremental seats that come in, probably happens at about 2x, the rate of incremental individual seats that are coming in. So that kind of paints the overall canvas.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Maria, I noticed that the long-term deferred revenue stepped up quite significantly this quarter. Can you talk to why?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, it's largely Apache-related, Ross.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, but I guess the question will be then, Apache has been in for a couple of quarters now. Was there any change in kind of duration of billing or any sort of contractual changes there that would've driven that?","Maria T. Shields","Yes. Also, Ross, one thing that will factor into that is the write-down from the purchase accounting becomes smaller and smaller, so that will impact that number.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. So just to be clear then, most of that change sequentially in long-term deferred relates to the Apache business, not ANSYS core?","Maria T. Shields","Yes, the majority of it relates Apache.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I just had one other question on the Apache business. You comment that you're executing on the milestones to work towards the comprehensive chip package system offering. Can you just update us on kind of the timeframe and the kind of way should we think about having that comprehensive release in market? Is that something where we'll actually get to a point where we will have net new products in market, or is it just more kind of evolutionary and that won't be necessarily sort of net new product release, if you will, in that division [ph]?","James E. Cashman","I don't think -- if you think of net new, if you're mentioning net new product as a new module to attack this, no. Our physics are going to attack all of that. It's basically -- internally, we've outlined that probably about 3 1-year time frames that I think I mentioned earlier ones, looking at being able to take some of the signal integrity and work that with power integrity and working with our SI products in addition to some of the Sentinel and RedHawk products on theirs, and those are ones that -- so they actually do create an updraft by the virtue of being able to solve a broader range of problems that could be solved, but they are largely -- the integration is largely a problem that's solving connectivity. So in essence, we get kind of a life -- a form of multi-physics, multidisciplinary kind of simulations to solve new classes of problems that have been particularly vexing. And so you'll see that, as we come out with the 14.5 and version 15 over the next few months, you will actually see that level of capability being built in. But it's largely on the integration of the blending of the capabilities and allowing them to inter-operate through the Workbench platform.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Then maybe one other one for you, Jim. In the world of handsets, we have 2 particularly strong players. One here in the U.S. and one in South Korea. Does that sort of bifurcation between 2 very, very strong players have any implication, either in the supply chain or anywhere else for your Apache offering?","James E. Cashman","Well, there are some -- obviously, there are some links in the supply chain because you do then get to -- you look at the major impact of the various chip providers there and what's being pushed along those lines. But it's nothing that's changing the normal course of business because in general, we tend to have a lot of those situations where all of the major players, be they 2 or be they 5, are utilizing this. And this is one of the -- very often, you get down to the standpoint. This is kind of the classic example where 3%, 4%, 5% increased efficiency and things like that can actually have a major impact on their business. And so it's one of the things we're just kind of getting close enough and using engineering intuition, which is what some of the older generations of this technology does, really doesn't get them past some of the major, major design hurdles. So being able to kind of really get in there and look at those refined effects that allow them to get a better quality product or a better user experience is really what's driving those.","Operator","And at this time, in showing no additional questions, I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Cashman for any closing remarks.","James E. Cashman","Okay. So well, okay. So just in closing, the emphasis for Q2 and the remainder of 2012, it's just the continued growth, customer development. I mentioned about the improved sales execution, but like I say, we're right in the lines of our guidance. Q1 tracking along it. It\u2019s actually, like I said, strengthening and tightening the guidance for the full year. And again, if you look at that overall, we're encouraged, we're motivated by the positive customer receptivity to our long-term vision, and again, we continue to be propelled by the combination of that vision, but a business model that has continued to work. ","And again, I'll do my obligatory close with a shout out to the -- thanks to all the loyal customers, the partners we've had over the years, the people creating the great technology and this growing base of super employees that we have here, and that's really what allowed us to do what we've been doing and will propel us into the future. So thanks to everybody, and we'll see you next quarter on the next call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today's conference call. It has now concluded.

With us today are Ajei Gopal, Chief Executive Officer; Maria Shields, SVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Annette Arribas, Senior Director, Global Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Please note, the call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks.","Annette Arribas","Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks documents have been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results and business update, as well as our initial Q1 and fiscal year 2019 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum.","During this call, and in the prepared remarks, we'll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. Please take any reference to revenue to mean revenue under ASC 606 unless we explicitly note that we're referring to ASC 605 results. Note, that all references to growth will be in terms of ASC 605 results since we have no baseline for last year under ASC 606. A discussion of the various items that are excluded in a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures under both ASC 605 and ASC 606 are included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.","In closing, I'd like to announce that our 2019 Investor Day will be held on Thursday, September 12th in Pittsburgh with a reception and technology showcase event the evening before. Further details around location, logistics and the agenda will be announced in the very near future and will be available on our IR website.","I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?","Ajei Gopal","Thank you, Annette and good morning everyone. Q4 was yet another exceptional quarter for ANSYS. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Our ACV growth of 28% in constant currency was particularly notable because of the challenge in comparison with Q4 of 2017. For the year revenue grew by 11% and ACB grew 17%, both in constant currency. And we ended the year with a record $957 million in 605 deferred revenue and backlog which is a 24% increase over Q4 in 2017.","To summarize, our financial results in Q4 were outstanding and provided a great ending to a stellar 2018. At Investor Day in 2017, we announced that our objective was sustained double-digit growth by 2020 while maintaining industry leading margins. We introduced several strategic pillars to guide our journey to that objective. I'm pleased that we have made important advances across all these priorities over the course of the past year, and with double-digit revenue growth in both 2017 and 2018 I'm confident we're tracking to our 2020 objective. The central pillar of our growth strategy was the need to extend our leadership in the core business by introducing new innovations and by transforming our go-to-market.","Let me start with products. Building on the momentum from last year's 19.X [ph] series of releases, we launched ANSYS 2019 R1 earlier this month. R1 features innovation after innovation, including a new multi-body dynamics product line and intuitive user experience and fluent our flagship CFD solution, and electromagnetic interference scanner that delivers results in seconds as part of our industry-leading electronics solutions, a new heads-up display capability in SPEOS, our flagships optics solution, and multi-core platform support in SCADE, our embedded software solution. Each of these individual innovations is important in helping customers solve some of the most challenging problems. Taken together, however, they show that ANSYS is leading the industry with advanced multi-physics simulation capabilities.","We also recently launched a new ANSYS cloud-native solution enabled by Microsoft Azure that offers customers seamless access to on-demand high-performance computing in the public cloud. The offering is optimized for ANSYS solutions. Initially ANSYS mechanical and fluent, and dovetails nicely with offerings by ANSYS cloud hosting partners which include both ANSYS and third-party products. Based on the advances in our core products and the integration across our portfolio we continue to help customers address some of the most challenging problems where they are aggressively investing in R&D.","Today let me highlight some of our successes with autonomous systems. 3M has developed advanced materials that enable sensors to deliver additional information from enhanced infrastructure to advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS. ANSYS tools and services are opening the doors to new opportunities in the fast-changing automotive market by providing 3M credibility in demonstrating their sensor material performance under adverse weather and lighting conditions. This is another example of how ANSYS is helping a customer chase a multi-billion dollar market opportunity.","Another great example of our Integrated Solutions is with Oceaneering which is developing autonomous submersible vehicles for use with offshore oil rigs. They are using a multi-physics ANSYS solution to digitally test obstacle avoidance algorithms, a technique that could reduce cost by 90%, and that's critical when in-water tests can run upto $150,000 each day.","Moving to sales; you may recall that two years ago we had embarked on a transformation of our go-to-market strategy to allow us to maximize our market opportunity and to correct underperformance in key geographies, notably Europe. Our new go-to-market approach enables us to effectively grow and close large enterprise deals through the ANSYS direct sales team while simultaneously efficiently addressing the large volume of our transactional or momentum business through a combination of territory sales, channel partners, and inside sales. That strategy has unlocked new opportunities as you can see from our revenue and ACV growth numbers.","We saw strength in all of our geographies. While North America led the way with 19% constant currency growth, I'm delighted that Europe grew 10% in constant currency, both in Q4 and in 2018, continuing the growth recovery we had expected. On the large enterprise front, we began 2018 with a $50 million customer contract, at the time the largest in the history of ANSYS. And I'm thrilled to announce that we capped off the year with a Q4 $59 million contract across multiple product lines with a long-standing customer.","The second pillar of our growth strategy was selectively investing in high potential adjacencies to expand our addressable market. You may remember that simulation has traditionally been used primarily as a validation tool. As part of our vision pervasive simulation we're expanding the use of simulation upfront in the design process with Discovery Live during manufacturing with our additive manufacturing solutions and in operations with Twin Builder. 2019 will be a validation and building year for these offerings setting the stage for additional growth in 2020 and beyond. With it's real-time simulation capabilities, Discovery Live has captured the attention of design engineers across the globe.","One of the new users of Discovery Live, long-time ANSYS customer, Endress+Hauser, is seeing the benefits of simulation in product ideation. This global leader in measurement instrumentation, services and solutions for industrial process engineering is cutting costs and reducing time to market by bringing simulation earlier in the product development process with Discovery Live. To quote one of the company's engineers, \"With Discovery Live we are agile, we are fast, and we are efficient.\" Discovery has picked up more best new product awards than any other ANSYS solution in the last decade. And at the end of Q4, we signed our first 7-figure Discovery deal.","Another new solution, Twin Builder, enables our customers to build, validate and deploy simulation-based digital twins. The market for Twin Builder is enormous with half of the large industrial companies expected to deploy digital twins in the next three years, and we are seeing early traction in the market. The home appliance and an air solution division of the global giant LG is using Twin Builder to create virtual prototypes at the component level and share IoT information amongst products, supporting research to boost product reliability, reduce the time to market, decrease the need for physical testing, and improved product development.","The next pillar of our growth strategy was pursuing strategic partnerships and acquisitions. On the partnership side, last week PTC released Creo simulation live which embeds ANSYS Discovery technology into Creo. With PTC's market leadership, this partnership grows the ANSYS reach to a new and broader base of design engineers around the world. While it is too soon to evaluate market success, early indications are positive. During it's most recent earnings call, PTC reported that it already had orders from 20 customers following it's December preview release, as well as more than 160 customers in it's short-term pipeline.","M&A continues to be a highlight for us. As you know, ANSYS has a long history of successful M&A where we acquire companies with leading technologies, invest in both, innovation and integration with a broader ANSYS portfolio, and take advantage of the vast ANSYS customer footprint to increase customer adoption and sales, and drive growth for ANSYS. We're following that same playbook with our two most recent acquisitions, both of which closed earlier this month. The first is Granta Design, the pioneer of material intelligence and information technology. With the variety of materials available to product developers today having accurate, traceable and reliable materials information is increasingly critical to simulation accuracy.","Granta has proven world-class technology that has enjoyed success in some of the largest and most sophisticated companies. Rolls Royce for example, used Granta to save $10 million through reduced testing, legacy data capture, and other cost avoidance. And although we share a few customers with Granta including Lockheed Martin, Saudi Aramco, and Airbus; their distribution was limited because of their size. Now as part of ANSYS, with our ability to reach customers in all geographies, there are many new opportunities to drive growth by introducing the Granta material solution to a much larger customer base.","We also closed a smaller acquisition, HELOC, which builds great technology to analyze and mitigate the risk of electromagnetic crosstalk for semiconductor designs. This is particularly relevant because mega-trends like 5G and Artificial Intelligence are driving the need for extensive on-chip electromagnetic analysis to combat electromagnetic noise. HELOC solutions when combined with ANSYS power artist, our power integrity and noise analysis technology, as well as our market-leading electromagnetic solvers will help engineers deliver on the promise of next-generation solutions.","Our 2019 strategy for growth remains the same as last year. We'll continue to grow our core, expand into the adjacencies we've selected, drive partnerships and pursue appropriate M&A. With this strategy in place I'm excited that our guidance for 2019 is 12% constant currency ASC 606 revenue growth at the midpoint for the full year. This is an ambitious growth objective, especially in the light of our stellar performance in 2018, and it is a testament to the strength of the ANSYS franchise.","I want to take a minute to talk about corporate commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives. Last month, we were named to the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations by Corporate Nights, a firm solely focused on tracking and ranking companies as committed to sustainability. This is a powerful recognition of our company and our employees.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Maria.","Maria Shields","Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ajei, by any financial measure we delivered another quarter and year of exceptional results. This is quite an accomplishment when you consider the strong comparable of both, Q4 and 2017. I'll take a few minutes to add some additional commentary around our fourth quarter and annual financial performance, and we'll close with an update on our outlook and key assumptions for Q1 and 2019.","Throughout 2018, we have been providing financial results and outlook under both, ASC 605 and ASC 606. Consistent with our messaging throughout the past year, beginning in 2019, we will transition to only reporting our financial results under ASC 606. For purposes of today's commentary, any comparisons that I make relative to growth rates will be comparing 2018 to 2017 results under ASC 605, and in constant currency. And for the last time, I'll provide key financial metrics under both ASC 605 and ASC 606, and consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise.","We would also like to announce that we will be removing the statistics on cumulative orders above $1 million in our future communications. While this metric was relevant when we first introduced it over a decade ago, the $1 million threshold is arbitrary, and has become less meaningful over the past two years as the company has begun to experience higher deal values with transactions increasingly incorporating multi-physics. It gives equal weight to both, the $59 million transaction that Ajei previously mentioned, and to a transaction that may be less than 2% of that value, which we believe is not useful in evaluating our performance.","As we move forward, we believe the best indicator of our go-to market and large deal progress is the overall ACB growth across the full calendar year. I do want to mention that we closed the fourth quarter with 68 customers that had orders over $1 million, a 39% year-over-year increase and four customers that had orders of over $10 million. Our Q4 results reflect a great finish to our strongest year ever, one in which we experience continued accelerated business momentum and execution across the company. We reported constant currency revenue growth of 14% for the quarter, and 11% for the year, and EPS results that we're above the high-end of our guidance under both, ASC 606 and ASC 605.","Our ongoing record of execution throughout every quarter of 2018 gives us confidence that we are on a path to continue to make progress against our strategic priorities and to deliver another record year of financial results in 2019. Other key financial metrics that I would like to highlight begin with Q4 and fiscal year 2018 constant currency ACB growth of 28% and 17% respectively.","For the year, we reported total revenue of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion under ASC 605 and ASC 606 respectively. Fourth quarter revenue under ASC 605 and ASC 606 total $340 million and $418 million with the large disparity between the two coming primarily from the upfront recognition of the license component of leases under ASC 606. As mentioned earlier, the strong fourth quarter results included a $59 million 4-year deal, the largest in our history. This deal which was not included in our guidance was a principal driver of the overachievement in our Q4 ASC 606 results on both, the top and bottom line. It also illustrates the increased volatility that results from the upfront recognition of the entire license component of multi-year lease transactions.","And further, the earnings volatility is even more pronounced because the additional upfront revenue comes with minimal variable cost. The inclusion of this deal in our 2018 results also adversely impacts our fiscal year 2019 growth rates by approximately 1% for ACB, 2% for revenue, and 5% for diluted EPS. The increase in software license sales combined with strong maintenance renewals contributed to our deferred revenue and backlog under ASC 605 of $957 million, representing a new record Q4 high and a 24% increase over last year's very strong comparable. Deferred revenue and backlog under ASC 606 totals $659 million.","Total recurring revenue for the quarter and the year under 605 grew 16% and 12% in constant currency to totals of $245million and $933 million or 72% and 76% of total revenue, respectively. Lease and maintenance revenue, each grew double digits for the quarter and the year indicative of strong renewals and expansions within our global customer base as well as the value that our customers place on the ongoing investment in innovation and the high quality of our support services. This increase in our recurring revenue streams in Q4 and 2018 was relatively balanced across each of our three major geographies each of which delivered double digit constant currency growth in recurring revenue. Under ASC 606, recurring revenue totaled $305 million for Q4 and $962 million for the year or 73% and 74% of total revenue, respectively.","Our strong and growing base of recurring revenue improves the predictability around our future performance. The operating margins under ASC 605 were 40.5% for the quarter and 44.4% for the full year. The lower fourth quarter margin is consistent with our recent financial guidance and reflects the significant incremental sales commissions that typically occur in the fourth quarter as high achieving sales personnel hit their commission accelerators. The full year margin is also consistent with the expectations that we set at the beginning of 2018 and maintained throughout the year. The operating margins under 606 were 51.6 % for the quarter and 47.4% for the year. Both results exceeded our expectations and were driven primarily by the revenue over performance under ASC 606. both sets of results are evidence that we are committed to managing our business with discipline and to ensuring that the incremental investments are driving the annual ACV and top line growth that we have planned. ","We reported fourth quarter EPS of a $1.39 under ASC 605, a 30% growth over last Q4. And $2.13 under ASC 606 and for the year, we also finished with record EPS of $5.30 under ASC 605, a 32% growth over fiscal year 2017 and $5.98 under ASC 606. The overperformance on EPS in the quarter was driven by the very strong top line finish. With respect to taxes, under both standards, our effective tax rate was approximately 18% for the year and 17% to 18% for the fourth quarter.","Looking ahead into 2019, we currently expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% for Q1 and the full year. And for 2019, we have assumed a slightly higher mix of income in foreign jurisdictions which have a higher tax rate as compared to the US. Our cash flow from operations totaled $133 million for the fourth quarter and $486 million for the year. We closed the year with a total of $777 million in cash and short term investments of which 79% was held domestically. And while we are discussing our cash balance, I wanted to also note that we just closed a 5-year $500 million revolving line of credit while the line of credit is new for ANSYS and is not for any imminent need but simply intended to give us additional capital flexibility as we continue to grow the business.","Also, in line with our previously communicated capital allocation priorities, we repurchased $500,000 shares during the quarter and $1.7 million shares during 2018 at a total cost of $77 and $270 million respectively. Currently, we have $3.8 million shares available for repurchase. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We are initiating our guidance for Q1 and expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $290 million to $310 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.98 to a $1.11. And for fiscal year 2019, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1 billion $410 million $1 billion $470 million or constant currency growth of 10% to 14% and EPS in the range of $5.55 to $6.","Our 2019 outlook includes the contributions from the recently acquired Granta Design and HELOC businesses. We are currently forecasting a range of $20 million to $25 million of revenue and ACV for 2019. the combined impact of the capital utilized in the acquisitions and the incremental integration investments that will be necessary throughout the remainder of the year will result in the near term impact of approximately $0.05 to $0.07 of dilution for 2019 as we integrate these acquisitions into our core business. Our ACV outlook for 2019 is a range of $100410 million to $100465 million; this represents constant currency ACV growth of 8% to 12%.","Our initial outlook for annual operating cash flows is a range of $470 million $510 million for 2019. I would like to highlight that our outlook for 2019 include tire tax payments that relate to the accelerated lease license revenue and related profitability that incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 under ASC 606 as well as the expected adverse first year impact of the acquisitions. For modeling purposes, we're expecting first quarter operating margins in the range of 36.5% to 38.5% and for fiscal year 2019, in the range of 43% to 44%. The recently announced acquisitions of Granta Design and HELOC are expected to adversely impact our operating margin by approximately 1% in 2019.","As we head into 2019, I would like to again remind everyone that our focus will be on progress against annual targets as opposed to quarterly results simply due to the volatility in quarterly revenue operating margin and EPS that result from the timing of large lease transactions under ASC 606. As we saw in our 2018 results, our Q4 business volume with 28% constant currency ACV growth continues to grow seasonally stronger. It is by far our largest quarter for new business particularly for large multi-year deals. As we look ahead to 2019 we see a very similar seasonal pattern with a disproportionately large Q4 dynamic. Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for both Q1 and 2019 are contained in the prepared remarks document.","In summary, we are very pleased to have delivered another excellent quarter and year with strength across all of our key financial metrics. We also continue to deploy capital to drive long term stockholder value for investing in our core business, pursuing important M&A targets and additional share repurchases. our strong close to another year gives us confidence that our continued focus on execution and investing in the business, both organically and through M&A supplemented by our growing base of recurring business, strong customer relationships and a healthy sales pipeline, provide a solid foundation to deliver on another strong year in 2019 as well as our 2020 financial targets.","Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Richard Valera of Needham & Co.","Richard Valera","Thank you and congratulation on the strong results. I just wanted to hone in on Discovery Live here Ajei and get your sense on the potential impact, both in '19 and beyond. It sounds like some promising initial returns from the PTC agreement, as well as some sort of organically. So if you could just frame that out for us in terms of maybe what you've baked in for '19 and how you think about that longer term? Thank you.","Ajei Gopal","As far as Discovery is concerned, as I've said in my comments, we're very excited about what we have in terms of the technology and obviously we're taking it to market, both, directly through our sales force, as well as in conjunction with the OEM that we have with PTC. PTC recently announced it's new product, it was announced last week there was a webcast -- webinar yesterday I think that 2,000 customers or 2,000 individuals had signed up for that webinar as well. So there is obviously a lot of excitement in the PTC customer base as well for that. So we're very excited about it, we see 2019 as essentially a validation year; we don't really see this as being a big revenue here yet, this is not -- this is still early stages for a product which I think is transformative whether the fact is in our market it takes a while for product to get to gain momentum. So we see this as a building year and we'll continue to come out with new versions of the technology, PTC will continue to improve their product with the integration of our technology into it. We'll learn this year and I'm looking forward really next year to seeing some more tangible results from a revenue perspective.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities.","Kenneth Wong","This question may be geared towards Maria; when looking at your margin outlook of 43% to 44%, obviously that's consistent with how you guys have been framing, kind of where the margins could go with your investments in double-digit growth. But obviously it's a step down from what we saw in fiscal year '18; can you maybe just talk about kind of where some of those investments are coming and maybe some of the headwinds on the margins for '19?","Maria Shields","Yes. Ken, I'd say the biggest headwinds on the margins are for the dilutive impact from the two acquisitions that Ajei spoke to in his remarks. As you can imagine, most of the acquisitions that we're looking at -- particularly, the smaller tuck-in have no margin structure that's near ours [ph], so -- but there are important technologies that advance our roadmap and extend our multi-physics capabilities. So we will be making some investments relative to integrating those two acquisitions, and as a result of the capital deployed, as well as those integration investments, we'll have dilution in 2019 and we'll see them becoming more creative to profitability as we head into 2020. Additionally, from the core business we are continuing to invest in the business, and in talent, R&D, AEs [ph], field engineers, and infrastructure to continue to be able to scale the business over the long-term.","Operator","The next question comes from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","I would just like to focus a bit on the very, very large deals -- I don't know if we can call them mega deals. In terms of the fact that 2018 was kind of a breakthrough year for you, may be after the number of those have come through now; can you talk a bit about the predictability and the nature of those deals that you're seeing in terms maybe of the sales cycle compared to what the usual deal -- kind of large deal previously would take and how much effort it takes? I hope that makes sense.","Ajei Gopal","A couple of quick comments about large deals. Firstly, large deals don't just happen by themselves, they happen as a result of a long-term relationship between us as a company and the customer, and that's a relationship that takes years to develop, and it's a relationship that we pride ourselves on and we maintain because of the levels of investments we're making both in our product, as well as in our technical capability with customers; and so that's one important aspect of those relationships. And as the $59 million deal that we talked about is from a long-standing customer of ours, as an example. And the second thing is what we're seeing is many of these large deals are obviously not just single product deals, these are -- these pull together multiple products from multiple product lines, and so they are essentially multi-physics deals. And that's really important for us because when we think about the direction where some of these large companies are going, they are looking at more challenging problems, they are looking at more, they are looking at solutions which require necessarily this multi-physics analysis [indiscernible]; and so that's another element as well of some of these large deals.","And so when you think about the pipeline that we're seeing for this year for some of the larger deals, we're kind of backend focused -- we're backend loaded this year, so a lot of activity is happening in the latter part of the year, Q4 is obviously going to be a heavier quarter much like Q4 in 2018 was a heavier quarter, and that's also part of the way that we're thinking about the year. So we have visibility into the pipeline, we have been developing these deals and these relationships with customers, and as I said, the relationships take years to develop, and this is part of the cadence that we're building into our business as we go forward understanding how to manage these large deals, to understand what they look like in the pipeline, make sure that we can bring the relevant sets of solution to bear with both, our sales organization or the technical organization, and then slotted-in [ph] from an execution perspective.","Operator","The next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","In your prepared remarks you talked about some of the cross-talking semiconductor design; I'm kind of curious as you look at 2019, how much of the growth dynamics are you expecting to come from more of your EDA portfolio versus the rest of the portfolio? And then, Maria, just to sneak in; can you give us a sense, what did 2018 acquisitions actually contribute to the 2018 full year ACV?","Ajei Gopal","So let me address very quickly the opportunity in '19. Obviously electronics, in general, is very strong for us. We have solutions that help us, both, in the traditional EDA market, as well as in the broader high-tech market. And frankly, we see tremendous opportunity in 2019 and beyond, and it's obviously being fueled by the complexity of semiconductors that are rolling into solutions for autonomous and for 5G, for AI, cloud computing; all of these things are demanding more and more complexity for semiconductors, obviously that's driving process nodes -- customers with advanced process notes. But from our perspective, that also pulls in need to be able to do multi-physics analysis, and it's not uniquely about looking at one individual physics, it's understanding the implications at the chip level, at the board level, at the system level, and that requires necessarily an understanding of across all of the different physics as we've discussed in the past. And so I think that's going to be very important certainly as we see the use of semiconductors in these next-generation applications. Maria?","Maria Shields","Yes. Sterling, relative to the contribution to ACV in 2018, from the acquisition it was $25 million.","Operator","The next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays.","Saket Kalia","Maybe for you Maria; on the large $59 million lease deal in the quarter, can you remind us how the cash collections on that multi-year deal will work?","Maria Shields","Yes. So Saket, as you saw in the materials, it's a 4-year deal with annual payments and that first payment will come into 2019.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities.","Steve Koenig","I'd like to maybe dig into your -- what you're doing in cloud here. And so, Ajei you mentioned you've got a new cloud native solution or Azure. Maybe just -- can you backup a little bit and remind us what -- how are you currently going to market your hosting partners? And then, what's different about the new Azure solution that you're offering, relative to either product or pricing model? And just remind us are the hosting partners of that BYO [ph] -- by BYOL [ph] model for them and then customers rent or -- so just kind of refresh me on how you're going to market in cloud and how the new offering might be different here?","Ajei Gopal","So, we currently go-to-market as you said, you rightly pointed out with the network of cloud-hosting partners who are essentially around the globe, and they provide turnkey access to the ANSYS portfolio. So our cloud-hosting partners take advantage of whatever public carve [ph] infrastructure they choose to use. The customer works with them and they are able to work with both, ANSYS technology, as well as third-party technology and offer that as a -- essentially as a cloud solution. So they serve as the cloud partner, if you will, for the customer and the customer directly works with them. And that's a great partnership with us and the cloud-hosting partners that's been working very well. What we've done with the ANSYS cloud is, we've taken a slightly different approach; and here now within -- directly within our flagship products initially with fluent in mechanical, you can directly access the HPC capabilities in the cloud, in this case, the [indiscernible] cloud. And so it's completely seamless, it's completely built into the UI, and you have an option, when you're using the product to then choose to use the public cloud which essentially provides seamless HPC for our customers.","And obviously that provides -- that makes the cloud a little bit more accessible, it provides convenience because customers or engineers can -- without having to leave the environment that they work in every day, they can enlift this additional compute power without even being an expert in HPC, and obviously this makes HPC easier to use and we're excited about that. And in the coming months we'll be adding more services and capabilities to the ANSYS cloud. It dovetails nicely with what our public -- with our cloud hosting partners, what they provide, and we're excited about providing our customers the choice of how they want to take advantage of the public cloud.","Operator","The next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs.","Gabriela Borges","Ajei, I wanted to ask about the dynamic at your Top 100 customers. As ANSYS dedicated more technical resources to those customers, we've actually grown as a percentage of sales. How do you think about how penetrated you are at your largest customers? And as part of that, any metrics you can share on multi-physics penetration and adoptions would be helpful. Thank you.","Ajei Gopal","Sure. As you well know that these larger deals as I mentioned, already -- these larger deals do include multi-physics deployments or multi-physics -- I mean the multi-physics in nature. I would say that for our largest 100 customers, most of them probably have three or more products from three or more physics if you will, installed; and I'm taking advantage of them. So I would say that it's a pretty broad penetration of multi-physics into the largest 100 customers. That being said, I think that the market for simulation is still -- it's still early stages because when you think about where the use of simulation is even at the very large customers, there is plenty of opportunity to continue to increase the use of simulation. In our strategy for simulation and the use of simulation is to make it more pervasive. Historically, it's obviously been used in the validation phase and even there I think we're under-penetrated but if you start to think about the opportunity going upstream to the designers and then downstream into manufacturing and operations, I think we have a significant opportunity.","And we're seeing that because with some of these larger deals, yes, there is improved sales execution, obviously there is improved sales execution but it's also the case that the customers need the technology, right; no one would be buying things if they didn't need it. The customers need the technology because we're able to demonstrate the value of the technology in different used cases, and to addressing different customer needs, and that's translating into greater demand for our offerings. And so you see with these large deals; these are customers we've had for a number of years and then we continue to expand the footprint and the penetration into those organizations and I don't believe that we're reaching an asymptote [ph] or anything of that nature. So we're excited about our future, we're excited about the opportunity in front of us.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI.","Kenneth Talanian","I was wondering if you could give us a recap of the changes you made to both, the sales force and the channel this year and your plans for 2019?","Ajei Gopal","Sure. I think the further importance and I couldn't tell you exactly what was happening in 2017 versus 2018, but essentially what we did is -- did a pretty deep segmentation of our customers and separated them into different categories if you will. There is a segment of our customer base where we directly address the customer through the ANSYS direct sales force, and these tend to be the largest of customers. And typically, you'll have an account manager looking after a small number of one customer with technical support, and this is where a lot of the large deals come from. We also have what we call -- we also have territory sales individuals who are not focused on the largest accounts and we have what we call a momentum sales motion or which is more transactional in nature. And these are the next-generation or the next level if you will of customers where the coverage is less, it's not so much one-to-one, it's less, single sales individual may cover several different accounts or we would have channel partners who are then working with us to also cover accounts.","And so through the combination of channel partners and territory sales we're able to cover some of these accounts. We also have invested in inside sales, and our inside sales activities is doing well, and we're able to then not just create inside demand, it's not just an organization to set up meetings but we have an organization that can actually close business telephonically through our inside sales organization. Obviously, that is -- those tend to be smaller deals but some of them are very nice deals as well. And so that combination of being able to go direct to larger organizations with more focus, being able to manage the territories effectively, and leveraging the channel partners and leveraging inside sales to be able to scale the transactional aspects of a business is really what's been contributing to our success on both fronts, on the large enterprise side, as well as on the smaller enterprise side.","As we look, as we go forward into 2019; the challenges for the sales organization obviously are -- we have two new acquisitions in the form of Granta and HELOC, we're integrating them into the sales organization into a better market motion, that technology will be available to obviously our direct sales people, as well as to our channel partners to be in a position to take to market; so we're excited about that work, and that means integrating the technical sales organization as well, as well as teaching our sales organization. Outside of that, the same structure that I described namely going after large enterprise customers being able to manage the momentum accounts that remains in place as we think about our business in 2019.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Pfau of William Blair.","Matthew Pfau","Just wanted to ask on Discovery Live; maybe you could talk about the initial traction you're seeing; is it different users than you would typically see using ANSYS? And then the funding for these deals, is it coming from different budgets would typically be used to purchase ANSYS? Thanks.","Ajei Gopal","Our approach for Discovery has been two-fold; one is that we think that it could be customers -- we've historically had larger customers who are taking advantage of Discovery; although it may be -- excuse me, it may be a different user base within that large customer. So it may be a different cadre of users who have not historically used the ANSYS flagship solutions but who do -- who could benefit from the use of simulation. So even though it would be the same large customer, it would be a different user within that. And we're seeing that certainly within our own go-to-market with Discovery but we're also seeing that as you think about some of the conversations we've been having with our colleagues at PTC in terms of how they're thinking about positioning Creo Live as well.","And then the other area that we think that we will be able to bring in customers is customers have historically not necessarily been ANSYS users who tend to -- who are smaller, haven't found -- haven't felt that they could manage to use of simulation even though they would benefit from that, and we believe that there is an opportunity there as well. And that's -- I would say that that's harder for us to quantify right now but that's also an opportunity that we are excited about.","Operator","The next question comes from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan","So when I look at '18 I think your organic constant currency ACV growth was about 14%, and even if we take out the large deal in Q4 I think it would be 12%. And then when I look at '19, it's on a constant currency organic basis, in the kind of 7% to 8% range; so a big sort of step down. And I just wanted to know if that's just elements of prudence or are there any other things that you're thinking about that would create that deceleration? And maybe related to all of this is just -- can we just touch on the philosophy on these large multi-year transactions; you said the one in Q4 was not in the guidance, does that imply that you are excluding deals like this from your future guidance? Thanks so much.","Maria Shields","Ross, relative to our outlook for 2019 I would say we have forecasted based on our visibility in the pipeline as it exists. And no doubt we are going to be a little bit prudent as it's just the beginning of the year. And similar to what we experienced in 2018, given that the majority of those large transactions are currently forecasted for Q4, we want to build in a little bit of conservatism if you will. That being said, relative to that $59 million deal in particular, we did not include it in our guidance because at the time that we gave our outlook back in November there were still a number of moving parts relative to that deal, including some competitive dynamics that quite frankly could have easily made that a Q1 deal. And given the size of it, particularly, the impact under ASC 606 with $30 million of revenue and $0.28 of earnings, to the extent that it had closed in Q1 it would have just left too big a gap; so the downside risk was not worth trying to be aggressive on forecasting that deal.","The reality is we're still in the learning stages relative to the particular predictability of these. And as it becomes more and more of an ongoing part of our business and we learn more about exactly different personalities that have different perspective on closing, we'll get better at it but for now we are going to build a little bit of caution into -- to our outlook so that we don't have any downside surprises.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Could you comment Maria on your expectation for expense growth in 2019? You grew your headcount by about 500 for the year versus a prior -- many year average of just about 100 or so increase in head account per year, so pretty considerable difference there. And relatively for Ajei, having spent the last 6 to 8 quarters on your go-to-market and AE [ph] investments; could you talk about the relative investments or initiatives on those two things for the next year or more as compared to the past year or two? And the preparations you need to make or investing in vis-\u00e0-vis infrastructure acquisitions integration, data centers and the like to prepare for future growth? Thank you.","Maria Shields","Yes. So Jay, let me take your first question relative to our plans, relative to investing. Our 2019 plans currently anticipate adding about 300 new employees to the organization throughout 2019. As of the end of January, we've got about 176 positions open for hire across the globe. Other things that I spoke to earlier, we will be absorbing the two recent acquisitions which will require some additional integration cost in 2019. And then as you just heard -- as you just mentioned, we do have a number of infrastructure investments, not necessarily data centers, certainly some of our own HPC capacity, internally, but most of our investments around talent and additional costs that come with talent relative to licensing around digital technology that they're leveraging, and we're also investing in our own digital technology to really be able to automate and scale our processes consistently across the globe.","Ajei Gopal","And I think Jay the other part of your question was around our investments in our technical capability -- customer-facing capability, our ACE organization. And yes, it continues to be an area that we are making investments, and you'll see that if you look at our -- go online and look at the kinds of people that we're looking to hire, and we're making investments in our ACE organization, essentially across the product portfolio across the world. Obviously, we've got some new talent coming in through the acquisitions of Grant [ph] and HELOC, and those individuals will obviously join the company and will be central of course as we start to expand in those areas as well. So there will be expansion in our ACE capabilities in 2090.","Operator","The next question comes from Monika Garg of KeyBanc.","Monika Garg","The question for you Maria; you have the questions like you are guiding cash flow flattish year-over-year, maybe add some color around that. I mean, you did talk about it could be slightly higher taxes; would you quantify that number, how much increase you are making in for year-over-year? Thank you.","Maria Shields","Monika, so I'd say, as you think about cash flow for 2019, there is a few headwinds that we're facing in addition to the additional taxes from the ASC 606 format. We've also got a headwind of about 1% to 2% from currency, and the two acquisitions that we did are expected to be dilutive to cash flow in 2019. If you think about relative to quantification of the tax impact, our tax rate in 2018 was about 18% for the full year, and we're guiding to 21% to 22% for 2019, so that's really kind of the differential in tax payments relative to ASC 606 as we had into 2019.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Lemenager of Robert W. Baird & Company.","Matt Lemenager","Thanks, it's Matt on for Rob [ph]. Thanks for taking the question. I have a question around North America; it's now grown 13% or faster, I think 6 of the past 8 quarters. Ajei, is there anything in particular driving that, simply sharper execution or anything standing out direct versus indirect, anything that's kind of driving that?","Ajei Gopal","No, I think there is obviously a great execution in North America and there has been a lot of large deals, activity as well as that we've mailed to drive from North America. And I think to a certain extent the -- just given the nature of some of these large deals, these tend to be long-term customers, have historically been with us for a long time; that's been -- we've been able to build on that given the way the North America team has been laid out. But no, I think from a market demand perspective and what customers are looking for, it's kind of -- you would expect the same sort of thing from customers whether they are based headquartered in North America, whether they are headquartered in Europe or whether they are headquarter in Asia. And I think that the execution aspects of the North America business has also been very strong.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks.","Ajei Gopal","Thank you, Andrew. So 2018 was another outstanding year for ANSYS with strength across all of our key financial metrics. We improved our go-to-market execution and we broadened our product capabilities. These important accomplishments continue to move the business in the right direction and give us confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. We look forward to another exciting year-end 2019. In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners for their support, and a shout out to my ANSYS colleagues, thank you all for your efforts and thank you for another exceptional quarter, and an exceptional year. Thank you all for joining the call today, and I look forward to our next call. Enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to ANSYS' Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call. With us today are Mr. Jim Cashman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Maria Shields, Chief Financial Officer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Cashman for some opening remarks.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, good morning, and thanks to everybody for joining us to discuss our second quarter and first half 2015 financial results. But before we get started, I will introduce Maria Shields, our CFO, for our Safe Harbor statement. Maria?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks documents have all been posted on our homepage at the Investor Relations website this morning, and they contain all of the key financial information and the supporting data relative to Q2 and the first half 2015 financial results and the business update, as well as our current Q3 and fiscal year 2016 outlook and our key underlying assumptions.","I'd also like to remind anyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today. And ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum.","During the course of this call and throughout the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.","So, Jim, I'll now turn it back to you.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Maria. So, I'd like to start with a recap of the results that the ANSYS team achieved in Q2. So, as you may recall from our Q1 earnings call and from our Investor Day in early June, we laid out a number of key financial objectives for Q2. These included, let's see, achieving non-GAAP revenue growth of 7% to 10% in constant currency, achieving strong margins and earnings per share, high rates of recurring revenue, continued growth in both deferred and backlog, and improvement in our European business. And I'm glad to say that we did in fact deliver on every one of those goals and at high levels in the second quarter.","So, first our non-GAAP revenue for the quarter in constant currency was 9%. This was led by solid sales execution in North America and Asia Pac, which both reported double digit in constant currency. We also made progress in our restructuring efforts in Europe where we realized improvement from our Q1 results with 7% constant currency overall and 11% growth in Germany. Eastern Europe and Russia remained the softer parts of Europe for us. Growth came from a broad base of industries and these are all highlighted in more detail within this quarter's prepared remarks on our website.","Non-GAAP EPS in Q2 was $0.85 above the high end of our guidance range. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 47% above the 45% to 46% projected margin. This is a result of previously announced cost of the organizational changes being at the lower end of what we expected as well as ongoing spending disciplines that we always engage.","Our recurring revenue for the quarter was 71% and our deferred revenue and backlog as of June 30 was $474 million. Yes. Overall, the second quarter results reflect a combination of improved execution in targeted areas of our business, the continuation of softness in certain markets and parts of the channel, in addition to, of course, the various ongoing geopolitical tensions that we highlighted last quarter.","So, now, I'd like to actually take a little chance to talk about the latest groundbreaking, you guys call it, version of our software, ANSYS 16.1, which we released in May and included the launch of our new ANSYS Enterprise Cloud solution. This is an area, where we continue to accelerate our investment to further develop these offerings, in line with our customers' adoption patterns and extend our competitive advantages.","Now, the ANSYS Enterprise Cloud solution, it's been specifically architected to actually remove previous barriers to adoption of cloud computing for engineering simulation. It's first of all, it's delivered in a single-tenant environment that secures customer data. Large data streams do not need to be transmitted between end users and the cloud data center. The solution also supports 3D interactive graphics and auto-scaling of high performance computing.","So, basically, with ANSYS Enterprise Cloud, more engineers can access the software and hardware, exercise those tools that they need from any desktop or handheld device. And, basically, is a step toward enabling broader adoption of simulation technologies and helping organizations stay competitive while also focusing on their core competencies, which is usually developing products and not maintaining large data centers.","ANSYS Enterprise Cloud, it also enables our customers to utilize the scale of processors that they need, but only when they need them. So, they avoid some of the costly investment in underutilized server, security and maintenance, and certain things that were tending to slow down some of the adoption.","We also completed the acquisition of Gear Design on July 1. This was an acquisition that we targeted for two key reasons: first and foremost, the unique talent and leadership skills that the Gear team adds to ANSYS which will be immediately combined with our existing Apache business; and secondly, the technology that Gear has developed which is a purpose-built big data platform to solve problems confronting next-generation semiconductor and electronic design systems. So, what we've seen is on time and on schedule, robust, low power, high-performance devices. It's critical to a wide range of areas. It's critical to the success of mobile, high-performance computing, automotive and also Internet of Things, electronic platforms.","So, similar to the other acquisitions that we've done in the past, this will enable us to leverage the power of combining ANSYS' proven technologies for low-power designs and Gear's big data analytics. So, ultimately this will provide our semiconductor and electronic system customers with a best-in-class simulation platform that provides both measurement-validated accuracy for design signoff and accelerated closure of early design decisions. And it will also continue to extend our leadership in what we feel is a very important and growing market.","During the second quarter, we continued to see progress from a number of changes and investments that we made throughout 2014 and earlier this year. And I'll tell you our plan is to continue to focus and invest our energy and resources toward achieving strong results in the second half of 2015.","So, you may recall at Investor Day this year, we outlined the significant growth opportunities available to us across what we normally categorize in three major dimensions: first, increasing the number of users; second, increasing the density of usage; third of all, increasing the intensity of usage. Well, ANSYS 16.0 and 16.1 include significant advancements in our platform. And these releases, we think, substantially broaden the capabilities available to our customers. They break down the barriers to adoption, and they help us drive growth from all of these dimensions.","So, even though we already have the deepest and broadest physics portfolio, we're committed to continuing to make significant investments in R&D to further increase our technological and competitive leadership advantages and to strengthen our position at the forefront of the industry.","So, with those brief comments, I'll turn it back over to Maria to discuss our Q3 and 2015 guidance before we move into the Q&A session.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Okay. As we outlined in this morning's press release, we've initiated our outlook for Q3 with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $232 million to $240 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.89. With respect to our previous guidance for the full year of 2015, while we've narrowed the revenue range, the midpoint of our revenue guidance for the full year remains essentially unchanged from our last call. And we've also factored in a slightly higher tax rate, further weakening of the Japanese yen since our last call and the acquisition of Gear. So, all of that translates to our revised outlook for the full year in non-GAAP revenue in the range of $948 million to $964 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $3.37 to $3.45.","And for 2015, we are assuming no significant changes, either way, in the overall macro climate. And we also continue to see that our sales will ramp up later in the year as the new heads that we've brought on in Q4 of 2014 and the first half of the year begin producing, and as the channel initiatives that we've also announced also drive incremental sales.","Further details around currency rates and other key assumptions that have been factored into the outlook for both Q3 and the full year are contained in prepared remarks that we posted on the homepage earlier this morning. Also during the second quarter, we repurchased about 36,000 shares at an average price of slightly north of $85.","And for the first half of the year, we've repurchased over 1.5 million shares at an average price of $83.42. As of the end of June, we still have 4.4 million shares remaining in our authorized repurchase pool. So, in addition to our ongoing M&A activities and consistent with what we've previously communicated earlier in this year, it's our intention to continue to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program.","So, with that, Operator, we'll now open up the phone line to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Jim and Maria. I'd like to ask first about the results you've seen in your various end markets and your expectations for those. When we take the percentages of revenue by end market that you've provided now for the second quarter, we see, for example, that automotive appears to have been down slightly year-over-year for the quarter, about flat for the trailing 12 months. Aero and defense seems to have been down pretty materially year-over-year for the quarter and for the trailing 12 months. On the other hand, you did quite well it seems in industrial equipment, up pretty strongly for the quarter and for the trailing 12 months. And semis were up again pretty strongly which I assume is still Apache.","So, perhaps, you could talk about the varying trend that you are in fact seeing in those markets. And do you foresee for example that either auto or aero and defense might begin to rebound after having some negative comps here lately?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yeah. Jay, I would say relative to auto and aero and defense, I think some of what you're seeing ties into the timing of some of those deals and renewals. So, I wouldn't focus on any given quarter as much as I would focus on the full year. I would say no doubt one of the areas where we definitely felt pain is in the oil and gas sector, not only in North America but in other geographies where oil and gas displayed an important part. But I don't know of any, I would say, trends that we're aware of. I think it's more around the timing of some of these larger deals in those sectors that you spoke of.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. Secondly, could you comment on the likely direction of your operating expenses for the remainder of the year and perhaps into next year? When you look at your website, we see and count the number of job openings that you're advertising. There was a pretty significant increase from the last time we did that a couple of months ago. In fact, it looks like the largest number of openings for the last few years since we began tracking this with increases in sales openings which is fairly consistent with your plan. R&D, up a lot, particularly in places like India. So, I guess my question is are you perhaps over advertising the number of openings that you're looking to fill as you've sometimes done in the past or do you think you're about to embark on, in fact, some significant additions here to head count?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well we, you see the ramp-up of \u2013 in the last half of the year, I mean, we started to build to some of the run-rates that we guided to at the earlier part of the year. So, that's going to continue to drive up that. Now, the other thing is we also \u2013 we're looking at \u2013 sometimes we don't always get precise skillsets in the exact primary geography that we look for. So, we may have secondary locations, and if that's the case you might see some redundant postings in there. But in general, we're keeping a broad range because the long-term projections are that we will be adding staff, and we want to continue to find the best people and at least build up that portfolio as quickly as we can.","So, we'll continue to build up along those lines, but it is in \u2013 as we've alluded, we've seen improvement in Europe, but we've also kind of gotten into the double-digit range in both North America and Asia Pac. And this is even in light of the fact that we expanded the sales force and alluded for the last couple of quarters that the ramp-up in training and acquisition of that talent would take time which is why we see the continuation toward the stronger end of the year, but that's a continuation of something that we'll want to carry into 2016 and 2017.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","All right. If I could perhaps just squeeze in one more. You articulated a very interesting strategy and definition for what you call systems engineering. Could you comment on any examples to-date of customers, who have in fact deployed your full vision or definition of what you call systems engineering and what requirements do you foresee in terms of having to your ramp up your services capabilities to support that strategy?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, the first of which is with regard to the mention of specific customers, that's something that we're going to actually be publishing on the website as we get those permissions and do it in the correct way. The other thing I will say is that like many other things, I mean, early on when we were talking about design space more than a decade ago, or when we were talking about a workbench platform, none of those things existed before we did it.","So, we were talking about it and sometimes it was a year, or two years, three years before those things manifested themselves. So, the fact is some of the things that we're doing in the systems simulation capability, there really weren't skill sets and organizations at our customer site really built around those because the tools didn't exist at that time.","But the, I would say if I can throw one breadcrumb out there, anytime you would see reference to a, some of the enterprise license agreements, which are starting to happen in increasing amounts, there's almost always element of the system simulation and strategy being involved there, but it will be an evolutionary sense for the customer to think in terms of how it fits their processes and how do they organize around that.","That being said, you're absolutely correct. Anytime you have a new technology services, which will help bridge the adoption of that, is very key. And that, again, that's something we've been talking about for the last couple.","Now, if you recall, we did mention some of these at Investor Day. So, I think it's probably okay to mention those. But Cummins, Ferrari and...","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Ford.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...Ford were \u2013 those were the, I think, the three that we mentioned.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","They were there...","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","...right, telling their own systems story.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That was during the World, Simulation Congress...","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yeah.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","... that was concurrent with the Investor Day. So, and we'll probably have more of those because, as we mentioned, the enterprise engagements have been noticeably ramping up over the last, probably three quarters.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks very much.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Anil Doradla from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. A couple of questions. In the quarter, you had about, what, 18 customers, sorry, with $1 million revenues and you talk about some commentary in the second half. But, Jim, can you talk about how many of the customers are very close to that $1 million number?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well we, I mean, if you're talking about in the high six-figure amount, you know, think of it, it's not like there's a vast wasteland. There's actually like a pyramid building up below that ramping up. So, we probably have easily 70 customers to 100 kind of customers in that next tier of range. But we also see that some of those percolate very quickly and some of those might be on a protracted thing. But they're all ones that we have to develop.","And keep in mind that's pretty consistent with the strategy that we talked about both at Investor Day and at \u2013 on previous calls here in terms of why we have gone more toward addressing that growing market with more of a name to count strategy versus the old territory thing.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Very good. And with all the good stuff that's happening on the sales front, the new initiatives that were kicked in, one of the questions that we get from investors is, if we were to look at when we would see it from an inflection point of view in your business, when would that quarter be? I mean, granted \u2013 since the new head of sales has come onboard, it's been what, over a year. It takes about 15 months, 20 months to get many of these new strategies in place. So, if you were to pick and choose, maybe around what time we should start seeing the business getting inflected by these great initiatives, any color on that front?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, first of all, in terms of what I call an inflection point, I need to break that between two things. There's one of which is related to sales capacity. But there's always the longer term one that we talked about in terms of both the creation of enabling technology and customers' ability to adopt it, and that's not just an increased amount of sales engagement. Because even though we've got the leading technology, it needs to progress a lot more. Just think in terms of \u2013 again, I've used this analogy a lot \u2013 but think in terms of where the home PC was in 1980 and what happened over the next 15 years, 20 years. All the components were there in 1985, and there were leading providers there. But a lot of things had to happen before you saw the inflection point in computing. Same thing really holds for the simulation software.","Now, getting back to the sales one, I wouldn't think in terms of what some people think in terms of a massive dislocation. I think what you're going to see is quarter-upon-quarter \u2013 adjusted for seasonality, of course. You throw Q3 in the mix, and Q3 doesn't compare to many other quarters. But as you see that, you're going to see a continuing ramp-up. And, in fact, I think that's what we saw in Q2 versus Q1 and some of the early comparables where now you've got a couple of areas that have ramped up into the double-digit. Right there, we need to increase and sustain that. There may be blips up and down, original quarters, but you should see a longer term and that should continue to ramp up as we go through, if you will, the bell curve of training requirements of all the new salespeople.","So, I don't think you'd see like a step-function increase or a massive dislocation. I think you'll see numbers of people raise up, and you'll see continued up pressure on the growth curve. And as we mentioned before, where we were a little bit slower in terms of the sales up ramp which we were addressing, was in Europe. But you even see some of the early returns in Europe; of course, Q3 in Europe is well chronicled. So, there we've got that factored into our guidance also.","But, so, I think in terms if you're talking about inflection points or major movements, I think you see one \u2013 I think you will see one when the \u2013 on the technology side, but we've always talked about that being a multiyear kind of transition. But in terms of taking care of the sales capacity, I think that's one where you see a kind of a steady continued ramp-up.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I would just like to ask about the third quarter guidance and actually, Marie, I don't know if you have an answer to this, but when we look at it in constant currencies, you've been growing here constant currencies kind of 8%, 9% recently. Does the third quarter guidance kind of assume that kind of similar growth rate, constant currency?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Constant currency for Q3, that ranges 5% to 9%, Steve, and...","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","...what we are factoring in is what Jim alluded to in the previous question is the reality is Q3 for us is iffy relative to Europe. A third of our business doesn't really get back into the groove until after Labor Day. And so, whether or not some of those deals that are in the pipeline make it into Q3, we're just putting in a little bit of caution.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. That's very helpful. And in terms of the evolution of the sales go-to market, lots of different things happening there, one of the things you wanted to happen were named account reps starting to engage with a VP of Engineering, someone at a higher level. Have we started to see some anecdotal evidence that that is beginning to happen?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, absolutely on that one. Now, yeah, again, just having a visit with a VP and checking the box, only time will tell on that. But if I look at the number of engagements, it's probably about a four-fold increase at least. Now again, that's anecdotal and I just have from the number of meetings.","The other thing that I think is particularly interesting that the sales team has done is sometimes when you have the VP meetings, you have to have a lot of reach. We've actually started a series of executive virtual town halls. And I know that we've had several hundred people just on the first couple of those sequences going in.","So, at least, if we don't get a full chunk of a day with senior execs, we do have introductory things to introduce them to concepts and we've actually had some very interesting customer presentations that were co-presented with those things. So, the overall, at least, introduction and entr\u00e9e has increased quite a bit.","And for certain, the focus has been more along those lines, which, in turn, are necessary steps as we see some of these increasing amounts of some of the enterprise engagements because those do not happen at a grassroots level.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In the prepared remarks, talking about the deals over $1 million and the 18 number, there was a comment in there about the pipeline for the second half. And I guess the way it was worded, it made me wonder, did you see deal slippage in this quarter in terms of some of those large deals? And, maybe you could tie that into what you saw in terms of the linearity. Was the linearity any different than typical?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Linearity is about the same. In terms of any major slips, there are some that pull forward. I mean that's the natural motion in there. But there were no aberrations, nothing out of the process. The thing is, keep in mind, when you're dealing with some of these larger deals, they can tend to take longer because the number of cycles, the number of the \u2013 the amount of scrutiny that they're put in there, but there was nothing that was there.","And as for comparables, the only thing I'd say is that again these deals tend to be multi-year. So, in general \u2013 that's why we're tending to look at these characteristics of what happens to the overall deferred and backlog because the timing of multi-year deals, by definition, they don't very often renew the next year. So, they're out. They're in the denominator but not in the numerator. So, that's just more of a numbers reality.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. And this has been asked a couple of different ways. I just want to ask this question in this structure. When looking at the guidance for the second half, in the first half at conferences and meetings, you've talked about the increased hiring in trying to accelerate the growth. If I look at the guidance for the second half it feels like it's really kind of flat or maybe even a little bit of deceleration that's factored into the second half guidance and I'm wondering how much of that is the FX that you talked about in terms of the yen or other versus macro demand, versus anything else.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first of all the Q4 constant currency growth is right up in that thing where double-digit gets in the range and continues kind of the path. So, I don't buy into the premise of deceleration. There's no doubt that the currency has a little bit of impact on that and then also some of the things we factor. I think maybe one of the key things you have to realize is that we talked about some of these ELAs and I would not be surprised \u2013 I mean keep in mind, they've \u2013 when they come in, they typically are multi-year. They typically are time based which means you do not get a lump of revenue. However, you do see the long-term prospects significantly increase as best evidenced by the growth in the deferred in the backlogs.","So, I think even when you factor those things, it's a fairly impressive growth that we're targeting in light of all of that for the end of the year and it's tending to build off of what we said from the very beginning of the year and it's continuing to inch up even with the time-based element and the strengthening of the long-term book of business.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. Last real quick one. The Gear acquisition, what's the contribution to revenue assumed for the year?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's minimal. That was really not the reason. There's some there but it's not much and that's really not the reason. The main thing we were looking there, it was really key technology, and quite frankly, as was mentioned before, we're always looking for talent and we got that in multitude with this particular one. What we're looking to do is actually continue to strengthen that position, building off of the foundation that we had with Apache but take that into the next few years of development for us.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, ANSYS. Thanks for taking my question. I'll do the first one and then I've got one follow-up. In the prepared remarks, Jim, there was reference in discussing the European performance to commodity oversupply and a slowdown in China affecting not only Europe but also North America. There's also a comment about oil and gas, and that comment's pretty clear. But can you give us some more granular view of the impact of the slowdown in China and the commodity oversupply, like what verticals is it impacting?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","How is that going through your forecast? What's your outlook as well based on what we're seeing?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. With China right now \u2013 and we view this as being temporary because we still view that as being a good long-term market. We saw a little bit of slowness in some of the state-owned enterprises. And I think you saw that there was a lot of macro environment things going on with China, and there's the stock market, and some of the things that the state was doing in terms of that. That's really kind of the primary part of it.","Oil and gas, pretty straightforward. But those are really the only ones that really stand up. We talked for a couple of quarters about Germany. I mean, as Europe was coming up even with \u2013 as I mentioned, Eastern Europe and Russia, being continuing to be pretty underwhelming right now, is that Germany has always been a big bellwether for us and one of our top three markets perennially. And, we had talked about some of those things and some of the things we put in place and that's probably one of the leading elements we had coming out.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just for clarity in the commodity oversupply, what's that? How is that impacting you?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Well, it's just \u2013 if you remember when oil and gas and copper and anything was driving mining and other commodity-related industries, as a result of the slowdown in all of those sectors, obviously, some of those are our end customers, so they tend to either result in those businesses realigning themselves for the realities of the current economic situation and slowdowns.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And, I mean if you look at it, I mean, the most notable ones over the last few years, the mining in Australia, which was largely to support the Asia Pacific. And if you look at also the mining and oil in South America. And Latin America was one of the areas, where we saw probably the lowest performance.","I mean, even that being said, we wound up at the pretty high-upper end of the revenue guidance. So, it wasn't like it had a major impact, but we're always trying to note those various perturbations we see, not that any one signals a megatrend, but they tend to be a number of things that we're looking at just as we continue to project out the next couple of years.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. And if I may squeeze in a follow-up, just one on the sales initiatives. There have been some questions about the impact of the sales hiring. I'm curious to get your read on how is the \u2013 the creation of an \u2013 the enlargement of the named accounts group and the account assignments by named counts. When might \u2013 are you seeing progress with that? And when might that have a more significant impact?","And then just on the sales hiring. I don't want to repeat all the questions that have been asked but I think given the rate of sales hiring, we might have expected a more significant impact than what you've included in your guide. Is it \u2013 would it surprise you to see some pretty good upside from your guide? Is there potentially some conservatism there or is it more of a time lag as these people get productive?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'd say it's conservatism. And I say it is, it is a time lag because any time you get people involved, it is a big issue. Keep in mind, we did a very major thing and the management and absorption of that is important. The, quite frankly, I don't know anybody who hits 100% on all the sales hires. We've got a really good percentage but you've got some of that factoring in. And again, we're still hitting what we had projected at the beginning of the year for the year-end. And, that's even taking into account that we're absorbing an increasing number of these ELAs.","And, like I mentioned, we're close to $0.5 a billion now in the deferred and backlog elements. So, the business is building along those lines. Now, keep in mind, when you go to the named accounts as somebody mentioned earlier but I'll reiterate, we had, first of all, you find them; second of all, you train them; third of all, you have to then engage with the customer and we are getting that increased engagement.","Somebody mentioned, alluded to the VP kind of access, and that is, on a market uptick but it isn't like the very first time that you meet the VP they write you a check. I mean, we're talking about planning out, if you will, 2-year through 10-year type of adoption patterns. So, there is that natural, but that natural latency was built into the very guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, and if you will, we're maintaining it even against some of the additional headwinds, and also the benefits of the longer-term nature of the enterprise license agreements. And even though we're only on the very beginning of the ANSYS enterprise cloud usage, we've gotten a lot of interest there now. That'll be time before people change their overall usage patterns also. But those are all fairly positive things, but I think they're also fairly much in line with the guidance that we've been giving for the last few quarters.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Maria.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here.","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Hey, Saket. How are you doing?","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good, Maria. How are you? Let me just start with just a high-level and then I've got a follow-up. Jim, can you just talk about the U.S. macro backdrop for your customers? We all see the manufacturing PMI. And, it seems like it's affected at least one other design company. If you look at the more established sales reps that you have, what are they seeing in terms of their pipeline and their close rates in the U.S.?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'm going to have to try to process the closure rate. The pipelines are markedly up. And I'd say, in general, you look at the manufacturing index and things like that, those are some bellwether, but I think what we've always gauged more toward is the R&D and, if you will, the innovation measures because essentially, that's where our software is used, not primarily on the manufacturing and inventory side of things. So, as a result, we've seen a range of companies continuing to try to drive new innovation into their products, first and foremost.","Second of all is they're starting to figure out what, for instance, the industrial Internet or Internet of Things might mean in terms of how they evolve or retrofit their products to fit in with that kind of environment. We've talked about the overall electrification of traditional industries, the automotive being one of the more notable ones, but being able to go into that one. So, with those type of things, we still see a lot of innovation. In keeping with our global presence, we do see a fairly broad-based globalization.","But amidst there, there are increasing amounts of fits and starts that continue around the globe as everybody seems to be recalculating things. But at the end of the day, we don't really see an end of interest in new innovative products or basically flat-lining on the new design level.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Got it. And just for my follow-up, can you just remind us, do customers on lease and maintenance get access to the suite of tools under ANSYS 16.1 or do you think the product could maybe generate incremental revenue from your existing customer base?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it can create incremental revenue because essentially if somebody is on a lease basis, they basically get enhancements to the products that they've leased, but they don't get those generally across the portfolio.","Now, some of that starts to enter in a little bit more, as we discussed, with the Enterprise license agreements, where there's an increased flexibility that helps people predict over a multi-year period usage patterns that they might not be able to predict but allows them to flexibly meet that, which gives them the confidence to kind of, I would say, move forward instead of doing an exhaustive study to determine exactly what they need and when. So, we'll have some of that.","But in answer to that is, what we've usually said, if it tends to bend the curve up, maybe that's a bad expression these days, but it bends the curve. It doesn't dislocate the curve traditionally, but we do see that increased usage from the capability. But keep in mind we've had a normal cadence for the last decade of almost every six months having a fairly significant feature release and it's continued to be one of those things that has helped propel us to this point. And we think it's essential for keeping that progress going over the next couple years.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Makes sense. Thanks very much.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think also, the other thing I'd mention of course is that as a testament to that, you also look at the historical renewal rates, which continue to be historically strong. And that's one of those things \u2013 it's really that vote of confidence in getting continued access to those capabilities, I think, that keeps those strong on both the lease and the service side of things.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thanks again, Jim.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Hey, Jim, how many ELA deals did you sign this quarter and can you remind me how many you've signed to-date?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the one thing I want to mention is sometimes ELAs are really covered under \u2013 I mean you can kind of draw a proxy by those seven-figure deals that we talk about, because ELAs are always in the healthy side of that. But I will tell you that sometimes the kind of agreements that we have here, we're not even allowed to really mention some of those. So, I will tell you the one that we're able to kind of put through there and you'll see \u2013 you'll be able to get at least a windage and elevation on that \u2013 from that.","The other thing is that \u2013 the other thing is tendency ELAs, they tend to more often happen beginning and end of year as people are synchronizing on their various calendars and budget cycles.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Well, maybe I could ask it this way. Is it trending in line, above or below your expectations?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Above.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And, Maria, two for you if I could.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","By the way, when I say above, I won't say 2x above, but it's significantly above.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm just trying to give you a little bit more color on that.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. That's helpful. And then, Maria, do you have the FX impact to deferred sequentially this quarter?","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hang on a minute. Where did you get...?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yep, hold on \u2013 yeah, plus $2.5 million.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Plus $2.5 million?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","Yep.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And, Maria, just curious, your perpetual license constant currency has been growing faster than lease constant currency this year and that's despite more ELAs that are time based and therefore, would go into deferred and backlog and ultimately I think be recognized through the lease line.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Why is that? Why are the perpetuals growing faster?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","So, Ross, on, I think it was the last call someone asked about are we going to trend our model kind of line with what other people in our industry are doing relative to moving to everything subscription. And, I had commented that historically, we've tended to have models that are flexible and meet the needs of many of our customers.","So, if you looked at the commentary around geography, if you look at the performance of Asia Pac, for example, Asia Pac, places like India, China, Korea, when they're growing very fast, they are really perpetual license buyers. They are not subscription license buyers predominantly, particularly in those major accounts that we have in those geographies.","So, the reality is while in some geographies, ELAs and subscription is becoming more of an acceptable norm. In other parts of the world, they are still perpetual buyers and we're going to continue to offer them perpetual licenses.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Just one quick one, last one if I could. What was the consideration for Gear?","Maria T. Shields - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President, Finance and Administration","$30 million.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Having no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jim Cashman for any closing remarks.","James E. Cashman III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Actually, I'd like to thank you all for your participation in our call today and for your ongoing support and coverage of ANSYS. So, we're proud of what we've accomplished in the first half of 2015. But as we've discussed on the Q&A session here, we've got a lot of work ahead of us to deliver on our goals for the full year.","So, with that, in addition to thanking you, I'd like to thank the entire ANSYS team for their commitment to driving the results that we've had and that we're moving toward. And, I'd also like to welcome the Gear team to the ANSYS family.","So, in short, we feel that we're very well-positioned to continue to drive the growth. I'd probably cite two very significant reasons. First, we have increased visibility from some of the larger multi-year Enterprise opportunities that are in the pipeline for the back half of the year, and also the general growth in the pipeline that we've alluded to on this Q&A.","Secondly, we've been successful in the more aggressive approach to sales hiring that we reference on the last couple of calls. And, of course, we've discussed that here.","So, in short we have unparalleled production offerings. We've got a great long, lived record with our customers, extremely high recurring revenues and the opportunity to augment our growth through new features and the kind of the exciting technologies from acquisitions as well as our own internal R&D innovation.","So, continued sites in the near-term. We're growing our direct sales force. We have a renewed focus on our indirect channel. I think you saw some of those results in Germany where we're, have a very hybrid model. And we're committed to driving solid financial results to generate continued value for our shareholders.","So, with that I'll sign off. Thank you very much and talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"2197":["ANSYS, Inc.

Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks document have been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supporting data relative to our first quarter financial results and business updates as well as our Q2 2019 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are available via our website.","Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information, unless we do so in a public forum.","During this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures under ASC 606 is included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K.","As we previously communicated, now that we are beyond the first year of adoption of revenue recognition under ASC 606, we will only be providing financial results and outlook under ASC 606. I want to highlight that any comments made relative to revenue growth rates will be comparing 2019 to 2018 results under 606.","In closing, I would like to announce that our 2019 Investor Day will be held on Thursday, September 12th in Pittsburgh, with a reception and technology showcase events evening before. Further details around the location, logistics and the agenda can be found on our IR website.","I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal for his opening remarks. Ajei.","Ajei Gopal","Thank you, Annette and good morning everyone. Q1 has given ANSYS an excellent start to the year with strong results across our key performance metrics. We exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by delivering constant currency revenue growth of 16%. Our operating cash flow was robust increasing 14% year-over-year, and we reported record first quarter EPS of $1.29.","To reflect the momentum across our business, I'm pleased to announce that we are raising our full year guidance. Maria will provide further details.","Our financial success is propelled by our unique multi-physics portfolio and our drive to make simulation pervasive throughout the product lifecycle; a distinct combination that helps our customers solve their most complex product problems.","In Q1, we enjoyed success across most of our industry verticals with particular strength in the high-tech sector. Given the unique challenges that high-tech companies face and with our growing momentum in that sector. I would like to highlight ANSYS' value proposition to those companies and some of our successes in the vertical. The high-tech industry stands at a crossroads thanks to mega trends like 5G, AI, autonomy, electrification and datacenters.","Those trends coupled with intense competition across the verticals are spurring customer innovation that's driving even higher demand for multi-physics simulation. And that's why hundreds of high-tech leaders including the vast majority of the top companies in semiconductor, smart devices, telecommunications and datacenters are using ANSYS to address many of their product challenges.","For example, customers are increasingly relying on ANSYS' unique solution set to make 5G a reality. 5G networks require an unprecedented number of base stations creating more complex connectivity, energy efficiency and thermal management challenges. Our solutions help users examine the performance of the base station in large scale environments to ensure connectivity is maintained while base station placement is optimized.","Combined with our chip package system workflow, we can help customers tackle the critical power and thermal management issues on a single platform. In Q1, we closed a deal with an Asian telecommunications company to design and analyze the 5G networks they're building. The company is using ANSYS solutions to increase the performance of antennas in their base stations to accommodate the higher frequencies inherent in 5G communication.","After a head-to-head comparison this telecom customer chose ANSYS because of our complete multi-physics simulation platform. Solutions that help our customers grapple with the complexities of mega trends like 5G are based on our market-leading portfolio including gold standards such as ANSYS HFSS and ANSYS RedHawk-SC.","ANSYS HFSS enables users to design and simulate high frequency electronic products such as antennas, microwave components, high-speed Interconnects, IC packages and PCBs. With its unmatched accuracy, the modern architecture of HFSS empowers users to solve complex electromagnetic and electromechanical problems across hundreds of cores and enables customers like Samsung, Nvidia and Ericsson to develop amazing products.","We continue to extend our leadership with HFSS through our recent releases as well as through strategic acquisitions. in Q1, we released our EMI Scanner which is new functionality in HFSS to quickly identify areas of potential electromagnetic interference on PCB designs prior to simulation. This helps customers to eliminate errors, while speeding time to market.","And as we discussed on our last call, we further expanded our leadership in the electronics industry in Q1 with the acquisition of Helic, the industry-leading provider of electromagnetic crosstalk solutions, for systems on a chip.","The acquisition of Helic, combined with ANSYS' flagship electromagnetic and semiconductor solvers provides a comprehensive solution for on-chip 3D integrated circuit and chip package system electromagnetics and noise analysis. Reaction has been overwhelmingly positive with industry leaders praising us for combining the best technology for off-chip electromagnetics in HFSS with the most innovative on-chip electromagnetic technology in Helic.","DfR Solutions, our latest acquisition, which closed this week, is helping customers address their product challenges by ensuring the reliability of their electronics. DfR Solutions is the leading provider of automated design analysis software and comprehensive services for electronic components and material supply chain. DfR bolsters our electronics reliability capabilities with an automated designer level solution to quickly and easily analyze the potential for electronics failures and I'm excited to welcome the DfR team into the ANSYS family.","Moving to our semiconductor solutions, ANSYS RedHawk-SC is the world's first purpose-built Big Data system for the semiconductor industry. And I'm proud to say that 100% of our 7-nanometer base is using RedHawk-SC which is undefeated in all head-to-head technical benchmarks our customers and foundry partners recognize that ANSYS is accelerating its leadership in chip package system multi physics with innovative new products like RedHawk-SC with integrated workflows using our flagship solvers such as HFSS and with our targeted technology acquisitions.","TSMC, the world's largest semiconductor foundry has recognized ANSYS with Partner of the Year Awards in each of the last three years. And in Q1 they certified our semiconductor solutions for SoIC advanced 3D chip stacking technology. Our work on developing solutions for the high-tech industry is paying off. In Q1, Seagate Technology a world leader in precision-engineered data storage and management solutions, entered into a multiyear enterprise agreement expanding the use of ANSYS simulation software worldwide.","Demands on Seagate development teams are increasing. Reaching capacity performance and environmental goals on schedule increasingly requires more simulation across all engineering disciplines. ANSYS solutions deliver technical and business value helping Seagate maximize data potential. Similarly, LG Electronics also into new enterprise agreement with ANSYS to help support the company's continued commitment to delivering highly innovative mobile devices, home entertainment and appliance applications to customers worldwide.","LG expects this expanded access to our multi-physics suite to drive innovation, shortened product development cycles, and accelerated product design. Moving away from high technology, we have seen considerable traction with another recent acquisition, Granta Design, the premier provider of materials information technology. In early Q2 ANSYS closed the largest deal in Granta history at a leading aerospace company to enable materials intelligence and material data management across the organization.","This deal was made possible by the combination of Granta's mission-critical technology, the long-standing relationship the customers had with ANSYS and their confidence in ANSYS' ability to successfully integrate Granta. We're also enjoying success with our key partnerships for example, our award-winning Discovery Live solution, which brings real time simulation capabilities to design engineers is reaching new audiences, thanks to our partnership with PTC.","During Q1 PTC released Creo Simulation Live embedded with ANSYS Discovery Live technology. During its earnings call last week, PTC reported that it already booked deals with 70 customers. As previously discussed, we expect the near-term financial impact to be immaterial, but we see upside in the longer term. Similarly SAP showcased its Predictive Engineering Insights enabled by ANSYS solution at the Hannover Messe Industrial Fair in Germany.","Their Design to Operate demo featured an automated fluid handling system designed by packaging and bottling machine manufacturer Krones which showcased digital twin capabilities enabled by ANSYS. And just recently SAP enhances highlighted joint success with a leading air compressor company using the SAP ANSYS solution. The company is able to streamline its customer delivery time from months to hours by eliminating the need for engineering teams to perform detailed technical customization and analysis work.","Predictive engineering insights empowers field-based sales teams to save critical time and engineering resources. With our strong Q1 financial results, our continued momentum in high-growth industry verticals such as high-tech, our investment in leading technology and our focus on expanding the value from our partnerships and our acquisitions, we remain confident that we will achieve our goals and objectives. Like our customers we're focused on innovation, on solving the toughest problems and on delivering results. We believe this is a winning combination and our performance speaks for itself.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria. Maria?","Maria Shields","Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2019. Consistent with our standard practice, my comments will be in terms of non-GAAP, unless I state otherwise. The strong Q1 results reflect solid execution across our business combined with a steady customer demand environment which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all well above the high end of our Q1 guidance.","Our excellent start to the year is quite encouraging when considering the Q1 2018 comparable in which we reported double-digit ACV growth and strong earnings. Key financial metric begin with Q1 ACV of $303.5 million and total revenue of $319.9 million or constant currency revenue growth of 16%. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first quarter guidance.","The increase in software lease license sales combined with strong maintenance renewals contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q1 total of $673 million, representing a 13% increase over last year's first quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline which yielded a very strong first quarter gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 43%. Margins were positively impacted by revenue results finishing well above the high end of our revenue guidance, as well as a slower pace of hiring than we had planned coming into the quarter.","The pace of hiring was most notably impacted by the integration activities of both the Granta Design and Helic acquisitions during the quarter, as we added approximately 200 talented employees to our team. We also saw the continuation of the tighter labor market, particularly for highly skilled positions. We reported record first quarter EPS of $1.29. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 21% in line with the range that we had guided coming into the quarter.","Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% for Q2 and the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $152 million, a 14% increase over last year's Q1 and we ended the quarter with a total of $608 million in cash and short-term investments.","The operating cash flows in the first quarter positively benefited from the very strong Q4 ACV finish in 2018. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 250,000 shares during the quarter at a total cost of $45 million. We have 3.6 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program.","Now let me turn to the topic of guidance, coming off our strong finish in Q1, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and increasing both our revenue and EPS outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the solid financial performance in the first quarter combined with our confidence and continued positive business momentum for the remainder of the year. Our updated outlook reflects the minor contribution of the DfR acquisition that we closed yesterday.","Let me also add that currency exchange rate changes did not contribute to our increased guidance. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $325 million to $345 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.18 to $1.30. For the full year, we are increasing both the revenue and EPS outlook the non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1,430 million to 1,480 million our constant currency growth of 11% to 15% and EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6.10.","We are also increasing our full-year ACV outlook to $1,425 million to $1,470 million. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 9% to 12%. With respect to annual operating cash flows, we are maintaining our outlook for 2019 in the range of $470 million to $510 million.","I would like to remind everyone that our outlook for operating cash flow in 2019 includes higher tax payments that relate to the acceleration of lease license revenue and the related profitability under ASC 606, including additional tax payments in 2019 relating to our strong 2018 finish, as well as the first year impact of the acquisitions. For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margin of 39% to 41% and for the full year, we continue to expect operating margins of 43% to 44%.","Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2019 are contained in the prepared remarks document. In closing, we are very pleased to start the year with excellent first quarter financial and operational results.","Another quarter of delivering on our financial commitments combined with the exciting opportunities to continue to leverage our incredible technology, talent and customer relationships gives us confidence that our focus on execution and investing in the business combined with the strength of our recurring business and growing sales pipeline, provide a strong foundation to deliver on our 2019 goals as well as our longer-term 2020 financial targets.","Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ken Wong with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Wong","Hey, thanks a lot. Maybe first question on my end. Last quarter you guys touched on a heavier seasonality in the back half of the year, specifically Q4. Just wondering based on what you've seen in Q1 and the expected pipeline, how is that looking, is the magnitude even greater? And then perhaps and then a follow-up on Discovery Live, just wanted to understand how the PTC partnership differs from what you guys are seeing in terms of customer engagements?","Maria Shields","So Ken, I'll take the first part of the question relative to the seasonality for 2019, as I had said on the last call, we see 2019, very similar to 2018. Back-end loaded and a lot of the large multiyear transactions are in the Q4 queue right now. So everything is going as we had mapped it out and it's just a lot of those larger deals aligned with customer yearend budgeting and spend. And so they're just aligned with a larger second half.","Ajei Gopal","And then with respect to the PTC partnership, we are very excited about the PTC partnership. I think it's going well. We announced the partnership, as you know, in June of 2018. And they released Creo Simulation Live, which is Creo embedded with ANSYS technology in Q1. And they've created essentially a solution that adds simulations into the CAD environment. And so engineers can see the real-time results of simulation in the CAD environment that allows them to make the kind of trade-off and design changes, they need to early in the design process.","Based on what they said during their investor call they've closed 70 CSL deals in Q1, essentially across all geographies, industry verticals, both direct and indirect and they've built a promising pipeline for future quarters. And we're excited about the option pattern, and that's consistent with what we've seen which is customers will use the technology and then start to broaden.","They've also announced that they're going to be back porting CSL to Creo 4, which is essentially where a larger portion of their installed base, primarily their enterprise customers are, and that will allow them to benefit from upfront simulation. So I think it's going well. We're excited about that and the relationship is strong.","Operator","The next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good morning. Maria, let me start with you, on the call a quarter ago you anticipated that you would add about 300 employees for the year. And I think that did not include Helic and Granta. You've grown 300 thus far for the year, 200 of which was from the acquisitions. So you are about a-third of the way it seems towards your hiring goal for the year.","Does your guidance anticipate that you will hit your hiring objective and you - in fact a record number, which seems of technical consulting and support openings right now, could that be some factor as well in terms of you have being able to sustain the numbers for 2019.","Then a technology question for Ajei, maybe to prognosticate, a little bit about the evolution of the industry, there is considerable attention, as you know, being paid to generative design which is neither CAD nor simulation. It's some of each, and it's more than just a tool to process. As that becomes more and more adopted - as I expect it will, how do you think that affects your business, the role of simulation or multi-physics simulation? And maybe tie that also into your larger SPDM strategy, if you could? Sorry for the long question.","Maria Shields","Okay. So Jay, I'll start on the hiring. Yes. As you heard in the prepared remarks, we had planned and we are still planning for roughly 300 net new, not including the impact of Granta and Helic.","That being said, as you heard in my earlier comments, the two acquisitions in the first quarter, as you can imagine, slowed some of the original plan down. But we did add net about 130 additional employees onto the ANSYS roster in addition to the 200 plus from Granta and Helic and it is our anticipation that over the remainder of the year that we will see organic hiring increase over the pace of the year and that's what's built into our guidance for the remaining quarters.","Ajei Gopal","And Jay, just to briefly touch on generative design. We are very excited about the direction that the industry is taking in generated design. We think that's an opportunity for us to increase the penetration of simulation into the marketplace, because as you think about generative design, the improvement of a design continues to require rapid iterations and simulation. And so where historically simulation might have been someone, an individual creating a design and then subsequently validating it in the world of generative design.","And frankly in the world that we're talking about, where more people are creating technology and creating products, the opportunity for simulation to provide that rapid feedback to both human beings as well as provide guidance as you start to think about a generative kind of solution, it makes sense. It drives the use of simulation.","So we're very excited about our position in the marketplace, we think that generative will be another driver of the use of simulation and then you think that's completely consistent with the product strategy that we are driving. What we doing and things like SPDM allow us to continue to manage the huge amounts of simulations data that's being generated. Obviously, with generative design there will be more simulation data. So this is completely consistent with the direction that we're going and frankly we're very excited about it.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ken Talanian","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I guess from Maria. What was your constant currency, organic ACV growth in the quarter? And then could you give us a sense for how you're thinking about the inorganic contribution to revenue for the remainder of both '19 and as you think about hitting your 10% plus target in 2020?","Maria Shields","So Ken relative to ACV, basically it is organic. There was only about $3 to $4 million from the acquisitions to ACV. So the majority of the ACV growth is from the organic business. And with respect to 2020, we have not changed our outlook on 2020 from what we said in Investor Day relative to, we are still targeting double-digit growth and industry-leading margins in the 43% to 45% range.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Matt Pfau","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on the PTC partnership and I realize it's still pretty early there, but if you can just talk about with what you've seen so far, do you think similar partnerships like the PTC one would make sense to pursue and are there other ones out there that you could pursue? Thanks.","Ajei Gopal","So we certainly are excited about the PTC partnership. They have been good partners and we continue to support them. The opportunity that we see obviously is for designers to be able to take advantage of simulation, not just experienced analysts or designers to take advantage of simulation and frankly we believe in an open ecosystem.","So no matter which CAD solution someone's using, we're perfectly content and delighted for those customers to take advantage of the CAD capability from any vendor and to take advantage of ANSYS simulation. But obviously with PTC, we have a tighter relationship with PTC's OEM-ing our technology and integrating it directly into Creo.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Oliver of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Rob Oliver","Hi, guys, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Ajei, this is one for you. Just as a follow-up to the last question, so you when you got here you embarked upon a pretty bold strategy on the partnership side, you mentioned 5G comms obviously you guys have always been strong in semiconductors. Maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the potential other areas within partnership potential? And then I had a quick follow-up on Discovery Live unrelated to PTC? Thanks.","Ajei Gopal","Just on the partnership question, just to clarify what specifically are you asking me to comment on. Please?","Rob Oliver","Yes, just getting a sense for, you guys have expanded your go-to market through partnerships pretty markedly and wanted to get a sense if there were other specific areas where you saw opportunity. I realize it's a bit of a follow-up to last question. Thanks.","Ajei Gopal","Sure. So the strategy that we've articulated is one where simulation becomes pervasive throughout the product lifecycle. And what we mean by that is that anyplace where a product is being touched, whether it's in the inception phase, whether people are thinking about a product in the ideation phase, whether it's the deep design, whether it's manufacturing and things like additive manufacturing, whether its operations, whether it's in the product itself.","We believe that simulation can play a role. Because frankly an understanding of the physics of the product and understanding of how the product could operate or will operate or is operating is very important for customer value and customer benefits.","So we see simulation as playing this much deeper role across the product life cycle. Now historically, we've been in a particular part of that product lifecycle, which has been in the tail end of the design process for validation or for sign off and increasingly as you see from the strategy that we've been pursuing, it's to make simulation available in multiple places.","Now the way we doing that is obviously we have our own go-to-market, but we're also looking at those areas where others have a very strong presence and we're integrating our technology into others who have a strong presence on a particular workflow and that's one of the reasons why when you think about the EDA space for example, we are partnering with Synopsys, where Synopsys is taking our technology and integrating it into their products as part of the workflow.","We're partnering with PTC it because they have a presence in the CAD space, we're partnering with SAP as you start to think about operations. And so the way you should think about our partnering strategy, it's driven by the ability to work with industry leaders who are in their space, who are key providers of a workflow or a capability at some point in the product life cycle.","And since we have an open strategy, our intention is to be able to integrate with their workflows and let our simulation capabilities to be present in their product offering, in their solution offering and obviously they're taking it to market through their channels, through their re-sellers and so forth. So we see this as a win for ANSYS and that's a strategy that we've been pursuing and that's the strategy we will continue to pursue.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Koenig of Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Steve Koenig","Hi, ANSYS. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about large deals in the quarter and the context here being the year ago quarter maybe remind us that the $50 million deal a year ago. How much of that was impactful to ACV? And what did you have this quarter in terms of very large deals that might have moved the needle if you can provide any qualitative color there?","And if I may, I do have one housekeeping type question for Maria and that is, if we were to calculate bookings under 606 is that comparable to the 605 calculation, we performed a year ago. I know you don't know my calc but I'm just talking about the change in the total backlog plus revenue, are those things comparable?","Maria Shields","Yeah. So let's start with respect to the year ago quarter. If you recall, that was a quarter in which we did announce at that point in time, the largest deal in the company's history and ACV would have been a-third last year, a-third in Q1 this year. And then, and then a-third next year at the 3-year anniversary of that deal, so a-third of the deal went into this quarter's ACV result.","As you know, we moved away, Steve, from bookings just because it's a much more volatile metric then ACV. But there should be no difference between bookings under 606 or 605.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Question for you, Ajei on the sales force on yourself and Rick Mahoney took over about the same time since then you've made a lot of structural and capacity additions to the sales force. Just wondered if you can give kind of an update on where you are in that sales force transformation and what's on the to-do list for 2019 as far as continuing to add capacity and make any perhaps structural changes there? Thanks.","Ajei Gopal","Yes. So when I came on board and certainly Rick came on board shortly after I did, our focus was on looking at the go-to market to try to figure out how we could optimize the go-to-market. And the model that we were dealing with earlier was I would see a more - it was a model that was relevant for an earlier time in the ANSYS lifecycle and was more of a one-size-fits-all in terms of how we address the market opportunity.","Today what we have is a more differentiated go-to-market, where we take advantage of a direct sales force to go after the large deals and the larger territory deals. And we've done some channel, to be able to have the channel focus on more of the volume business. And then of course we also have some inside sales activities.","And so there has been a pretty significant, as you point out, change in our go-to-market, which has allowed us to continue to grow our business across a number of different dimensions. We've also continued to make investments in our ACE organization or our technical sales organization and that's of course helped overall. And our channel partners, have also continued to blossom. We've brought more channel partners on board and they've continued to bring on more ACE capacity or technical capacity as well, to be able to support customers.","So that's the journey that we've been on, that's a journey that obviously is an ongoing journey. We continue to make refinements to that model and we will continue to continue to do that this year through next year and beyond. But the basic bones that we've talked about, have been put in place and now we're starting to think about how we would optimize within that structure, in some cases, does it make sense to have some particular vertical focus in certain areas and those are the kinds of questions that we're exploring.","But again, we have a very enviable business model with within ANSYS and that's on the back of the kinds of products and capabilities that we have and the customer relationships that we've been able to maintain and that's something that we hold very dear to us and so our go-to market model and the changes that we make will support that and we're not planning on doing anything to disrupt our go-to-market capabilities.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Jason Celino","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question this morning. One question back on ACV guidance you are raising your current constant currency outlook by 1 percentage point. Can you maybe go into more details, what gives you confidence to increase modestly here?","Maria Shields","Yeah, I would say, as I said in my earlier commentary Jason; one, the performance in Q1 and the strength of the pipeline and the deals that we're seeing that the teams are working on. So we see a lot of interest from our customers, particularly in some of the key areas that Ajei mentioned in his commentary. And we don't see that slowing down. So we are excited about the opportunity we see ahead for 2019 and we're going to spend all of our time focusing on executing and delivering.","Ajei Gopal","And if I can just add to what Maria said, she is absolutely correct. I mean if you start to spend time with our field organization. I spent a fair amount of time out in the field with customers as well and with the organization, you get a sense of the strength of the pipeline and obviously we are very excited about the capabilities that we can provide.","I've talked about some of them in my script. I mean we have conversations with companies where we talk about things like say autonomy electrification for example in the auto industry. Those are conversations, which are much deeper and broader than conversations that we may have had with similar companies in the past.","Similarly in the electronics space that I talked about in my remarks earlier and other industries and that's because of the capabilities that we're able to provide is because of where the industries are right now and because of the nature of solutions that we can point to. So the pipeline is looking strong. We're excited about where we are. This is always a back-end loaded year as we had indicated earlier, there's a lot of activity in Q3 and Q4. But we are confident that we have visibility into that. And we understand how to land our business. So we're excited about the year.","Jason Celino","Great, thank you.","Operator","The Next question is from Ross MacMillan of RBC. Please go ahead.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks so much. Ajei just, on the large deals you mentioned Seagate and in the release you talked about LG, were they both in the quarter and were they both multi-year, and I'm just curious, your indirect revenue spike so was there some impact from a partner on one of those deals that would be great. Thanks.","Ajei Gopal","I think the answer was - I think it was a yes to answer all your questions. So yes, there was, those were in the quarter. Those were multi-year deals. And yes, there was some impact of partner activity in our indirect number.","Operator","The next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Saket Kalia","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe first for you, Maria, just picking up on the last topic a little bit more broadly. Can you just talk about the mix of long-term deals in the quarter? And I guess the reason why I asked this, of course 606 we're going to see some differences in sort of revenue versus arguably the cleaner metric of ACV. Can you just talk about that delta and growth between revenue growth and ACV growth this quarter?","Maria Shields","Yeah. So, Saket. I think in our comments you picked up the unique disparity that comes from 606. And the reality is under 606 our results are going to be very impacted by the size, the duration and the timing of those multi-year lease deals. This is the first quarter where you can actually see a comp under ASC 606 for both Q1 of 2018 and 2019 and going forward depending on where those deals land, you'll see some disparity between the growth rate in revenue and the growth rate in ACV.","They won't always be moving in the same direction. There will be periods where ACV will outpace revenue growth. So I wish I could explain with certainty, how it's all going to roll out, but I think the most important thing that we've been communicating is the focus on the annual results will be much more meaningful than the volatility that you'll see in the quarters, Q1 being a perfect example.","Operator","The next question is from Adam Borg of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Adam Borg","Great, thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe Ajei, just talking big picture on ANSYS Cloud obviously, it's still really early and as you think about bifurcating both the down market and up market, are you expecting more percentage of use cases that come at the lower end of the market or bursting at the upper end and potentially even a replacement overtime as on-prem hardware gets depreciated?","Ajei Gopal","It's a hard question to answer in terms of exact predictions of what's going to happen. There clearly is value proposition for smaller customers who don't have an investment in the data center to take advantage of, sort of, the native HPC capability that we're making available through ANSYS cloud, native to the cloud. So with the ANSYS cloud solution that we've just released, most recently in Q1, we have an offering that essentially has the following capabilities that I think are really important to your question.","The first is that it allows for high performance. It's essentially building on the investments that we've made in HPC and we are providing a compute optimize cloud infrastructure that's configured and optimized for ANSYS solvers and so essentially, any customer can take advantage of ANSYS solutions at scale than in the public cloud, because of the work that we've done.","And then the second piece that makes it important is that the ANSYS Cloud is accessible from within ANSYS products and so someone can be sitting there at a screen working with an ANSYS product and then immediately take advantage of the cloud. So it's completely seamless. And of course since we are running on the back end on Microsoft Azure, in this case, it gives global access and best-in-class security.","So we've made essentially the experience of using cloud drop-dead simple and it's as easy as it needs to be. And of course with the on-demand licensing that we can provide, the pay-per-use licensing that gives them. That's a third way to complement traditional leases and paid up and that give them flexibility of usage, so given the performance, given the access given the flexibility that we have with our ANSYS Cloud offerings.","We would expect the opportunity for customers - for customers to seize the opportunity both large as well as small, small customers who don't necessarily have any infrastructure. Obviously, they'll be excited and interested in that. But equally large customers for project-oriented work when back-end HPC resources aren't available. We've seen interest from large customers as well.","So we expect both of those to continue. I couldn't tell you where demand is going to be higher or lower, but we certainly see demand across both of those segments for the reasons that I've mentioned.","Operator","The next question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi guys. You mentioned the strength in multi-year leases, I wasn't clear. I didn't hear. Is there been any noticeable change in duration. And maybe just a reminder, what are you seeing as the average length of these multi-year deals?","Maria Shields","Surely. There's been no change in duration and typically two to three years, some of the larger deals tend to be three years and some of the, at the strategic tend to be two years, but there has been no significant change in the go-to-market or duration.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then one follow-on question Ajei, Cadence announced an electromagnetic solver, what appears to be coming into one-year core pillars of strength. What are you seeing in terms of the competitive landscape? And do you think this is going to be the beginning of others that tried to go after those or adjacent marketplaces?","Kenneth Wong","So thanks Sterling. I mentioned I talked a little bit about HFSS in my script, but perhaps - since you asked the question, it's worth emphasizing. A couple of points. The first thing to understand is ANSYS HFSS serves as an important and growing market and is the gold standard. It is the industry-leading product. HFSS solves some of the most complex electromagnetic problems spans a vast number of industry then it covers both the RF and ESI space.","So this includes problems in high-growth areas that range from radar in autonomous vehicles to phased array antenna for 5G telecom to IC circuits frankly that are in all manner of electronics products. So it's no surprise to us, and it's no wonder that other vendors, want to compete in this growing space. But the point is competing isn't that easy. We are today, the leader in this space and we've been the leader for almost three decades and customers have trusted HFSS for decades to solve their most complex problems and they continue to place that confidence in ours.","Our technology, with references in tens of thousands of peer-published IEEE publications, we are absolutely justified in saying that we're the industry's gold standard and we've been able to maintain our leadership because we've continued to make significant investments in HFSS over the years and the product today incorporates breakthroughs in both methods which is studying the physics as well as in processing sort of the computer science.","So to give you some details, customers trust the accuracy of HFSS because of our technology leadership and one example is in the area of automatic adaptive mesh refinement, which provides accurate consistent and repeatable answers within an air tolerance that's specified by users, and this is the cornerstone required for predicting accurate answers. And frankly, why so many global customers trust HFSS to solve their electromagnetic challenges.","HFSS today is available, of course, on-prem for customers to use within their own data centers, but it's also available in the public cloud, and this month natively on Azure with the ANSYS Cloud offering that I just talked about.","To give you some perspective of performance, in a recent benchmark HFSS solved in IoT PCB using a 128 cores, which is a pretty typical customer configuration 128 cores, resulting in a 40x speed up versus one core and so to put that in perspective that's approximately an hour versus approximately 40 hours and that's impressive and it's also important to note that as per the previous comments I made about cloud, that the cloud will democratize that scalability and it will make it available for every single customer.","And then we've introduced some technology that reduces RAM consumption by a factor of 3. So in the customer benchmark that I just mentioned, RAM usage went down 176 gigabytes to 64 gigabytes, again significantly. Improving solve efficiency. HFSS is a great product that serves customers around the world in an attractive market. The competitive moat around the product, the competitive moat around HFSS is it's broad, it's deep and it's filled with hungry alligators PowerPoint presentations are easy, products are hard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Rodgers of Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead.","Jason Rodgers","Yes. I wondered if you could talk about the decline in EMEA for the quarter. It was due strictly to tough comps or are there any other factors involved, and if you are satisfied with the performance there?","Maria Shields","Yes, Jason. It is exactly what you mentioned it was - if you recall last year EMEA grew in double digits, it's just the timing of some large deals that were in Q1 of last year that did not repeat this year. So we are very excited about our EMEA business and our EMEA team.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for closing remarks.","Ajei Gopal","Thank you, operator. Given the strength of our Q1, our robust pipeline of direct channel and partner-driven deals and our partner leadership across physics, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our goals and objectives. ANSYS is well positioned to broaden our market opportunity and to extend our leadership in both the near-term as well as in the long term. That confidence is made possible due to the tireless work of customers, partners and of course my ANSYS colleagues.","Thank you all for your efforts. And thank you for another exceptional quarter. Thank you everyone for joining the call today. I look forward to the next call. Enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Cashman. Please go ahead, sir.","James E. Cashman","Okay, thanks, Maureen. Good morning, and again, thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss the ANSYS Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results. And consistent with what we've been doing all of this year, all of the general information and key topics relative to the third quarter and the year-to-date business results, as well as our future outlook, are included in the earnings release and in the prepared remarks that we posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. So before we get started, I'd like to introduce Maria Shields, CFO, and would you give us our Safe Harbor statement, please?","Maria T. Shields","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the world and our business as of today and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date that these are made. Consistent with our standard practice, during the course of this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be making reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release, materials and the related Form 8-K. So Jim, I'll turn it back to you.","James E. Cashman","Okay, Thanks, Maria. Before the Q&A, I'd like to briefly highlight a few key points about our Q2 results and our updated 2012 outlook, as well as our preliminary 2013 outlook. Actually, before I get into that I just want to send condolences and best wishes out to all of those on the East Coast who are dealing with their own versions of tragic and challenging times, so we wish everybody the best as they start to recover and rebuild from the events of recent days. So anyway, moving onto Q3. In summary, I'll say it like Q3 was a very good quarter for ANSYS in many respects. In fact, it was the highest revenue and earnings quarter of any third quarter in our history. And this morning, we reported revenue growth of 16% in constant currency and 12% EPS growth, or $200 million in non-GAAP revenue and $0.74 in non-GAAP EPS. This was in the midrange of our guidance for revenue and beyond the high end of our range for earnings. This yielded deferred revenue balance of $306 million, which is also a new record high for Q3.","Both software and maintenance revenues grew in double digits. All 3 of our major geographies delivered double-digit constant currency growth and our industry composition remains strong as we maintained our diversity, while leveraging our continuing strength in various sectors, most notably this quarter, including Automotive, Aerospace and Defense and Electronics and Semiconductors. Now we also added a significant number of new logo-ed customers to our global base. Now I mentioned these because they're usually, initially, not high-volume account, but a good number of them grow over the 3 to 5-year time frame. And then we also, of course, continue to see expansion in our major accounts where we're inversely all of the top 100 industrial companies of the world. I think most importantly, this was accomplished while we maintained the core tenets of our long-term vision and focus to deliver on our key commitments. We continue to focus on efforts and investment on building our business and capabilities for the long-term. I'm thinking of some -- if I get to throw out a few examples of this, the recent acquisition of Esterel, a commitment of our new corporate headquarters in 2014, and the release of ANSYS 14.5, which is coming up next week, as just a few examples.","Now I acknowledge that the overall macro-environment and customer sentiment turned out to be increasingly, at least much more cautious as we finished out the quarter and as we focus on closing out the year, and think this is a pretty similar to what a lot of people are seeing and we've been seeing as we ended up the last part of third quarter. And we don't see any clear signs of that changing anytime soon. So with Q3, in the rearview mirror and one quarter left in 2012, it looks to -- it's like more of the same. The result is, that we've adjusted our outlook for the year and it\u2019s based on the following factors: first, and the overwhelmingly -- biggest one is the economic and political realities that our current environment with all the uncertainty and concerns around the continued slow growth, elections, fiscal cliff, what's going to happen to taxes, we just aren't hearing any of our customers talk about year-end budget flush or excess spending. So we've factored in the challenge that we and many of our customers are facing into our guidance.","Second of all, we have also updated for currency because, since the beginning of the year we've had, probably, somewhere around mid-teens in terms of currency headwinds on that, narrowed the range for the fact that there's a single quarter remaining in 2012, so any shift out of the quarter also means movement out of the year. And, of course, we've included the strength of our Q3 earnings performance into that. So this all translates into non-GAAP revenue for the full year in the range of $798 million to $805 million, and we are maintaining our full year earnings outlook in the range of $2.83 to $2.86. Our Q4 outlook of $215 million to $222 million in non-GAAP revenue and EPS of $0.71 to $0.74 does not factor in any of historical year-end spending that we've seen in past healthy Q4, but it still represents a respectable 7% to 10% growth off of a strong comparable last year.","It appears really to us that the uncertainty in today's world has been fostering, in fact, demanding a more patient wait-and-see attitude from some of our customers. And since we're really not seeing it, none of our customers, nobody seems to be talking about year-end spending surges, we're just not -- we're not even going to assume that it comes. But if it does, and we could be at the high end or even beyond the range. And if it doesn't, just like our Q3 results demonstrates, we are a very sound business model, supported by strong fundamentals, solid customer relationships and a committed team that will work to navigate the business through the current economic challenges and continue to build for the long-term.","Now with respect to a preliminary outlook for 2013, we considered basically more of the same from the general macro perspective as we've seen in 2012, at least from anything we can see at this time. We've also factored in a full year of Esterel, continued strength in our renewals and ongoing investments in the business. And basically what this translates to is our initial outlook of $885 million to $910 million in non-GAAP revenue or a 10% to 14% top line growth, and then $3.00 to $3.12 in non-GAAP EPS. Now more details around currency rates and other key assumptions are contained in the prepared remarks that we posted on our Investor Relations homepage earlier this morning.","We're going to stay at a very high level on the 2013 assumptions, for purposes of today's discussion, because as I said earlier, we're in the process of prioritizing and finalizing the details around hiring, capital and overall investments for 2013 and we'll provide more insight at the time of our Q4 earnings call.","We also see no signals that the environment heading into 2013 will be dramatically different from 2012, so this is our very preliminary outlook on 2013. We're still in the midst of finalizing all the details around our annual plan, and so for now, we're being cautious in our approach and assuming that, basically, 2013 will not be a whole lot different from what we've been seeing as we close out this year. And a point that I would like to make, actually for both Q4 and 2013, is that there's really no loss in our short-term ability to harvest revenue upside should those opportunities occur or should there be surges out there. The customer -- the software is there, the customer relationships are all in place and they continue to be solid. So basically with those brief comments, I'd be happy to open up the phone lines to any questions that you may have. So Maureen, you can release them.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be Richard Davis, Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So quick question. With regard to this quarter, I think you kind of touched on it, but including -- or if you exclude Esterel, the organic growth rate looks to me to be about 7% in the quarter. And then kind of layering on that on the services side, it looked like there was a bit of a deceleration there. Is that a leading or lagging indicator, or a non-indicator to kind of future growth, which kind of just bakes into the thought process as to how de-risk the -- your view of the estimates are?","James E. Cashman","Right. Well, the first thing is, yes, for the organic, again, keeping in mind that Esterel was very small, but it's a -- it would be -- it was around the 7% to 8% range. And remember last time, we did say that it would basically, probably be somewhat equivalent to -- at least nibbling away a lot of the currency headwinds that we were seeing, and that pretty much was the case. Second, could you just rephrase the second part of the question?","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes, yes. Services kind of -- the services kind of were a bit less than what we thought. Is that the leading or lagging indicator as to your future growth? Because I'm just trying to triangulate around how firm the outlook is, that kind of thing.","James E. Cashman","Understood. Actually, I would not really treat service as a leading indicator, because over last -- I think last few quarters, we've talked about evolving the services business. Basically, we've got a really powerful channel that does a lot of the traditional bodies for hire, project type of work and things like that. And -- but we've been trying to evolve toward the, what I'd say, not services as a leading indicator but services as a future enabler of capabilities, which really gets to how do companies more effectively utilize the new levels of simulation that are available out there. And that's turned out that, that's actually required a lot of methodology workflow, just not utilization of the tools, but embedding the utilization of the tools into the workflows of companies and helping them kind of evolve their own engineering processes while, of course, maintaining their own product qualities internally. And so that's going to be -- that's actually going to be a multiyear, a couple of year kind of evolutionary step, but that's kind of the buildup. So you'd actually see kind of a -- more of a cross-over in there. So I'd say, if you look at the numbers right now, don't treat it as a leading indicator. But it is something that's -- independently, you would probably see that we would want to be building up as a result of some of the new capabilities we've put out are really pretty unique out there and it takes companies a while to actually fully embed them in their design processes.","Operator","Our next question is Steve Ashley, Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering if you might be able to tell us for Esterel, what kind of revenue contribution you're looking for, for maybe the fourth quarter and for 2013?","James E. Cashman","Again, let's keep in mind that Esterel is a -- we think is a long-term strategic element but it's a very small numeric portion of it right now. So you might see something in the $4 million to $5 million range for the quarter. Now of course, non-GAAP because a lot of the things are going to be actually deferred in GAAP because of the way -- because we didn't have the objective evidence to base that and then the -- you were asking also the margin?","Maria T. Shields","2013 contribution.","James E. Cashman","Okay. The 2013 contribution should be somewhere in the low 20s.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And you are clairvoyant. I was now going to ask about that Esterel margins so maybe you could comment, I know that next year you're kind of guiding 47 to 48 and how much...","James E. Cashman","If you look at that, Steve, and this is not really atypical. They ran a very sound private business. They were actually we are prudent one, but the margins, of course, weren't very high. And if you look at it, they'll probably be in the mid-teens kind of range, arguably in there. And I'd say that, if you look at their expense base, it isn't like it's a -- it isn't as uniform, for instance, throughout the year as [indiscernible] might be because they might have -- because of the smaller denominator, they might look lumpier when they have a major expenditure or year-end kind of computation, but just to give a high-level kind of metric on that. Does that cover you?","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I\u2019m Good to go.","Operator","Our next question is Perry Huang, Goldman Sachs.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just want to ask a question about deferred revenue. It looks like short-term deferreds were down about 7% sequentially, which is a touch lower than I think a typical 4% decline for September. But at the same time, the mix of lease to paid up licenses was little bit higher for September quarter. So I was just wondering if you're seeing customers signing smaller-sized deals in general and maybe in particular, for lease?","James E. Cashman","Well, there are some and in these times when people get a little bit more nervous, there is that kind of a characteristic. However, you also see a couple of other things where -- with Apache, some of those tend to be longer term leases and therefore, that's why you've seen -- I realize you broke between the short and the long-term base, but that contribution plays a lot. And also some of those longer term leases are things that we just started to look at from an overall ANSYS standpoint. So I think those will cause -- but we didn't see anything that really drove outside of expectation for us, following kind of a usual burn down during the Q3 quarter, but again, the highest deferred balance we've had at this point in our history, at this point of the year, I mean, I'm sorry.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And just as a follow-up. For Japan, the weakness on the consumer-electronics segment, it looks like been ongoing for about 3 quarters now. As you kind of talked to your Japan customers, just, I guess, how were they kind of thinking sort of the stabilization in their business?","James E. Cashman","Well, obviously,  some of those -- in fact, I was over in Japan just recently and I'll just say that those kind of conversations are ones that they normally don't -- they won't bleed their heart out internally. But they're going through a lot of issues, there actually are some significant layoffs. The general tenor I've got is that Japan is not sending signals that they're officially leaving the electronics business. However, they're trying to do some stabilization right now and that's translating into a cautious environment where they're really kind of realigning their assets and then looking how they're going forward. So the general tenor was that they're -- like I've said, they're not vacating the space, albeit, they have felt some pressures that are pretty well covered in the press, but they still got some pretty significant talent and assets and company there. So at least there are long-term prospects with us at least seem reasonably good. I think they'd have a chance for rebound on that","Operator","Our next question is Ross MacMillan from Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jim, I think your Q4 guidance implies some further deceleration in your software license revenue and I'm just curious as to when you're thinking about guiding for Q4, what do you think -- I guess the big picture question is, what do you think is -- what's the notion around no flush? I guess, I'm curious around that idea. And then secondarily, are there any particular vertical industries that, feel like, they're being incrementally more cautious than others?","James E. Cashman","Okay. On the first item on Q4, the -- well, obviously, if we tweak the guidance down, a lot of that is going to be -- some of that is going to be felt in the license range. But when you ask about the no year-end budget flush, normally around these times, we are -- people are starting to talk about, well, if I have this, could we accelerate this program forward. I think the thing is, as opposed to seeing programs accelerate forward into Q4 because people have available funds, they're actually sitting there saying, let's really watch what we spend until we have a lot more -- a little clearer insight as to what's going on in some of the macroeconomic, political front. So that's -- I mean, basically, if you take out what we normally see in terms of the year-end thing, you're seeing basically the -- kind like the whole definition. But the thing is that, so far, that's not been indicated as business. It's just business, it isn't going to pull forward to take advantage of year-end budget money. It's projects, are they going to go into 2013? That's why I'd reiterate that we are actually maintaining the growth ranges in the rate that we've been signaling before. Now apart from that, I haven't seen any -- I've seen very few places where people are not demonstrably, visibly and consciously cautious on what they're doing. That's happening in Europe. It's definitely at some -- as we've mentioned on the previous call, in Japan. And we're certainly not seeing a cavalier effort -- attitude in this country. So I mean it's really -- it's pretty global. And from that standpoint, it's really pretty much, I wouldn't say that it focuses on any one industry, but I'd say that the industries where we still have one, have probably the most resiliency are where they are actually coming under different forms of pressure, such as regulatory pressures, like for noise, or mileage standards, or pollution or things like that, where they're actually being driven and they just can't just kind of sit still and coast. So we are seeing those -- a little more resilient, but boy, are they still being cautious to. Did I get all aspects to your question?","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Definitely. And just on cost, Maria, I think this year has been a year where you had been looking to accelerate hiring. You came into this year thinking that margins would be down 100 basis points plus, for the year. Just as we circle back and think about operating expenses and the run rate that we are at now, is this a function of you realizing more efficiency, more cost synergy or is it still the issue around the pace of hiring? Just curious to get a sense for that.","Maria T. Shields","I'd say it's a combination, Ross. We still have, even as we exit Q3, we still have over 100 open positions. Many of them in R&D, technical support, AEs and sales, and yes. So the ability to find -- and many, especially in the R&D and comp science, is a challenge. And not only that, but no doubt, we have in our discretionary spending, whether it's travel or marketing or -- we've tried to be disciplined in light of what we see our customers -- or what's happening to them relative to layoffs and just a much more cautious tone in how they approach their business.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, if I could just squeeze one last one, and it's on housekeeping. Do you have the sequential impact from FX on deferred? Do you have that to hand?","Maria T. Shields","Yes. $2 million.","Operator","Our next question is Greg Halter, Great Lakes Review.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Looking through the prepared remarks, I guess, on Page 3 ,where the discussion is Apache. Growth there, obviously, looks pretty strong in triple digits in some areas. Just wondered from small bases and some of those areas, of course, just wondering what's behind that growth? I mean are you seeing the...","James E. Cashman","Well, Greg, just before you go, I'm sorry, I thought you were finished. I didn't mean to cut in. But keep in mind that Apache had 2 months in the comparable year of last year and 3 months this year. I don't know, that may explain a lot. Because apart, the performance has been pretty much on target and pretty linearly increasing. I think that may identify most the difference.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. And if you had to strip that out though, what kind of growth is Apache seeing on a core organic basis?","James E. Cashman","It's in the upper teens to 20 range.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. And given the acquisition of Apache and Esterel, I wonder what your M&A appetite is balanced off, on the share repurchase with this stock up about 9% this morning, so far?","James E. Cashman","Well, I have to say that, based on anything that's short-term happening right now, I mean I got to tell you, my finance colleague may wring my neck here, but it really doesn't change the long-term perspective. And share repurchase is always -- is something that we're taking to account because, a, we think it's a good investment, it's a good use of cash, I mean, and we're also mindful of judicious use of the stock, in terms of our employee retention and building what we've done over the last decade. From the M&A standpoint, there's really nothing that changed there. The one thing that changed really is, as time builds up, our capacity actually increases. If you look at the combination of the cash flows and cash in multiple parts of the world. And to us, it continues to be a -- basically, an inexorable push to get the technology continue to a level where our vision wants to drive it, and a lot of that we do with our internal investment. But if we can find the right acquisition, that fits in at the right time, it gives us a big leg up on the technology, with already proven customer base and, by the way, and Maria and I were mentioning about the 100 people because you know we're maybe a little picky on the team we build and gain those people. Well, with the acquisition you also tend to pick up a lot of already proven, well-oiled people. So both of those things really -- regardless of what might happen in the short term, I mean, it might tackedly [ph] impact our interaction in many one month or so, but over the long haul, that really doesn't change, really, anything that we've been saying for many, many years.","Operator","Our next question is Blair Abernethy from Stifel.","Blair H. Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Jim, I just wonder if you can comment a little bit on the pricing environment, as demand is slowing a bit here and, obviously, customers are more cautious. Is that impacting your pricing, in particular around lease and maintenance renewals?","James E. Cashman","No, really I have to say there is -- right now, there's no change. I kind of maybe try to harken back to what happened in 2009, where even at this point in time we saw no change. And if conditions dictate it, they might push toward a short-term lease kind of standpoint. At that point in time, there were lots of requests for discount. But our pricing has been very stable. The customer reaction to the pricing has been stable and so, really, there's not just -- there's really not a lot of change on any of that aspect. Of all the things we're dealing with, that probably is not even in the upper half of the issues. It is really the overriding message, I don't want to beat this to death, but I guess I will anyway, is that there's just a lot of things where people are exerting a lot of caution right now and it's like nothing's disappearing, but everything is dragging out. And like we said, we perceptibly saw that even toward the latter part of Q3 and all intents we see going into Q4. If it turns out that something magically happens, I mean, we're seriously -- we have no problem harvesting that. But again, we built kind of history here of talking about what we see and what we're really seeing. We try to do that in our 2012 Q4, as well as our -- the statement of the 10% to 14% growth in 2013.","Blair H. Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just a second question, if I can, Jim. I'm wondering if you can give us a bit of an update on progress in the channel particularly around your Electrical Products business?","James E. Cashman","Well, keeping -- actually, great question and I'm going to give you an extended answer. So as we've always talked, it usually takes about a year before the lead channels get certified, both from a business model and a technical excellence standpoint. So if you look at it now, about 3, 4 years into the End Soft [ph] acquisition, we've got channels that are making positive contributions into that. Now by contrast, with Apache, for instance, which has only been on board for a year, actually we've been going a little bit slower on that because it is a much more concentrated user base and we're able to actually address that more from an account standpoint than from a regional channel standpoint. We'll be able to enlarge that over time, but I think we've already seen that we've been able to maintain and actually grow the prospects there. And frankly, it will be similar thing with Esterel. A very small company, a very good company, but a new emerging technology base for us. And then as such, we're not going to unleash all of that on a team that would be -- might have difficulty supporting all the requests that came in with their relatively small staff. So again, it's been made very evident, as soon as we announced that we had some customers who actually calling in, asking for greater clarity, I mean, there were people that it immediately resonated with and so we're thinking much more of a rifle shot along that path. But we utilize the same methodology. But people will have to learn a new branch of simulation technology, they'll have to actually pass technical certification and then they'll have to present a business case that doesn't show -- that basically shows how they get the same commensurate, disproportionate growth that we're expecting from it. So it's going to be the same thing, but again, these are multiyear kind of standpoints. But to close on your specific is, yes, we're already seeing the impact of that earlier heavy lifting in the early parts of our Electronics Simulation business, with the End Soft thing and on a rifle shot basis, we're starting to see some traction and co-selling between Apache and ANSYS customers. In fact, one of our top 5 accounts right now is a very significant, mutual legacy customer of each that where we continue to grow.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Koenig, Wedbush Securities.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I'd like to bill down a little bit on Ross' question earlier, in terms of the -- you talked about the lack of budget pull forward that you're not expecting basically on Q4. In terms of translating that to guidance, what are you assuming for close -- how does that translate to closed rates or pipeline coverage assumptions for Q4? Compared either to Q3 or to a year ago Q4? And then I have kind of second part of that question, too, if you don't mind.","James E. Cashman","Can I answer that one, so I don't lose track of the 2 questions, if you just bookmark it for a second? It's really -- it's not a whole lot of change. The only thing is, the pull forward of the flush that happened Q4. So Q4 -- a Q4 standalones are pretty typical, but what isn't typical this time is, at this point, we are normally hearing about customers that are trying to say, well, what if we could pull this forward, what if we had this amount of money to spend? And there are those kind of discussions going on at this particular time. That's really the whole different, but it doesn't -- it doesn't really affect the pipeline, because the pipeline there was just a matter of, when did the pipeline is empty? Secondarily, it doesn't really affect the close rates, per se, because the closed rates were not a normal close in an expected Q4 timeframe as with our forecasting discipline. It were things where many times a customer was initiating and driving those forward. So that's a little bit different than our traditional view of a closed rate. So that -- hopefully, that covered that part and then you said you had a second part or?","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I do. But just a follow-up on that. And Jim, your guidance is a little more cautious certainly than I think the Street expected for Q4. What are you do -- what mechanically is causing that then in your guidance, if it's not the closed rates?","James E. Cashman","Well, again, it was a definition -- obviously, if you have more business, you close less business. But what I'm saying is, the closed rate normally is saying, here's what we're forecasting for this customer here, here's what the forecast says and here's what we have to do to make that happen. The things that come in from the earlier quarter -- I'm sorry, from outlying quarters, are things that are normally brought in by the customer and while you got a historical norm that says, this typically happens in this typical kind of economy, and that's what we kind of factor in for the year. You don't have -- you don't necessarily have that, any of those discussions that are going on, in the middle of the year. They start to trickle in at the beginning of Q4, when companies get a chance to see what they're doing, and then outlying their overall prospects. And all I'm saying is that, that part of the things that are being pulled forward, actually more by the customers than by our efforts. Those things -- their caution is translating basically into the absence of that kind of activity. And that's really the difference of the story right now.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then, if I just may, this is related. Europe actually looks pretty good in constant currency terms this quarter. In terms of your go forward guidance here, what are you assuming about Europe and are you making any differential assumptions about weakness in Europe versus weakness in North America or Japan or elsewhere?","James E. Cashman","Well, first of all, yes, Europe was doing pretty well and basically it's a testament to 2 things, we got really some good customers there and our team performed admirably in there. Yes, we did. The one thing that maybe doesn't come out in there, I'd say that every part of the globe, it wasn't like one -- every part, any one part was monolithically great, and the other part was monolithically bad. It was really more along the lines that each one had big pockets of strength and that, frankly, some of the parts of Southern Europe, which are relatively smaller ones for us, they felt some of the pain. But Europe, the team there is strong. They did a good job. The customers there are great for us, too.","Now if we move into 2013, the first thing I'll put is a big caveat on there saying, keep in mind Q4 this year isn't over. We're still doing a lot of the final planning. So I mean a lot of this is getting into a level of precision that would be far beyond what we've really honed it down to. However, we are taking a more sober look toward Europe, looking at it being roughly equivalent, a little bit tougher, I mean, and then right now, who knows, on what can happen to the currency and things like that. That we're really trying to build that. If you look at that, the bulk of -- when I talked about the currency headwinds that we ate throughout this year, oh my gosh, the lion's share of them, I mean, a strong majority of those were European, that came in. And nevertheless, they still posted pretty good. But so, those things can blow a lot of different ways, but we're not expecting -- let's put it this way, at best, we're not expecting anything a lot more promising out of Europe.","Operator","Our next question is Jay Vleeschhouwer, Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Jim, within your current active base of licenses, are you seeing anything on the margin whereby customers are utilizing their existing licenses more intensively, making more use of existing capacity rather than adding new licenses? So maybe you could talk about current customer usage trends, then a couple of follow-ups.","James E. Cashman","Well, the current usage trend is, our main customers actually are increasing licenses. However, one trend, that we -- and we've actually I think we've chalked off now, this maybe the fourth quarter is there is a definite increasing trend toward High Performance computing licenses which, again, somewhat analogous to as opposed to buying a bunch of extra computers, buying a bunch blades of to shove into the system to get additional computation along. There are probably 3 major reasons why people are doing this. A, is they're being a little cautious in the hiring of new potential users. Second of all, they're actually solving -- trying to solve bigger problems than traditionally they use to let prank [ph] on different clusters or unit processors. And probably, the third one is, in some of the -- the third case we probably see is when they're \u2013 under a lot of pressure either to hit a design cycle, a date, or hit some kind of a design goal and the calendar is a big enemy. But I'd say right now, at this point in time, the intensity factor, the high performance computing factor is outgrowing the just the pure base C cal [ph] even though that is also growing, but it's skewed toward the more intensive usage.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Within the ANSYS space that is keeping Apache on the side for moment, could you talk about the relative performance of the traditional, structural, mechanical side of business versus CFD?","James E. Cashman","Well, like I said, they've all been pretty much on par, they're all pretty much with the company. So I mean, if you looked at -- I think we mentioned that, for instance, both -- all of the aspects kind of grew double digits and each of the geographies grew double digits in constant currency. And we only don't do a lot of constant currency split on some of the business line things because just the way we track them. But you probably look at that kind of a double-digit, really, kind of across-the-board, it wasn't like there were any extreme laggards or people that were way outside the norm.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in answer to an earlier question about lease and maintenance pricing, you said you hadn't seen a change, but as best we can tell competitively your largest competitor, against whom you are still considerably larger, however, they do seem to be growing more quickly than you on a constant currency basis. And so I'm wondering if, in fact, you are seeing any increase from Desou [ph] or any of the smaller competitors?","James E. Cashman","Well, definitely really not  former. I'd say, at any one time, I'd say that there's always 1 or 2 competitors that cycle in and have relatively high points. Sometimes it's numbers -- growth numbers look bigger off a lower denominator, there are a lot of things. But in terms of the competitive environment and then actually, let's just say, published numbers versus anecdotal numbers, really, don't see much change.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","And lastly, for Maria. Does your 2013 guidance -- for 2013, Maria, does your guidance encompass any appreciable change in the proportion of revenues from top 10 or top 100 customers?","Maria T. Shields","No.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","For 2013?","James E. Cashman","Again, you're probably getting to a level of granularity that where we really aren't. I think that you would -- we continue to see trends where the top 100 probably grow a little slightly disproportionately because they are on the rapid acquisition part. But by the time you span it over the entire business, it really doesn't move a dial in any big direction.","Operator","Our next question is Sinil Bepterer [ph] from Sentinel Investments.","Unknown Analyst","Jim, about the guidance for 2013 when you look at revenue growth of 10% to 14% at constant currency, your earnings growth is not growing at that rate. Can you give the puts and takes on that?","James E. Cashman","Yes, well, first of all, the second thing is we've been talking about still investing for the long-term because -- but the other thing, the main important part is that you got a blending with some of the -- first of all, you've got a blending with the lower margins as a result of some of those business we talked about, over a couple year period, will blend in there. The second thing is, quite frankly, the share count increases also, the diluted share count it cuts up, so with more accounts, the EPS goes in. Which, is one reason why we talked about -- that's one of the reasons why we have had an active buyback period, which we took advantage of this particular year and things like that. So the other thing is on the margin, keep in mind we had guided this year to the 48% to 49% level and then, of course, on numerous parts of this call, we talked about -- first of all it's difficult to hire those top decile type of employees. Now we have been bringing them on, albeit, slower. But the thing that will probably factor in is that, if you look at 2013, we will have those employees for a full year where we might have only have them for 1\/4 to a 1\/3 to 1\/2 of the time we expected to have them that year. That tends to bring up the personnel costs also. But it's really a good story, it's actually, frankly, we wish we've had been able to get some of those people earlier.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. You talked about cautiousness in general. Now is it any -- concentrated in any specific geographies or it's across the board? And what verticals do you have seen most cautiousness because you thought that Automotive, Aerospace and Defense, Electronics and Semiconductors being the good areas, but if you look at Japan and probably look at Asia, Semiconductors, Electronics has been weak. So can you just expound on that?  Where did you see that or what geographies you've seen that cautiousness?","James E. Cashman","Well, the caution spans the globe, first and foremost. So I might say that, that's the theme, that's the general theme. Now, theme and variations, there are variations in each different realm. So for instance, while China has been good for us, I mean, a lot of times they're in this -- we think they're in their 12th 50-year plan, and the first year of it normally has kind of a slowdown and some deactivity, but then they build up in the second year once they get through the budget. That's one particular aspect. If you look in India, some of the things that have been going on with the tax environment, that tends to predominate. If you look in Europe, you've got a number of different factors, everything related to a sovereign debt to a whole range of fiscal issues come into play. Here, general tax, political, whole sorts of environments in there, so it's kind of like the caution has been across-the-board and it's not like each one has different factor. If you look at industries, again, the ones that are under pressure to, again, automotive, we think has been a little bit stronger because of the drive toward high-efficiency and hybrid vehicles. You look at mileage standards, you look at the increased safety regulations. If you look at Aerospace and Defense, I can probably parse that down between aerospace and aero engine performance versus maybe some more subdued defense spending in certain areas. If you look at the energy industry and what happened a couple, 3 years ago. Nuclear was starting to really pick up and then slowed down a little bit after Japan and then oil went up $140 and people got really excited in other forms of alternate energy. Now oil is back down. So you see some investment flows that ebb and flow through all those things. But in general, come think it's just an overall -- it's the overall level of the ocean and all the other things are different people are seeing different waves, here and there.","Unknown Analyst","There was a question on about one of your competitors growing faster than you. Do you think that you are  -- you're position is weakening in that area versus -- vis-a-vis the competition. Or you think that your position is still strong? Given the difficulty of finding people, do you think that going forward for 1 year or 2 years that you're not able to find enough people, your competitive position may weaken? Or you may have to pay up more to buy these people and have a headwind on the margin?","James E. Cashman","Well, that's really not the issue. The other thing is just a kind of the -- the situation is, at any point in time, anybody is going to -- I mean, while we don't have a single competitor across-the-board, we've got about 20 or 30 people that all poke on different aspects of it and they all tend to be smaller, so a growth rate might be in the short term smaller. Sometimes these are private companies, sometimes, again, it's anecdotal reporting and things like that. So it's really difficult to speak. If you look at the overall supposed size of the thing, if you look at the overall market, we're holding or gaining in each of the major sectors. Now that's looking at major sectors. What happens any given period of time, any year, any quarter or something like that, there can always be spikes that put it up and down. But I mean, we tended to look at the overall issue and continue. And I think that's probably borne out in some of the longer-term and the sustained growth rates over the long-term. To answer to your question about investment, yes, if we didn't hire anybody and we didn't continue to innovate and renovate internally, of course, that's going to -- that would affect the business. But our situation has been one of probably hiring 3, finding 3, 4, 5 months slower than we would like. It's not a question of doing it or not doing it and it's certainly, not doing it over long-term. So I mean if you look at it we've got close to 900, approaching 1,000 people in R&D today. So I mean and the other thing is if you look at the product that people are using right now, it has literally persons centuries of development already into the code and we're really trying to take the lead in terms of pushing the new kind of capabilities out there. So it's really not even -- that's not even a maintaining parity kind of thing, it's actually continuing to progress this to the next level. And those are the things that we really don't want to lose scope of.","Operator","Having no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Cashman for any closing remarks.","James E. Cashman","Okay. Well, basically, in closing, emphasis to the remainder of 2012, it's going to be execution, customer development and, of course, an operational discipline. Again, if you haven't picked up through the course of this call, there's little doubt about the long-term opportunity, but in the short-term, there's a continued vigilance as customers and their increased spending, scrutiny, the diligence in their investment decisions, they've led the longer sales cycles and actually a staging out of the decision. So we tried to factor all these realities into our guidance and like we try to do for almost forever, continue to endeavor to do so going forward. So but despite these economic and political uncertainties that dominate the headlines, everybody's seeing them, we're still -- at the heart of what we are, we're still propelled by a combination of a long-term vision, a business model that I think is navigated through a range of economic conditions, cost of oil customers that are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me out there and they stay loyal to us, the partners who have been with us for decades, great and unique technologies and, of course, the base of employees that continues to help keep this ship going through all sorts of weather. So I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning and, again, our best wishes for everybody out in the East Coast and we'll talk to you in a few months. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"2189":["ANSYS, Inc.

Please note, this call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks.","Annette Arribas","Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release and the related prepared remarks documents have been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website this morning. They contain all of the key financial information and supportive data relative to our first quarter financial results and the business update, as well as, our Q2 and fiscal year 2017 outlook and the key underlying assumptions.","I'd like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available on our website.","Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance, as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future.

Ajei?","Ajei Gopal","Thank you, Annette and good morning, everyone.","I have been CEO of ANSYS for just over four months, and I\u2019m delighted to join you today to discuss the results of Q1 2017, which is my first full quarter as CEO of this great company. These are exciting times at ANSYS.","As you saw in our earnings document, we started 2017 with a record quarter that exceeded the guidance we provided in February. I\u2019m especially pleased with our revenue growth of 13% in constant currency, and with our booking performance that resulted in record deferred revenue and backlog of $653 million, which is a leading indicator of the ongoing health of our business.","We\u2019re also off to a fast start in Q2 with continued momentum from the higher growth that we just experienced in Q1. Our excellent performance this quarter coming on the heels of a strong Q4 is a testament to outstanding teamwork to a strong focus on go-to-market and sales execution, and to our world-class solutions and to reflect our performance, we are raising our 2017 annual revenue guidance. Maria will go into more details in her section.","The merger of the physical and digital world is creating an unprecedented disruption, resulting in a new generation of innovative and transformative products that are significantly more complicated to design and manufacture than anything on the market today. Simulation is the most important solution companies have to help them address product complexity and accelerate time to market.","As I said in our last call, ANSYS 18, which we released in Q1, expands simulation from digital prototyping, upstream to design engineers, and downstream to the manufacturing, operations and maintenance of products.","We call this pervasive engineering simulation, and we believe it will transform the industry. We are not alone in that belief. A record number of customers and prospects participated in our ANSYS 18 virtual product launch, and in follow-on webinars and in-person events.","Our customers recognize and value the innovations we are bringing to market. Let me give you an example.","As you know, additive manufacturing and 3D printing are transforming product development Topology optimization, one of the exciting new innovations in ANSYS 18, finds the optimal shape for a part based on loading and support criteria.","The result is a lighter yet stronger part that saves the manufacturer money, and is perfectly suited for both traditional manufacturing, as well as the additive manufacturing process. In the two-plus months since it has been released, over 500 customers across the automotive, industrial and aerospace industries have taken advantage of ANSYS topology optimization.","Customers are increasing their commitment to ANSYS. This is a testament to the strength of the ANSYS product portfolio and the strong technical relationships we have built with our customers.","For example, in Q1, Eaton Corporation, a leader in power management and a customer for over 20 years, increased its adoption of ANSYS simulation solutions through a new agreement. The company now has access to the full suite of structures, fluids, electromagnetics, embedded software and system solutions, enabling it to standardize on ANSYS as a single-simulation platform, thereby accelerating innovation and reducing costs.","This new agreement will also allow Eaton to move simulation upstream, to allow design engineers to use simulation early in the design phase, thereby preventing costly late-stage design changes, and to move simulation downstream to incorporate Internet of Things technology into product design and create digital twins for new products","In Q4, Pratt & Whitney, also a customer for over 20 years, expanded its use of ANSYS technology through a new multi-year enterprise agreement that gives it access to a broad range of ANSYS products.","Of special importance to this aerospace innovator was ANSYS\u2019s ability to support collaboration across global engineering and product teams. In addition to increasing adoption, our vision for pervasive engineering simulation is also helping us drive competitive displacements.","In Q1, a major automotive chip manufacturer expanded its use of our semiconductor products, effectively replacing the competition. Recognizing that safety-critical automotive applications require the sophisticated power and reliability analysis that only ANSYS can provide, the customer has adopted our solutions across all process nodes for its designs going forward.","It\u2019s not just long-established customers who are benefiting from pervasive engineering simulation. In our latest success in the space 2.0 revolution, a North American channel partner closed a seven-figure agreement in Q1 with a disruptive company in the commercial space sector.","The company will use ANSYS technology to design its innovative new rockets, and expects to improve simulation time by 20%. Pervasive engineering simulation continues to help democratize our solutions, and expands the use of ANSYS technology from our traditional user base to design engineers and to smaller companies.","Using ANSYS AIM, Jet Towers, a small and innovative manufacturer of telecommunications towers in Brazil, has developed a better understanding of the performance of its towers, and has reduced wind drag and removed unnecessary material from its products. By doing so, Jet Towers gained a five times delivery advantage over its competitors.","Now, let me give you some color into the performance of our sales regions. North American revenue grew 17% in Q1, including over 20% growth in lease revenue. This is further evidence of the shift in preference for time-based licenses that we have highlighted in recent quarters. Electronics, aerospace and defense, and automotive were the strongest industries again this quarter.","Driven by strong performance in China, Japan, India, Taiwan and South Korea, Q4 results in Asia-Pacific included 15% revenue growth and 21% increase in perpetual revenue, both in constant currency. We had double-digit growth from our indirect channels in the region, which was offset by slower growth in our direct business in South Korea. From an industry perspective, electronics was by far the strongest sector in Asia-Pacific, followed by industrial equipment and automotive.","Our softest region was Europe, delivering constant-currency revenue growth of 5% in Q1. France led the region with 19% constant-currency growth for Q1, albeit off a weak compare. Our business in Germany reported mixed results with the channel delivering double-digit growth that was offset by the performance of our direct business. We also continue to experience challenges in the U.K.","Our performance in Europe, while disappointing, is in line with the challenges that we highlighted in the last earnings call, and we are taking appropriate actions. With regard to industry performance in Europe in Q1, automotive, electronics, aerospace and energy all contributed relatively equally.","I\u2019d like to talk about a major and strategic account program for a moment. A few years ago, we started down a path of building deeper relationships with our largest customers, and I\u2019m delighted with our ongoing success. We have reported our progress with major accounts using two metrics.","First, the number of customers with orders in excess of $1 million in the quarter and in the year. And second, the number of enterprise agreements. We have continued to show strong progress in both metrics. In Q1, we had 31 customers with orders in excess of $1 million in the quarter, including five who spent over $5 million. This compares with 22 customers who spent over $1 million in Q1 last year, including one customer with orders of over $5 million.","In Q1, we closed four enterprise agreements. This compares with one enterprise agreement in Q1 last year, and 18 for the fiscal year 2016. Going forward, however, we will continue to report on the number of customers with orders in excess of $1 million, and we will not be reporting on the number of enterprise agreements.","There are two reasons for this. First, our definition of enterprise agreements is overly constraining. I would prefer to give Rick Mahoney the ability to structure the right relationship with the customer, one that optimizes the value to ANSYS rather than focus on whether a deal can technically be classified as an enterprise agreement under a legacy definition.","Second, based on Rick\u2019s years of success with strategic selling and large transactions, we are further investing in and evolving our major accounts program. Our goal is to build increasing momentum in our largest accounts through a repeatable and measureable model.","So, through a combination of strong account planning, pragmatic execution, and to mapping the specific needs of each customer to ANSYS\u2019s differentiated capabilities, we believe that we will increase our value to our customers, increase customer loyalty, and grow our revenue and share of wallet. We will be discussing more of our plan with major accounts during the upcoming Investor Day in September","I\u2019d like to turn to M&A for a moment. Our Medini acquisition in Q4 is showing early success and has been integrated into the ANSYS sales channel. I\u2019m excited that we closed our first cross-physics Medini sale. This was to a semiconductor company for components targeting the automotive industry. This is further proof that our multi-physics strategy drives cross-sell within our customer base","In Q1, we acquired the assets of CLK Design Automation, a small company that provides exciting technology to address timing and voltage variability for sign-off for high-end mobile processor design. Although the company\u2019s revenue is not material to our financial outlook, the technology will be a strong addition to our semiconductor portfolio.","I\u2019d like to turn to M&A for a moment.

Matt is an outstanding executive with an impressive track record of executing both large and small acquisitions, and building strategic partnerships.","He brings strong financial knowledge and acumen, and a deep understanding of how a large and complex software company runs. In addition, he was part of the management team that transformed Ariba to the cloud, fueling its growth and a nearly 400% increase in share price. Matt has already made an impact in his short time here, and I look forward to telling you more about his successes on future calls.","As I said in the last earnings call, we at ANSYS are working to reinvigorate our top line growth while preserving our commitments on our strong margin structure and cash flow. I am very excited and proud of the progress that we\u2019ve made over the past few months, and I am more confident than ever in our ability to execute.","However, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. We have a number of ongoing initiatives on the sales front. First, Europe remains a top area of focus for us in 2017. As I mentioned on our last call, we have already made key leadership changes and operational changes in Europe, and we will continue to take actions to improve sales execution and sharpen our go-to-market strategy in the region.","Secondly, as already described, we will be evolving our major account program. And third, we will continue our efforts to expand the indirect channel, especially in Europe and North America.","On the product side, we continue to invest to address the ADAS, additive manufacturing and Internet of Things opportunities, and also continue to improve our capabilities in cloud and machine learning.","From an infrastructure perspective, we are in the middle of implementing a new CRM system, which is, of course, critical to our go-forward of sales effectiveness. We also need to modernize our HR information system to allow us to more effectively manage our worldwide workforce.","And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financial results in a little bit more detail. Maria?","Maria Shields","Okay. Thank you. Ajei.","For the next few minutes, I\u2019ll add some additional perspective on our Q1 2017 operational performance, touch on some key financial highlights, and also comment on our Q2 and fiscal year 2017 outlook. Also, just a note, I will be commenting in terms of non-GAAP, unless I otherwise state.","The results of Q1 reflect solid execution across most aspects of our business. This enabled us to deliver both revenue and earnings, which exceeded the upper end of our guidance. Key highlights include total revenue of $253.5 million for the quarter, a y-over-y growth of 13% in constant currency.","Our Q1 revenue includes a negative currency impact of $1.8 million. Recurring revenue for Q1 was a hefty 78%. Our ability to consistently maintain a solid base of recurring revenue remains one of the hallmarks of our business model. Sales bookings growth outpaced revenue growth in Q1. This was driven by a combination of the 31 seven-figure deals which were closed in the quarter, including five customers with orders in excess of $5 million.","We also reported increases in software license sales and solid maintenance renewals, both of which contributed to deferred revenue and backlog of $653 million, representing a new Q1 record high and 29% growth as compared to Q1 of 2016. This positions us well for Q2 and the remainder of 2017.","In Q1, we achieved a gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 46.4%. We reported EPS of $0.89, representing 16% growth over last year\u2019s first quarter earnings. Q1\u2019s GAAP earnings included approximately $9.3 million or $0.07 per share related to our previously announced workforce realignment.","Currently, we expect to incur additional charges of $2 million to $4 million or $1.3 million to $2.8 million net of tax primarily during Q2 2017. Our operating cash flow for Q1 totaled $126 million, a 14% increase over last year\u2019s Q1, and we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $867 million.","Keeping with our commitment to return capital to our stockholders, during Q1, we repurchased one million shares at an average price of $100.35. There are 4.5 million shares capacity remaining in the authorized repurchase program.","Now, let me spend a moment on our current outlook. We\u2019ve initiated outlook for Q2 with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $254 million to $263 million.","This represents constant-currency revenue growth in the 6% to 7% range at the midpoint, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.88 to $0.93. I\u2019d also like to mention that last year\u2019s Q2 results included $0.03 tax benefit that will not repeat this year.","With respect to fiscal year 2017, we are increasing our outlook to factor in our Q1 performance, our outlook for the remainder of the year, and movements in currency since we last provided guidance in February. This translates to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.058 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of $3.68 to $3.85.","We\u2019re targeting non-GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 88% to 89% for the quarter and the year, and non-GAAP operating margin to 45% to 46% for Q2, and 46% to 47% for fiscal year 2017.","Further details around specific currency rates and other key assumptions that we factored into our outlook for Q2 and for 2017 are contained in the prepared remarks document.","Kate, we'll now open the phone lines to take questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Anil Doradla","Hey guys. Good morning. And very impressive results. Congrats to you all.","Ajei Gopal","Thanks Anil.","Anil Doradla","So, Ajei, so thanks a lot for sharing your new philosophy around the enterprise-level agreements and using the million dollar as kind of the -- as kind of a tipping point in terms of highlighting the number of deals.","But just digging a little bit onto that, why are you using the million dollars as kind of the -- as the milestone for highlighting the number of deals? Is there something around the million dollars which leads you guys to believe that once you touch $1mm dollars at a client, the prospects are more often better than not? Can you help us understand the philosophy behind that?","Ajei Gopal","Sure, Anil. I mean, we\u2019re being very pragmatic here. The million-dollar number is something that we have reported over a number of years. So, if you go back all the way to 2007, you\u2019ll see how we\u2019ve done against million-dollar deals. We wanted to give you some continuity so that you could continue to see the growth that we\u2019re driving in our larger accounts. So that was the rationale behind that.","Anil Doradla","So it isn\u2019t like because we had -- we used to look at ELAs, right? And ELAs was the way for us to view the company in terms of how it\u2019s shaping out. So, what I\u2019m trying to really get at is the million dollars versus your previous ELA commentary, what is the correlation there?","Ajei Gopal","Well, let me give you a little bit more, perhaps a few more words around why we\u2019re trying to move away from this counting of the enterprise agreements on the call.","Look, as you know, we have increased our focus on building strategic relationships with the largest and most important customers, and success in major accounts will play an important role in our business.","And our goal and our objective is to try to build a platform between the customer and ANSYS, which aligns both the customer\u2019s short-term and long-term objectives with our capabilities and our long-term road map. And we want to create an opportunity for the customer to maximize their use of ANSYS technology.","And frankly, if we do this, we believe that we\u2019ll be able to optimize our financial relationship with the customer, and this might result in a sequence of transactions that happen over time over multiple quarters.","We\u2019re trying to move away from a constraining definition of enterprise agreements that we\u2019ve used in the past. So, let me make that very specifically concrete. So, our current definition of enterprise agreements that we\u2019ve reported to you requires that the agreements span multiple physics.","Now, suppose you have a large customer who\u2019s ready to standardize on ANSYS Mechanical, as an example, but they\u2019re not yet ready to engage on the additional physics.","So that standardization could represent a huge enterprise relationship. But if you operate under today\u2019s definitions, the sales team would be trying to shoehorn other physics into the deal even if the customer is not ready.","I would rather, instead, that the sales team focus on the long-term opportunity with the customers, which is to choose to close the agreement on standardizing on ANSYS Mechanical, whether it happens to be classified technically as an enterprise agreement or not, and then expand to include multiple physics when the customer is ready.","So that\u2019s what I mean by building a platform between the customer and ANSYS. It\u2019s the mechanism by which we can continue to monetize the relationship on an ongoing basis. And our former definition forced us to think very transactionally while we believe in the long-term platform.","And as a result, with some of our customers, we are in a position to close multiple deals. Even after we have closed large enterprise agreements, we continue to do deals with customers. And so, we feel like this ongoing activity is a better view of the nature of this platform relationship between us and our largest customers.","Now -- and we\u2019re excited about the million-dollar metric because that -- by looking at that metric, you can clearly see the growth of our -- some of these larger relationships with our customers.","Anil Doradla","Very good.","Ajei Gopal","And finally -- yeah. During Investor Day, you\u2019ll hear more about this from Rick and myself. We will talk a little bit more about our strategy for major accounts. But obviously, Rick brings enormous amounts of credibility and expertise there based upon his experiences in the past.","Anil Doradla","Great. And as a follow-up, Ajei, and by the way, thanks a lot for clarifying that, that helps. I know it\u2019s not a very fair question, but nevertheless, I will ask. You\u2019ve embarked on kind of a reorganization of the sales force. Europe was identified as an issue, you\u2019re seeing that. I know you\u2019re in the midst of many changes, but in what innings are you in relative to Europe in terms of turning it around?","Ajei Gopal","Look, we made some changes in Europe that we reported on last quarter that included some changes in leadership and management. It included some changing of territories and redefining sort of our countries or the regions, if you will.","And, of course, I talked about how we\u2019re changing some of our go-to-market strategy, how we\u2019re dealing with a finer segmentation. I talked about some of our channel relationships and how we\u2019re trying to broaden some of the channel relationships in Europe.","All of these things take time. We believe that we\u2019ve made very good progress so far. We believe that we will continue to make progress through the year. We\u2019ll see early results of this towards the end of the year, but we expect the broad-based financial impact to start to make its presence known in next year and the latter part of this year.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ken Talanian","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. You saw a healthy uptick in perpetual licenses in the quarter. I was curious, was most of that growth coming from APAC? And as we look into the rest of 2017, could we see perpetual licenses actually grow for the year?","Maria Shields","Yes. So, Ken, absolutely. If you recall, for the past several calls, I\u2019ve been highlighting that while some software companies are making a push towards all subscription, we\u2019ve chosen to remain flexible so that we cannot lengthen sales cycles in particular geographies where customers still prefer perpetual models, and Asia-Pac happens to be one of those geographies.","So, we believe that based on our current guidance and based on our current visibility, that we should see some modest growth in perpetuals. But I don\u2019t believe it will be double-digit unless something changes in second half that we don\u2019t have visibility into. But we are very happy that our Asia-Pac region, our hybrid licensing model enables customers to adopt our technology.","Ken Talanian","Okay. And I was also curious. Has there -- just sort of bigger picture question. Has there been any change in the percentage of your customer base who\u2019s adopted multiple physics? I know you talked about the desire to push that over a longer period of time rather than sort of forcing it through an ELA, but I\u2019m curious as to what the trend has been.","Ajei Gopal","So, when we look at the top 100 customers who tend to be the larger customers who buy more and have more sophisticated products, a lot of them tend to be multiphysics. I would say approximately 35%, 40%, somewhere in that region, are adopting multiple physics for the large customers.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Maria, let me start with you and ask about the relationship of perpetual with maintenance revenue. So, over the quarter and for the trailing 12 months, maintenance continued to substantially outperform the perpetual license revenue.","In 2016, for example, perpetual revenue was down 5%, maintenance up 8%. And then now, for the trailing 12 months ended Q1, perpetual\u2019s down 2%, even with the uptick in Q1; and maintenance up 9%.","So, given your historically very high correlation between maintenance and perpetual, could you perhaps talk about why the maintenance revenue growth would continue to be so much stronger than the corresponding perpetual? Then a follow-up for Ajei.","Maria Shields","So, Jay, I think it\u2019s a combination of not only what happened in the current quarter, but previous quarters\u2019 paid up strength also result in increase in maintenance revenue. We continue to have extremely high renewal rates and attach rates on the maintenance.","And then, of course, in Q1, you will also see some of the impact of the price increase that we announced with the latest release in late July. So, I think those are really the three combining factors that drove the strength of the maintenance revenue in Q1.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. For Ajei, we track your bookings by end market fairly closely, and it\u2019s good that you disclosed those percentages. When we look back over time, including Q1 and on a trailing 12-month basis, it\u2019s generally the case that you have one or two or maybe three end markets that most contribute to your bookings growth.","More recently, as you noted, you had -- auto and electronics were quite good for you in the quarter, and last year, of course, in Q4, electronic, semis and A&D were the main drivers.","The point I want to bring out is that your industrial equipment segment has been lagging for some time now, partly due to tough comps perhaps. But could you talk about when you think you\u2019re going to start seeing some momentum in that category as you have in the past? And then more broadly, does your guidance encompass an assumption of double-digit bookings growth for all of 2017, as you showed in Q1?","Ajei Gopal","So, I think look, your point about the -- Jay, it\u2019s a good question about the industries. Obviously, we\u2019re seeing enormous strength in electronics. We\u2019re seeing enormous strength in automotive, aerospace and defense, semiconductors.","These are areas that have been performing significantly above perhaps the past. I mean the automotive sector, for example, with electrification and with ADAS, the level of investment continues to accelerate there. So, we\u2019re seeing, in some sense, outperformance in some of those areas.","Certainly, if you think about industrial equipment in the aggregate, oil and gas has been somewhat depressed for a while. And we would expect that as the oil companies adjust to a new reality or oil prices start to change, they may be some in what that looks like.","That being said, of course, we are not just in exploration, we\u2019re also in pipeline, and we continue to sell into that part of the oil industry as well. But obviously, oil and gas fits into our view of the industrial equipment market, and there\u2019s been some downward pressure there.","I\u2019ll let Maria answer the question about bookings.","Maria Shields","Yes. So, Jay, our current guidance would -- if everything on the high end would go well, could result in double-digit bookings growth for the full year. However, I will caution that there\u2019s two major factors that could yield high single-digit growth. First being, as we get into second half, our Q4 comparable will be extremely challenging.","With that being said, we also have a number of multi-year deals that are in the pipeline. And the timing of when those close, whether they be Q4 or Q1 of 2018, will also have an impact on where we finish relative to the growth in bookings. So, it is very possible. However, I will caution that there are some things that could yield some of those deals shifting into Q1 of next year just based on timing of closure rates, so.","Operator","The next question is from Monika Garg of Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First on Q1, Q1 much better than expected. Maybe can you walk through more details what led to beat? And also, when I kind of model the guidance for Q2 and rest of the year, it seems you are -- in Q2, your midpoint is about 5%, 6% growth, and second half, the guidance implies less than 5% growth. So, given such good performance in Q1, why would we see such deceleration in rest of the year?","Ajei Gopal","So, let me address the issues about performance in Q1, and then I\u2019ll hand the question over to Maria. So Q1, Monika, look, I think we approached Q1 with the focus on execution. And we were very clear about making sure that we got off to a fast start within our sales organization. And we did a number of things that were tactically important, as well as strategically set the stage for a very strong year.","From relatively simple things like moving our sales kickoff meetings earlier in the year to being thoughtful about how we drive the start-of-the-year activities around ANSYS 18 and so forth. So, there were some, I would say, sort of thoughtful execution.","And then, of course, we\u2019ve had Rick Mahoney, who\u2019s our new VP of Sales. Rick came on board. Rick has a particular view on how he wants to drive accountability and execution in the sales organization, and that\u2019s been tremendously well received and been tremendously successful.","So, it\u2019s been a combination of execution. It\u2019s been a combination of fresh sets of eyes on the company, and our ability, most importantly, to work as a team across ANSYS to make sure that we can support the needs of our customers in the best way. So, I\u2019m very proud of the work that\u2019s been done this quarter, and a lot of it is just about execution.","Maria Shields","And, Monika, relative to your question regarding outlook for the full year, and particularly, second half, what I\u2019d say is our current outlook considers a number of factors.","First of all, as I mentioned on the earlier question, as we get to second half, the strength of last year\u2019s Q4 will make the comparable in this year\u2019s Q4 a little bit more challenging. And as you heard in the prepared remarks during the script, we are cautious about Europe.","It is going to take us the better half of 2017 to do a lot of the heavy lifting that we\u2019ve got ahead of us, and to begin to see the fruits of our labor. And we\u2019re also a little bit, relative to the larger deals, to the extent that the mix of those deals shifts toward leases, particularly the trends that we\u2019ve commented on in North America, that could have an impact on short-term revenue.","So, I just think it\u2019s Q1. We\u2019ve got good visibility, but there are some moving parts that could yield differences in short-term revenue recognition under the current rules, but result in better bookings growth for the long term.","Monika Garg","Got it. Thanks. Then, Maria, on the 606 revenue recognition, you\u2019re shifting model -- or you\u2019ve seen more lease -- ELAs than lease revenue. So how do you think that could impact that lease revenue line? Thank you.","Maria Shields","So, Monika, not unlike what we have been saying for at least a quarter now, no doubt the standard\u2019s final. And while there are interpretations that the FASB and the powers that be are working through, as some of the people understand that the volatility that\u2019s going to be caused by the new standard is going to raise, we still, working with our independent auditors and some of the consultants that we\u2019ve brought on to help us through this transition, believe that we will have to recognize a portion of those leases upfront because of our model.","And that it will have a material impact on revenue recognition in any given quarter, and have implications relative to deferred revenue. We\u2019re working through all of that. And when we have better visibility as we get into the second half, we will share some of that at Investor Day.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Congratulations on the very nice results. Just wanted to sort of follow up on that line of questioning, particularly if your perpetual licenses, as I think, Maria, you indicated you thought could be flat for the year, are, in fact, flat, it\u2019s sort of challenging to get to your overall full year revenue number given that the other two line items in your revenue, sort of your revenue statement, the lease licenses and typically maintenance tend to progressively increase as the year goes on.","So just trying to -- wonder if you could give a little more color in terms of the lease line or the maintenance line, how you\u2019re thinking about those lines for the full year in the context of a perpetual license line that was flat to sort of get to your full year revenue guide. Thank you.","Maria Shields","Yes. So, I would say at the low end of our guidance, it would assume in constant currency perhaps negative to flat, which would mean we would continue to see growth in the lease and maintenance lines.","And at the higher end of the guidance, depending on mix and the timing of some of the deals, we would see, I would call, mid-single digits perpetual growth, as well as stronger growth in both the lease and maintenance lines as the drivers. And service, we\u2019re continuing to see some growth, albeit off of a much lower denominator.","Rich Valera","Got it. And then looking at the industry segment data that you provided, it does look like, over the past couple quarters, that the semiconductor segment has come back pretty strongly. Just wondering if you can provide any color on that, what\u2019s driven that and how the new Apache product is fairing out in the market, the new RedHawk product. Thank you.","Ajei Gopal","So, look, we -- firstly, to address your question about the new architecture, we believe that the SeaHawk, SeaScape architecture, we believe it\u2019s a great game changer because essentially, what SeaHawk does is it combines the big data architecture that we\u2019ve been working on as part of SeaScape, and it combines that with our capabilities which allow chip designers to essentially do the power -- to meet their power and performance goals, while reducing the need, if you will, for overdesign to make sure that they\u2019re being conservative.","So, I think we\u2019ve proceeded very well with SeaHawk. We have a number of engagements under way. We\u2019re seeing tremendous interest.","More broadly, this is an example of our commitment to continue to innovate within our portfolio to maintain the leadership across all of our physics so that we can dig that technical moat that separates us and our competitors. We can dig it deeper and wider from a position of strength.","More broadly, in the semiconductors, as we see customers moving to advanced process nodes, 60 nanometers and below, the designs are becoming more complex. The risk of failure is really high. And so, customers are driving more and more simulation. And that drives more and more use of our technology. And certainly, with the big data analytics, we\u2019ve become much stronger.","And so, we\u2019re very excited about that movement, it plays directly to our strength. And then when you start to think more broadly about where the industry\u2019s going, it\u2019s not just about the chip itself, it\u2019s about how the chip fits into the package, into the system.","And that chip package system requirement is driving the need for multiple physics. Again, it\u2019s not just the semiconductors, you have to understand the thermal, the mechanical, the structural elements of this. And so, that again leads -- brings in the ANSYS portfolio.","So, we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re seeing more customers now. Think about silicon, not just the traditional semi guys, but also the systems guys are building custom silicon to capture their intellectual property. Think mobile devices, etcetera. So, we\u2019re very excited. We think the technology gives us a good start, and we think that the market is very strong for us.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Oliver of Robert Baird & Company. Please go ahead.","Matt Lemenager","Thanks, this is Matt Lemenager on for Rob. Thanks for taking our question. Is any part of this acceleration in bookings coming from pushing upstream to design engineers who maybe weren\u2019t using your product for simulation in the past vs. the historical market of core analysts? I\u2019m just trying to parse out maybe where that acceleration is coming from.","Ajei Gopal","We certainly have customers who are up and down, traditional analysts, as well as designers, now taking advantage of our technology. But I would say that our growth is coming and being driven from our core business and the strength of our core portfolio within our flagship products. Because obviously, that\u2019s -- the denominator\u2019s sufficiently large when you start to think about growth.","Some of the emerging products that we put out there are relatively small. With a large denominator, the growth is being driven by the growth in our flagship offerings. And so that\u2019s driving usage, not just within the traditional base, but of course, within the designer community as well within our existing customers.","Matt Lemenager","Great. And this is for\u2026","Ajei Gopal","Did that help?","Matt Lemenager","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And for Maria, I don\u2019t know if I missed it on the call. Is there an update to the full year cash flow guidance?","Maria Shields","Yes. We are updating outlook on cash flow to $365 million to $385 million for the year.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Schappel of Benchmark. Please go ahead.","Mark Schappel","Hi. Good morning. And nice job on the quarter. Ajei, the company did exceptionally well in North America this quarter. And with that said, though, the discussion of late has really been around the operational changes in Europe. So, I was wondering if you\u2019d just discuss a little bit about maybe some of the changes you\u2019ve made in North America just to help drive these good results.","Ajei Gopal","Well, I think we had a very strong team in North America. We have a leader in North America who\u2019s been in his position now for a while, and we have a set of lieutenants below him who are very skilled at what they do.","What Rick has been able to bring on board is a set of discipline around execution, a focus on the basics. It\u2019s just looking at forecast, being very disciplined about forecasting; looking at deals, doing analysis around especially some of the large deals, which, of course, continue to be very important for us, doing an analysis of what they look like, making sure we have customer engagements.","And so, we certainly have better execution. We\u2019ve got a very mature market. We\u2019ve obviously been in the North America market for a long time. We have a long history with our customers.","And if you take, for example, the comments I made in my prepared remarks or in the script around Eaton Corporation, for example, or Pratt, in both cases, these are long-established customers. Their needs have continued to change. They\u2019ve historically bought a set of products, but their needs have continued to change. Their vision has changed. They\u2019re looking at IoT.","They\u2019re looking at ADAS manufacturing. They\u2019re looking at the use of design engineers. And they\u2019ve come to us as a critical strategic partner, and they\u2019ve asked us, how can we stay ahead of this curve, this industry arc that\u2019s changing? How do we get ahead of this? And obviously, we have answers for these customers.","And so that\u2019s what\u2019s leading to some of these larger transactions, that\u2019s what\u2019s leading to some of this success in the field. So, our strategy of multiphysics, our strategy of being a simulation specialist, our strategy of making sure that we have the right solutions for the customers ahead of their needs, that\u2019s paying off.","And so, we\u2019re seeing better sales execution. We\u2019re seeing the impact of great relationships with customers over the years. We\u2019re seeing the impact of a great team, and we\u2019re seeing the impact of really great products that are the best in the industry.","Mark Schappel","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up here, obviously, a lot of internal initiatives going on at the company to drive sales, that\u2019s good. But based on the good revenue and bookings numbers we\u2019ve seen the last couple of quarters, is it fair -- I would assume it\u2019s fair to assume that the overall demand conditions are also improving as well. Is that correct?","Ajei Gopal","Yeah. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the overall demand is improving, especially around areas like the electrification, if you will, of the electronics everywhere. And you\u2019re seeing that clearly as a trend. Products that were traditionally not sort of electronics, if you will, and not electronics-enabled, these things are now IP addressable and there\u2019s more electronics in the bill of materials everywhere.","So, for example, in a car, 35% of the bill of materials of a car is electronics now, and it\u2019s going to go raise to 50%. All of that leads to and points to our strengths, which is strength in electronics and strength across multiple physics.","So, yes, there is some improvement, but it\u2019s also not just the macro, it\u2019s also the fact that our products are perfectly positioned for where the demand in the market is. And I don\u2019t necessarily -- I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s just one or the other, it\u2019s both. There is some demand, but clearly, we have the best products in the marketplace.","Operator","The next question is from Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks so much and congratulations from me as well on a strong quarter. Ajei, I had just a question in terms of maybe changes to the sales compensation. I was curious if you\u2019ve put anything in place or Rick has put anything in place this year, or indeed, if it happened last year, that\u2019s fundamentally different than what preexisted.","And related to that, has there been any change on the cadence of lease deal renewals? I\u2019m just curious as to whether lease renewals are happening in the timeframe that they sort of normally would be expected to renew or whether there\u2019s anything changing on that cadence of renewal. Thank you.","Ajei Gopal","Yeah. So, to your point about sales compensation, we put in place the bulk of the compensation structure for the sales team. Last year, we put the model in place kind of at the end of last year. And obviously, we\u2019re incenting our sales people to win business, and that\u2019s where the variable compensation comes from. And so that\u2019s how the variable compensation is structured.","This year, at the start of the year, one of the additional things we did to drive the fast start that I talked about is we put in place a small spiff for deals that were brought in earlier in the quarter.","And so, for deals that came in above a certain threshold level, so the larger deals that came in above a certain threshold but that came in earlier, there was a little bit of incentive put in place as an incremental spiff for the sales organization. And so, we\u2019ve done a little bit of that as well.","But for the most part, the sales organization is being incented on new business. And that\u2019s the basis by which we\u2019re driving the organization. Yeah. And by the way, equally so for the channel, the channel also has a similar incentive around driving and closing new business for us.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks. And just on that spiff, is that something that you will not carry through to subsequent quarters or is it something you plan to keep in place this year?","Ajei Gopal","It was a one and done for Q1. So, it was a Q1 fast start, and it was only for the first part of the quarter, so it\u2019s in the past.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Steve Koenig","Hi everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. My first question I want to ask you, I just want to maybe augment Mark\u2019s question just a little bit here.","You talked about in terms of improving North America, acceleration there.","You talked about the sales execution and leadership, that\u2019s been a change in terms of something different in ANSYS. You did agree that there\u2019s a secular demand trend towards more electronics, you pointed out to. But I\u2019m wondering in the demand environment, is there also a cyclical component? What are you seeing there in terms of kind of market conditions?","Ajei Gopal","Well, each individual vertical is different. I mean, oil and gas has its own parameters. But for the most part, we\u2019re seeing essentially a continuation of what we saw in Q4. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s been any dramatic difference between Q4 and Q1 that we can discern.","There\u2019s always been this trend towards electronification, if you will, if that\u2019s a word, and some of the other metrics that I talked about. So, I don\u2019t see any fundamental difference between Q4 and Q1.","Steve Koenig","Okay. And then on the follow-up, I\u2019d like to ask about initiatives at the lower end of the market, where you\u2019ve been growing more slowly, you\u2019ve been growing very fast at the high end of the market. What\u2019s -- anything new for the low-end and what\u2019s your thinking there in terms of what things you might want to pursue?","Ajei Gopal","Well, I\u2019ll sort of make two observations, one is around channels. We have continued to make investments in the channel, and our channel gives us reach into customers that we would not historically be calling on ourselves.","And you can see from the performance of the channel, the channel has done really well. We\u2019ve driven double-digit growth, for example, in our channel partners in Asia. And I think that they are -- that\u2019s been very helpful for us, bringing in a number of new logos into the company through the channels.","The second part of the answer is if you think about our product offerings, I mentioned this briefly in my remarks, we introduced Version 3 of our AIM offering in ANSYS 18, and that is obviously seeing some good traction with customers.","And I would say something like 60% of the customers to whom we\u2019ve sold that product are new logos to ANSYS. And that is something that the channel has been able to embrace, as well as -- and its still early days, of course, for that product. So, yeah. So, I mean, we\u2019re seeing our ability to get there driven through both product, as well as channels.","Operator","The next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Saket Kalia","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Listen, most of mine have been answered, but two quick modeling questions for you, Maria, if I may.","First, you mentioned that bookings could grow double digit for the year, and of course, some of that, as you said, will come from some multiyear contracts. Can you just talk about how you think about current bookings growth or maybe annual contract value growing for this year?","Maria Shields","Yeah. I would think that if you look at the bookings growth and the current in Q1, they were very similar. So, to the extent that the timing and the mix hold up based on our current visibility, I would think that they would be -- the current portion would be similar. It may be a little bit impacted by timing.","Saket Kalia","Got it. And then you can tell by all of our questions, we\u2019re all trying to understand sort of the driver behind the big deals strength. So, I\u2019ll ask you a different variation of it. How will you, qualitatively, of course, think about some of the big deals strength in terms of contracts up for renewal vs. expanded usage?","Maria Shields","So, I would say it\u2019s a combination of both. I mean those deals that we highlighted in prepared remarks and in the script, those 31 seven-figure deals and those five over $5mm, not only are they renewals, but there is also expansion of new business. So those are customers, and two of them that Ajei highlighted.","We have had decades of relationships with some of these customers, particularly in North America where we started and where a number of the companies that we\u2019ve acquired over time started.","So, the goodwill and the brand recognition that we\u2019ve been able to develop with these customers as they do tool consolidation, as they make changes in their business to deal with additive manufacturing and IoT, and digital twins and all of the things that are relevant to them, we are uniquely positioned because of those decades of relationships to help them through their own transformation.","So, it\u2019s a very exciting time for us given the breadth and depth of our portfolio, and how we can help our customers to continue to solve the problems of tomorrow.","Operator","The next question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Yeah thanks. Hi guys. Can you just remind us what was included in guidance and what the contribution in the quarter from the Medini acquisition was?","Maria Shields","For the full year, I think the Medini acquisition is relatively immaterial, it\u2019s about $2mm, and the contribution for Q1 was probably a quarter of that. It\u2019s not material, it\u2019s early in the day, but we were excited, as you heard Ajei talk about, the integration of that and having the opportunity now to leverage our installed base and those customer relationships to grow that given that, that Medini technology is very much aligned with some of the current things that are happening relative to our customers.","Sterling Auty","Got it. And then\u2026","Ajei Gopal","Yeah, and that allows us to drive a conversation -- I\u2019m sorry. Just to amplify what Maria said, that allows us to drive a conversation with our customers about if they start to think about these next generation, for example, of vehicles, we can drive a discussion about safety and that broadens the discussion down to the multiphysics strategy. So, it\u2019s a symbiotic relationship driving the business forward.","Sterling Auty","And on that point in terms of auto, given the strength that you\u2019ve had, can you update us, at this point, where do you see the biggest concentration of ANSYS usage within the automotive market? So, what area of automotive, design, simulation, where are the biggest use cases?","Ajei Gopal","Well, look, traditionally, if you go back a decade or so ago, a few years ago, traditionally, it\u2019s been -- it was in structures, it was in thermal, it was in fluids, looking at things like integrity, vibration analysis, looking at aerodynamics, looking at combustion for thermal and so forth. That\u2019s where traditionally it\u2019s been.","Where it\u2019s evolved to is now things like electric motors. So, companies that are building electric motors are using our technology to help design these electric motors. It\u2019s evolved to electronics, so antenna placement. So, for example, as companies are thinking about vehicle-to-vehicle or V2X or go V-to-anything, it\u2019s where would you place the antenna.","If you start to think about -- as you start to think about ADAS, then it becomes much more sophisticated because you\u2019re dealing now with essentially, a supercomputer on wheels. You\u2019re dealing with a very challenging environment, and that requires a lot of electronic simulation.","Of course, multiphysics simulation as you start to think about vibration and its impact on electronics, for example. There\u2019s opportunities with embedded software, and we\u2019ve had some success there with our SCADE offerings. Certainly, we\u2019ve talked about Medini and our opportunities there.","So, there\u2019s a new standard, the ISO 26262, that\u2019s driving sort of a standard set of requirements that the automotive manufacturers have to comply with, and that\u2019s something that our products allow them to easily comply with. And that, again, gives us a strategic advantage.","So, historically, we\u2019ve been in sort of structures, fluids, thermal, etcetera. And increasingly, as the bill of materials of the car migrates, goes from 35% electronics to 50% in the future, we\u2019re seeing the electronics part of our portfolio, the embedded software part of our portfolio, the safe -- all of that come in as well in addition to our traditional strengths.","Operator","The next question comes from Erik Karlsson of Bodenholm. Please go ahead.","Erik Karlsson","Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on the major and strategic account program. We have seen some acceleration in bookings and sales growth here, which is very positive for us shareholders, of course. But do you think there\u2019s incremental upside from this program as you improve the focus even further here?","Ajei Gopal","Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. We see incremental upside. We see our performance continuing to improve. We see -- as I mentioned in the script, we had, I believe, four enterprise agreements as compared with one enterprise agreement this time last year. So, we continue to drive progress forward. We\u2019re excited about this at the relationship.","And as we were saying earlier in the relationship, for example, with Eaton Corporation, we\u2019re a trusted vendor. We are in a position to engage with the customer as they themselves are thinking about how to respond to these changing market demands of IoT, et cetera, additive manufacturing. And we\u2019re in a position with the right solutions to come in to help have that conversation with the customer. And obviously, that drives more business for us.","So, we believe that our relationship with these large customers is very strong. It\u2019s based on a very robust platform, a robust foundation. And we have the ability because of our capabilities and because of the technical relationships that our ACE team has been able to build with the customers.","We have the ability to then drive that conversation forward towards incremental opportunity. And so that drives both new business, as Maria was saying, as well as our ability to renew the portfolio. And that\u2019s where the strength of the franchise comes from.","Erik Karlsson","Very good. And a question on cost as well, if I may. You were investing for growth in a number of initiatives, such -- R&D, sales force incentives, HR and so on, which is really very positive. Where have we already seen the increase in the SG&A costs due to this? And where do you think there are more costs to come in the quarters ahead?","Maria Shields","I would say across the business because each component of the business, each functional line item, we have a lot of exciting opportunity. Now, the challenge will be the prioritization of those opportunities and the sequencing.","But I believe you will see continued investment in innovation, in R&D, particularly around some of the high growth opportunities that we see that Ajei mentioned around additive manufacturing, around IoT, around digital twin.","On the SG&A side, not only are we investing in some of the go to market initiatives in expanding the channel, but we\u2019re also investing in infrastructures such as CRM. We\u2019re working our way through the implications of the revenue recognition changes.","So, we\u2019ve had to bring in some outside parties to help us through that. So, there\u2019s a number of areas across the company that we\u2019ll continue to invest in because we really see the opportunity for longer-term growth, and we need to invest now to be able to capture that growth.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks.","Ajei Gopal","Great. Thank you, Kate. So, I\u2019d like to close by expressing my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners and a big shout-out to my ANSYS colleagues. Thank you for all your efforts and thank you for a great quarter. Thank you all for joining our call today. I look forward to our next conversation. Please enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."]}}
