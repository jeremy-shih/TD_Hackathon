At this time, all participants are in a listen-only model. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I'll now introduce your host for today's conference, Kerri Thurston, Director-Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Limited's first quarter 2015 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and the related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and the related transcript will also be available on our website.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products, and objectives, are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call, may not occur and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are, Cliff Pemble, President and CEO; and Doug Boessen, CFO and Treasurer.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Cliff.","Clifton Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier this morning, Garmin reported solid first quarter revenue and margin performance. Consolidated revenue was flat year-over-year, and what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. Revenue from aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor grew 9% on a combined basis. These segments contributed 63% of total revenue and 80% of the operating profit in the first quarter.","Gross margins improved year-over-year to 59% while operating margin came in at 19%. Slight reduction in the operating margin from the prior year reflects continued investments in advertising and R&D. The stronger U.S. dollars created a headwind for most businesses including ours. We estimate that recent currency movements reduced our revenue by approximately $38 million and operating income was reduced by approximately $11 million. As everyone can appreciate, these are meaningful amounts that would have otherwise resulted in growth for our business.","Please note that our pro forma calculations do not account for these factors, but we wanted to mention it for clarity. Strong margins combined with the lower effective tax rate resulted in $0.55 of pro forma EPS in the quarter which is flat on a year-over-year basis. We are maintaining the guidance we issued earlier in the year as our performance thus far is consistent with our expectations.","Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first I will walk through a few highlights for each business segment. Beginning with the fitness segment, revenue grew 31% on a year-over-year basis with strong contributions from activity trackers, multi-sport and cycling products.","We delivered gross and operating margins of 63% and 26% respectively. Operating margin was lower on a year-over-year basis, reflecting an increase in R&D and advertising investments during the quarter as planned. As you are aware, the fitness market is highly competitive and thus requires additional R&D investments in order to bring innovations to market faster. In addition, we are deliberately investing in our point-of-sale presence as we roll out new products and prepare the way for our spring advertising campaign.","In cycling, we announced the Vector 2 and Vector 2S, our latest pedal-based power solutions. These new vectors, simplify the installation process and deliver advanced cycling metrics that are useful for improving cycling efficiency. Fitness has been an exciting growth driver for our business in recent quarters, and we believe there are more opportunities to capture. We are well positioned with our current product breadth and depth, and we'll continue to invest for future growth and expansion.","Looking at outdoor, revenues declined 10% which fell short of our expectations as the currency situation disproportionately impacted both fitness and outdoor, due to the geographic revenue profile of these segments. Additionally, we experienced some supply constraints which affected our results. Despite these headwinds, growth in operating margins remain strong in the segment at 66% and 31% respectively, allowing us to deliver operating income growth on lower revenue.","Finally in outdoor, we announced the VIRB X and XE in all new family of action cameras. These cameras deliver a unique and massive experience through G-Metrix which adds insightful context to any video. In addition, our updated VIRB mobile application provides the ability to create, edit and publish videos on the go. We're excited about the capabilities of these new cameras and believe they offer unique differentiators on which we can grow in the category.","Turning next to aviation, we posted revenue growth of 2% as we faced some more challenging comparable from Q1 2014, when the segment grew 19%, while growth in operating margins remain strong, operating profit declined on a year-over-year basis due to R&D growth, supporting future revenue opportunities.","During the quarter, we announced enhancements to our ADS-B product offerings. Our current lineup offers the most comprehensive set of solutions across a range of price points in aircraft categories. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on modernization mandates around the globe, which are rapidly approaching. We continue to support numerous OEM partners in the development and certification of multiple aircraft and helicopter platforms, which will result in future growth opportunities, when these platforms reach the market.","Looking next, the marine revenue grew 7% in the quarter driven by the recent acquisition of Fusion. Our organic business was relatively flat on a year-over-year basis as we started delivering our new products in the latter part of quarter. Profitability improved in the first quarter, which resulted in operating income growth of 20% for the segment. While industry activity remains below historical levels, we've recognized the innovation is essential to deliver long-term improvements in market share and profitability. We will continue to invest in the category to deliver compelling innovation to recreational marine market.","In our auto segment revenues were down 11% in the quarter with PND industry volumes declining in line with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, amortized revenue declined creating a headwind is not correlated to the underlying business. As we have mentioned before, the segment delivered solid profitability as we continue to experience gains in global market share on the strength of our product portfolio.","As indicated in our February guidance, we expect the market to decline 10% to 15% on a global basis during the year. We will focus on growth opportunities in OEM, trucks, RVs, dash cameras and other specialty automotive products to partially offset lower consumer PND volumes.","Finally, I want to highlight the recent introduction of N\u00fcvicam, which is the first PND to offer advanced alerts such as Forward Collision and Lane Departure Warnings. N\u00fcvicam also includes an integrated dash camera that saves video images whenever a crash or user initiated event occurs. We are excited to deliver these advanced features to the PND market and we anticipate offering similar products to OEM customers in the future. So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Doug will now walk us through our Q1 financials in more detail. Doug.","Doug Boessen","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I would like to briefly review our financial results then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $585 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $106 million. Pro forma EPS was $0.55 per share excluding the FX loss.","During the quarter, we faced significant exposure of foreign currency fluctuations which resulted in a revenue headwind of $38 million or 6.5% of revenue. Taking into consideration the offsetting benefits, FX negatively impacted EPS for the quarter approximately $0.05 or 9% of pro forma EPS.","In addition, amortization of deferred revenue is now a year-over-year headwind, negatively impacted revenue by $14 million. Pro forma EPS was approximately $0.05. Excluding these headwinds, revenue growth would have been 9%. Pro forma EPS growth of 18%. Gross margin was strong at 59%. A 210 basis point increase from prior year, driven by favorable segment and product mix.","Operating margin was 19%, a 150 basis point decrease from the prior year. We will look at operating expenses by category on a later slide. Effective tax rate decreased to 12.3% in the current quarter compared to 16.6% in the prior year due to an improved income mix outlook for 2015 as compared to our outlook at the end of Q1 2014. We still anticipate a full year tax rate of 16% to 17%, so first quarter tax rate was positively impacted at least a $5 million of tax reserves to a percentage of lower pre-tax income.","In the quarter, we shipped over 3 million units, a 22% increase. Reduced average selling price in the quarter due to product mix, FX, reduced contribution from deferred revenue. Did not see any significant price reductions on like-for-like products.","Next, we look at how our first quarter revenue breaks down by segment. The auto segment represented 37% our total Q1 2015 revenue, compared to 42% in Q1 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base with growth in Fitness, Marine and Aviation.","I'd like to now briefly discuss gross margin which increased to 59% as segment and product mix was favorable during the quarter. Looking at year-over-year changes by segment, Outdoor, Marine posted a significant improvement with reduced discounting and favorable product mix.","Fitness gross margin declined slightly to 63%, remained strong with a full portfolio of products continued to perform well. Total corporate operating margin was 19% as operating expense growth outpaced revenue growth.","Excluding the headwinds from FX, amortization of deferred revenue, operating margin would have been flat. Next, we look at our operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $22 million or 10%, this is a 360 basis point increase as a percent of sales.","Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year, and 160 basis points to 18.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce, increasing resources, focused primarily on aviation, fitness, and outdoor.","Our advertising expense increased $3 million for the prior year quarter, represented 4.7% of sales, 50 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness, investments in point-of-sale presence with key retailer to produce long-term revenue results, in preparations for the launch, spring wearables advertising campaign.","SG&A was up $9 million, compared to the prior year quarter, increasing a 150 basis points as a percent of sales to 16.9%. Increased spending driven primarily by legal costs, IT expenses, and product support costs that customer base continues to grow rapidly.","Just a few quick highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $426 million, following the holiday quarter. Our inventory balance increased to $470 million as we have build inventory level to support the launch of new product categories, in preparation for a seasonally stronger second quarter. We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business with $64 million generated during the first quarter 2015.","During the quarter, we paid dividends of $92 million, repurchased $16 million of company's stock. The $284 million remaining for purchase in December 2016.","This concludes our formal remarks. Ashley, can you open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Simona Jankowski","Yes, hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask you first on any thoughts you might have on plans for sourcing your maps in the event that the HERE business from Nokia is sold to a vertically integrated vendor?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, Simona. I think we've always operated with HERE under long-term contracts. And so while the process that Nokia has been going through has been rather public, we don't have any concern right now in terms of what our massive supply situation will be.","Simona Jankowski","And because the contracts would go with the company.","Cliff Pemble","Yes.","Simona Jankowski","Okay. And then on the fitness business, you commented about an FX impact even with that it seems like it came a little weaker than I think we had expected. Can you just comment on the competitive environment there, and then specifically to some of the consumer feedback you had on thinking issues with the mobile app, what actions do you think you can take to address that in a timeline?","Cliff Pemble","Well, the market is definitely getting more competitive, as some of the major players are -- have or are introducing now their new products for the year. So we recognized that definitely the competition is getting more intense. In terms of our product feedback, of course we are very sensitive to that, and they've been working hard to improve our mobile app and product software in order to be able to be the most robust as possible. I think though that this is part of the reality of the mobile phones and Bluetooth connections, which are somewhat unreliable and software has to try to be as robust as possible, but there is still side effects.","Simona Jankowski","Is \u2013 do you have any visibility on the timeline to when you might be able to address those concerns?","Cliff Pemble","Well, we've already introduced updates to Garmin Connect mobile. And I believe this is working much better, and we also have a roadmap to release the update throughout the year as well.","Simona Jankowski","And then just last quick question from me on the legal expense which I think was the biggest reason for the increase in SG&A of 10%. What was that related to?","Cliff Pemble","This relates to some lawsuits that we have previously described in the 10-K, but some of those hopefully will come to a trial in the next few quarters.","Simona Jankowski","Okay. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as a request, we are asking you to ask two questions per person. Our next question comes from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Sue","Thank you, and good morning. I'd like to focus on Garmin's ability to grow operating income considering that EPS will mostly flat year-on-year this year. Particularly as we look at the two segments of outdoor and fitness where our competition is increasing, and you do have more entrants. Are we at a point where Garmin needs to spend more in advertising and hence spend more in point-of-sales to drive the incremental unit growth. How should we think about the balance between operating margin improvements, and your ability to grow earnings?","Doug Boessen","Yeah. Mark, it's absolutely true that that particularly fitness and somewhat in outdoors is more competitive. There is a need to invest more in advertising that's something that you've been seeing us doing over the past few quarters. We increased our investment in Q1 mostly around point-of-sale material, preparing the way for our new products and also spring advertising campaign that's coming up.","Mark Sue","Any thoughts on when that might actually start winding down or is this more of a full throttle push to drive that to the balance of the year?","Doug Boessen","So, right now, the market is growing rapidly and we are in a mode of gaining market share and so we are focused on that at the moment and taking advantage of the growth opportunity that's there.","Mark Sue","Okay, that's helpful. And Doug, maybe on FX, the volatility is quite high, any inclination to look at forward or options or even colors at this point because of the big currency moves, I know the cost of hedging is quite high at the moment, but maybe your thought, long-term on hedging?","Doug Boessen","Yeah. So with that we currently do not have intentions to hedge. We have not hedged historically. The foreign currencies will move up and down. So at this point in time, we don't have current plans to hedge.","Mark Sue","Okay. Thank you.","Doug Boessen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","James Faucette","Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a couple of questions, first from a high level perspective. I recognized that the first quarter is a seasonally weak quarter, but I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more broadly about where you're seeing strengths versus potential headwinds as we go through the rest of this year, and as you reiterate guidance kind of the things that you're feeling confident about versus what [indiscernible] ? And then I also wanted to touch on the \u2013 specifically the aviation business, I know that you are up against a tough compare versus last year, but how should we think about the growth prospects and particularly as new platforms continue to grow for the rest of this year and into 2016? Thank you.","Doug Boessen","Hi, James. I think right now in terms of strength and weaknesses, each of our segments is performing pretty much in line with where we would expect at this moment, still very early in the year, only one quarter behind us. So right now we are not changing any of our outlook in terms of the growth across each of our segments. And in terms of aviation, it definitely was weaker this first quarter, but we are up against a 19% growth in Q1 of 2014 when several new platforms hit the market at once. I would expect that the growth should increase as the year goes forward as new platforms hit the market particularly the Cessna Latitude as well as Cirrus SF50 and the HondaJet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Charlie Anderson of Dougherty and Co. Your line is open.","Charles Anderson","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I know it's only been a few weeks, but I wonder if you got any feedback yet from the retailers in terms of sell through of your fitness products since the Apple watches debut both on a pre-ordered basis and then now on chain.","Doug Boessen","Well, I would say just in terms of availability of the Apple watches only been a few days and in limited quantities, but that at this moment we don't hear of any or expect any significant change, our products are positioned differently than the Apple watch, and we appeal to a strong active lifestyles.","Charles Anderson","Second question from me, a number of your competitors in fact just have embraced the optical kind of on risk heart rate monitor you guys have always favored Chest Warn, I wonder as you think about product roadmap, you evolve to that feature and how much more expensive would it be to add it to the device versus this $50 premium that you are adding now for the Chest Warn.","Doug Boessen","Well risk heart rate is definitely a functionality that customers are embracing, and it's a differentiator for our competitors, we anticipate we'll close this gap in our product line in the near future.","Charles Anderson","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy David of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Jeremy David","Hi, good morning. Thank you taking my question. Two questions on the next-gen VIRB action camera. First on timing, your press release today, it stated that shipments will start in Q2, whether if I recall correctly the product announcement refer to a similar launch. So should we think of VIRB ramping in Q2 or more in Q3. And then my second question is going back to the launch of the initial VIRB, again a half ago, I think one of the issue you had was that not many retailers where interested in carrying the product in their stores. Do you believe that distribution for the next-gen product will be broader than for the initial product and if so, why would that be the case? Thank you.","Doug Boessen","Yeah. I think Jeremy, in terms of the timing of the product, probably it will be ramping in the back half of Q2. So that's that the timing that we're working with right now. In terms of retailer interest in this product, we do see much more interest in this product in our first VIRB, I think that the form factors appeals to people, the ability to use the product without a protective case is the differentiator and people are excited about the new enhancements we've made to our PC software and our mobile applications to be able to edit and publish videos easily.","So we're getting good feedback and \u2013 and we would anticipate that we will be able to have better distribution based on the strength of the product features.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Ben Bollin","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the call.","Cliff Pemble","Good morning.","Ben Bollin","My first question, when you look at the outdoor and the fitness business, you talk to the increased R&D, in advertising emphasis you're placing, how sustainable are you anticipating that investment to be, is that a 2015 event, is this a more perpetual event? And do you have any thoughts on the associated margin profiles of these businesses in a more normal environment, when you're \u2013 you're not pushing these expense line items as aggressively, and then I have a follow up?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. In terms of the R&D investment, and the sustainability of that, the markets right now are very competitive. And so, of course we have to innovate and bring features to market in order to be competitive and superior in our offerings. Right now, we see the growth opportunities in terms of \u2013 as the long-term look at that, I think these markets can move up and down very quickly. So we would adjust our business in our investment based on the opportunity that's out there. In terms of the margin profile, particularly in fitness, it's definitely true that the ASP of this particular segment is coming down, because of the contribution of the activity trackers.","The margin profile will also certainly come down, although we do believe that our mix of products across the range from low-end to high-end will tend to balance, and we'll still have strong margin profiles in fitness going forward.","Ben Bollin","And then, looking at the automobile business, how do you feel about the progress in traction, you're realizing on the auto OEM front? And how well do you feel your position for autonomous vehicles into the future? Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Well we have demonstrated consistent progress in our auto OEM business, with some high profile customers like Daimler and Honda. And we continue to work closely with multiple targeted customers on several opportunities better out there. Of course, giving more color on those opportunities, we're unable to do that at this time because of confidentiality. But we view this as a marathon effort and not a sprint. So, we continue to be patient and invest. In terms of our positioning around autonomous vehicles, we certainly offer technologies much like we've introduced recently in our n\u00fcvicam that could serve in those kinds of vehicles. But, at this point, we don't see ourselves as a driver of vehicles themselves or as the main integrator in that technology.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tavis McCourt of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Tavis McCourt","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Two of them. First, on the inventory build, Doug, I think you mentioned, that was in preparation for -- I think you're wording with new product category launches, and I'm trying to get a sense of -- are these products that you've announced already or entire new category that maybe some of the definitional issue. But obviously, the inventory trending in Q1 a little different than the historical average, maybe a little more clarity around that? And Clif, I have a question on the new n\u00fcvi with the integrated forward collision warning and dash cam. Some of the smartphone-based solutions like that have been pretty crucial to be honest. So, are you comfortable that you're able to provide a good quality of service, especially on the forward collision warning and lean departure without professional installation. I think that's where the smartphone based systems run, so it's a bit of an issue? Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Okay. I'll take the inventory question. As it relates to the inventory, that relates to already announced products. So, basically, we have a lot of the fitness products as well as some of the work we talked about in there that we're building up to make sure that we meet demand and the retailers.","Doug Boessen","And Tavis, with regard to the n\u00fcvicam and the Collision Warning and Lane Warning type of features, in terms of what I've seen and I've used the product quite a bit, I feel pretty good about the capability and the performance of the product. We've tested the product versus integrated solutions and vehicles that are offered on the market today, and we feel like it compares very favorably. So, we feel good about our technology. We've invested in optics technology for a while now and it's starting to show up now across our product lines including products like n\u00fcvicam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Power of Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Will Power","Great. Thanks. Couple of questions, maybe just come back to the fitness operating margin outlook. I think you referenced spring marketing campaign, and obviously you get more competition in the marketplace, should we expect just because of operating margins to further sequentially in Q2 due to the competitive dynamics or lot of that marketing would have spent and reflected in Q1 margin level?","Cliff Pemble","I think in terms of sequential moment, we would not expect it to dip. We would expect that our revenue profile will be increasing because of [indiscernible] seasons that are coming up, but in terms of year-over-year performance, we do believe that it will be lower.","Will Power","All right, okay. In a separate question, looking at the buyback in the quarter, somewhat limited, what's the thought process or I guess, the process generally to consider accelerating the current buyback authorization or even upsizing it?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. So we principally announced $300 million authorization in February. So our current plans are to complete that $300 million within that two-year period of time December 2016. So, the method we purchased in Q1 was just from the time of authorization. So, it obviously is plus than the amount we have last year when we had a full quarter, but we can despite probably a similar pace is what we've seen in Q1, but making sure that we do complete that authorization within our two-year period of time.","Will Power","Okay. And then, just I wanted to make sure is clear on the tax rate, which came in lower in the quarter, and so only there was one time impact there. What sort of a tax rate now you use for the full year?","Cliff Pemble","Full year, similar guidance we gave 60% to 70% so it's a full year rate. And we saw there was in the first quarter since it's a low income quarter, the $5 million of tax reserve we had there at a larger percentage on that.","Will Power","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Erickson of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Brad Erickson","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The few follow-ups from some have already been asked. First it's around the fitness margins and the incremental, are they, I guess the spending around R&D and advertising, you talked about, just to be clear, is that incremental relative to kind of previous expectations that were set on the fitness business?","Cliff Pemble","No this. In terms of the expectations we've sent, we are operating according to plans, we feel like our current spending is in line with plan four in our budget.","Brad Erickson","Got it. That's great. And then, just in terms of the return of capital. I think, you know historically you've kind of committed the returning basically all of free cash flow. Can you comment just on yours and your board's appetite to return to potentially more than 100% of free cash flow at some point?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. I think at this moment, we're comfortable with the level that's being returned. We do have unique limitations around the shareholder structure and control of foreign corporations as well as our capital structure in Switzerland. So, we feel like the current approach is adequate.","Brad Erickson","That's great. Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Spinola, of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Andrew Spinola","Thank you. You had a nice improvement year-over-year in the auto gross margin, about a 120 bps. But I think if you do account for the FX, and the deferred revenue impact I estimate maybe over 400 bps improvement. And you referenced in the press release that, there was less discounting and more improvement in cost material space. It seems like a very large improvement. And I'm just wondering if you can help us understand, is this something that's sustainable going forward, is it maybe more of a Q1 trend, because there is less discounting post the holiday, with less seasonality would, how much of this is sustainable and how much is just a Q1 impact going forward?","Cliff Pemble","I think there's some element of that, that's \u2013 this Q1 impact, because we're comparing the discounting that should place in Q1 of 2014 versus 2015, which is probably more a seasonal spike. But in terms of the cost structure and those other factors we would see that going forward and we're managing the business for our market share and profitability. So this is our approach.","Andrew Spinola","Okay. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein, of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kristine Tan Liwag","Hi. This is actually Kristine Liwag, calling in for Ron this morning.","Cliff Pemble","Good morning.","Kristine Tan Liwag","Good morning. In your press release you mentioned that you're now offering an ADS-B piece that provides most comprehensive line of solutions. Can you provide more details on how your product compares to the competition, and then also can you please quantify the size of the market that you could address?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. In terms of the breath of products that we offer. We offer products that can work with portable solutions, we have a product that can work with tablets. We have a product that's fully installed and integrates with our panel mount equipment. We have products that operate through our transponders as opposed to through separate 978 megahertz UAT transceiver. So, we just have a broad set of offerings that can appeal to almost any aircraft whether they have mode S capability or they're on the lower end in the piston side. And your second question, please?","Kristine Tan Liwag","Can you quantify the size of the market?","Cliff Pemble","Size of the market is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.","Kristine Tan Liwag","Great. And then a separate question. What metrics do you look at internally to measure the brand awareness of Garmin products and also the effectiveness of your advertising dollars?","Doug Boessen","Yeah, I think these are very challenging things to specifically measure, because each kind of approach that you use might yield a different result, but we look at search trends and web trends. We look at trends on our websites. We look at trends on major retailers, online retailers and we get a sense out of those types of investigations.","Kristine Tan Liwag","And can you provide or give us some an idea of what your tracking right now?","Doug Boessen","No, we don't have details, we can share right now.","Kristine Tan Liwag","Great. Thank you.","Doug Boessen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have a follow up from Tavis McCourt of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Tavis McCourt","Yeah. Thanks. Doug, wanted if you could give us kind of an updated view on with respect to the deferred revenue decline to be on the balance sheet this year?","Doug Boessen","Pardon me.","Tavis McCourt","It means decline in deferred revenues or the \u2013 that the [indiscernible]...","Doug Boessen","Sure. So from \u2013 yeah, sorry about that. So, from debt perspective, we anticipate a headwind or consistent to what we have probably in the first quarter there.","Tavis McCourt","For the full-year?","Doug Boessen","Yes.","Tavis McCourt","So, all of the headwind would be recognized in the first quarter or everything.....?","Doug Boessen","No, no, no, no. Consistent type of a headwind....","Tavis McCourt","Okay.","Doug Boessen","Yeah. consistent type of headwind.","Tavis McCourt","And then, Cliff, I want to follow up on kind the automobile question, if I look at revenues and back out the deferral impacts, it looks like revenues were probably down, more like 7% and then if I assume some FX exposure. You're pretty close to flat, and I'm wondering if you look at it on that basis, is that something that's sustainable or was there some quick takes in terms of the year-over-year comps that would make that, get a bit worse with your progress. Thanks?","Clifton Pemble","Well, as I mentioned in my comment status, we were pleased with the underlying business and those are the factors didn't really tell the whole story, in terms of the strength that we saw that keep in mind that on a year-over-year basis last year, we probably had a higher level of inventory in the channel and thus ship more into the channel or less into the channel, at that time, as we discounted and tried to help our retailers clear it. This year, the channel is cleaner and we had the ability to ship pretty much what retailers wanted. So, there is some puts and takes along that regard and we do anticipate that the overall market will decline in the 10% to 15% range for this year.","Operator","Thank you. I'm not showing any further question in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Kerri Thurston for any further remarks.","Kerri Thurston","Thanks, Ashley. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. And Doug, and I will be available throughout the day for follow-up calls as well as on the road over the next three weeks. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect.

Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Teri Seck, Manager of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Teri Seck","Good morning. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd.'s fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcript will also be available on our website.","As a reminder, we adopted the new U.S. GAAP revenue standard in the first quarter of 2018. The prior periods presented here have been restated to reflect adoption of this standard. This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, gross and operating margins and future dividends, market shares, product introduction, future demand for our product and plans and objectives, are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur and actual results could differ materially, as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with Securities and Exchange Commission. Presenting on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, we finished 2018 strong with revenue for the quarter increasing 4% over the prior year to $932 million. Aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness collectively increased 13% over the prior year.","Gross margin improved to 58.9%, driven by both product and segment mix. Operating margin improved to 23.9% and operating income increased 21% over the prior year. These results generated GAAP EPS of $1 and pro forma EPS of $1.02 in the quarter, an increase of 26%.","Looking briefly at full year performance. 2018 was our third consecutive year of revenue and operating income growth. We launched many innovative products, some of which have become halo products in their respective markets. I will highlight accomplishments in each of our business segment in a moment. But looking back at 2018, I'm very pleased with everything we accomplished.","For the year, revenue increased 7% to over $3.3 billion. Combined revenue from aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness increased 16%. Gross margin improved to 59.1%. Operating margin improved to 23.3% and operating income increased 14%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $3.66; and pro forma EPS of $3.69, an increase of 22% over the prior year.","The growth in EPS and cash generation gives us confidence in proposing an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. We shipped nearly 15 million units during the year bringing our total to over 205 million since inception, which includes over 1 million certified aviation products.","Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first I would like to highlight some achievements from the past year and outlook in each of our five business segments.","Starting with aviation. Revenue increased 20% driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. ADS-B continues to be a driver of solid performance in the aftermarket, while new platforms and favorable market conditions led the growth in the OEM category.","Gross and operating margins were 75% and 34% respectively and operating income increased 33% over the prior year. During the year Tactical Air selected us to equip their fleet of F-5 fighter aircraft, which is the second program win for our tandem integrated flight deck.","Also during the year we were recognized by Airbus helicopters and Embraer as outstanding Supplier of the Year. And most recently, Garmin was ranked number one in avionics product support by Professional Pilot magazine and by Aviation International News for the 15th consecutive year.","The recognition we are receiving is significant, because the aviation industry demands strong performance from those that participate in the market. I congratulate our team on earning these awards, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers.","Looking ahead, positive market conditions, contributions from new products and platforms and ADS-B provide growth opportunities in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue in the aviation segment will increase approximately 10% in 2019.","Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 18% driven by strength in a broad range of product lines. During the year, we launched Panoptix LiveScope, a sonar system that generates real-time video-like images underwater. LiveScope was quickly recognized by the marine industry as disruptive new technology and has become a halo product in our marine portfolio.","Gross and operating margins improved to 59% and 14% respectively, and operating income increased 26%.","We recently introduced new versions of our flagship GPSMAP and echoMAP chartplotters, which included a new map combining the best of Garmin and Navionics content. This marks the achievement of a major objective we established for the Navionics acquisition.","We continue to gain market share in the OEM category. During the year, we were named as an exclusive supplier to several boat manufacturers.","We enter 2019 confident in our portfolio of strong product, such as, Panoptix LiveScope and our flagship GPSMAP and echoMAP series. We anticipate revenue in the marine segment will increase approximately 10% for the year.","Turning next to outdoor. Revenue increased 16% on strong demand for outdoor adventure watches, golf products and inReach subscription services. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 36% respectively, and operating income increased 16% over the prior year.","During the year, we built on the momentum in the adventure watch category with the introduction of the f\u0113nix 5 Plus series with streaming music, built-in maps and mobile payments. We also extended the category with the introduction of Instinct and Descent.","Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% in 2019, driven primarily by growth in watches and inReach subscriptions.","Looking next at fitness. Revenue increased 13% driven by growth in all product categories. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 21%, respectively and operating income increased 24% over the prior year.","In 2018, we launched new music-enabled wearables and added seven music providers into our Connect IQ app store including Spotify, Deezer, and KKBOX. Lastly, we signed an agreement to purchase Tacx, a leading provider of indoor bike trainers and we expect this acquisition to be completed sometime in the second quarter. In 2019, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 13% which includes the acquisition of Tacx as well as organic growth within the segment.","Looking finally at the auto segment, revenue decreased 19% for the full year due to the ongoing decline of the PND market and lower auto OEM sales driven by program timing. Gross and operating margins were 43% and 6%, respectively.","Our global PND market share remains very strong and at the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we announced our new Drive PNDs with simplified road trip-ready features. In the OEM category, we were awarded new business that will contribute starting in 2020.","Looking at 2019, we anticipate revenue will decrease approximately 18%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market as well softness in OEM due to program timing mentioned earlier.","In summary, we began our 30th year of operations with opportunities in all segments. We anticipate revenue of approximately $3.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Our plan calls for stronger growth in the second half of the year due to the timing of product launches.","We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59.5% and operating margin of approximately 22.7%. We anticipate a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 16.5% resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.70.","That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on financial results. Doug?","Doug Boessen","Thanks Cliff. Good morning everyone. I'll begin my review in our fourth quarter and full year financial results with comments on the balance sheet cash, flow statement, and taxes. We posted revenue of $932 million for the fourth quarter, representing 4% increase year-over-year.","Gross margin was 58.9%, 280 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $223 million, a 21% increase with the prior year. Operating margin was 23.9%, a 350 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1. Pro forma EPS was $1.02, a 26% increase from the prior year.","Looking at full year results, we posted revenue over $3.3 billion for the year, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.1%, 150 basis point increase from the prior year.","Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.9%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $778 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 23.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from the prior year, driven by the increase in gross margin. Our GAAP EPS was $3.66. Pro forma EPS was $3.69, a 22% increase from the prior year.","Next, look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in three of our five segments led by the Outdoor segment with 25% growth, followed closely by the Aviation segment with growth of 22%. For the full year 2018 we achieved 7% consolidated growth with double-digit growth in four of our five segments.","Looking next to fourth quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the Aviation, Marine, Outdoor, Fitness segments contributed 84% total revenue in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 77% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 23% to 27%. Aviation grew from 14% to 17%.","You can see from the charts it illustrate our profit mix by segment. The Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and fitness segments collectively delivered 97% operating income in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 88% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 40% to 43%.","Looking next at full year charts. For the full year, the Aviation, Marine, Outdoor, Fitness segments made up 81% of total revenue compared to 75% in 2017. A similar shift occurred in operating income with 95% in 2018 operating income collectively coming from the; Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness segments compared to 88% in 2017. All segments besides Auto had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.","Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $6 million or 2%. Research and development increased $12 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense decreased $4 million in the prior year quarter representing 5.9% of sales, 60 basis point decrease. ","Decrease was primarily due to lower media spent in the fitness segment.","SG&A decreased $3 million compared to prior quarter with 13.5% of sales, 90 basis point decrease compared to prior year. Decrease was due to prior year litigation-related costs partially offset by increased personnel-related expenses.","A few highlights from the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion.","Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $570 million, due to holiday quarter and decreased year-over-year due to timing of cash receipts. Inventory balance increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $562 million.","During the fourth quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of approximately $185 million. For the full year 2018, we generated free cash flow of approximately $764 million, a $243 million increase to the prior year.","We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for our increased dividend beginning for the June 2019 payment. Proposal is a cash dividend of $2.28 per share, $0.57 per share per quarter, 8% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share.","For the full year 2018, we recorded an effective tax rate of 15.7%, 520 basis point decrease from the prior year primarily due to benefits from U.S. tax reform. We expect our full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16.5%. The year-over-year increase in 2019 pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to lower expected reserve releases compared to 2018.","This concludes our formal remarks. Channel, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Robert Spingarn","Good morning. Very good numbers guys. I wanted to ask you just on the -- to start with on the margins, on the gross margins Cliff or Doug, how do we think about that improvement considering volume mix pricing those three factors and anything else that I should be throwing in there?","A \u2013 Cliff Pemble","On the year, our margin improvement is primarily segment-driven mix. On the quarter, it's both segment and product mix.","Q \u2013 Robert Spingarn","And then -- go ahead Doug.","A \u2013 Doug Boessen","Yes. We did see some improvement in the outdoor gross margin year-over-year for the quarter as primarily due to Cliff mentioned product mix higher percentage of wearables year-over-year and also some improvement in the marine gross margin also due to product mix.","Q \u2013 Robert Spingarn","And are there any pricing trends at work here that we should think about? Or is pricing stable? Or do you see any kind of moderation as technology gets -- with competition and technology somewhat matures?","A \u2013 Cliff Pemble","Yes. Competition is obviously still a factor especially around holiday promotion times. Our product life cycles within the various segments do also have an impact particularly in outdoor where we had the new f\u0113nix watches for most of the year. So going forward I think all those things are dynamic. We would anticipate just following the market and doing the best we can.","Q \u2013 Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then just on the sales guidance. The sales guidance is a little bit short of what you delivered in 2018. But then again you did better in 2018 than you initially guided. You did 7.5% against I think the original guidance of about 3%. Is this just typical conservatism? Or are there any fundamental elements that we should really be thinking about for example maybe ADS-B activity fading as we get into 2019 or anything else across the segments we should be thinking about?","A \u2013 Cliff Pemble","I think the segment level guidance speaks for itself. I think that in terms of our overall guidance, we spend a lot of time on that and we\u2019ve articulated the road map that we believe we can deliver. So that's really what goes behind our guidance at the beginning of the year. There's still a lot of the year ahead of us. So as things develop of course we'll update. But right now that's our view and our road map.","Q \u2013 Robert Spingarn","Thank you, very much.","A \u2013 Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Caitlin Dullanty","Hi guys. It's Caitlin Dullanty on for Ron Epstein today. My first question is can -- how did the U.S. government shutdown affect the ADS-B upgrades? Did you encounter any delays? And if so, should we expect to see a pickup of pent-up demand going into 2019?","A \u2013 Cliff Pemble","Yes. We really didn't see any impact from the shutdown on ADS-B itself. I think that there's lots of puts and takes at the shop level of the industry, so I wouldn't say that there was zero impact. But it was hard to detect at least from the activity that we saw. And so going forward, I don't think there's a major wave that comes through because of the reopening. We expect that the upgrades will continue strong into 2019 because there's still quite a few aircraft to equip and shop capacity is still a factor.","Caitlin Dullanty","Okay, thank you. That's very helpful. And then can you talk a bit about how the two new product launches such as the Instinct watch and the GPSMAP 66 handheld contributed to outdoor growth in the quarter?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. Instinct really opened a new category product for us, a new kind of customer, so we view that as a new opportunity within the overall wearable. And the GPSMAP was a refresh of our product line and so whenever we do that we're able to capture people who upgrade and people who are looking for new features and products that they might already have. So, kind of, a new product refresh out there.","Caitlin Dullanty","All right. Thank you so much.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks, Caitlin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company. Your line is now open.","Charlie Anderson","Yeah, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a really strong 2018.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Charlie Anderson","Cliff, I wanted to start with a question on auto. So PND continued its current rate of decline, which looks like it's in kind of the low 20% range. I realize that you have some program timing that's impacting OEM right now. But you do have BMW, Geely and others coming in later. I think you've also referenced in the past that you have some unannounced wins. I wonder how should we think about that business over the next few years. Is there a point, at which it stabilizes or even grows? And then I've got a follow-up.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, we believe there's a plan. We're definitely -- we'll stabilize and grow.","Charlie Anderson","Can you speak to -- if that's something we could consider on the 2021-2020 time frame or any more color there?","Cliff Pemble","Well, it's a little early to talk about 2020, but I would say consistent with the remarks that we made earlier that many of the programs we've talked about start to hit in 2020, and so that will be a key year for us and looking forward as well as we have additional programs that come online.","Charlie Anderson","Okay, great. And then on aviation, I wonder what are some of the key assumptions you guys are making this year as it relates to the ADS-B rollout to any degree do you think it spills over into 2020? And then a post-ADS-B world, how should investors think about the growth within the aviation category? Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. Our outlook today is very similar to what we provided back in July. We are seeing that based on run rates we have today that we would have about 100,000 aircraft equipped by the time the mandate takes effect. And looking into 2020, I would say that there still appears to be opportunity for additional aircraft that come online either due to the fact that they weren't able to get into shops or perhaps they're just lagers in terms of overall buying behavior.","Charlie Anderson","Great. Thanks so much.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Your line is now open.","Rich Valera","Thank you and congratulations from me on a strong 2018 as well. Just wanted to follow-up on the ADS-B question. Can you give us any sense of the revenue level you're seeing from ADS-B-related retrofits right now and how you think that trends into 2020?","Cliff Pemble","It's probably a little hard to quantify because we are seeing customer step up to additional equipment when they bring their airplanes in for modification. I think that's critical, because it shows that customers they realized that the effort it takes to put the equipment in is significant, and so they want to take advantage of all of the potential features and opportunities they can have with the latest equipment. So consequently we're seeing improvements in a lot of our retrofit product lines in addition to ADS-B.","Rich Valera","I guess I understood, but to the degree that you're getting all the sort of pull-through from ADS-B-related activity in 2019 and then that was to significantly decrease in 2020, it would seem you could have almost the reverse effect. So just trying to think about how to think about 2019 versus 2020 given you expected high level of ADS-B in 2019?","Cliff Pemble","Well we're not ready to provide a lot of color around 2020 yet, because we still have a lot of 2019 to play out when it comes to the mandate. But we said all along that certainly there will be a drop-off as people become equipped. And the way we see it today there will still be sales that occur into 2020, but the level of those sales and the impact in the pull-through that comes with those is still unknown.","Rich Valera","Fair enough. And I wanted to ask one on Tacx if I could, interesting acquisition there. First, I was wondering if you'd be willing to give the expected revenue contribution from Tacx either on an annualized basis or in however many months you expect to have that acquisition with you in 2019?","Cliff Pemble","Well from our guidance, we would say that about half of the growth that we're projecting in fitness is due to Tacx and based on our projected closing date. So those are the assumptions we made so far.","Rich Valera","And can you share that projected closing date?","Cliff Pemble","I think there's still a lot to happen, so we don't really have a specific yet, but we expect it to be sometime in second quarter.","Rich Valera","Got it. And then, is there anything else you're looking to do with Tacx from an integration with some of the Garmin software or other Garmin products? I'm just thinking what else -- what are the types of things you could do with Tacx, once you get that as part of the sort of Garmin portfolio?","Cliff Pemble","Well we built a very solid cycling business based on outdoor cycling activity and so Tacx allows us to bring cycling indoors and allows us to integrate across our platforms both in terms of head units as well Garmin Connect. So we see a lot of opportunities and synergies that we can work together with Tacx in order to better serve the overall cycling market.","Rich Valera","Got it. And one more if I could. Can you give a marine organic growth number for 4Q 2018, if we were to back out some of the recent acquisition impact?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. For the fourth quarter the vast majority was organic growth about three quarters of it and maybe about 25% of that was Navionics.","Rich Valera","Got it. Thanks very much.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yuuji Anderson of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Yuuji Anderson","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. First, I wanted to follow up on the previous outdoor question that was asked. Just looking at Q4 and just concerned the acceleration year-over-year. Can you just give us a better idea of how much of that was a contribution from the new product that you cited there versus performance of the underlying -- or performance of the older Fenix watches for example?","Cliff Pemble","Well definitely the new products like Instinct and Descent contributed totally new dollars to us, but we still saw strong growth for the year and for the quarter in our Fenix line as well.","Yuuji Anderson","Got it. That's helpful. And then on the operating margin guidance, so it is a tick down from 2018. I guess when we look at this longer term, should we be thinking of the company as kind of hovering around this low- to mid-20 percentage range? Or should we just think of 2019 as being particularly investment-heavy and we should expect more meaningful operating leverage in the outer years?","Doug Boessen","Yes. So this is Doug. Let me give you a little perspective probably on operating expenses and the gross margin and kind of feed into that. So for the gross margin, we do expect that to tick-up a little bit, that's primarily all due to segment mix. And then as it relates to operating expenses for 2019, we would expect operating expenses to increase on a consolidated basis similar level as it did in 2018, probably maybe as a percentage of sales maybe 100 basis points increase year-over-year.","And about -- I should also mention that, about 25% of that year-over-year increase in our operating expenses were attributing primarily to the acquisition of Tacx -- acquisition there. And looking at -- maybe a little more granularity on each one of the expense lines, as it relates to advertising; our goals for 2019 or as a percentage of sales to look at advertising to be relatively comparable as a percentage of sales in 2018.","We do expect R&D investments to continue probably -- maybe as a percentage of sales probably a 50% increase there -- basis point increase. And then SG&A expect that to increase year-over-year maybe about a 50 basis point also. But we do continue to make investments in our business on a go-forward basis to drive the top line.","Yuuji Anderson","Great. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just one more quick one if I may. On the Aviation guidance at this point, are you building in new production from OEM design such as Citation Longitude?","And I guess just more broadly, like how do you build in the production ramp for new platforms such as that versus what those OEMs might be saying publicly? Like can you give yourself room for potential upside, if things don't track according to what they're saying publicly?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So we do have new platforms such as Longitude in our plan. We work closely with the teams at our partners such as Textron to plan for -- basically create our plan around their plan. And so that's what we've done. And I can't really comment in terms of our views versus theirs, but we're ready to support their launch and rollout.","Yuuji Anderson","Okay. Thank you so much.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul Coster","[Technical Difficulty] encouraging. Can you talk a little bit about the sort of macro-environment that you're assuming for that both domestically and internationally?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. Sorry Paul, I think your question broke up during the first part. So if you wouldn't mind to repeat that then we'll try to tackle it.","Paul Coster","Just asking with regard to the 2019 guidance what kind of macro assumptions, you've made both domestically and internationally?","Cliff Pemble","Well I think we're assuming what all people are kind of steady state the way things are right now. I think aviation and marine are segments that are definitely very sensitive to the macro-environment. So our outlook there assumes that we're going to continue to see recently favorable conditions to support those markets.","Paul Coster","If the China-U.S. trade dispute is resolved amicably what kind of impact does that have if any?","Cliff Pemble","Well, I think to the extent that it improves the situation in the China market itself it could positively impact us. But China is a challenging area, just in terms of the overall global economy. And our revenue exposure there is somewhat small. But on the other hand we still are looking for growth opportunities in the Asia market.","Paul Coster","Okay. Great. Got it. And then my last question is on the halo products, which you referred to. Can you just talk to us what you mean by halo? I think, I can guess. But how does it mobilize the rest of the sort of product lineup and marketing? And what's the broader takeaway for us in terms of the technical approach to your business?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. The example we gave was Panoptix LiveScope, and as we've been mentioning since LiveScope was launched that it is disruptive technology. Marine people and fishermen view it as something that truly doesn't exist anywhere else, and so it casts a positive glow across the marine segment and additional pull-through sales of our other equipment as well. So that's what I call a halo product.","Paul Coster","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners. Your line is now open.","Ivan Feinseth","Thank you for taking my call, and big congratulations on another great quarter and a great 2018.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks, Ivan.","Ivan Feinseth","My question is about Tacx. It's a really exciting acquisition. And can you give us some of the insight to how it came to be and then like your big picture view as far as distribution and branding and how it's going to be integrated and how their product lines could be integrated into Garmin?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So we've been working to build relationships across the industry and we did reach out to Tacx and introduced ourselves and built a relationship with them. They're an awesome company. They're a family-owned company over generations. That's well-run, has a great product line and technology. They're vertically integrated, and so we felt like they were a great fit with our company as well.","In terms of how we view them going forward, they have a great brand and it's a brand that we want to support and keep around for the long-term. And we intend to integrate them into our sales in our fitness area. Like I mentioned earlier, they have a strong offering for both indoor and outdoor cycling activities.","Ivan Feinseth","And like how will the products be available? Let's say in the U.S., for example, what will be the distribution channel?","Cliff Pemble","Well, we would anticipate the distribution would be through existing sports retailers. Already the product is available through REI. But there's an opportunity to expand Tacx distribution in the U.S. and Asia market. They're very strong in Europe, but less strong in the U.S. and Asia, so we'll be working to expand that distribution.","Ivan Feinseth","And what about like ramping up the exercise bike and the treadmill and integration? So you\u2019re going to -- I mean, I assume you'll be integrating that to connect with -- monitor your heart and fitness with your smart wearable integrating the FIT Connect IQ App, and also software to monitor your workout? Are you also going to be, let's say, offering online or video classes similar to the Pendleton model?","Cliff Pemble","Well, I probably can't comment on specifics. But like I mentioned earlier, there's many different assets within Garmin and Tacx that we can now look at together and create a much more high fidelity and interesting experience for customers that go both outside and inside. So that's our goal and we have a lot of work ahead of us for sure.","Ivan Feinseth","Very good. Very exciting. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks, Ivan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Todorov of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Nick Todorov","Hi. Thanks. And congratulations guys on a great execution, really great job.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks, Nick.","Nick Todorov","Question on -- Cliff you said that in fitness, I think, you said all of your categories experienced growth in the fourth quarter. Can you kind of give us some data on what portion of your fitness segment is now the basic trackers? Do you see some stabilization in that segment or the trend of switching to smartwatch is still intact?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So, we did see growth across all of our categories in fitness. The basic category has come down quite a lot as you imagine with the overall market. Where we saw growth was in unique products that we offer such as the hybrid analog smart devices vivomove HR as well as the kid trackers as well.","But we see it as a solid category where we offer something unique, so that's where we're investing. And then the overall fitness categories outside of that in advance trackers, we're also strong for the year.","Nick Todorov","Okay. Thanks. And in the fitness guidance aside from the Tacx acquisition contribution you're seeing some really decent product refreshes. I know you don't speak about the upcoming launches, but can you share; at least, in what product line you expect the strongest product refresh on fitness?","Cliff Pemble","I think we have a strong roadmap across all of our lines, so we would expect during the year that we'll have refreshes across the entire portfolio.","Nick Todorov","Okay. And how are you thinking about ADS-B growth per se? Are you baking in any kind of a deceleration year-over-year due to capacity constraints? Or how are you thinking about capacity? Has the picture there changed? Are you seeing anything different?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, we're really not seeing anything different than what we reported midway through 2018. We do see that shop capacity appears to be a factor in limiting the growth of installs. And so on a percentage basis I would obviously represent a deceleration, but again, a lot of demand that still has to be worked through for the year. So, we're working as hard as we can to help our shops get through that and we'll continue to monitor and see how things go into the following year.","Nick Todorov","Okay, great. And last one for me. Doug, how should we think about free cash flow and CapEx in 2019?","Doug Boessen","Yes. So, we had a very strong free cash flow in 2018. The big piece of that was driven by operation, but also we did have some very strong working capital improvements year-over-year.","I wouldn't expect to see those -- all of those working capital improvements year-over-year. So, probably for 2019, I'm estimating free cash flow around $675 million. And zoomed in that is about $150 million of CapEx which is a similar level that we had in 2018.","Nick Todorov","Okay, awesome. Thank you. Good luck guys.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks Nick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Ben Bollin","Good morning, Cliff, Doug, Teri. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, where are you in the capacity expansion with -- in Olathe for aviation? What's left to do? And where is the utilization of that footprint today?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, I'll probably comment on that Ben. This is Cliff. We are producing aviation products now in our new facility, so that part is up and running. We're still outfitting our distribution center with new equipment in order to turn that on, so we're not yet operating out of the distribution side of the new facility.","Ben Bollin","Okay. And as a follow-up. Longer term the company has executed really well in the broader aviation segment with OEMs. How would you characterize your objectives longer term with commercial opportunities? What's that process look like from start to finish? How long is kind of the training effort of the pilot? And how long is the ramp in spares inventory? I know it's very open-ended question. But could you walk us through what a win could look like or how you think that could translate to opportunity over time? Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Our objective is to grow share across the whole segment including moving upstream in both business jets as well as getting our foot into the commercial side as well. We do already have some commercial opportunities that we're executing on in terms of some smaller pieces of equipment, but we continue to aspire to and work on additional opportunities to move upstream. It is more intensive activity as you can imagine. And in order to do that we have to invest in ourselves, in our team, in our capacity which are things that we've been doing over the course of the years now. And in terms of actually executing then of course we would have to achieve a very high level of service for our customers in terms of spares and general support for their operations. So these are all things that we're evaluating and making methodical investments in order to be ready.","Ben Bollin","Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Teri Seck for closing remarks.","Teri Seck","Thanks everyone. Doug and I are available for callbacks throughout the day. Have a good one. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"10021":["Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August  1, 2012 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Kerri Thurston - Director of Investor Relations","Clifton A.

Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Kerri Thurston. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd. Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Please note that a copy of the press release concerning this earnings call is available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock.

The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong revenue and margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth of 56% in the second quarter.","Consolidated revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $718 million with growth in Outdoor outpacing all of the segments at 24%. Our traditional markets of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed 45% of the total revenue mix. Gross margins improved to 59% from 48% in the prior year. Kevin will discuss specific items impacting margin performance later during his remarks.","Operating margins also improved significantly to 28%, with our traditional markets posting 10% operating income growth in the quarter. Revenue growth combined with improved margins resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth.","Operating income for the quarter grew 55% to $204 million, while pro forma EPS was $0.98, a 56% improvement over the prior year. We sold 3.9 million units in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Next I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights segment by segment.","Starting first with Marine. Revenue in the Marine segment declined 14%, driven by weak economic conditions around the world. However, better gross margins largely offset the impact of lower sales. Sales in Europe were down sharply, while sales in other regions were comparatively better but still soft during the normally robust second quarter selling season.","While industry statistics indicating that boating sales have improved, the trend seems to be towards low-end boats where there's little to no Marine Electronics content. We maintain a high level of confidence in our long-term opportunities in the Marine segment and are continuing to invest in new product development and strategic alliances that position us for market share gains. As we have mentioned previously, these investments will create near-term operating margin compressions.","In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 4% as improvements in OEM deliveries were partially offset by weakness in the aftermarket. In recent quarters, operating margin has trended below historical norms as new programs require a higher level of R&D investment compared to what we have seen in the past. We remain confident that these investments will lead to stronger revenue and operating margin growth for the future.","During the quarter, we made additional announcements that demonstrate the progress we are making to expand our presence in the business jet market. Cessna selected are G5000 integrated flight deck for the new Citation Longitude, which is the longest range business jet operating, offering in the Cessna lineup. This expands upon the already successful relationship we have had with Cessna for many years now.","In addition, we announced a new relationship with Bombardier who selected the G5000 for the new Learjet 70 and 75, which are scheduled for delivery in 2013.","Due to the steady increasing number of new cockpit certifications that are in progress, we thought it would be helpful to provide a summary of the major wins that have been announced so far and projected entry into service based on publicly available information from the aircraft manufacturers.","In 2013, we anticipate entry into service of the Citation M2 with the G3000 integrated cockpit system. The Citation Ten with the G5000 integrated cockpit system and the Learjet 70 and 75 also with the G5000 system.","In 2015, we anticipate entry into service for the Citation Latitude, which will be equipped with the G5000 system. And finally, in 2017, we anticipate entry into service with the Citation Longitude, which will be equipped with the G5000 system.","We expect these wins along with other initiatives to deliver revenue growth in Aviation that outpaces that of the overall industry.","Turning next to Outdoor. The Outdoor segment continued to perform well in the quarter with 24% revenue growth and 23% operating income growth, driven by new products and category expansion. In the golf market, we are experiencing growth across our product offerings with our high-end wristwatch, the Approach S3, and our newest handheld, the Approach G6, both contributing to the strong results.","In early July, we introduced yet another innovative product in the Outdoor category, which is the fenix. This rugged yet stylish wristwatch integrates best-in-class outdoor watch functionality with GPS navigation. In addition to the GPS functionality, which we are known for, the built-in sensors include an altimeter for elevation, a barometer for providing weather information and a compass for navigation and tracking. The watch can also be paired with additional sensors to provide temperature, heart rate and cadence. We believe this is a highly attractive offering at a value price of $400.","Looking next at the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 5%, while operating income grew 35% on a year-over-year basis. The slower revenue growth but strong margin performance are attributable to a variety -- variability in our product cycle during the past year.","In 2011, we delivered the Forerunner 610, which positively impacted revenue through channel fill, while discounts on the end-of-life Forerunner 305 drove additional volumes, but that negatively impacted margins. So far in 2012, there have been no major product announcements. However, we have experienced good demand for our high-end products including the Forerunner 910XT, the Forerunner 610 and the Edge 500. We anticipate revenue growth rates will improve later this year as we launch new products in time for the holiday season.","Late in the quarter, we launched the Garmin Swim, our first fitness product that targets the swimming market. This training watch tracks stroke type, stroke count, distance, pace and lengths. This information can be uploaded to Garmin Connect for post-workout analysis. Garmin Swim was introduced at the U.S. Masters Summer Swimming Championships where it was well received by the swimming community, including both former Olympians and Olympic hopefuls.","Our Automotive\/Mobile segment experienced another strong quarter with revenue growth of 8% along with strong margins. Our strong margin performance was partially due to a onetime benefit of $21 million due to an overpayment of certain royalties. Kevin will provide additional details in a moment. We gained additional market share in the second quarter and now estimate that our market share in North America exceeds 70% with European market share of approximately 35%.","While we have posted 3 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the segment, we continue to expect that the overall PND market will decline approximately 10% to 15% in units and value for the year. This decline is consistent with our prior expectations for the market.","During the quarter, we introduced an update to our zumo product family, which is designed specifically for the motorcycle market and represents an important customer base for us. We remain focused on OEM market opportunities and are excited to partner with Suzuki as they launch their 2013 models with the Garmin-branded entertainment system.","Turning next to guidance. Having passed the halfway point for 2012, we are updating our full year guidance. In light of our solid first half performance, we are narrowing our revenue range to $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion, which is at the high end of prior guidance.","Additionally, we have raised our margin expectations for both gross and operating margins. As a result, we are increasing our pro forma EPS guidance to a range of $2.70 to $2.85, an increase of approximately 10%.","That concludes my remarks. Next, Kevin will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Kevin?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement and conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations.","You saw that we posted revenue of $718 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $193 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.98 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 7% year-over-year.","Gross margin came in at 59%, which was an 1,100-basis point improvement from the prior year. I will discuss this in further detail by segment a little bit later. Operating margin was 28%, up 890 basis points from the prior year. The components of this increase were gross margin being favorable by 1,100 basis points; offset by advertising, 20 basis points unfavorable, which was up $4 million on a year-over-year basis; SG&A, 110 basis points unfavorable, up $13 million on a year-over-year basis; our R&D was 70 points -- 70 basis points unfavorable, up $9 million on a year-over-year basis. Each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide.","Our pro forma EPS of $0.98 represents a 56% increase year-over-year, driven by increasing revenues, good gross and operating margins. Units shipped increased 4% year-over-year as 3.9 million units were delivered during the quarter. And our total company average selling price was $184 per unit, up 3% from Q2 of 2011.","According to U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the second quarter of 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we deferred on a net basis approximately $16 million of revenues, resulting in a $0.05 of tax affected deferred earnings per share during the quarter. In the second quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $62 million or $0.23 of tax affected EPS.","While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting the cash at time of sale as reflected in the statement of cash flows. We expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impact due to deferrals in the upcoming quarters, but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred in 2011.","As I said, in total, our revenues increased 7% during the second quarter, and with all segments -- within all segments excluding Marine contributing to the growth. During the second quarter, we generated an 8% revenue increase within the Auto\/Mobile segment as volumes increased due to our 2011 acquisition of Navigon. We continue to gain market share and we benefited from a reduction in deferred revenue.","Our Outdoor segment posted the strongest revenue growth at 24% due primarily to market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market, strong consumer reception for our recent product refreshes and the acquisition of Tri-Tronics in the back half of 2011.","The Fitness segment continued to grow with a 5% revenue increase when compared to Q2 of 2011. The slower growth resulted from an exceptional Q2 2011 when we were heavily promoting the Forerunner 305 and has just begun deliveries of the Forerunner 610. We will have new Fitness products at the back half of 2012.","Aviation segment revenues increased 4% compared to Q2 of 2011 with growth in OEM, partially offset by a slowdown in the aftermarket.","And finally, Marine segment revenues decreased 14% compared to Q2 last year as both the aftermarket and OEM markets slowed down due to a global decline in the Marine Electronics markets.","During Q2, both the Americas and EMEA posted revenue growth with a slight decline in APAC. The decline in APAC is the result of a change in shipment location for a major OEM customer. Without the impact of this change, our APAC region would have grown approximately 10%.","For Q2 of this year, the Americas represent 55% of revenue compared to 53% in Q2 of 2011. EMEA decreased from 38% of total in Q2 to 38%, while Asia decreased from 9% to 8% in the same period.","The Auto\/Mobile segment represented 55% of our total revenue during Q2, up slightly from 53% in Q2 2011 due to the contribution from our acquisition of Navigon. Outdoor grew to 14% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 12% in 2011. And due to the improved profitability of Auto\/Mobile in the second quarter, the operating income contribution of the segment increased to 43% from only 19% in the prior year.","In absolute dollars, our traditional segments of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed $117 million of operating income in the quarter, a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2011.","Moving next to the margin analysis. Our second quarter Auto\/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 51% and 22%, respectively. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenue, which contributed 590 basis points, a onetime royalty fee adjustment of $21 million contributing 510 basis points and product mix shifting toward more full-featured large screen devices.","Operating margin improvement resulted from the strong gross margins with only a slight offset in SG&A expenses due to a legal settlement during the period. Q2 Outdoor gross margin was 67%, up from 65% year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 44%, flat to the year-ago quarter as improved gross margins were offset by a slight increase in operating expenses.","Q2 Fitness gross margin of 69%, up from 58% in the year-ago quarter when we were heavily discounting the Forerunner 305 product. Operating margin was 42%, again up significantly from the year-ago quarter as improved gross margins were only slightly offset by increased advertising costs in the segment.","Q2 Marine gross margin was 64% compared to 56% a year ago as product mix shifted towards higher-margin products. Operating margin was 27%, down from 30% a year ago as the gross margin improvement was offset by increased R&D expenses to support our long-term Marine OEM strategy and cooperative advertising with our Marine partners.","Our second quarter Aviation gross margin was 71%, up from 69% in Q2 2011. Operating margin was 27% for the quarter, down from 30% in the prior year due primarily to increased R&D expense associated with new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013 and increased SG&A cost due to a bad debt credit that we booked in Q2 of last year.","Our second quarter operating expenses increased by $27 million on a year-over-year basis from $191 million in Q2 2011 to $218 million in Q2 2012 and increased 200 basis points as a percentage of sales. R&D increased $9 million year-over-year in the second quarter and 70 basis points to 11% of sales as headcount increased with our recent acquisitions, and we continue to invest in OEM opportunities.","Our ad spending increased $4 million over the year-ago quarter and increased 20 basis points as a percentage of sales to 5% in Q2 of 2012. This was largely driven by additional costs associated with acquired entities and cooperative advertising and promotional activities in our Outdoor, Fitness and Marine segments. And SG&A increased $13 million compared to the year-ago quarter, which was a 110-basis point increase to 14% of sales. The increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions and a $9 million legal settlement.","Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.6 billion. Our accounts receivable increased sequentially to $486 million due to seasonal strength in the second quarter.","Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 62 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters compared to 66 days of sales in the second quarter last year. Our inventory balance has decreased to $384 million on a sequential basis at the close of the second quarter, and our days of inventory metric was 98 days compared to 106 days in the second quarter of 2011.","The dividend payable now reflects 3 remaining quarterly payments of $0.45 per share, which was approved by our shareholders on June 1 at the Annual Meeting.","We continue to generate significant free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $223 million during the second quarter. CapEx was $12 million during Q2. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $211 million during the quarter. Cash flow invested during Q2 was $146 million, which was including $12 million in CapEx and $132 million net purchase of marketable securities.","Financing activities were $86 million use of cash during Q2 due primarily to the dividend payment on June 29, and we earned an average of 1.3% on all cash and marketable security balances during the second quarter.","With our strong free cash flow generation year-to-date, we are making good progress to our forecast of $650 million, which will fund our annualized dividend of $1.80 per share or approximately $350 million. We also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets and tuck-in technologies, which fit with our core markets. As has been Garmin's practice, acquisitions will continue to be evaluated by technology, value, compatibility and strategic fit.","Our tax rate for Q1 -- Q2 was at 10.4% due to the release of reserves following the expiration of the statute of limitations. We expect the full year 2012 tax rate to be approximately 13%.","Finally, as Cliff mentioned, we are updating our full year 2012 guidance given current trends across our segments. Let's review the total company guidance, so here we just provide additional detail on revenue by segment.","At a high level, we have increased our growth expectations for Auto\/Mobile and Outdoor, our 2 largest segments, while Fitness and Marine expectations have been reduced. The upside in Auto\/Mobile is the result of better-than-expected market share gains and product mix. Deferred revenue has also proven to be less of a headwind than expected.","Outdoor revenue guidance is being raised due to the continued strength we are achieving in golf and dog-related products. Offsetting these positives, we reduced our Fitness forecast due to new product delays and our Marine forecast due to a weak Marine environment, which we view as a macroeconomic problem.","While on the surface, this revised guidance may appear conservative given our strong first half performance, we do have a number of contributing factors to consider. First, first half revenue growth was positively impacted by our acquisitions of Navigon and Tri-Tronics, which were completed in the third quarter of 2011. Our Outdoor segment had very strong fourth quarter 2011 due to new product introduction and a strong holiday season for our golf devices. Also, the European macroeconomic situation and subsequent weakening of the euro brings possible headwinds for us in the back half of the year.","This concludes our formal remarks this morning. We will now move to a period of questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I could ask on PND, the units actually grew for the past 3 quarters, yet you're still pointing to a sharp decrease this year. I'm just wondering what's behind the fear that the segment deteriorates when the results indicate otherwise? Is it mostly the European macro? Is it competition or is it channel inventory? And also if you could comment on what's the impact of Apple maps, if any.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Mark, this is Cliff. There's really a couple of factors that impact our PND deliveries. First of all, we're delivering units under the Navigon brand, which has increased our deliveries. And along with that, we have market share gains, both when considering the Navigon brand, as well as organically in the Garmin brand. So we've been able to essentially avoid the trends in the market, which is a clear downsizing of the market that's going on right now. So as we comp against Navigon in the third and fourth quarter, we would expect our unit deliveries to level out and follow the market after that. And the market trend, again, is down 10% to 15% or so this year we estimate. As far as Apple goes, of course, everyone knows about the announcement that was made, turn-by-turn navigation on the next version of the OS. I would say that we've been through this before on the Android side of things, and Android does offer that on all their devices right now, so we don't see that as being a big change in terms of customers' perceptions. It just means that there's a choice now on the Apple platform that people didn't have before.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And maybe a question for you, Kevin. The encouraging trends in the gross margin seem to imply a higher level of movement in operating margins, yet it's just a notch higher at this point. Is that mostly due to the drag on the Aviation side or is there something else going on where the flow-through from gross margins is not hitting operating margins just yet?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think, you have to look at the seasonality that we experienced in margin. So while we did have a really strong quarter in the first half on gross margins, we still expect promotional activity during the holiday season, which will drive a little bit of gross margin decline in our Auto\/Mobile segment. And then on the operating level, I think there is definitely a continued investment in those areas especially in the OEM side that Cliff and I both discussed. So it's a combination of the seasonality of gross margin but also the continued investment on OpEx.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. Is there a period where that peaks the investments on the OEM side and just for Auto and for Aviation perhaps?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think we've been investing pretty heavily on the Auto OEM and the Aviation and the Marine OEMs. So there's no peak. We're just going to continue to invest on these programs for future revenue growth.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Bright of Avondale Partners.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","How significant was the contribution of Navigon to Auto\/Mobile in Q2?","Kevin S. Rauckman","So we're not really commenting on the amount that -- I think we did continue to perform well. Now we're into a period of transitioning to one brand in the back half, but that business and that acquisition has been very suitable to us not only from a revenue perspective, but also from capability on the R&D side.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","What is your view on the inflection point of PND sales versus embedded car navigation? When might we -- when do you think we're going to see that?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think there's no question, John, that in-dash systems are increasing. It is still true that a lot of those systems are sold with more expensive cars or higher-end trends, and so the amount of penetration there has some upper bound at least at the moment. But right now, we still see that there's a healthy demand from people with vehicles without turn-by-turn navigation, as well as replacement buyers.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And moving to Aviation, you have a timeline in your slide. How do you anticipate the ASP margin impact of OEM Aviation wins as we look forward to calendar '13 and forward?","Clifton A. Pemble","ASP is kind of a hard metric for Aviation because systems like the G5000 come with many components in the overall system, and price per aircraft, of course, is high compared to other areas of our business. In terms of margin, we feel like that will be equivalent margin to what we've been experiencing so far, and there really shouldn't be any change in the overall gross margin profile.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And to guidance, it looks like the -- you've trimmed your guidance in Fitness, Marine and Outdoor. Is it fair to assume that's primarily due to really economic concern?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, first of all, we actually raised our guidance on Outdoor because our prior expectations had been 5% to 10%, so we're raising that due to continued success on what I have mentioned, the golf and the dog-related products. But I think Fitness is -- and we talked about the fact that we have tough comps into Q2. We do expect with some new product releases in the back half for that to be better, but I think it's that and also Marine are definitely macro concerns.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Pardon me for mentioning Outdoor on the trim. Kevin and Cliff, on the Auto\/Mobile side, more on the OEM side, characterize your progress in generating some additional wins. We've certainly seen some from TomTom. Characterize how you're -- how that's going for you.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we think it's going steadily. I think this market does move at a fairly slow pace and the projects do take some time to develop and the relationships. So we don't want to provide people a false sense that this is going to move very quickly. The Auto industry is a slow-moving industry. With that said, we're excited about where we're at with the Suzuki program launches now, and it's a full infotainment system for the vehicle, which is a Tier 1 opportunity for us, which we're excited about. And other recent wins such as VW with the Navigon brand on the Up vehicle has been very good.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Final question on the use of cash, on your slides, increased focus on acquisitions. Is there any change in that thought process from last quarter?","Kevin S. Rauckman","No. We've continued down the same strategic path there. We're looking for companies that would fit us well, but can also provide growth much like you've seen from us in the past. So no real change in our strategy.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer & Co.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'm trying to understand the comment about PND volumes being up. Your revenue was up $30 million in the quarter, but $45 million of that came from the deferrals coming down. I think another $21 million came from the royalty reversal. So if I exclude those factors, it looks like revenue is probably down $20 million or $30 million. Is the right analysis here is that there was ASP coming down potentially because of the Navigon acquisition or what are the other factors at play here?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, first of all, the $21 million adjustment is actually a gross margin benefit, so it's not a sales impact, but your other comments about Navigon and deferred revenue definitely hold true. So we did see with -- if you strip out deferred revenue, we did see just a small ASP decline as we move towards a little bit lower sales of lower-priced SKUs. That definitely exceeded expectations on the first half, but I think we're being pragmatic as we look at the back half of the year on unit growth, and we picked up market share gains pretty healthy in North America on the first half, but we don't forecast we're going to continue to grow any further on share gains in the second half.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, if I look at the underlying margin, even if I exclude that $21 million, it's up in the high 40s. I think your guidance implies that the margin in the PND business goes back into the low 30s. I understand that there's typically promotional activity in the back half, but it seems like a pretty dramatic decline given the expectation that ASPs are going to stay relatively flat.","Kevin S. Rauckman","I don't think our expectation is, again, in the low 30s, but they definitely come down as we see every Q4 into the -- below 40%. So there is some decline is assumed -- in our EPS assumptions in the back half, but not as low as you just stated.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I meant high 30s, I apologize.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Okay.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Sutherland of Wedbush Securities.","Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So you talked briefly about some of the Auto OEM wins, BMW with Navigon and the Suzuki. Can you talk a bit more about the pipeline? Could we expect to see you guys is other 2013 models or is that longer term as you look at this market?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, the Suzuki win is 2013 models, and those are coming down the line now.","Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I guess I was asking about the pipeline. Can we expect more Auto OEM wins for 2013 models beyond the couple you just announced or have been talking about?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, there's definitely other projects we're working on and I really can't comment on the timeline of those. But as I mentioned, the timeline for these programs is very long. So I would expect patience is in order in terms of just seeing some of these come to fruition.","Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Diving deeper on an Apple question earlier, they did announce their maps navigation, but one of the things they did also announce is a button on the steering wheel integration with Auto OEMs. Has that changed any of your discussions you had with the auto manufacturers?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think auto manufacturers are interested in incorporating consumer content into the cars. That's been true for a while now, and this is really just a variation on the capabilities that cars have had for a while, which is what we call the push-to-talk capability, activating voice recognition.","Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, shifting over to the Fitness segment. How much of the decline in your guidance is due to the delay, such as the power meter and other things such as that? Are you seeing any competitive threats or is this just push out to 2013?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think it's both. I think the Vector product definitely was the one product delay that we assumed earlier in our guidance, so that's one component. But it's also a factor that there is more competition, and we do have some new products that I mentioned. We can't talk specifically about them yet, but if they are received well, we feel confident in that segment. But it's a combination of both product timing and also competition.","Operator","We'll go next to Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Just to hone in on Fitness a little bit. I think you guys were looking at a little bit of an accelerating growth rate versus Q2 in the second half. You talked about new products. I wonder -- and you're sort of in the core markets of cycling, running and now swimming, and I wonder if you're adding new adjacent categories or you're just having refreshes of your current categories to get that higher growth rate? And then secondly, on Outdoor, it looks like you're implying kind of a slower growth rate on the second half versus what you did the first half, and I wonder with the fenix and golf having more points of distribution, why would we see that slowdown?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. I think, on the Fitness, definitely, we have niches of existing segments and categories. We're not looking at any brand new. We brought up the Swim watch as you mentioned, and then it's primarily in the running market. We already have the cycling products out for the year. So there's no new brand new categories that we have coming up other than some new features and functionality. From the Outdoors, I mentioned we have some very significant Q4 results last year. So we're really talking about a tough comp year-over-year, but with the new fenix watch, we think that's going to do well, and the remaining golf products and the dog-related products. So I think we're being reasonable on our expectations on Outdoor in the back half of the year.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Great. And then lastly on gross margins, it felt like it wasn't category specific the lift in every single category. I wonder if there was a common component that came in a little bit lower in terms of the pricing that you got or if there was some sort of a currency tailwind you got on your cost of goods sold?","Kevin S. Rauckman","No, not really. I mean, we've seen single-digit product cost benefits across our business, but I think a lot of it had to do with the product mix as we talked about. We think that 5 points of margin is due to the fact that we sold products at higher functionality and higher price points, which helped our overall gross margins across many of the segments.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one more, a follow-up on the Fitness side. You talked about some of the competitive dynamics and the delays that might have impacted the revenue deceleration there. But margins are very, very strong, and also when we have tracked your pricing, it seems to be still pretty stable especially relative to what we've seen from some of the competition. And so, I guess, the question is what is your thinking around being more aggressive on pricing to stimulate some of the demand and also to fight off some of the competitive dynamics?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think, Simona, as we mentioned in 2011, we had a lot of promotional activities with products that was nearing the end of their life cycle. And I think you can expect that going forward, we'll have those kinds of activities as well, which will bring the pricing down and also bring the value up for people that are looking for certain capabilities in their running and cycling products. We're also planning to introduce new products, which will address additional price points in our range.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just a clarification on your updated full year guidance, that includes the royalty benefit in it, is that right?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, absolutely.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you just expand a little bit on what the royalty entailed? What that reversal was all about?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think it was one of our suppliers that we typically review the price or the cost per unit. And so we made some adjustments there after doing further review, and I think that's the onetime benefit that we expect in Q2. So we don't expect that that's going to be anything significant moving forward, but it was a kind of a cleanup or a correction of past license fees paid.","Operator","We'll go next to James Faucette of Pacific Crest.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions. I think, first, as it relates to the Marine segment and addressing why gross margins were so strong there in spite of the year-over-year revenue decline. You mentioned product mix. Can you give a little more detail what is happening with the product mix there that's helping you to drive the better margins?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think it's people gravitating towards the higher end of our product range, our bigger displays, as well as our more capable sounders which go on larger vessels.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then you also highlighted the opportunities in Aviation, particularly as new aircraft start to ship in the next few years. What's your visibility into the unit numbers of their shipments? What kind of lead time do you get and how much confidence do you tend to have in those orders once they're delivered to you?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think aircraft OEMs are running a long lead business much like a carmaker would do, but they have to plan their production months or even more than a year in advance. And so they provide us with forecast, and those are usually pretty solid. Obviously, when there's a major disruption in the economy like what we experienced back in 2008, things can dramatically change. But we feel like, for what we know today, there should not be anything that would significantly change the projections they're giving us.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my last question is just as it relates to investments that are ongoing, particularly in terms of trying to win OEM opportunities, how do you think about the, I guess that investment trajectory going forward? You've had a few wins, but at what point do you start to feel like, okay, most of the opportunities have now been allocated whether to Garmin or to others and can start to think about either scaling that back or not -- or just investing as revenues?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think there's a certain amount of activity that we can support given the size of the overall automotive industry and the number of competitors that are out there. But right now, certainly, automakers are looking for new solutions and innovators that can come in and provide unique advantages and differentiators for their products. But this is a business that has a large number of participants, and the overall operating margin profile of people in the industry, if you gotten a look, is on the lower side. But it's also a business that gets refreshed every few years. Automakers don't just choose the supplier and then keep that for the next 20 years. They're constantly looking for new things. So we think that there's a sustainable business there that requires investment to get there.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer & Co.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Question about the take rate for lifetime mapping. Can you tell us how that's tracking and what you expect for the back half of the year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. We did see continued increases in that, primarily in the European market. So we're about 2\/3 of our PNDs are now bundled with lifetime map. So we expect that to continue to increase probably to about 3\/4 of our units by the end of the year.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And then it looks like you have some litigation stuff behind you. How should we think about SG&A for the balance of the year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I would think that SG&A, we did have the onetime $9 million. SG&A should stay at the current run rate where we might actually see a little bit of savings in Q3, but it will be between the 13% and 14% of sales for the full year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jonathan Goldberg of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of quick questions here. Just, first of all, on the power meter on your Vector product, can you give us an update on where that stands?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, as we have told you before, we have been extensively testing working prototypes that we've been building. And at the time, we weren't happy with the consistency and the overall performance that we were seeing. So we are doing some design changes and starting to assemble new prototypes now, and we would expect that by the end of the year we should have a solid power meter.","Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And what is the -- what caused the problem there? Is it a function of this being a more mechanical rather than electrical product?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, it's some of that, but it's a highly sensitive measuring instrument, and so integrating that into the bike and achieving some of the innovations that we're working on here has been challenging, but something that we're able to knock off the problems one by one.","Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just shifting over to Marine real quick. This is typically a market where you guys have been somewhat subscale, or not subscale but sort of a lot smaller than some of your bigger competitors. Do you see a potential to shift your market position there over time without acquisitions? Can you guys grow without, say, acquiring Raymarine, which got away?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. Actually, we estimate our market position right now to be a strong #2 in the market, and we're actually the strongest one single brand out there in the market. We've been able to raise our penetration into the market through our large displays and through additional systems that we brought to market such as our radars and our sounders, which are built for the big boaters and the coastal markets. So we're very strong, we feel, in the coastal markets, and we're less penetrated in some of the other markets such as inland and sailing.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Valera of Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, a clarification on your commentary on SG&A. When you said a slight savings in 3Q, were you referring to the $99 million or backing out that $9 million settlement charge?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I was referring to the $99 million. So yes, we would still see a slight growth if you strip out the legal fees for the rest of the year, but still, I guess, between 13% and 14% total year SG&A as a percent of sales.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Holt of Morningstar.","Michael Holt - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Looking longer term at the Fitness segment. Just wondering if you could provide some color on the dynamics that you think will help you maintain your lead over the competition. Is it the fragmentation of the market, the distribution advantages, the ability to invest more in innovation? Or how do think about staying ahead of the competition?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think, we've established a really strong presence in the market especially amongst the really serious participants in that market, and so we're experiencing a lot of loyalty from those customers built on the kind of products that we're doing. They're very innovative, they offer the kind of features that the customers want and they trust our products and our brands for what they're doing.","Operator","And with no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Rauckman for any additional or closing remarks.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, thanks, everyone, for your participation, and we look forward to staying in touch and further comments as we execute in the business throughout the second half of the year. So thanks again, and have a great weekend.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We appreciate everyone's participation today."],"10295":["Garmin Ltd (NASDAQ:GRMN) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call February 19, 2020 10:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Teri Seck - Manager, IR","Clifton Pemble - President, CEO & Director ","Douglas Boessen - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Treasurer","Conference Call Participants","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Charles Anderson - Dougherty & Company","Nikolay Todorov - Longbow Research","Charles Erlikh - Robert W.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Teri Seck, Manager of Investor Relations. ","Teri Seck","Good morning, everyone. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd. Fourth Quarter of 2019 Earnings Call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcripts will also be available on our website. ","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, growth and operating margins and future dividends, market shares, product introduction, future demand for our products and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of the risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.","Clifton Pemble","Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, we finished 2019 strong, with revenue for the quarter increasing 18% over the prior year to $1.1 billion. Fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor collectively increased 24% over the prior year. ","Gross margin was 58% compared to 58.9% during the prior year. Operating margin improved to 25.1%, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. These results generated GAAP EPS of $1.89 and pro forma EPS of $1.29 in the quarter, an increase of 26%. ","Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2019 was a remarkable year of accomplishments. Revenue increased 12% to over $3.7 billion, representing a new record for Garmin. Combined revenue from fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor increased 18%. Gross margin improved to 59.5%. Operating margin improved to 25.2%, and operating income increased 21% to $946 million, another record achievement. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $4.99 and pro forma EPS of $4.45, an increase of 21% over the prior year. ","In light of these strong results, at our upcoming annual meeting, we'll be asking shareholders to approve an annual dividend of $2.44 a share, representing a 7% increase. Doug will discuss financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to highlight some achievements from the past year and our outlook in each of our 5 business segments. ","2019 was an outstanding year for our fitness segment, with each product category performing well. During the year, we launched sweeping updates to our running, wellness and cycling product lines, and these products were strong contributors in the final quarter of the year. In addition, our recent acquisition of Tacx brought new revenue to the segment and expanded our ability to serve cycling customers indoors and outdoors all year long. ","For the year, revenue from fitness increased 22%, exceeding the $1 billion threshold for the first time. Gross and operating margins were 51% and 18%, respectively, and operating income increased 6% over prior year. In 2020, we plan to build on this momentum by launching new feature-rich products while also expanding the distribution of Tacx products. As a result, we anticipate revenue from the fitness segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. ","2019 was an extraordinary year for our aviation segment. ADS-B was a significant contributor to growth, but on a combined basis, other categories contributed even more. We experienced growth in aftermarket systems as customers recognize the strong value proposition of modern cockpit electronics. We also experienced growth in OEM systems driven by popular new aircraft and from increasing demand for trainer aircraft. For the year, revenue from aviation increased 22%. Gross and operating margins were 74% and 34%, respectively, and operating income increased 24% over the prior year. For 2020, we anticipate that revenue for aviation will be comparable to that of 2019 as growth in aftermarket systems is offset by declining ADS-B revenues. ","Trends in the broader OEM market should be in line with those of 2019. We anticipate that the early part of the year will be the strongest driven by residual ADS-B demand, followed by a weaker back half as we move past the inevitable peak of the ADS-B cycle. We are focused on opportunities that lie ahead, and we are confident in the long-term growth prospects for our aviation business. Our marine segment delivered another year of impressive results, and market growth and market share gains boosted our performance. From time to time, we've highlighted our HALO products and technologies, achievements that speak for themselves and cast a positive glow across the entire Garmin brand. Our Panoptix LiveScope sonar system is one example that is generating excitement and strong sales across a broad range of products. We also introduced our first electric trolling motor, which is a new product category for us and bring game-changing new features to the market. ","For the year, revenue from marine increased 15%, exceeding the $500 million threshold for the first time. Gross and operating margins improved to 60% and 22%, respectively, and operating income increased 73%. Looking forward, interest in our products remained very strong, entering the 2020 boating season. In addition, our market share in the OEM category will grow as some of the most respected boat brands adopt our products as standard equipment on their 2020 models. With this in mind, we anticipate revenue from the marine segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. ","Outdoor delivered another strong year of product achievements and revenue growth. During the year, we launched the MARQ luxury watch series, and we completely refreshed the fenix adventure watch series. We also introduced versions of the fenix with passive solar recharging technology, which has resonated positively with the market. ","For the year, revenue from outdoor increased 13%. Gross and operating margins were 65% and 36%, respectively, and operating income increased 15% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe that the adventure watch category will continue to grow driven by further innovation in new utility. We also believe that inReach will continue to grow as more people appreciate the convenience and life-saving potential of two way remote communication. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% for the year. Our auto segment also delivered many strong achievements in 2019. We integrated the Alexa digital assistant into our PND product line, and we entered a new product category with the launch of the Overlander navigation device. ","At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, we announced the new Dash Cam Tandem that captures quality video both inside and outside the vehicle, regardless of lighting conditions. During the year, we also secured a significant backlog of new business as a Tier 1 supplier to the world's most respected automakers. ","For the year, revenue from auto decreased 14%. Gross and operating margins improved to 47% and 10%, respectively, and operating income increased 50% over the prior year. Looking ahead, we believe that the negative trends in auto will moderate as contributions from specialty categories increase and as previously announced OEM programs contribute in the back half of the year. ","2020 will also be a year of accelerated investment to support recently awarded programs. We are equipping our manufacturing facility in Olathe for auto OEM production. We are opening a new manufacturing facility in Europe that will be dedicated to auto OEM production. We also plan to hire additional resources in engineering and operations to support these complex, intensive development programs. With these things in mind, we anticipate that revenue from the auto segment will decrease 5% for the year. ","In summary, we are excited about the opportunities we see in every business segment. For 2020, we anticipate consolidated revenue will reach approximately $4 billion, up 6% year-over-year as growth in fitness, outdoor and marine more than offset a slight decline in the auto segment. We anticipate that revenue in aviation will be comparable to that of 2019. ","We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59.2% and operating margin of approximately 23.5%, reflecting our plans for an increased level of investment to support long-term growth initiatives. We anticipate a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 10%, resulting in a pro forma earnings per share of approximately $4.60. ","Our estimated tax rate will be favorably impacted by an intercompany transaction to migrate the ownership of a consumer intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States over the next several years. Doug will be providing more details on this in a few moments. ","So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results and outlook. Doug?","Douglas Boessen","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and give comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue over $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, representing 18% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58%, a 90 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 32.9%, 210 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $277 million, a 24% increase from the prior year. Operating margin was 25.1%, 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.89, and pro forma EPS was $1.29, a 26% increase from the prior year. ","Looking at the full year results, we posted revenue of over $3.7 billion, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.5%, 40 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.3%, 160 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $946 million, a 21% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 25.2%, increase of 190 basis points from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $4.99. Pro forma EPS was $4.45, a 21% increase from prior year. ","Next, look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved strong double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments led by fitness segment at 34% growth, followed by the aviation and marine segments with growth of 22% and outdoor with growth of 16%. For the full year 2019, we achieved 12% consolidated growth, double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. ","Looking next to fourth quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, the fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments contributed 89% of total revenue in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to 84% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 30% to 34%. Aviation grew from 17% to 18%. ","Let's see these charts to illustrate our profit mix by segment. Fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments collectively delivered 99% of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 97% in the fourth quarter of 2018. All segments besides the auto segment had year-over-year increases in operating income dollars. ","Looking next to full year charts. For the full year, fitness, aviation, marine and outdoor segments made up 85% of total revenue compared to 81% in 2018. All segments had year-over-year increases in operating income dollars. ","Looking next to operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $36 million or 11%. Research and development increased $17 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. ","Our advertising expense increased approximately $8 million from the prior year quarter due to higher fitness and outdoor expenses, represented 5.7% of sales, 20 basis point decrease compared to prior year. SG&A increased $12 million compared to prior year quarter but decreased as a percentage of sales to 12.5%, 100 basis point decrease compared to prior year. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with the recent acquisitions. ","A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividend payments. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $2.6 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $707 million due to strong sales in the holiday quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $753 million. Increase is due to our strategy to increase data supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines and the acquisition of Tacx. ","During the fourth quarter 2019, we generated free cash flow of $208 million. For the full year 2019, we generated free cash flow of approximately $581 million, $183 million decrease from the prior year due to increased working capital needs. ","For 2020, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, approximately $225 million of capital expenditures. We announced our plans to seek shareholder approval for an increase in our dividend beginning with the June 2020 payment. Proposal, the cash dividend of $2.44 per share or $0.61 per share per quarter, it's a 7% increase from the current quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share. ","For full year 2019, we reported income tax expense of $35 million, which includes an income tax benefit of $118 million due to revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets as a result of the Switzerland tax reform. Excluding the $118 million income tax benefit, the full year 2019 pro forma effective tax rate was 15.5%, 20 basis point decrease from the prior year. ","The fiscal year 2020 forma effective tax rate is expected to decrease 10%, primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from Switzerland to United States. Taking into consideration the recent major tax reform in Switzerland and United States, the migration maintained an efficient tax structure and responds to the changing global tax landscape. Migration includes an intercompany license agreement that shifts intellectual property ownership for our consumer products from Switzerland to United States through royalty payments. This results in a favorable shift of income by jurisdiction, reduces our level expense related to uncertain tax positions. And at the multiyear license agreement, higher percentage of income were recognized in the United States, which concludes our formal remarks. ","Mike, can you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn","Cliff, I wanted to dig into aviation just a little bit here. And now that you -- I think you're through some of the tough compare with your guide for '20, but how do we think about the relative size of ADS-B in '19 versus '20? That's the first question. And then the second question, we've been getting a lot of from investors as to what extent was ADS-B driving associated retrofit activity when aircraft were in the shop for the mandate upgrade. And is -- how do you contemplate any fade in those associated revenues looking forward?","Clifton Pemble","Yes. So as we exited the year, there were approximately 118,000 airplanes that had been equipped out of a total park, if you will, of about 160,000. So ideally, that would mean there's something over 40,000 aircraft that could be left to equip. We don't think that all of those will be. Some of those are probably airplanes that maybe aren't in the best shape and might be scrapped, so there's going to be some fallout from those, for sure. ","We expect that most of the activity would take place in Q1 and some in Q2. And then the activity would tend to go down in Q3 and Q4. In terms of the retrofit activity, while it's true that ADS-B probably prompted people to come in and look at other things as we got towards the end of the mandate, particularly most of '19, I would say, shop capacity has been a real issue. So as a result, people may not have been able to do everything that they wanted to. ","And meanwhile, we've been introducing a lot of great new products, and these are generating a lot of interest. So we would expect that people will come back and do more. And the reality is that not everybody wants to put down the big bill for all of their retrofit needs at one time, too. So they may shop and continue to watch and then do more later. So we're optimistic about the retrofit market. We think that it still has a lot of room to grow.","Robert Spingarn","So if there's -- reflecting back on what you just said, if Q1 and Q2 see a little bit of ADS-B activity and probably a lower rate than the quarters of 2019, is it fair to say that you're anticipating a decline of something like, I don't know, let's call it, 60% or so, maybe a little more?","Clifton Pemble","Yes. We don't have guidance specific on that. I would tell you that ADS-B is not a market that goes to 0 because transponders need to be replaced. There's new features, new products that are introduced. So there will always be an underlying market for ADS-B out there. And of course, new airplanes always need ADS-B. So there will be a run rate of ADS-B going forward.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then just -- I wanted to ask you if -- to what extent you've factored coronavirus into the guide? And that's it for me.","Clifton Pemble","Yes. So coronavirus, I think it's still an emerging situation, and the cases seem to be peaking, but we're watching that. I would say it's also early in the year, so we don't -- even if there's some short-term impact, we feel like there's a lot of room to make up for that. So far, our impact has been minimal, and our safety stock situation has helped us there. If the outbreak continues to go on, then, of course, that would change the game for us and a lot of other people. But for now, we're optimistic that things are coming back online. Our suppliers seem to be coming back although, obviously, there's a ramp-up period that we're managing through all of it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Charles Anderson from Dougherty & Company.","Charles Anderson","Congrats on stellar 2019. I want to start with automotive. A few things. I think number one, Q4 was a little bit lower operating income, looks like higher R&D. Was that just the start-up ahead of the BMW? I was curious there. ","And then you did make some comments in your prepared remarks, Cliff, about production in the U.S. and then in Europe. I know you talked about the Ford deal recently, but I wonder if there are any others to highlight that drives putting those facilities together.","And then lastly, on automotive. I know PND has kind of continued probably to be a headwind. I'm assuming we're not basing there. So maybe just kind of curious what you're embedding in the guidance in terms of the rate of decline in the PND business.","Clifton Pemble","Yes. So in terms of the lower operating income in Q4, there was a mix of some onetime items there as well as increased R&D associated with noncapitalized projects. So both of those kind of came together to generally lower the overall auto operating income. The PND side is very profitable. And so that's something we're not as worried about. We do see that the market will continue to decline in 2020, although at a moderated pace as specialty products become a bigger part of the mix. And we also see a shift in terms of buying behaviors to the more advanced products that we offer. So that's all good news in our view. In terms of the production plan in the U.S., we're equipping our factory here to be able to supply the BMW program that we won a few years back for North American production. And then the European investment is for the most recent BMW win that will supply the European factories for BMW.","Charles Anderson","Okay. Perfect. And then for my follow-up, with the change that you made that influences the tax rate, I'm just sort of curious how that impacts where cash is accessible to corporate -- for corporate purposes. I wonder if you could just sort of update us on kind of where everything stands, in terms of where cash isn't accessible, and if there's any change there.","Douglas Boessen","Sure. Well, thanks, Charlie. So as it relates to where the cash is, it does not change that. So let me give you a little bit of a little more detail or color on the transaction that we went through. So this relates to intercompany license agreement between Switzerland and the United States. And so the situation is that United States is going to be paying a royalty payment to Switzerland for the use of certain consumer IP we have in Switzerland. So as a result of that, that lowers the amount of income recognized in the United States, increases it in Switzerland. And so as result of that, that gives us a favorable income mix by jurisdiction during that license period. So during the license period, the situation is that a higher percentage of the income will be going to the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nick Todorov from Longbow Research.","Nikolay Todorov","Congrats on great 2019 results.","Clifton Pemble","Thanks, Nick.","Nikolay Todorov","Cliff, you talked about expanding distribution of tax in 2020. And I think you're also having some additional capacity coming up online for tax specifically in 2020. In your view, can you give us some sense on how should we think about overall fitness gross margin in 2020? We see that fourth quarter gross margin dipped below 50% for the first time, I believe, since 2010 or before. So can you give us some color how should we think about that?","Clifton Pemble","Yes. So the fitness gross margin, that is influenced by product mix. And in the fourth quarter, we had a lot of products that were sold, obviously, for the holiday season, particularly promotional. Products and tax itself is a product line, as we've said before, that is slightly dilutive to the overall gross margins of the segment. And so just under 50% was obviously a result of all of that mix. We would expect that to go up and down as the year progresses depending on the seasonality and the kind of products that we offer. And generally, we're targeting around a 50% gross margin for the segment. And mid- to high-teens operating margin for the segment.","Nikolay Todorov","Okay. Got it. And Doug, I believe you said our CapEx for 2020 is expected to be around $225 million, if I'm not mistaken. That's about 2x an increase. Am I assuming correctly, that's mostly coming from investments on the auto side and facilities and so forth? Or there is something else to that?","Douglas Boessen","Yes. So let me give you -- yes, it is at an elevated level compared to 2019. So yes, 2020 will be an investment year for us as it relates to CapEx and probably going into 2021. So what's driving that is exactly what Cliff mentioned. We're making some investments relating to our auto OEM business. So we are equipping our facility here in Olathe to handle OEM. Also, we'll be opening a European facility, manufacturing facility for OEM. Also, we are building a new manufacturing facility for Tacx in Netherlands for that acquisition. ","Another piece relates to our overall Olathe facility expansion. If you remember, we built a new facility for our manufacturing as well as our distribution. We're complete with that. What we're doing now is actually renovating our previous manufacturing and operation facility there. We're renovating that to increase our work space because of increased headcount to support our R&D expansion as well as innovation, the big drivers we have.","Nikolay Todorov","Yes, I see. And last one for me. The implied guidance assumes about 100 basis points of increase in operating expenses as a percent of sales, Doug. Can you give us some color? Is it mostly coming up from higher R&D expenses? Or is it across the board?","Douglas Boessen","Yes, sure. So as it relates to 2020 operating expense, to give you a little bit a flavor of that by category. First, on advertising. For advertising, a percentage of sales, we would expect our advertising to be relatively consistent year-over-year. We'll probably spend more advertising dollars, but we try to keep that in line with our sales growth. ","As it relates to R&D, yes, there will be increased R&D as a percentage of sales year-over-year. We expect that to probably be up maybe about 100 basis points. And then as it relates to SG&A as a percentage of sales, we expect that to be up about 50 basis points or so. So what's really driving that increased operating expenses really is to support our increased revenue growth, so one of which is the situation that we talked about for OEM business. So we're making some investments there. It occur -- increased R&D operations as well as IT for different systems there. ","From an R&D front, overall, we'll continue to invest in R&D to make sure that we have innovation in our products. And lastly, I would say is that there is some full year impact to some acquisitions, most notably Tacx that we did in 2019, and we'll have the full year impact of those items. So all of the expense items as well as the CapEx we talked about is really to support our increased top line growth into revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Will Power from Baird.","Charles Erlikh","This is Charlie Erlikh on for Will. I wanted to ask about the fitness segment and the strength in the quarter. Could you talk a little more about what specifically drove that strength? And it's been a real standout in 2019, it looks like you're expecting another strong year in fitness next year. So how have you been able to successfully navigate the competitive environment where Apple continues to do really well as well?","Clifton Pemble","I think for us, the strength, Charlie, for the year and also for the quarter was really around new products, our new Venu, v\u00edvoactive 4 product lines are very popular as well as the new running product lines that we introduced last year. We completely refreshed all of those product lines, so they did very well. And then separately, we got very promotional with some of the previous generation products, which drove a lot of sales activity in the holiday quarter. ","In terms of just drivers around the competitive landscape, I would say that we feel like the landscape has generally narrowed a lot. Of course, Apple is a big one out there just in terms of total wearables market share. We believe that we differentiate from Apple and others with our products that are built specifically for active lifestyles. And we focus on all-day, 24\/7, wearability, long battery life and the ability to track detailed health metrics. So we're very focused on those categories, and we believe we're doing very well with our space.","Charles Erlikh","Great. Yes. No, that makes sense. And congrats on surpassing $1 billion in revenue. That's quite an accomplishment.","Clifton Pemble","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley.","Erik Woodring","Just a quick procedural question here. As I think about the tax rate going forward, should we think about 10% as somewhat the normalized tax rate as this license is intact beyond 2020 basically into 2021 and out? Or how should we think about that beyond 2020? And I have a follow-up.","Douglas Boessen","Yes. So as it relates to our tax rate, we do not give any detailed guidance beyond the current year. So there's a number of things that really impact that tax rate, all the way from the amount of income we have, the income by segment, income by country, reserve releases as such. But while -- from a high-level perspective is while we have the license agreement in that place, we will see that favorable income mix by jurisdiction. Then when we no longer have a license agreement at that point in time, we'll have a higher percentage of our income going to U.S. So that's directionally what it is. But like I said, there's a lot of puts and takes in that tax rate, but it's something that we looked at to make sure that we do maintain as efficient of a tax structure as possible.","Erik Woodring","Perfect. That's super helpful. And then, I guess, if I just think about the auto's business, I guess, what your guidance would imply and your commentary would imply that you're going to see more of a mix shift towards the OEM business away from the business in 2020. And so I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is this mix shift a tailwind to gross margins? A headwind to gross margins? Just would love to hear kind of the puts and takes as you think about auto gross margins in 2020.","Douglas Boessen","Yes. So as it relates to gross margins, you're correct. In the auto segment as a total, OEM will be a higher percentage of the total. So that will be a situation where auto OEM gross margins are lower than the PND. So that will be something that will impact and decline the total auto gross margin in 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Chung from JPMorgan.","Paul Chung","So as we think about free cash flow for 2020, you had kind of a working cap drag in '19, and part of that was from Tacx. But how should we think about '20 working cap dynamics? And then what is your kind of free cash flow guide for the year? Should we expect kind of like a bounce back in conversion this year? And then as you think about seasonality for the business, you have some aviation flow-through in first half and then a pickup in the second half in auto OEMS, so a lot of moving pieces. But how should we think about kind of seasonal patterns from last year -- relative to last year and prior years? Or anything you want to call out. And then I have a follow-up.","Douglas Boessen","Yes, sure. So as it relates to free cash flow for 2020, you're correct. First, we'll start with 2019. So yes, 2019, we did have some significant capital -- working capital needs, primarily in inventory area. That situation, as previously talked about, for 2019, we basically made a strategy to increase our days of supply, to increase our safety stock because of Tacx, mitigate Brexit, all those type of things as well as we had increased AR just because of the increase in our sales year-over-year. ","Now turning to page to 2020. We expect our free cash flow to bounce back. Our current estimates for free cash flow for 2020 are about $750 million. So with that, we're not anticipating to have the same type of year-over-year working capital needs that we had in 2019 and 2020. ","I should say, as it relates to inventory, we would expect inventory -- year-end inventory 2020 to increase from 2019 levels, but probably more in line with what the sales increase, not the type of a step function that we have. So we'll get some benefit in 2020 relating to that situation I have in working cap. ","As it relates to how it falls out through the year, the situation is we were building inventory throughout the year. So there'll probably be a situation where we may have -- a situation where we have inventory year-over-year higher than just the level of sales as we get through the year in the first few quarters. But by the end of the year, hopefully, it will be in line with that as we go forward. ","But then also, CapEx plays into that also. That's partially offsetting that to increased CapEx we have, which we previously talked about. So to go back to it, we're making some increased investments in there for building us for the revenue for the future.","Paul Chung","Got you. And then your kind of seasonality of top line, if you could follow-up on that. And then also the increase in OpEx, is that going to be pretty measured throughout the year?","Douglas Boessen","Yes. So as it relates to the top line, I'll give you some real high-level points on that. I think Cliff alluded to the situation in auto, the back half of the year, you'll see some of that increase relating to OEM. Also, I should mention, in the fitness side of our business related to the acquisition of Tacx. So Tacx was acquisitioned, that was first -- or the second quarter, so we'll get some benefit in Q1 relating to that. So that will kind of be the seasonality related to revenue. And then as it relates to OpEx, I said that will be something where we started to basically build some of those operating expenses here in Q4 moving into 2020. So that will be something that we'll see that build throughout the year.","Paul Chung","Okay. And then last question on Tacx. What was the contribution in the quarter? And then as we lap it in 2Q, how should we think about the kind of growth in the second half in fitness for 2020? How much of that growth are you kind of baking in for expanding your distribution efforts for Tacx?","Clifton Pemble","Yes. So the majority of the growth that we saw in fitness was organic. Tacx was less than half of the growth that we saw. And of course, we have 1 quarter in 2020 that we're basically comping until we comp against the acquisition of Tacx. So going forward then, the outlook would be for all organic growth, Tacx contributing to the expanded distribution and then, of course, we anticipate a strong year for our wearable products as we had in 2019.","Operator","I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Teri Seck.","Teri Seck","Thanks, everyone. As always, Doug and I are available for calls throughout the day. We hope you have a wonderful day.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Kerri Thurston, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kerri Thurston","Good morning. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd.'s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Please note that the earnings press release and the related slides are available on Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcript will also be available on our website.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market share, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and CEO; and Doug Boessen, CFO and Treasurer. Also joining us today is Kevin Rauckman, who continued to provide support throughout the third quarter.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong third quarter results that included growth in revenue, operating income and pro forma EPS. Consolidated revenues increased 10% year-over-year with double-digit growth in each of our non-Auto\/Mobile segments. Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor revenues grew 24% on a combined basis and contributed 56% of total sales in the quarter. Gross and operating margins were 56% and 25% respectively, a year-over-year improvement driven by segment mix.","Operating income grew 16%, with non-Auto\/Mobile segments generating 70% of total operating income.","In the third quarter, we executed our previously announced intercompany restructuring, which resulted in $308 million of tax expense. This onetime expense drove a GAAP net loss per share of $0.76. After adjusting for foreign currency losses and onetime events, we generated $0.76 of pro forma EPS in the quarter, representing an increase of 10% over 2013. A reconciliation of our pro forma EPS is provided in the appendix to these slides.","So next, I'll highlight segment-specific results and initiatives.","Looking first at the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 43% on a year-over-year basis with strong contributions from activity trackers and running products. We delivered gross and operating margins of 64% and 32% respectively. While gross margin increased from last year, the operating margin was essentially flat due to investments in advertising leading into the holiday season. Even with these investments, we generated operating income growth of 38% in the quarter.","We recognize that competition isn't standing still and neither are we. We continue to innovate and broaden our product portfolio. In the third quarter, we launched v\u00edvosmart, an activity tracker that also delivers smart notifications from an iOS or Android smartphone. In addition, we announced the Forerunner 920XT, our next-generation, multi-sport product that incorporates advanced running dynamics and connective features, including smart notifications and line tracking. Finally, we announced the Connect IQ software developers kit. This exciting initiative will allow developers and partners to build apps and customizations that will extend the utility and attractiveness of our devices. We look forward to seeing all the possibilities to be explored through Connect IQ.","Turning next to Outdoor. Revenues increased 19% in the quarter with recently launched products in golf, dog tracking and training and wearables contributing to the strong quarter. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 65% and 42% respectively in the segment. Due to the strong performance in the third quarter, we now anticipate Outdoor will generate full year revenue growth in the mid-single digits. In addition, we will continue to explore and innovate in the Outdoor segment to drive long-term growth in our current markets as well as other adjacent categories.","In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 19% with all product categories contributing to the strong performance. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 73% and 29% respectively. Operating income grew 25% in the quarter, ahead of revenue growth, due to gross margin improvement. We have continued to complete certifications that represent market share gains in both the business jet and helicopter markets. Two recent examples are the Cessna CJ3+ with the G3000 system and the Enstrom 480B with the G1000H system. Beyond OEM share gains, we are also pursuing additional aftermarket opportunities. At the NBAA show last week, we announced a new standalone ADS-B solution for the business jet market that significantly reduces the cost and complexity of complying with the FAA NextGen mandate. This solution will be available for popular business jets like the Citation 560, the Beechjet 400A and the Learjet 60, with others to follow. In addition, we announced the availability of a number of avionics enhancements for our existing King Air retrofit certifications.","Finally, I'd like to highlight that the photo on this slide shows the G5000 retrofit solutions as installed in our Beechjet 400A. Our flight test program is underway, and we anticipate final certification to be completed in late 2015.","Revenue in the Marine segment grew 12% in the quarter, driven by the third quarter acquisition of Fusion. As planned, we delivered higher gross and operating margins in the quarter, which allowed us to generate 32% operating income growth. We continue to focus on product innovation, highlighted by the announcement of our 2015 product lineup, which includes new chartplotters, multifunction displays, radars and autopilots. We believe these products further differentiate us from the competition and should provide the foundation for another year of growth in 2015.","In our Auto\/Mobile segment, revenues decreased 5% in the quarter as PND industry volumes continued to decline per expectations. Profitability of this segment continues to be strong with operating margins of 17%. In addition, we continue to build market share with NPD reporting our highest-yet U.S. market share for the third quarter at 84%, an improvement from 78% in third quarter of 2013. Recently, we announced our partnership with Honda on their 2015 Civic and CR-V models to be delivered in Europe, Russia and South America. Garmin will be providing integrated navigation software with many of our signature features such as lane guidance, photoReal junction views and predictive routing. This program win highlights the quality and reliability of our industry-leading navigation solutions, which we will continue to leverage as we build market share in the infotainment industry.","And finally, with 3\/4 of the year behind us, we're revising our full year guidance to reflect our outlook for the remainder of the year. We now anticipate revenue of approximately $2.85 billion, at the high end of prior guidance. In addition, we anticipate strong full year margin performance, with gross and operating margins at 56% and 24% respectively, consistent with prior expectations. Our prior guidance called for a pro forma effective tax rate of 15%, which was based on a number of assumptions, including the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. Since this tax credit has not yet been authorized by Congress, we've removed it from our assumptions until there's more clarity around this item. But as a result of all these factors, we're increasing our pro forma EPS guidance to approximately $3.10, representing full year growth in the high teens. These expected strong results in 2014 further validate our strategy of diversification and multipronged growth. Our 2014 results will provide the foundation upon which we can drive continued category expansion and market share gains to ensure long-term growth.","So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will discuss additional details of our financial results. Doug?","Douglas G. Boessen","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I begin by reviewing our financial results and provide summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $706 million for the third quarter. As previously highlighted by Cliff, our revenue represents a 10% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was strong at 56%, a 160 basis-point increase from prior year, driven primarily by favorable segment mix. Operating margin was 25%, an increase of 130 basis points from the prior year. This is a result of the gross margin favorability of 160 basis points, partially offset by operating expense growth of 11% or $22 million. Our pro forma effective tax rate increased to 21%. We'll discuss the tax rate in more detail later. Adjusting for the foreign currency loss, tax impact of intercompany restructuring and tax benefit for the release of material reserves, pro forma EPS was $0.76, which represents a 10% increase year-over-year.","We shipped 3.7 million units during the quarter, up 12% from 3.3 million last year. Total company average selling price of $192 per unit, down 2% from $196 third quarter of 2013, driven primarily by fitness product mix.","Next, we'll review how our third quarter revenue breaks down by segment. We experienced double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. Looking at the charts on this page, the Auto\/Mobile segment represented 44% of our total revenue during third quarter of 2014, down from 49% in the prior year. Fitness grew to 16% of revenue current period compared to 13% in the prior year.","These charts illustrate our profitability mix by segment. Our non-Auto\/Mobile segments delivered 70% of operating income in the quarter, up from 64% in the prior year quarter.","Looking next at year-over-year gross margin. Total company gross margin improved to 56% due to positive segment mix and stable or improving margins in most segments. Total operating margin improved to 25% due to the increased gross margin performance.","As previously mentioned, third quarter operating expense increased by $22 million or 11% on a year-over-year basis, while increasing 30 basis points, percent of sales. R&D increased $11 million year-over-year and 30 basis points to 14% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce with increasing resources focused on compelling new Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor products.","Our advertising expense increased $7 million over the prior year quarter, representing 4.7% of sales, a 60 basis-point increase. Additional spending was focused on Fitness and Outdoor to support new product categories. We'll continue to manage advertising cost by segment with a near-term focus on market share growth and wearables.","SG&A was up $4 million compared to the prior year quarter, decreasing 60 basis points, percent of sales, to 12.8%. We continue to manage these costs closely to gain operating leverage when possible.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for third quarter 2014 was 21% compared to 15.7% in third quarter 2013. Pro forma tax rates exclude tax expense associated with the intercompany restructuring in 2014 and the tax benefit from material release of reserves in both 2013 and 2014. Increased tax rate was primarily driven by unfavorable income mix by tax jurisdiction, expiration of some Taiwan tax incentives and expiration of the U.S. R&D tax credit. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 17% given the anticipated delay in approval of the U.S. R&D tax credit.","We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of almost $2.8 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $470 million, a result of seasonally lower sales in the third quarter. Year-over-year accounts receivable was basically flat, resulting in improvement in day sales outstanding. Our inventory balance increased to $466 million on a sequential basis as we build inventory for the holiday season. We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business.","Excluding a $78 million cash tax payment related to the intercompany restructuring, cash from operations was $220 million and capital expenditures were $18 million, resulting in free cash flow generation of $202 million during the quarter. We also repurchased $79 million of company stock during the third quarter, completing our current repurchase authorization. Our dividend and stock repurchase activity during 2014 will return approximately $600 million of cash to our shareholders.","This concludes our formal remarks. Tim, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to start out with a pretty high-level question on the activity band market. Wondering now that you've been in the market for a couple of quarters, is there anything that has changed? Or has your view of this market changed in terms of sizing, opportunity or where it's trending? I'm just -- it's a big delta in your business and I'm just wondering how maybe your thoughts have evolved on the business.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Andrew. This is Cliff. I think in terms of where we're at today in the market compared to where we thought we would be at the beginning of the year, we're pleased with where we stand today. We believe that the market has grown a lot over last year. There's still a lot of awareness that's being generated in the market. So it is a nice additional market for us to be involved in, and we do feel good about where we're at today.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And one follow-up on the Auto margin. I think -- if -- in my model, if I normalize for the deferred revenue impact, it was down a little bit more than I would have thought. I think we've spoken previously about kind of high-teens margins in the PND business and sort of flattening OEM spending and then a ramp of the OEM revenue with contracts like Mercedes. So I'm wondering how you're thinking about that margin. Do you still think that, that can improve over time? And what are the puts and takes that are impacting Q3 here?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think it\u2019s the PND volume declines and the mix of PND changes with the overall segment. Definitely, OEM and Mobile will contribute more in terms of their margin profile. In terms of the PND-specific product category, we feel like those margin structures have been relatively stable in the product category and we feel like they're performing as we expected.","Operator","And we'll go next to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Also a couple of questions on the Fitness segment. I wanted to just get your thoughts on what drove the decline there sequentially, if that was an end demand function or inventory-related? And also, I wanted to get a little bit of context around the price cuts on the v\u00edvofit we saw on Monday. And then just looking forward into Q1, how are you thinking about potential competition from the Apple Watch? And what, if anything, are you doing in terms of interoperability with HealthKit?","Clifton A. Pemble","Okay. So quite a few things there. I'll probably start with the seasonality question. It is normal for this market to be seasonal like every other market, and we feel like the sequential drop from Q2 to Q3 was within our expectations. So we don't see anything there that stands out as a difference from what we've seen in the past. In terms of the price cuts, those are normal pricing actions that we have planned around leading up into the holiday season and around our promotional activities. And in terms of next year, we're not in a position to really provide specific guidance. But in terms of where we stand with our product positioning, we feel good about where we stand today, both in terms of what we're offering as well as the product road map that we have.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Gentlemen, maybe your thoughts on just how we should think about the subcategories of Fitness and Outdoor over the longer term, considering some parts of the -- some products such as action cameras have not worked. There\u2019s price stimulation going on in some of these Fitness categories. And perhaps, if you can relate your comments on your overall views of price elasticity of demand as we get into the holiday season and how we should balance and consider price declines to drive unit growth in both categories of Outdoor and Fitness.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, in terms of the subcategories of these 2 different segments, every segment has categories of products that have higher- or lower-margin profiles, so we don't really view what's happening in Outdoor in the action camera space as well as Fitness in the tracker space as anything unusual in terms of what we see overall in these segments. I think from an elasticity point of view, and I think you're probably referring specifically to the tracker market, I think the market is very new. And so we, like many others, are learning in terms of what seasonal demands are and what the elasticity will be. We're promoting the category heavily and as a result, we expect that we'll be able to perform well in the fourth quarter with our advertising.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then Doug, maybe a question for you. Recognizing that we're still in the early stages of the transition, is there any preliminary framework in terms of free cash flow returns to shareholders, how we should be thinking about capital structure? Thus far, the company has recommended the return of $600 million in cash every single year. Should that change? Or should that be supplemented in the future?","Douglas G. Boessen","Yes. This is Doug. Yes, the way I look at it, it's pretty well consistent with our previous strategy we had. This year, 2014, we'll return about $600 million between dividends and share repurchases to our shareholders. We'll take another look at that in February, looking at our dividend and share repurchase in connection with our guidance for 2015. But I'd say it's pretty consistent with what we've looked at in the past.","Operator","And we'll go next to Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask you, with the maintenance of your guidance and the trends in the Auto\/Mobile market, how should we think about the implied declines in Q4, which are rather strong, obviously against a tough comp? But of course, that's the fourth quarter seasonality as well. So how do we think about the fourth quarter on the Auto side?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, as the markets mature, the seasonality impacts of fourth quarter have been more muted, so we're conservatively counting on a more muted response this year as well. But it's all baked into the overall guidance that we provided.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And because that implication is a double-digit drop, which you really haven't seen, so it sounds like there might be some conservatism there.","Clifton A. Pemble","Again, we've treated this market conservatively over the past couple of years, recognizing that it can surprise in terms of overall demand, so -- but we feel like retailers are looking at the category very realistically, and our guidance factors in that realistic view.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly on Marine, if I could ask about the pricing environment, how competitive that remains and what the longer-term trend in margins might be, given where you've been in the -- maybe more of the distant past.","Clifton A. Pemble","So Marine pricing is very competitive. There's definitely several players that are promoting quality products at value prices. And some of the markets that we are penetrating, including the inland fishing market is very competitive. So we would expect that the pricing environment is challenging. And as a result, the margin impact is definitely a factor. We would anticipate as we roll out new products on a regular basis that we should be able to bring our margins up incrementally from where they're at. But because of the competitive environment, it may not be to the high levels that we've seen several years ago.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just a clarification. You mentioned Fusion was a driver of the sales growth there on a year-over-year basis. Was it a full driver? How do we think about Fusion relative to the rest of the business?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. Fusion was definitely the biggest contributor to that growth. Our other categories, our organic categories, were more flat year-over-year. But the reason for that is that last year, we were doing a lot of sell promotion on some end-of-life products, particularly our 700 series of chartplotters. So as a result of those factors, we were more or less flat year-over-year, but we felt good based on the strong performance we had last year with end-of-life.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions for me. A, first, Cliff, you guys have, over the years, talked about that you'll evaluate your investment in the in-dash and OEM market on kind of a year-to-year basis. And I just wanted to get a sense from you how you're feeling about the penetration that you're gaining and the share wins that you're having there and whether it makes sense to continue the level of investment that you've been putting into that segment? And then my second question is we've seen impact from -- or we've seen strong U.S. dollar over the last quarter, so can you talk a little bit about how you think that's been impacting your demand for products kind of across the different categories and what amount of headwind that might be creating?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, James. So in terms of Auto OEM, we view this as a long-term investment. We've been pleased with the progress that we've made. So far, the progress is admittedly incremental, but it's a very, very challenging market with a lot of incumbent suppliers. But we still believe that we have value that we bring to the table that automakers are interested in as evidenced by some of our recent wins. So I think as far as what we're doing there, we're still approaching the market with a pragmatic kind of investment and growing it as we go. In terms of the dollar impact, I think the biggest impact there is going to be the potential revenue headwind that occurs with the strengthening dollar. In terms of demand, there's typically some second-order effects that occur as pricing is adjusted over time, but we feel like the most immediate impact will be the revenue impact.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","First, on Outdoor. You had a pretty big leap-up in Q3 here, and I think what's implied in the guidance is you'll be somewhat flat in Q4 versus your typically up 20% or so sequentially for the holiday. So should we read into that, that basically you made a lot of the holiday shipments, call it, in Q3 here and you don't have that big follow-through like you normally have in Q4?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think one of the bigger impacts that we've had, Charlie, is the release of new products, particularly the S6, and we're also doing very well in the other wearable categories of the market, and dog products are also doing very well. This is hunting season time. So those are things that impacted us in Q3, and we would anticipate Q4 is a little more consistent with last year in terms of overall revenue levels because that seasonality is winding down.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","And then a question on the comment that you made in the release about adjacencies, and I think it was specific to Outdoor. Should we think about that as sort of incremental beyond just refreshing the VIRB? And you're looking now at categories where there are sort of well-established players like you've done recently, call it, with the VIRB and the v\u00edvofit. Or were you looking at some sort of, call it, brand new categories where you'd almost invent a new type of a device?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we don't have specifics, but I would say that our profile is that we always are looking for adjacent categories in each of these segments to help grow them incrementally.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rich Valera with Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Cliff, question on the overall growth rate or rate of decline of the PND market. It seems the market rate of decline has been slowing. I just wondered if you would care to say what you think that market might do as we move into next year and beyond, if that rate of decline might bottom and actually, if that market could flatten. So if you could answer that one, first. And I have a follow-up.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. So we don't have projections yet formulated for 2015. We're really looking at how Q4 performs to really put all of our views together there. I would say, though, that you're right in terms of where we are today versus last year and the years before, that we do see some moderation in the bigger markets. Particularly, the Europe market has been flatter. Some countries are doing very well, in fact, even show some value-oriented growth in the market, whereas other countries are not doing as well, but on balance, it has moderated a lot. In the U.S. market, there's definitely been some moderation from our more conservative views. But still, it's decelerating at a rate that's faster than what Europe is.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And I'm curious, how do you think about the -- perhaps the balance between your share gains, which I guess at 85%, I'm wondering how much further -- how much more share you think you can get versus the moderating market? Do you think at some point those balance out? Or how do you see those 2 kind of conflicting dynamics of you maybe not being able to gain as much share, but the market, sort of stabilizing?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. Obviously, there's not as much runway from 85% to 100% as what there was from 50% to 85%, but we feel like we're in a very strong position in the market. We feel like a lot of the smaller players have kind of exited the U.S. market. So that leaves us in a strong position there. And in Europe, we have increasing gains there and we're in the kind of the mid-30s range in terms of market share and growing, so we see some offsetting effect there.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. Just one on tax rate. Not sure if you're willing to comment on that, but any thoughts at this point on tax rate for next year? Or is that just too early?","Douglas G. Boessen","It is too early for us. We'll be giving that guidance to you in February.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Bright with Avondale Partners.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Could you give us an update on the action camera market, more specifically, your inventory levels as of today as well as maybe any ballpark timing of new products in '15?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. So the action camera market, as we updated you in Q2, it's been a market for us that's new revenue, new opportunity. Obviously, I think our views at the beginning of the year in terms of our potential for success were higher than where we've ended up today, but it's still a category where we feel like we have differentiators and thus, we're continuing to invest at a pragmatic rate to be able to develop new products and continue to grow share in the market. In terms of inventory, we feel like that situation is manageable at this point. It's again a product category that's not huge compared to PND. So consequently, I think all of that\u2019s manageable. In terms of new products, we're constantly working on our product road maps. We don't have anything specific that we would share at this time in terms of action cameras, but we are continuing to invest.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Cliff, second question is around Auto OEM. The Honda win, I think you mentioned on the call, was software-only. What were the hurdles that you overcame for that win? And is this giving you any momentum in that marketplace?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think in terms of hurdles, company -- any auto company, but particularly one like Honda, is very particular about their suppliers, and they're looking for quality and stability and value in what they're offering their customers. And so we were able to meet those objectives that they were looking for and we feel like it speaks to the overall quality of our solutions and our reputation in the industry.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","As far as momentum?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think momentum, it always helps when you're collecting a large number of very prestigious brands that you're serving. So in our case, we're also on Daimler. We work with BMW, now Honda. So we feel very good about the customer list that we have in addition to the ones that we've had for a while now like Chrysler.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeremy David with Citigroup.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions on fitness. Fitness revenue missed consensus numbers in Q3. I don't think you're changing your view for the year. You're still guiding to 50%, 55% year-over-year growth. But should we infer that, well, maybe the 3 was just too bullish in Q3 and there's going to be more of a hockey stick in Q4? Or has your views changed a little bit maybe of the margin on that guidance for the year you've given a quarter ago?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, I think normally, as I mentioned before, the market is seasonal. So people are winding down some of their purchasing that goes on in the spring and early summertime. So Q3 is seasonal, and it does not surprise us what we saw in terms of the overall quarter. I would remind you in terms of Q4 and our outlook there, we're factoring in the impacts of last year's successful launch of the Forerunner 620 and 220. And so there are some year-over-year comparisons that are stronger there.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And I -- you talked a little bit about that Fitness band category. But I think given numbers on the Q2 call around the size of the category and your market share, I think, at the time, you said you think the category is about 10 million units and that you've reached a 10% market share in Q2. What's your thinking now exiting Q3 around the category size on your market share?","Clifton A. Pemble","We feel like there's really no change in terms of our outlook on the category size in terms of our market share. We do see positive indications that our share is increasing somewhere in the mid-teens range.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And finally on the Connect IQ initiative you've announced, it looks like you're going to develop your own ecosystem just like what Pebble did with their watch. What led you down that path? Are you looking potentially to participate in a bigger ecosystem like Android Wear? How should we think about emerging wearable ecosystems like Android Wear? For you is that an opportunity not a threat? Any commentary on that will be helpful.","Clifton A. Pemble","I think Connect IQ is in response to a lot of requests that we get from customers and partners who want a way to be able to expand the utility of our wearable devices but don't currently have a way to do that. So Connect IQ provides that opportunity for people to be able to expand the utility beyond just what we offer in our markets. In terms of how we're positioning that, we're not putting that up against the big open players that are out there. That's not our objective at all. But we do feel like there's a strong desire for people to be able to customize their watches and to be able to expand the utility.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","First, on Aviation. Understanding that you have some new products sounds like to continue helping to drive growth. Can you kind of provide an update just how you're feeling about that market as a whole here as we look out over the next few quarters?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, I think in terms of our outlook, we're really only providing consolidated guidance for 2014, but Aviation is a market where it's a very long investment cycle, and we continue to invest in the market in order to be able to bring new opportunities and revenue and growth in the future. But at the moment, we feel like we're positioned well and we feel like the momentum is good.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just on the Fitness business. You've obviously talked this year about spending in the second half to kind of improve positioning, both in terms of marketing, promotion, et cetera, as well as a point-of-sale. Can you kind of give an update as to how that's going and how far along you are in that process at this point?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we've been running some TV campaigns here in the U.S. and we'll start in Europe as well. So that's driving some additional investments there. We've been focused for the year on improving our point-of-sale, and that has also increased some of our marketing expenses. We feel like we're positioned well at this point and there's more work to do as we go into 2015, but a lot of improvement so far in 2014.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just wanted to get a little bit of thought around sort of the Aviation business and maybe your thoughts around how sustainable the growth rates are in that business, just given sort of the general macro environment and the new platforms that you're adding on.","Clifton A. Pemble","Okay. Again, I think our outlook at this point is good for the near term. As I mentioned in the previous question, we continue to invest in opportunities that will lead to long-term sustained growth. In terms of the industry, we feel like there's some signs of incremental growth off of the lows that we've been seeing. Some aircraft categories are actually recovered and doing very well. Others are still very depressed, but they're at least off of their loads. So we feel like right now the overall environment is better than it has been.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then can you just give us maybe a sense of how the retailers are thinking about the wearable space as you start to go into the fourth quarter? Maybe the amounts of promotion activity or advertising spending support that you have to provide. And just maybe a general sense of how they're viewing the category relative to your expectations?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, I think they're positive about the category. They see it as an opportunity for growth. It's really in line with the expectations that we\u2019ve had. Many retailers are investing in more floor space and advertising in the category. So at this point, I would say that their reaction and their response to this is what we expected.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First, on kind of the big-picture fourth quarter revenue guide. You put up kind of 10% to 12% top line growth the first 3 quarters of the year. I think the guidance implies about 5% for the fourth quarter. And I understand relative -- or typical conservatism, but I wonder if you could quantify to what degree, if any, currency or a lower contribution from deferred revenues has an impact on the fourth quarter. And then secondly, on deferred revenues, it looks like the balance sheet deferred revenues are down about 90 -- or will be down about $90 million or so for the full year. Is that a reasonable run rate that we should expect going forward in terms of the decline of deferred revenues in the balance sheet? Or is it still too difficult to predict?","Douglas G. Boessen","Yes. This is Doug. Regarding -- first of all, I\u2019ll talk about deferred revenue here in the third quarter. That gave us a benefit of about $0.06 in the third quarter. Looking at the fourth quarter, we would expect a benefit of about $0.05 on EPS there. And then looking at toward the future into 2015, what we'll do there is probably have a little bit of headwind in there. We won't expect as much of a contribution in 2015 as we would have in '14. And all of the forecast we have given you does impact -- does consider all the currency changes we do have.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And a follow-up, Cliff. On the Auto OEM business, when you're winning kind of these software module deals, what is the design cycle for that? In other words, when you announced the Honda win for the 2015 product line in Europe, when was that award actually won? Is this as long cycle as the hardware side of the infotainment business? Or can you win deals reasonably quickly when selling the turn-by-turn nav app only?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. There's probably a mix of scenarios there. In some cases, it's been a shorter cycle in terms of award to market. In other cases, it can be a very long cycle depending on how much new design work is going on in the hardware side of the equation. Remember, our software has to run and be involved in an overall system. And so consequently, there can be a lot of factors that impact the time-to-market.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Will Power with Robert Baird.","William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess a couple of questions. First, on the Fitness band market and distribution. Maybe you can update us as to where v\u00edvofit is in terms of distribution? Is it in all the channels that you'd like it to be in? And really a similar question for v\u00edvosmart. I know you started with the Best Buy exclusive. Is that -- where does that now stand in terms of reaching all those channels?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. In terms of v\u00edvofit, we feel good about where we're at with the channels. I think we're in pretty much every channel that we would expect to be in at this point. And there's new channels that are being opened up for this category that wouldn't otherwise be carrying an electronic product in more of our traditional markets. So there's some expansion that goes on there. In terms of v\u00edvosmart, it does just roll off of exclusivity now. So it's expanding to new channels, and that's happening at a good rate. I think there's been a good response to the product, and so there's a lot of retailers that want to carry it around the globe.","William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And do you think you'll be able to get that into most channels through the quarter here or by the end of the quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. It's rolling out now. I think really it's going to be limited more by product quantity availability than it is by channel.","William V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a bigger-picture question. As you head into 2015, you've got new competition from Fitbit. Apple, this is on the watch side of the equation. I wonder if you could just kind of characterize how you think about the competitive climate there. And then one of things a lot of the new competitors there are doing is enabling wrist-based heart monitoring. I know I think traditionally, you all kind of prefer the chest wrap. That's more accurate. I wonder how your thinking there is evolving just as the competitive climate there changes and whether that's something important to get in the portfolio.","Clifton A. Pemble","It is no question this category is drawing a lot of interest from people. It's a category that we really pioneered and innovated in over the years. So there's many new players getting into that, and we would expect many more that aren't necessarily visible at this moment. In terms of our product road map and aligning that with what's available and announced to be available from competition, we feel good about our positioning. And in terms of specific features like the wrist-based heart rate, that\u2019s definitely a new innovation, which is maturing in terms of its technical capabilities. We definitely see differences in terms of accuracy for certain kinds of athletes who are interested in that. But we also see opportunity where the technology is maturing and is something that we will be offering in our product lines as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's actually Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron. For the Aviation business, you saw a 19% growth in the quarter. Is there any way you could parse out how much of that growth is from share gains and new program ramp-ups in business Aviation versus cyclical recovery in your legacy general Aviation business?","Clifton A. Pemble","We have not typically broken it out. I would say though that some of the trends that I mentioned earlier in the OEM market are carrying over to the retrofit market where we're seeing retrofit equipment demand increasing as people are getting back to flying, they're updating their aircraft, they're getting ready for things like the NextGen mandate. So we feel good about what's happening in the industry across the board.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And I have a follow-on on the Auto OEM side of the business. Can you quantify the number of active campaigns you're currently pursuing and your win rate? And then for the contracts that you have not won, what are the key recurring themes you're hearing from your customers?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, we've not ever broken out our sales funnel, so I probably won't comment on the dynamics of that.","Operator","And at this time, there are no other questions in queue. I'll turn it back to Kerri Thurston for any closing remarks.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you, all, for joining us today. Doug and I will look forward to following up with many of you after this call and over the next few weeks as we launch some travel. And most importantly, based here in Kansas City, we wouldn't want to leave this call without saying, go Royals. Thanks, everyone. Bye-bye.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference call.

And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Teri Seck, Manager of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Teri Seck - Garmin Ltd.","Good morning. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Limited third quarter 2018 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcript will also be available on our website.","As a reminder, we adopted the new U.S. GAAP revenue standards in the first quarter 2018. The prior periods presented here have been restated to reflect adoption of this new standard. This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, gross and operating margins, and future dividends, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone.","I'd like to begin by mentioning a couple of important milestones we recently celebrated. During the third quarter, we shipped our 200 millionth product, which is a testament to our ability to design, manufacture and sell unique applications of technology for active lifestyles. Equally as exciting, we started production in our new aviation manufacturing facility located in Olathe, Kansas. This new facility more than doubles our production capacity, allowing us to serve our growing aviation business for many years to come.","Moving now to the quarterly results, earlier today Garmin reported strong third quarter consolidated revenue of $810 million, up 8% over the prior year. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 16% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 59.4% compared to the prior year, operating income improved to $196 million, up 13% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.97, and pro forma EPS of $1 in the quarter. We are pleased with our performance in the first three quarters of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance.","Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.","Starting with the marine segment, revenue increased 28% as we saw strong sales continue well into the summer boating season. Approximately half of the growth was organic, while the other half came from acquisitions. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 14% respectively. We recently announced our GPSMAP 8600 series of chartplotters. This is the first product line to use our new G3 maps, which combine the best of Garmin and Navionics content.","We've been very intentional about investing in our marine segment and the industry is taking notice. For the fourth consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as manufacturer of the year and Panoptix LiveScope won their prestigious technology award.","We were also recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative marine companies in 2018 by Soundings Trade Only, which is a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. It's an honor to be recognized by the marine industry and we will continue to invest in this segment to maximize its potential.","Turning next to aviation, revenue increased 17% driven by broad-based growth within this segment. Gross and operating margins increased to 76% and 35% respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 49% over the prior year. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of FltPlan.com and have began integrating these new services into Garmin's existing apps. Also, we recently announced that our ADS-B solution was selected by Gulfstream for the G280 aircraft. Finally, we announced the teaming agreement with Bell to supply avionics for on-demand mobility vehicles. While this project is in its early stages, it's an important first step towards creating a viable urban air transport system.","Turning next to the fitness segment, revenue increased 14% primarily driven by growth of our wearable products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20% respectively and operating income grew 12% over the prior year. During the third quarter, we launched the v\u00edvosmart 4, a slim smart activity tracker that includes a pulse ox sensor. In addition to providing blood oxygen saturation levels, this device also provides users with advanced sleep monitoring and a new Body Battery feature that helps individuals understand and manage their energy levels throughout the day. We also added Disney Princess and Marvel's Spider Man bands to our popular v\u00edvofit jr. product line along with new mobile app adventures.","Turning next to the outdoor segment, revenue increased 13% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by growth in wearables. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 65% and 38% respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 16%. We recently announced the integration of Spotify with the f\u0113nix 5 Plus series and just this morning, the Forerunner 645 Music was added to the list of Spotify-compatible wearables. This gives our customers the ability to download Spotify playlists to the watch via the Spotify app, which is available from the Connect IQ store. The app is already proving to be very popular with customers. During its first full day of availability, Spotify set a record for the most downloads of a new app from our Connect IQ store. Finally, we recently announced Instinct, a rugged and reliable GPS smartwatch, designed to expand the market for outdoor wearables.","Looking finally at the auto segment, revenues decreased 16% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 43% and 9% respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. We recently announced that we've been selected by the Chinese auto group, Geely, to provide camera and driving recorder systems beginning in model year 2020. This award demonstrates the progress we are making as a tier 1 auto supplier.","In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first three quarters of 2018. In light of the strong third quarter results, we are making some adjustments to our guidance. We anticipate our fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis with full year revenue of approximately $3.3 billion and a gross margin of 58.5%. We are raising our full year operating margin to approximately 22% and lowering our full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.45.","That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks Cliff. Good morning everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results (09:06) comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $810 million for the third quarter, representing an 8% increase year over year. Gross margin was 59.4%, a 120-basis-point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.2%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $196 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.2%, 110-basis-point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.97, pro forma EPS was $1, a 30% increase from the prior year.","Next, look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth led by double-digit growth in four of our five segments. This growth was partially offset by decline in our auto segment as a result of continued decline in the auto PND business. Combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 16% compared to the prior-year quarter.","Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness, and outdoor segments contributed 80% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 74% in the prior-year quarter. Auto declined from 26% to 20%, while every other segment grew. Marine grew from 10% to 12%, and fitness grew from 22% to 24%. As you can see from the charts illustrate our profit mix by segment, combined basis, the marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments delivered 92% operating income in third quarter of 2018 compared to 89% in third quarter of 2017. The aviation and outdoor segments had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.","Looking next to operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million, or 8%. Research and development increased $9 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Our advertising expense was down $1 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A was up $13 million compared to prior-year quarter, increased 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.","A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion. Accounts receivable have decreased sequentially due to seasonal trends and increased year-over-year on stronger sales. Inventory balance increased on a sequential basis to $557 million to prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter.","In the third quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $234 million, $81 million increase from the prior quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $100 million. During the third quarter of 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 8.5% compared to the effective tax rate of 20.5% in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to the benefits from U.S. tax reform, increased benefit from U.S. R&D tax credits. We expect our full year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 60%.","This concludes our formal remarks. Miranda, could you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Charlie Anderson from Dougherty & Company. Your line is open.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. It looks like on the guidance you guys have kept pretty much everything with the exception of the operating margin a little bit higher, so maybe if you could just add a little color on why you're seeing the better operating margin despite looks like mix is going to be fairly similar. And then as a follow on question, Cliff, I just would be curious on your thoughts on the geopolitical situation in terms of its impact on your business. So, are you seeing anything changing in terms of consumer behavior in Asia, and then I don't think you want to be a contract manufacturer, but people scrambling to move outside of China, are there any opportunities for you guys? Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, in terms of guidance, basically each segment that comprises our guidance has a different set of circumstance that we're looking at there. So, we took each one of those into consideration when we constructed our guidance, and the result came up to essentially relatively flat last year. With the product mix and the overall trends we're seeing, we felt confident to upgrade our operating income estimate as well.","In terms of geopolitical issues, right now, we don't really see anything that's moving the needle in terms of concerns. The Asia demand still appears to be very strong. I think there's increasing competition in some of the product lines there, particularly in wearables, but we are very competitive with our product line. I would say we probably don't have the vision to become a contract manufacturer given the situation around tariffs. We actually feel like our capacity is really quite constrained with our own demand right now. So, we probably don't have the ability to look for other opportunities like that.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Just quick on that last thing, on the op margin guide, you talked about it overall kind of flattish with last year's almost 22%. Automotive is clearly coming down a bit this year, so where do you see the strength that's offsetting that? Should we just follow the trends that we've seen for the first nine months, is there anything different about the fourth quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think segment mix as auto comes down, we get improvements from some of the other segments, which are typically higher than auto and there's variables within each segment as well, in terms of product mix, but for the most part, it's segment mix.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I was just thinking, auto is down from last year, so is there one particular segment where you see more momentum in the margin strength out of the other non-auto segments?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, we're doing well as you said in outdoor, I think our f\u0113nix line continues to be an increasing part of the overall outdoor segment mix and the new f\u0113nix 5 Plus series has a strong margin profile. And also in aviation, obviously we're doing well there, a large part of benefit there with product warranty, which has been very good and our products are very reliable in aviation, so we're getting some benefit on the margin side with that?","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then just lastly on marine, your organic growth is, I guess solidly in the mid-teens now and I wanted to ask how that compares with the overall marine market. Obviously, you're quite innovative across the product line. How would you say your market share movement has been? Is there a way to quantify?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think it's harder to quantify in marine. It's a fairly small industry in the recreational boating category, but by our estimates and I think based on financial estimates that we see from other players that have to be reported publicly, we are taking share and the overall market is probably growing in the 4% range, while we're growing, as you said kind of in the low to mid-teens organically.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Okay, well thank you very much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Right. Thanks, Robert.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Wittine from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you. Good morning. First off in automotive, can you help us understand the scope of the Geely agreement. Are you going to be included in every Geely car in China, or is it kind of an option, and if you could address timing of both that agreement as well as a reminder of the BMW China timing? Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. So, the camera solutions that we're providing to Geely are across most of their models in China, there is regulation around having camera systems in vehicles, so it is equipment that is required in the vehicle. Timing will be the model year 2020 when the first model start rolling out, so we'll start ramping up in later 2019 and that happens to also coincide with the BMW China supply agreement as well.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","So, Cliff, do you anticipate those rolling on are enough that people like us will notice a change in the trajectory of the segment which has been pretty constant over the last couple of years?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think definitely that will change the trajectory around auto OEM for sure and we also have additional wins in there that will come online in the 2020 timeframe as well, so we anticipate that that will be a strong building year for us.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then second in aviation, in the aftermarket portion, and I know there's good things happening on the OEM side, but can you update us on what you're seeing in terms of incremental capacity additions. It's been 90 days or so since we last surveyed that channel, so curious what you're seeing and hearing and obviously I'm just trying to modulate whether we should be expecting much growth in 2019 off of 2018 given those potential capacity constraints.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I don't think we really see anything different in terms of the trends of capacity. We're selectively adding some shops to our list as we see qualified shops out there that can bring on Garmin equipment, but in general, it's still fairly linear right now, which is one of the constraints that we face I think going forward in aviation, it's really not demand limited, it's capacity limited.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","So, it's fair to say that where capacity is a problem in 2019 therefore some of this demand on the regulation side will spill into 2020 is still your base case.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","That's our belief. I think we could reach the low end of the equipage estimates based on today's capacity rates, but nobody probably believes at this point that the low end is the most likely case. We think that there's upside potential beyond the 2020 deadline.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yuuji Anderson from Morgan Stanley.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. This is James Faucette sitting in for Yuuji. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on the December quarter, and how you're looking at that on a year-over-year. And wondering on the fitness specifically, how much of the year-over-year growth in Q3 was attributable to new launch timing versus what was really existing vivoactive and Forerunner growth, just trying to look and see if how much timing of launches may have had an impact on Q3 and Q4?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think timing definitely had an impact on Q3, if you look back where we were last year. We had not yet delivered our new product lines into the market. So it's a very easy comp versus Q3 of last year. In terms of what we're looking at for Q4, there's really two dynamics that we see. One is the year-over-year comp with particularly the vivoactive 3 which is a very popular line last year as well as this year. And then the rotation of the product mix within fitness from basic trackers to advanced trackers is another dynamic that's shifting things around within this segment.","So, all that coming together we feel like our implied guide is basically what it is fairly flat to slightly down, but we feel very good about the product positioning within the segment and where we're at this year. And I think looking forward into the coming year we'll have a strong product portfolio that we can build on.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then maybe a question for Doug. Just wondering on costs associated with the new facility, are the fixed costs now fully built-in to the implied Q4 guidance or will there continue to be incremental fixed cost that still need to be layered in before we get to the sustained run rate there.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. So basically we're only partial way through our facility build. So the current situation is that we have opened, we're running our aviation manufacturing piece. In 2019 we'll be moving over our distribution center. Then after that's complete we'll be renovating our existing facilities in office space. So there will be continued CapEx spend as well as cost in there. But we factored those into the guides, we gave you what the depreciation for Q4 and then when we get to next year, we'll be factoring in that depreciation expense at that point in time.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And that's great. And just from a timing perspective, how long until you get to fully installed and you'll be done building out this new space and facility.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, it'll probably be once all is said and done, like I said the distribution center will have moved in 2019 and probably be a couple of years after that by the time we'll be fully built out on the renovation of new facility. We're doing it over a period of time depending on what our needs are.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great, thank you very much, gentlemen.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, James.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Cliff, could you talk a little bit about the wearables market overall, what do you think about the organic growth in high end wearables, how much of your growth would you characterize as expansion of the base versus refresh, trade up. And any thoughts you have on kind of the competitive environment overall and then a follow up. Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, in terms of organic growth, we still see the smartwatch market as being a growth market, especially as people who have been in basic trackers over the years, start to look to trade up and do more. I think there's a lot of awareness around this space right now. So that's helping as well. So we're getting some benefits from organic growth but also as we expand our product line like we've done with the Instinct that helps expand our reach to other customers who otherwise may not be ready to go or make that kind of commitment to like a f\u0113nix watch for example. In terms of competition, it's definitely getting stronger. There's a lot of competitors out there and some coming into this space from China. So that is a dynamic especially in the Asia market, but also even other areas as they start to play the market like what is typically done from those players that play typically on price. So that's the way we see things right now.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then within the aviation business, what are your thoughts when you look through the ADS-B cycle, past even spill over demand. Do you have any high level thoughts, is this where maybe you start to segue into more targeted commercial aviation opportunities? Any concerns on pull forward of demand potentially sapping consumption in future years. What are your high level thoughts on, what the cycle means once you kind of get through it? Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","I think definitely there will be some slack to take up once the cycle is complete. I think if there's any good news in the capacity issue, it's that we believe it'll be more of a soft landing than what past mandates have been.","In terms of segueing to other areas, we definitely have new categories and new opportunities that we're pursuing, and the activity in aviation really is very strong right now in terms of the overall market. So, we anticipate that there are other opportunities that we can leverage. Pull forward is certainly a concern in a situation like this, particularly as we see a lot of people updating their cockpits along with ADS-B, but we do believe we have a strong product line that should be able to continue those upgrades, especially for people that might have been cautious early on and are now coming forward to maybe complete a panel upgrade after they did some basic work with ADS-B earlier.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Good morning, guys. What are you seeing, Cliff, in terms of, how can I say, the sell into the aviation channel OE next year, right. Are you starting to see \u2013 I mean, I would imagine you would, the pick up in OE demand particularly sort of in the business jet segment?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think it's little early to give specifics. But I would say that some of the platforms we're on that have been very strong like latitude, we continue to feel very positive of that going forward with the longitude coming on for Garmin that will be \u2013 represent an incremental market share gain for us. So, that should be a growth driver in 2019.","And in general, the industry as you know has had a lot of activity. So, barring some kind of an economic shock that might change the calculus of everything, I would say that our view is optimistic for the future.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then just maybe a couple other points shifting gears here. When you think about the sell-in to the channel into the holiday season? How is that going, particularly when we think about Black Friday, Cyber Monday and all that? Do you guys have any promotions going on, and I mean, what's your thoughts going into the holiday season?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think it's just like past years, definitely we have a lot of promotional activity that we're planning in terms of both cooperation with our retailers on sales as well as advertising. In terms of just overall activity, I would say it's about where we expect it to be. I think there's really no surprises, and if anything, we're chasing demand and keeping our factories busy. So, I think right now we feel optimistic about the quarter.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, then maybe just one last financial question. When you think about your balance sheet, do you think you're effectively capitalized, I mean, are you using the balance sheet the best you can. And then finally, what are you going to do with all the cash?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, yeah, going to cash, and looking at that, our primary uses for cash, one of which is paying reliable dividends, that's very important for us. We did increase our dividend this last year. The second of which is investments back into our business, an example of that is the facility expansion that we did here relates to our aviation manufacturing, our distribution center as well as building out some existing space for office there. But then also acquisitions \u2013 acquisitions we've done in the past to DeLorme, then Navionics and such, so look at \u2013 those are really the priorities for our cash on a go forward basis.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Ron.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Paul J. Chung - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. This is Paul Chung on for Coster. Thanks for taking my question. So, just on your operating margins, they're usually seasonally weaker in 3Q, but it came in pretty strong. I know aviation was a big contributor, but anything else you want to point out?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, as you said, segment mix is a big factor, so I think it's difficult to look year-over-year just at the number and draw a conclusion, you really have to look at how the pieces are moving within the segments.","Paul J. Chung - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, then that would mean that your view on kind of seasonality in fiscal year 2019 is unknown at the moment based on product mix?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think seasonality has got a different consideration, each segment has their own seasonality. And I think as the segments are growing and moving around each other that will impact obviously the overall combined margin of the business.","Paul J. Chung - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then the next question is on auto. So, how should we think about longer term sustainable operating margins? Have we kind of hit trough levels or is there some kind of opportunity to cut OpEx in this segment, I mean judging by your new win in China it looks like you're still investing a bit?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think we're investing in the Tier 1 side of auto OEM and we're also investing in keeping our consumer products fresh. We're investing in a third area which is creating niche applications of PND technology for other types of vehicles and navigation out there. So there is targeted things that we're doing, some ability to scale our expenses, but I think as the business transitions, especially if we get larger revenue contributions from OEM, the margin profile will obviously follow the mix of the segment and will tend to be in the kind of range that we're seeing now.","Paul J. Chung - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then a quick modeling question. What should we model for tax rate for 2019? Thank you.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, as it relates to 2019, we'll give that guidance in February, when we give all of 2019 guides, but I should mention that in 2018 we did see some favorable benefits that probably will not recur into 2019, one of which was the R&D tax credit. So when we were doing the tax (32:21) 2017 we identified some additional benefits. So, we rolled through some of those impacted from catch-up basically in 2017 to 2018, so I'll give you a little bit of color on that, but we'll give you a better idea on 2019 effective tax rate when we give all the guidance in February.","Paul J. Chung - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Power from Baird. Your line is open.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks. Yeah, just a couple of additional questions. Continued strong growth in APAC, I guess, has been a kind of a running theme. I know Fenix has been a big driver of that. Is that still the principal driver of the growth there, are you seeing uptake of new products that are potentially helping that. And given, Cliff, some of the commentary on increasing competition out of China, do you think you can continue to grow that region double-digits?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, in terms of driving growth in APAC, definitely Fenix is one part of that, each country and each market is probably different, but we've also been able to grow with some of our other categories such as golf and dive watches as an example.","In terms of China that's definitely a new factor that's going to put some dynamics into the market. But we believe that we have a strong product lineup and plans around our product line that will help us be competitive there. So at this moment, again, it's probably the normal course of competitiveness that we see.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. All right. And then just coming back to fitness, I know you called out wearables is, I think, the key driver, is there any way to get any further granularity with respect to trackers versus smartwatches, Forerunner, what the kind of the key pieces of the growth were in the quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think a lot of the growth was driven around the advanced wearable category which is really our GPS-enabled v\u00edvo line of products. We also saw growth in what we call the basic tracker category which we have a more unique product lineup there compared to the rest of the market but our unique product offerings have helped us to grow that category as well.","In terms of what we call the pure running market, we are kind of at the end of a product life cycle there. And so I think going forward as we introduce new products we'll see upticks but we're relatively flat in terms of the quarter on running.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Teri Seck for closing remarks.","Teri Seck - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, everyone, and have a great day. Doug and I will be available for your calls the rest of the day. Thank you. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Kerri Thurston. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd's. Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet. The archive of the webcast and related transcript will also be available on our website until March 29th.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our 2012 filing will occur next week.","Attending on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Rauckman, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, business trends for Garmin decelerated in the fourth quarter with consolidated revenues down 16% year-over-year.","Gross margins remained strong at 48.6% and operating expenses declined 4% in the period. However, operating margins declined to 19.5% due to the weakness in revenues.","As a group, our traditional market segments of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed 66% of our total operating income in the quarter. We generated $163 million in free cash flow during the quarter, resulting in a cash balance of just under $2.9 billion. Though these results did not meet our expectations for the quarter, we were pleased with our continued strong profitability and cash flow generation.","Reviewing the full year, consolidated revenue declined 2%. However, pro forma EPS grew 4% as margins exceeded the expectations we established at the beginning of the year. Operating income grew 9% to $604 million, with all segments, excluding Marine, contributing to the growth. As a group, our traditional market segments posted revenue growth and contributed over $1.2 billion in total revenue for the year. The revenue growth in these segments, combined with our strong margin profiles, generated 63% of our operating income. We delivered approximately 15.4 million units in 2012, a decline of only 3% year-over-year. Lower PND unit shipments were partially offset by growth in auto OEM, Outdoor and Fitness. We generated $646 million in free cash flow in the year, which is partially used to fund our quarterly dividend and small acquisitions throughout 2012.","Next, I will review each of our business segments highlighting 2012 performance, 2013 outlook and a summary of long-term strategic initiatives for each one.","Looking first at the Marine segment, on a full year basis, we reported year-over-year revenue decline of 6%, driven primarily by weak market conditions in Europe. Operating income declined significantly, as we invested heavily in research and development to deliver a growing portfolio of products. Though this has reduced segment profitability in the short term, we expect to see improved revenue performance in 2013 as a result of this investment.","During the year, we acquired Nexus Marine, resulting in an expansion of our presence in the sailing market, which is an area of strategic focus for our Marine segment. In 2013, we are targeting revenue growth of 5% to 10%, as we anticipate market conditions will improve and recent product introductions will generate additional revenue.","These new products include our recently announced glass helms, chartplotters and fishfinders which deliver improved performance through the addition of  GLONASS and enhanced sonar capabilities. We also introduced the quatix, a watch that includes compelling marine features, rugged utility and the versatility of wireless connectivity to the Garmin Marine network. The product is another great example of how we successfully leverage products and technologies across our business segments.","In the long term, our objective is to increase our market share across the recreational boating industry. We will continue to integrate and leverage our acquisitions in this segment, resulting in a broader range of products for our customers.","And finally, we will focus on improving the operating margin performance over the long term. While we expect inherent improvements due to revenue growth, we also see opportunities to improve profitability through increased efficiencies in the Marine segment.","Turning next to Aviation, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 2%. Operating income also grew 2% for the year, due to increased sales and improved gross margins, which offset higher operating expenses in the segment.","During 2012, we secured a number of significant wins in the Part 25 business jet market. Cessna selected our G5000 system for the Citation Sovereign slated to enter the market in 2013. Cessna also selected the G5000 for the Citation Longitude, a newly designed aircraft that will enter the market in 2017. In addition, Bombardier selected the G5000 for the new Learjet 70 and 75, which will also enter into service in 2013.","Utility and flexibility of our integrated cockpit systems has created opportunities outside of our traditional Aviation business. Northrop Grumman selected Garmin to provide the integrated flight deck for the optionally piloted Firebird. This is a commercial off-the-shelf solution that offers the required capabilities at significant time and cost savings to the manufacturer.","Also in 2012, we launched several new system components that position us to secure more content in future OEM and retrofit installations. These components include a solid-state weather radar, ADSP and enhanced TCAS solutions.","In 2013, we are targeting revenue growth of 10% to 15% in the Aviation segment. We anticipate the industry will remain relatively flat, with Garmin's growth driven by numerous certifications that expand our share in the business jet market.  In addition, we anticipate that recent product introductions will contribute to the growth.","Longer term, our growth initiatives are focused on continued development of our G3000 and G5000 platforms with OEM partners, which serves as the foundation of our growth in 2013 and beyond; identifying and capitalizing on additional retrofit opportunities, as well as commercial off-the-shelf opportunities within the military and government sectors; further share gains in the helicopter market; and capitalizing on opportunities created by the FAA's transformation of the national airspace system from a ground-based system of air traffic control to a satellite-based system in air traffic management.","Turning next to Outdoor. In the Outdoor segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 11%, which was primarily driven by strong demand for golf and dog tracking products. Growth was further enhanced by a full year of revenue contributions from Tri-Tronics, which we acquired in the second half of 2011.","Product highlights from the year include the fenix wristwatch, a rugged yet stylish device designed with the active outdoorsman, featuring GPS navigation with altimeter, barometer and compass functions. The Approach S3 golf watch, offering unmatched convenience, simplicity and capability through the combination of our wearable device platform, touch screen and a built-in worldwide course database. Finally, the Alpha Track and Train system, integrating the best-in-class technologies of Garmin and Tri-Tronics into a single device for the sporting dog market.","Looking at 2013, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 10%, driven by both ongoing momentum from existing products, as well as recently introduced products including the BarkLimiter and Delta series for the pet market. These new electronic training aids expand our addressable market and capitalize on the correction technology of Tri-Tronics to deliver superior yet affordable products for the pet owner.","Long term, we will continue to create new opportunities by identifying adjacent markets and product categories. We will maintain our focus on utility, content and innovative form factors to engage both new and repeat customers in the segment and embrace the opportunities created by mobile platforms to expand our market reach.","In the Fitness segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 8%. While this is not as robust as prior years, we maintained our leadership position in the GPS-enabled Fitness category, due to our strong existing product portfolio and the introduction of the Forerunner 10, targeting entry-level and value-conscious consumers.","Return to double-digit growth in the fourth quarter gives us confidence that the market remains underpenetrated. In 2013, we are targeting revenue growth of 5% to 10% in the Fitness segment. We plan to accomplish this by further penetrating the cycling market with our recently launched Edge 510 and 810, which offer unique connectivity features that our customers have requested. We continue to make progress with our Vector power meter and anticipate that it will be available midyear.","In addition, we will continue to deliver further innovation across the Fitness category that will appeal to a broad range of consumers, whether shopping for a basic device or full-featured multisport product.","Looking beyond 2013, we believe the Fitness segment will continue to grow as society becomes increasingly health conscious and data driven. We will focus on delivering compelling form factors and innovative products to the market, offering a complete solution of device, wireless connectivity, measurement sensors and a well-developed web portal. We will continue to build the Garmin Connect community and social networking capability amongst our users. We also will enhance our devices with best-in-class peripheral sensors that expand our addressable market and leverage our knowledge of hardware, software and connectivity.","Looking finally at the Auto\/Mobile segment, revenues declined 6% for the year as our strong market share gains could not offset the secular declines in the PND industry, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. We estimate that we exited 2012 with greater than 70% share in North America and approximately 32% share in EMEA.","Though the industry headwinds were challenging, we achieved strong margins, which generated over $220 million of operating income for the year. The sustained profitability of the segment highlights the value of market share gains within the segment.","Also in 2012, we announced our first tier-1 relationship with Suzuki, providing a complete infotainment head unit system for the vehicle. While the opportunity was somewhat diminished by Suzuki's exit of the North American market, we continue to deliver equipment in Europe, Australia, Russia, India, Canada and Mexico.","Also on the OEM front, we continued our successful partnership with Chrysler, launching Garmin navigation on the Dodge Dart and extending our geographic reach into China and Japan.","Looking ahead, we expect PND unit deliveries to continue to decline in 2013, driving revenues down 15% to 20%. We will maintain our market share leadership and focus on maximizing our profitability. We will continue to invest in auto OEM opportunities in 2013, leveraging our K2 infotainment platform that was introduced at CES this past January. K2 digital cockpit was nominated by CNET for Best of Show and garnered significant media coverage and consumer attention. We believe it represents one of the most intuitive yet full-featured infotainment systems offered today.","Beyond 2013, we'll be focusing on expanding our auto OEM business through additional program wins, as infotainment and navigation become an integral part of the vehicle and capitalizing on niche opportunities in fleet management, over-the-road, trucking and other specialty markets that offer high-margin profiles.","Finally, turning to guidance. Given our revenue outlook and expectations for each segment, we are projecting revenues of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion in 2013, with gross margins stable to slightly increasing from 2012 levels. We are projecting operating income between $480 million and $500 million, with operating margins of 19% to 20%. Factoring an anticipated effective tax rate of 14%, which is 1 percentage point higher than the previous year, results in a forecasted 2013 earnings per share of a range of $2.30 to $2.40.","While it appears that 2013 will be a challenging year, we remain highly profitable with strong cash flow generation that allows us to adequately fund our growing business and generate long-term shareholder value through these initiatives. We remain committed to an attractive dividend yield, and our recently announced share repurchase program will return even more value to our shareholders.","That concludes my remarks. Kevin will now walk us through our Q4 and full year financials in more detail. Kevin?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Thanks, Cliff, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement for the quarter and full year and then segment results, move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement and then finally conclude with some comments regarding our full year 2013 expectations.","We posted revenue of $769 million for the quarter, with pro forma net income of $133 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.68 per share, which excludes foreign currency loss during the period. Our revenue represents a decrease of 16% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 49% which was a 90 basis point improvement from the prior year. I'll discuss margin results in further detail by segment.","Operating margin was 19.5%, down 250 basis points from the prior year. The components of this were gross margin, 9 bps [ph] favorable, offset by an unfavorable operating expense impact of 340 basis points. Total operating expenses decreased by $10 million in the quarter, driven by a $9 million decrease in advertising. Each of the operating expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide.","Pro forma EPS of $0.68 represents a 29% decrease year-over-year, driven by decreasing revenues, declining operating margins and an increase on our effective tax rate, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05.","Units shipped decreased 17% year-over-year, as just over 5 million units were delivered during the quarter.","Looking at full year results, we posted revenue of $2.7 billion for the year, with net income of $542 million. Our pro forma EPS was $2.85 per share, which excludes foreign currency losses. Our revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, while pro forma EPS increased 4%, when excluding FX.","Our gross margin at 53% was a 400 basis -- 450 basis point improvement over the prior year. Operating income increased 9% to $604 million compared to $554 million in 2011. Our operating margin was 22.2%, up 210 basis points from 20.1% last year.","Pro forma EPS of $2.85 was a 4% increase year-over-year on increasing revenues and improved growth [ph] and operating margins.","And our units shipped during 2012 were down 3% year-over-year, as 15.4 million units were delivered.","In total, our revenues decreased 16% during the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year.","During Q4, we experienced a 25% revenue decline within the Auto\/Mobile segment, as volume decline steepened and our product cycle created a difficult comparison.","Our Outdoor segment posted a 2% decline as we compare it against a very strong Q4 2011 when we generated 35% growth.","The Fitness segment returned to growth, with a 10% revenue increase when compared to Q4 2011 on the strength of our running lineup, including the Forerunner 10.","Aviation segment revenues decreased 2% compared to Q4 of 2011 and Marine segment revenues decreased 9%, if you compare it to the fourth quarter 2011, due to ongoing weakness in Europe.","During Q4, all geographic -- geographies declined, though APAC only declined slightly. For the full year, Americas declined 1%, while EMEA declined 4%, and this was partially offset by growth in the APAC region. In 2012, the Americas represented 56% of our revenue; EMEA represented 35%; and Asia, 9%, very consistent with 2011.","The Auto\/Mobile segment represented 57% of our total revenue during the fourth quarter of 2012, down from 64% in Q4 2011. Outdoor and Fitness grew to 16% and 14% of revenues in the quarter, respectively, an increase from 13% and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","On an operating income basis, Fitness and Aviation increased their contribution percentage, while Marine posted a loss in the quarter due to significant R&D investment and low revenues in the seasonably weak fourth quarter. The Auto\/Mobile contribution declined on a significant revenue decline.","On a full year basis, Auto\/Mobile revenue contribution declined from 58% in 2011 to 55% in 2012, with gains in Outdoor, Fitness and Aviation, which contributed 16%, 12% and 11%, respectively. The operating income contribution of the Auto\/Mobile segment increased to 37% in 2012 compared to 29% in 2011 due to the improved margins in the segment related primarily to the recognition of high-margin deferred revenue.","Q4 Auto\/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 38% and 12%, respectively. Gross margins were stable, as a slight ASP decline associated with our product cycle was offset by a lesser year-over-year impact from the deferred revenue. Operating margin declined slightly, as operating expense reductions were not enough to offset the revenue decline.","Q4 Outdoor gross margin was 62%, down from 68% in Q4 of 2011. Operating margin was 39%, a decline from 49% in the year-ago quarter as ASPs declined and the margins contracted due to life cycle pricing on many of our more popular devices.","Q4's Fitness gross margin was 60%, down from 64% in the year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted toward the lower-margin Forerunner 10. I do want to note that for the full year, gross margin was up 260 basis points as full year mix was positive.","In 2013, we will have product introductions across the price spectrum, and we don't anticipate a significant gross margin decline in Fitness. Operating margin was 34%, down from 43% in the year-ago quarter, as gross margins declined and operating expenses increased due to the allocation of SG&A and advertising expense.","Q4 Marine gross margin was 51% compared to 60% in the year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted toward lower-margin products and we offered promotional discounts on end-of-life products. Operating margin was negative 4%, down from 22% a year ago, as the gross margin declined and we increased R&D investment to support our long-term Marine OEM and aftermarket strategy, as Cliff discussed earlier.","Q4 Aviation gross margin was 73%, up from 65% in the fourth quarter of 2011, when we recorded an OEM program contribution that negatively impacted gross margins. Operating margin was 26% for the quarter, up from 18% in the prior year due to the gross margin improvement.","Q4 operating expenses decreased by $10 million or 4% on a year-over-year basis from $234 million to $224 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. R&D decreased $2 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter but increased 150 basis points to 11% of sales, as headcount increased and we continued to invest in OEM opportunities across multiple segments. Our advertising spending decreased $9 million over the year-ago quarter and held consistent as a percentage of sales at 6%. This was largely driven by decreased cooperative advertising. SG&A increased only slightly in absolute dollars compared to the year-ago quarter and decreased by 190 basis points to 12% of sales.","Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of almost $2.9 billion. Our accounts receivable increased sequentially to $604 million, which was relatively stable year-over-year. Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 81 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters. And as of early February, we've now collected $300 million of this year-end balance.","Our inventory balance has decreased to $389 million on a sequential basis at the close of fourth quarter, as we exited the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 117 days, up slightly from 102 in the fourth quarter of 2011.","The dividend payable continued to reflect 2 remaining quarterly payments of $0.45 per share, which was approved by our shareholders on June 1 last year at the annual meeting, as our December 31 payment was not made prior to the close of our fiscal year. Our deferred revenue balance has continued to grow, net of deferred cost, it represents approximately $1.55 of deferred earnings per share.","Looking next at cash. We continued to generate free cash flow across our business, as cash from operations was $175 million during the fourth quarter. CapEx came in at $12 million during the fourth quarter. Therefore, we generated free cash flow during Q4 of $163 million. Cash flow invested during Q4 was $192 million use of cash, including the $12 million in CapEx, $175 million net purchase of marketable securities and $5 million of acquisitions.","Financing activities were $3 million use of cash during the fourth quarter, as the dividend payment fell in the first quarter of 2013, as previously mentioned. And we earned an average of 1.5% on all cash and marketable security balances during Q4.","We expect our strong free cash flow generation year to continue in 2013. And with it, we plan to fund an ongoing quarterly dividend of $0.45, fund a share repurchase program as recently approved by the board of up to $300 million and pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets and tuck-in technologies, which fit with our core markets. As expected, our tax rate for 2012 is just over 13%, but this was an increase from 10.8% in 2011. We currently anticipate that our 2013 tax rate will be 14%, as benefit from the retroactive R&D tax credit is offset by geographic income mix.","And finally, Cliff has reviewed our 2013 guidance, but I'd just further highlight that we have 4 solid growth segments that we anticipate will represent over 50% of our revenue during 2013. As highlighted in our guidance, we'll continue to invest in 2013 for long-term growth opportunities across the entire business, positioning us well for the future.","Well, this concludes our formal remarks. We'll now move to a period of Q&A.","Kerri Thurston","Lisa, would you like to open the queue to our investors and analysts?","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And we'll take our first question from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","And we'll now go to Rich Valera with Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A question on the PND growth outlook. I thought about a month ago, you thought that, that market would be down around 10% to 15% in '13, and now it sounds like we're talking about 15% to 20%. So I'm wondering what's changed, whether it's a more detailed analysis of what you saw in 4Q or something you've seen in the last month that makes you more cautious on the PND outlook for '13?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think we were evaluating business trends. We knew we had come through the fourth quarter with a steeper decline on the PND and that we evaluated global trends across all of our markets. We realized that the decline was in fact steeper than we'd earlier thought. So there really isn't any detailed analysis other than we evaluated the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions and realized that those growth -- those changes in PND shipments were actually not going to get better. So we feel like this is a more accurate outlook on what the overall market is doing. I think we pointed out that this isn't due to any kind of market share declines, just really the fact that we've been gaining share and we anticipate we're going to track more in line with what the overall market is going forward.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Obviously, the seasonality was significantly less than what you've seen historically in the fourth quarter. Do you think this is kind of the new normal that we should think of that you don't see nearly as pronounced a seasonal uptick in 4Q as you historically have particularly in the PND segment?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think that's our expectation now. Of course, we don't have great visibility in the fourth quarter, but we believe that there will be less seasonality. I mean, we'll have some seasonality due to the holiday season, but the numbers won't be as significant as they've been in the last 3 or 4 years.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just wondering what your expectations are for auto OEM in '13. I think you've talked about that being kind of a $160 million, $170 million business. Do you expect growth in that in '13? And can you give any color on maybe how much growth, if you do expect growth?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Rich. We do expect some incremental growth. We don't expect it to be as strong as 2012 because there were quite a few models and programs ramping up, particularly at Chrysler in 2012. But we're forecasting some slight amount of growth and still something that's starting to be a meaningful part of our Auto\/Mobile business.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And for the K2, obviously, pretty significant lead times for revenue for a platform like that into the auto OEM market. But any sense of when you might see -- start seeing revenue for the K2, if you could secure wins, say, in the first half of '13?","Clifton A. Pemble","It's really hard to predict. I think that each automaker in each particular project or program would have its own set of requirements and time lines. Typically in the auto industry, when you start talking about a new system, it can take anywhere from 3 to 5 years to come to fruition.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great, just one final one. On Marine, obviously, you had some sort of nonrecurring pressure there [indiscernible] gross margin [indiscernible] promotions discounts. Should we assume that, that bounces back towards [indiscernible]","Clifton A. Pemble","So I think right now the market is definitely pressured [indiscernible] with quite a few competitors. And our product line, which we're refreshing significantly in 2013 is a little bit late to market. So our existing products have been discounted. We do anticipate that the gross margin will probably be down somewhat from the historically high levels, but we would also expect it to bounce back some.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We now go to Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","I wanted to talk about Fitness. I noticed in the slide you talked about identifying opportunities to offer best-in-class sensors to expand the TAM. I wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on what you're talking about there. And then also just a big picture question on Fitness. Where is the market on runners' watches and then cycling computers? Insofar as your market share, just how are those markets growing relative to one another?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. Charlie, in terms of sensors, Garmin has been in the sensor business for quite a while, offering things outside of what you normally think of us for, the GPS watches. So for example, we offer what we call foot pods, which very accurately track steps and distances traveled without the use of the GPS. And those are typically paired with a lower-end watch or in partnership with another brand or provider in the industry that has some specialized applications. So we've been doing that for quite some time, and we believe our sensors, particularly in the speed and distance area, are superior to others in terms of their accuracy. And your second question, could you please repeat that?","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Yes, sure. I'm just kind of wondering the total industry market for GPS running watches and then cycling computers. Kind of insofar, your market share more than the industry, how are those growing relative to one another in terms of what you're baking into your guidance for '13? And I'm also curious, on that, are you baking into your guidance some of these extensions that you talked about with new sensors to achieve that growth rate?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. So definitely, we're wrapping everything together to give our total view of Fitness. In terms of the running watch market, we're strongest in the GPS-enabled running watch, which is something we pretty much pioneered in terms of an integrated device. And so we believe we have very strong market share in that segment, probably greater than 50%. Although it's -- even though the volumes are somewhat interesting, it's a niche kind of volume compared to like a PND, so there's not a lot of market research that goes into that. On the bike side, it's a very similar situation, where we're specializing the GPS-enabled portion of the market. The volumes compared to all bike computers is on the lower side but, obviously, the price and the performance and the features are on the high side. So it's a growing category. Cyclists are starting to appreciate the benefits of GPS-enabled cycling. And when we do come out with our Vector power meter later in the year, we'll have a total solution for people high-end head unit with power meter, which is what cyclists really want.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just real quickly on Aviation, up 10% to 15%. Without Part 25, will we be looking at sort of a flat market? I'm just curious, is all the growth coming from that? Or are you getting any growth from sort of your legacy market there?","Clifton A. Pemble","We're factoring most of that as growth in the Part 25, the new certifications. There are some of the new products that we've announced that will contribute to both retrofit and OEM, but generally the growth is driven by Part 25.","Operator","We will now go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask you first, and I apologize if I missed it on the call. But what were your underlying assumptions for units and ASPs within the auto PND guidance for this year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","So we didn't address much on the ASP, but we're expecting fairly nominal changes on pricing, but we're looking at overall unit declines globally of around 20% on the PND market, and that's pretty consistent between the Americas and EMEA, which are the 2 largest markets, those both being down at least that level. So those are our assumptions baked in the Auto\/Mobile guidance.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the 20% global decline for the market, is that what you're expecting for your own units as well?","Kevin S. Rauckman","We're looking at both industry and Garmin expectations to be pretty consistent, so yes.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like you're embedding a slight increase perhaps on the ASP side?","Kevin S. Rauckman","No, I think ASPs are -- the difference in -- we're looking -- like first of all, a PND within our Auto\/Mobile, of course, that includes mobile, auto OEM and PND. So we're not anticipating any price increases right now.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then you haven't really announced any new infotainment wins for the 2014 models. Is that window now closed? Or would we still potentially expect to see something new there following to your Suzuki win from last year?","Clifton A. Pemble","The window is not closed, and we are working on some additional opportunities, but don't have any details we can share right now.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as I understand, the investment in the auto OEM opportunity is a pretty significant to the point where you have nominal, if not negative, operating margins in that segment. When should we expect margins there to turn positive? And also, at what revenue level can we expect them to kind of hit your longer-term target of about 10% or so?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think it does require significant investment, and we're not at the point where we're achieving the scale there to really turn the needle towards more the number that you mentioned. Although I'd point out that 10% in the auto OEM business is really considered a pretty healthy kind of operating margin. But we would expect in a few years' time, as our revenues grow, that we should be able to turn the corner.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just last quick one. If you can just expand on the Vector product. What does your Fitness guidance assume for that? And how should we think about the revenue and margin opportunity there?","Clifton A. Pemble","We don't break it out by product segment. As I mentioned, we would expect the product to be to market in midyear. That's a little bit late for the season, but we still think that we'll be able to catch some sales in the back half of the year. We're only anticipating some modest impact to Fitness because of that. The margin profile is good on that product, particularly the margin dollars. But again, it's coming a little late, so we're not overfactoring that right now.","Operator","We will now go to Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to understand a little bit in terms of your guidance what your assumptions are around the worldwide macro environment. And does your guidance take into account the share buyback that you announced today?","Kevin S. Rauckman","We assume that we would be buying some back but we didn't put all of the $300 million in the full year. The board actually approved that the $300 million buyback could extend past 2013, so we did assume that we would be buying back, but we didn't -- again, not all $100 million -- or $300 million of that would be bought in 1 year.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And in terms of your guidance for the worldwide macro environment, I just want to understand sort of your viewpoint, are you assuming that Europe kind of stays the same? Or does that have much of a bearing on your thought process there?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think we definitely factored those things in. Europe's situation is really pretty challenging, and we don't foresee that, that gets materially better. We're also not predicting it gets much worse either, but we feel like we probably hit kind of a bottom there. The North American market is stable to gradually improving, and we think a lot of our performance there and in Europe as well really depends on the introduction of our new products, which always generate new interest and new sales.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it, got it. And just in terms of your Auto\/Mobile viewpoint, in terms of where the market potentially could stabilize, has that changed at all at this point? Or how should we think about where you think maybe the end market ends up longer term?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, it's difficult to say. We did go through a pretty rapid change in Q4, where we saw the trends come down more significantly than we have in the past. So predicting an endpoint is a little bit challenging. I would say that we are being more conservative in terms of where that might be in our overall planning, but it is difficult to say exactly where it lands.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And in terms of the Marine business, can you talk a little bit about maybe your expectations around seasonality this year, just given sort of the new product releases, whether we would expect maybe the growth to pick up a little bit earlier in the year or perhaps later?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. I think our products, as I mentioned, are a little bit late for the season. We really should have them in the market right now in order to take full advantage of the seasonality. That said, we have good pricing on our existing products and we would expect some improvement in those sales. But probably the impact from the new products won't be seen until the middle half to the end of the year.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just one final question in terms of operating expenses. If you were to see perhaps more acceleration in terms of declines around the Auto\/Mobile business, how would we -- how should we think about sort of your philosophy around operating expenses and whether you would potentially cut those to hold the margins? Or how should we just think about that generally speaking?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think in general, we're watching the situation closely. We also recognize that it's been only just a short amount of time since we recognized this change, so we want to make sure that anything we do is in line with where the market is going to head long term. That said, there's still some needs across the organization. We feel like we have a very agile workforce that we can redeploy into certain other areas. And so we're taking steps right now to try to maximize our efficiency and make sure that we take advantage of all the opportunities we see.","Kevin S. Rauckman","One other point on that, Jonathan, from an operating expense, really, the only the area that we're seeing any growth in, in 2013 is in the R&D side, so we're managing advertising well. And also, from an SG&A perspective, we're expecting that to decline year-over-year, too.","Operator","And we'll go now to Paul Coster with JPMorgan.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to go back to the PND for a second, if you don't mind. When you talk -- at least your market research, does it tell you that it's going to stabilize? Or does it tell you that it might go to 0?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we don't believe, and we never have believed, that it goes to 0. I think the real question, Paul, is what is the level it stabilizes that. And I think market experts, as well as any number of PND providers can probably debate that point for a long time, but we feel like there's still utility and there's still a market for certain kinds of devices long into the future, and the question is how much.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Kevin, did you give any guidance for free cash flow or cash flow from operations for the full year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","We didn't specifically. We do expect strong free cash flow. At this point, we're looking probably at the level of around $525 million, given the operating income numbers that we put into our guidance. So we don't see a lot of movement on working capital. And of course depreciation, amortization stayed about the same. So overall, about $525 million for the year.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then my last question is, is there any intellectual property here that can help you defend your very strong leadership position in the Fitness space, which is obviously becoming more competitive?","Clifton A. Pemble","We've always focused on protecting our best ideas and the most general ideas that are enabling to the industry. So we're constantly filing patents and we're constantly thinking ahead in terms of where the market might go. So we feel like we're in a reasonably strong position. I think intellectual property is always a very tricky area, and there's all kinds of situations that are out there in terms of patent law and patent practice. But in general, we feel good about where we stand.","Operator","And we'll now go to John Bright with Avondale Partners.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys discuss specific aviation or auto [ph] OEM opportunities in '13? And also, where do you -- at what level do you start from in Aviation and Auto\/Mobile and OEM?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think to answer your first question, we've been pretty open about the 5 unique certifications in the Part 25, beginning with the Learjet 70 75 and then ending the year with 3 different Cessna certifications, which are the Sovereign, the Citation X and the M2. So we're going to be more back-end loaded because of the timing of the certification. But as Cliff said earlier, that's what's driving all of the revenue growth for the full year.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","But for new opportunities?","Kevin S. Rauckman","New opportunities, we also have some additional wins that are not coming until future years, 2014, 2015. But we do feel like we have a good path forward and new incremental opportunities for several years out.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Next question is a follow-up on a past one. You were asked about free cash flow for calendar '13. A lot of people have asked about deferred revenues, and is that a meaningful portion of the free cash flow, for instance, for '12? Can you address that?","Kevin S. Rauckman","It has been a meaningful impact because of the difference between what we record on the P&L and then the actual cash benefit. For 2013, we're expecting for the first time that we'll actually get a positive treatment on that. So that from now on, we believe that the deferred revenue numbers actually is going to be favorable on the P&L. In the past year, for example, in 2012, I think we had about a $67 million deferred revenue benefit due to cash.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Two final ones for you. Kevin, on the -- in the M&A discussion, you mentioned adjacent niche markets you might expand into. Give us a thought process, or Cliff, give us a thought process of what you're thinking about there?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, again, if you look at our history, the types of opportunities that we've been able to secure, are ones that are very -- mostly related to the businesses that we're in, and either extend our products, technology or resources in those areas. So for example, Tri-Tronics gave us additional presence in the outdoor market, particularly in the dog training area that complements our dog tracking type of products. And then in Marine, we, this year, acquired Nexus, which gives us an additional presence in the sailing side of the instrumentation markets, where we weren't  -- have been historically not very strong.","Operator","And we'll now go to Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","I wanted to first ask -- I didn't hear, can you give the split between the automotive OEM business and the PND business for '12?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. It's because we didn't really break it out. We kind of had said historically, it's around a 10% level of our total Auto\/Mobile segment, but we haven't given absolute numbers.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And Kevin, you talked a little bit about the Fitness business, '13. You said gross margins, roughly flat. Any thoughts on how gross margin trends in the other business segments throughout '13?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think we're expecting fairly stable margins -- gross margins in the Outdoor area. As I said, Fitness is very close. Aviation, we think that's a stable number, too, around 70%. And then the auto PND, we don't expect much deterioration there. So because pricing isn't moving and our bill of material, our costs are fairly stable as well. We believe that all of those are sustainable. Marine is the one, that Cliff mentioned earlier, it's going to be better than what we reported in Q4 but probably a little bit down year-over-year.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And my last question, looking at the current deferred revenue, it's up about $60 million year-on-year in 4Q. Is there anything happening, which would imply the incremental margin on that revenue is declining? Are your assumptions changing on how much you're deferring per unit? Or anything else that's driving a decline in the incremental margin of that revenue?","Kevin S. Rauckman","No, there's no change in either -- any of those assumptions, no.","Operator","And we'll go next to James Faucette with Pacific Crest.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions for me. First, you mentioned that you have and you expect growth in in-dash in 2013. Right now, do you have enough visibility to say that in-dash can continue to grow into 2014? Or would that necessitate incremental design wins for the 2014 period?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think we're really not prepared to be able to break it out and particularly talk about 2014. I think a lot can happen between now and then, particularly the OEM carmakers tend to make some rapid decisions around extending models or are changing equipment on models. And so as a result, it's kind of difficult to predict.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then Kevin, questions for you is in the past you've talked about, particularly with Aviation and Marine, returning to meaningful growth, that there is room for operating margin expansion in those segments. Can you talk about how we should think about kind of at least target operating margin levels for those company -- or for those segments, excuse me, and kind of what kinds of revenue levels we might have to get to, to see those levels?","Kevin S. Rauckman","So I think, first of all, on the Aviation, as you know, we've been putting some significant investments on the certifications on Part 25, and those are going to continue. I think the fact that gross margins are moving, it's just a matter of growing the top line, and so we're seeing 10% to 15% for the upcoming year, which don't -- doesn't really move us back to the historical levels. But with continued new business that we'll see going down the road the next few years, we believe that the operating margins will move back to above the current levels that we've been reporting. Marine, on the other hand, Marine is -- we feel like it's not to the point where we can say it's going to move back up into the -- even in the 20s or 30s, but we have some really some work to do there to be more efficient in that business and to get the biggest bang for our R&D investment there. So I think that may be -- Marine may be a little bit more difficult to return to those levels.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, I guess just a general execution question is that as we look at the initial outlook at least for 2013, you indicated that you've got a couple of products in Marine that you're -- you've been a little bit late on. You also indicated the Vector power meter in particular is going to be later maybe than you had anticipated and certainly later than you thought when you first talked about that product. Is there something that's happened, I guess, organizationally and from an execution perspective that is leading us to kind of see this string of later products? Or are you kind of thinking about those as being one-offs right now? And I guess I'm just wondering how we could see some improvement there, in getting new products to market in time frames you target?","Clifton A. Pemble","James, I think that's a really good question. I think in general, we would always like to do better in bringing our products to market faster. Sometimes, it's a little bit challenging, depending on when those products are initiated, whether or not they can meet the time line, particularly of a seasonality sensitive market like Marine, and that's kind of the situation that we find ourselves in, in that market in particular. Vector is -- every product has its own story. But Vector is a very complicated and precise instrument, and we felt like we needed to take more time to make sure we could meet the expectations of customers who are going to be very, very demanding in that particular market space. So those are the 2 examples that you referenced. But in general, I would say we're working to do better to meet some of those time lines, and I think many of our segments show that they're doing very well in that regard and being able to meet the time lines of the market.","Operator","And at that time -- at this time, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Rauckman, I'll turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, as always, we appreciate everyone's interest. Happy to move forward and really meet or exceed our expectations as we go through. And we, again, look forward to updating each of you, as we do that throughout the year. So thanks, again, and we'll talk later.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation."],"10294":["Garmin Ltd.

","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks, Teri and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, Garmin reported another strong quarter of revenue growth up 15% to $934 million. Aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine collectively increased 24% and contributed 85% of total revenues.","Gross margin improved to 60.7%. Revenue growth and expanding margins resulted in significant operating leverage in the business. Operating income increased 33% year-over-year to $261 million and operating margin expanded to 28%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.19 and pro forma EPS of $1.27 in the quarter.","We are pleased with our performance in the first three quarters of 2019 and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance, which I'll explain in a moment. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.","Starting with the Aviation segment. Revenue increased 28% driven by growth in both OEM and aftermarket systems. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 35%, respectively resulting in operating income growth of 30% over the prior year.","Growth in OEM systems was driven primarily by the recent certification of a Citation Longitude featuring our G5000 integrated flight deck. However, the strength was broad-based as other aircraft platforms also contributed to the growth.","Growth in aftermarket systems was driven by strong ADS-B sales and the recently certified G5000 integrated flight deck with the Citation XL and XLS. During the quarter the G1000H NXi was certified in the Bell 407GXi helicopter representing the first IFR certification for this advanced helicopter flight deck.","I'd like to highlight this morning's Autoland announcement. This new safety technology is designed to return an aircraft and its passengers safely to the ground in the event a pilot is unable to do so. We believe Autoland is a disruptive new technology that will change the way people think about safety in general aviation aircraft. Autoland will soon be available as part of the G3000 integrated flight deck on the Cirrus Vision Jet and the Piper M600 pending final FAA certification.","Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 28% primarily driven by growth in wearables and contributions from Tacx. Gross and operating margins were 52% and 20%, respectively resulting in operating income growth of 33% over the prior year.","At IFA, which is Europe's leading consumer electronics trade show we now a sweeping update to our line of consumer wearable products including new versions of the v\u00edvoactive series in two sizes, the v\u00cdvomove 3 hybrid smartwatch series and the all-new Venu smartwatch featuring a brilliant AMOLED color touchscreen display, comprehensive health and fitness features and long battery life. We also announced the Tacx NEO 2T smart trainer featuring enhanced drive design and performance analytics to simulate an outdoor ride as realistically and quietly as possible.","Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 23% on a year-over-year basis with growth in multiple product categories led by adventure smartwatches. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 66% and 41% respectively resulting in strong operating income growth for the segment. At the recent UTMB trail running event, we launched the fenix six adventure smartwatch series with larger displays and innovative performance features.","We also introduced the fenix 6X Pro Solar, the first of its kind with our exclusive solar harvesting technology. We have often mentioned that inReach technology has been a growth driver for the outdoor segment and that was definitely the case in this most recent quarter.","I'm pleased to report that inReach recently passed a significant milestone facilitating over 4,000 SOS incidents, since its launch in 2011 demonstrating the crucial importance of satellite-based 2-way messaging wherever our customers need assistance. We believe inReach has room to grow in the future as more people recognize its potential to change outcomes and save lives.","Turning next to the marine segment. Revenue increased 9% as we saw solid sales across multiple product categories led by chartplotters. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 60% and 19% respectively resulting in strong operating income growth for the segment.","During the quarter, we were named Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association for the fifth consecutive year reflecting the strength of our innovative products and our leading market position. We were also named the exclusive marine electronics provider by both Regulator Marine and Sea Hunt solidifying our leadership in the premier center console boats market.","Looking finally at the auto segment, revenue decreased 17% primarily driven by declines in our OEM business and the ongoing PND market contraction. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 48% and 15% respectively resulting in operating income growth of 39%. During the quarter, we began shipping the Overlander all-in-one navigation device, which is the new product category designed for the growing community of overland adventure enthusiasts.","So in summary, we're very pleased with the results in the first three quarters of 2019. Given this strong performance, we're raising our projected full year revenue to approximately $3.65 billion. We're maintaining our full year gross margin at approximately 59.5% and raising our full year operating margin to approximately 24.3%. We're also updating our full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $4.15.","So looking quickly at guidance by segment, we've increased growth expectations for aviation to 20%, fitness to 16% and the outdoor segment to 11%. Guidance for the auto and the marine segments are unchanged.","That concludes my remarks. Next Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?","Doug Boessen","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results some comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted third quarter revenue of $934 million, representing 15% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.7%, 130 basis point increase from the prior year.","Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 32.7%, a 240 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $261 million, a 33% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 28%, a 380 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.19 and our pro forma EPS was $1.27, a 27% increase from the prior year.","Next, we'll look at third quarter revenue by segment. We achieved record third quarter revenue of $934 million. Consolidated revenue grew 15%, led by solid double-digit growth in our aviation, fitness and outdoor segments. Also, marine segment had solid growth of 9% during the quarter. On a combined basis, aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine were up 24% compared to the prior year quarter.","Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine segments contributed 85% of total revenue in third quarter 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. Aviation grew from 18% to 20%, fitness grew from 24% to 26% and outdoor grew from 26% to 28%.","You can see from the chart to illustrate our profit mix by segment. Combined basis, the aviation, fitness, outdoor and marine segments delivered 92% operating income in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018. All five segments had strong year-over-year increases and operating income dollars improved operating margins.","Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million or 7%. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 32.7% in the third quarter of 2019, 240 basis decrease in the comparable quarter last year. Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year due to investments and engineering resources.","Our advertising expense was up $2 million from the prior year quarter, due to higher outdoor and fitness expenses, partially offset by lower expenses in the auto segment. SG&A was up $10 million from the prior year quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales.","Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion.","Accounts receivable decreased sequentially due to seasonal trends and increased year-over-year to $558 million due to strong third quarter sales. Inventory balance increased sequentially to $750 million prepared for the seasonally strong fourth quarter.","The year-over-year increase is due to timing of new products, acquisition of tax and efforts increase date of supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines. During the third quarter 2019, we generated free cash flow of $158 million.","During third quarter of 2019, we report an effective tax rate of 11.6% compared to effective tax rate of 8.5% in the prior year quarter. Increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower income tax reserve releases in the third quarter of 2019. Also, we've updated our guidance for the full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%.","This concludes our formal remarks. Olivia, can you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company. Your line is open.","Charlie Anderson","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions and my congrats on a really strong quarter and outlook. Cliff, I want to start with aviation. You mentioned some of the strength in OEM. I wonder if maybe you could just sort of speak to the pipeline of opportunity there, sort of the order book as we think about ADS-B will cycle down at some point and the ability of OEM to potentially offset some of that cycling down? And then, I've got a follow up.","Cliff Pemble","Okay. Good morning, Charlie. Yes. In terms of OEM, as reported last quarter in the GAMA results, General Aviation Manufacturers Association, there's been strength across the categories of business jets that were on, as well as strength in the piston aircraft, particularly addressing the training market. So that's driving continued momentum into Q3 and beyond.","We see those opportunities as ongoing, because particularly in the training market the need for pilots is very acute and the demand for aircraft trainers is high. In terms of ADS-B and its impact, it's definitely a growth driver for us. But even absent that particular category, we saw strong growth in the business. We're gaining confidence that going forward the cockpit modernization efforts that we're seeing across the fleet and demand for new aircraft should lead to positive results for the segment.","Charlie Anderson","Great. And then, for my follow up, I think, wearables business is doing very well for you right now. I wonder if maybe you could speak to what you're seeing in terms of unit growth versus ASP increases as you moved up market here and the trajectory of continued ASP increases in the future from your standpoint? Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. We're definitely seeing unit growth in the business. So the market is expanding and we're taking share as people recognize the value of our solutions and the capability of our products. We do see some ASP benefits as well as we introduce higher end products like the fenix six line with unique features as well as MARQ, so there's a positive impact there as well.","Charlie Anderson","Great. Thanks so much.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is coming from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Spingarn","Hi. Good morning.","Cliff Pemble","Good morning.","Robert Spingarn","Really just strong numbers across-the-board and particularly on the operating margin. I wanted to ask you Doug, you talked about the various categories in your slide number 16. And while these are maybe moving around on an absolute basis, they seem to be fairly low historically on a percentage of sales basis. And I was wondering if you could talk to the trends there? R&D is a bit lower than it's been. It sounds like maybe we back end that a little bit and then the other two categories as well. How sustainable is this level of overhead?","Doug Boessen","Yes. Sure. It's great. So I'll give you a little bit of perspective on our operating structure and you said between our advertising SG&A and R&D. So thinking about it on a full year basis as a percentage of sales, what we're thinking about as it relates to advertising, we anticipate advertising as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat year-over-year.","So with that, we will be spending more advertising dollars this Q4 than we did last Q4. And that's primarily a function of just having new product launches. So we will be very targeted in our advertising depending upon what those product launches are.","As it relates to SG&A, thinking about SG&A full year percentage of sales anticipate that to be relatively flat year-over-year also. What we have in there is a piece of that is due to acquisitions. The other piece of it is just general a merit other type of inflational type of increases we have in SG&A.","Thinking about R&D, as a full year percentage of sales, we would -- right now we look at that probably about 50 basis points lower than this year than last year. From a dollar standpoint, there will be an increase. The situation there is that we are capitalizing some of our R&D expenses. There are certain auto OEM contracts that include contractual guarantees for reimbursements of R&D expenses.","So in those cases R&D expense are capitalized they're put on the balance sheet until that cash is received from our OEM receipt. And I should say the expense structure that -- depending upon what kind of different product launches we have, and kind of advertising some of that will fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. But right now, we're getting some nice leverage due to our sales also.","Robert Spingarn","I was going to ask you if you look at the non-auto R&D, are you at a point here where that decreases over time as a percentage of sales? Like you just said on scale you're at some kind of a critical mass where it doesn't have to track at this point with the growth in sales.","Doug Boessen","I really think it's a function of that top line sales we have. So here's what I would say. We'll continue to invest in R&D, as we continue to have new products over a period of time, and some of those we will invest before the products come in that situation, but we'll continue to invest appropriately to support our diversified line of products over a period of time as we go through.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then just quickly Cliff for you. I wanted to ask about M&A. And I often focused on capital deployment. There's a couple of things out there. I just wondered if you could comment on them. The possibility out in the last 24 hours that Google could be looking at Fitbit, and how that might change the dynamics in the industry? And then also at the same time I think United Technologies has talked about, or maybe in some kind of a situation where it may have to sell GPS navigation business as part of its upcoming transaction with Raytheon. Can you comment on your interest in those types of properties?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So we've seen the speculation obviously around Fitbit and Google. It's really hard to say what we can think about that without any kind of formal announcement and whether or not it's even a real thing.","We believe that Fitbit's customer base is very different from ours and our product focus is also different. So it's not something that we believe impacts us and we're not worried about it.","In terms of other opportunities, we look at every opportunity basically in terms of what it can bring to Garmin both in terms of technology or product lines. So we would evaluate any of those opportunities based on that and what we can achieve with it going forward.","Robert Spingarn","Would military be of interest since it really hasn't been a big historical focus for you?","Cliff Pemble","I think generally the military and defense is an area of interest and potential growth for us. We've been focused on adapting our off the shelf products into those opportunities rather than doing full custom bid development, kind of, work. So those are the opportunities we're mostly focused on.","Robert Spingarn","Right. Thank you both.","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. Thank you, Robert.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Ben Bollin","Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you taking my question. Could we start -- within fitness and outdoor, could you walk us through a little bit where you think you are in the rollout of new products? It still looks like there's some expanded lead times. Where do you think you are in channel inventory, supply, overall tightness as far as raw materials? And then I have a follow-up.","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. So in terms of product introductions, we're mostly set for the remainder of the year. So we have a very strong lineup going into Q4. With any new product announcement, ramping up is always a challenge for any company. So we're in the process of doing that and that's part of the inventory situation with us as well as we build inventory to build these products and deliver them during the fourth quarter.","Ben Bollin","Second one. Looking at inventory, you continue to expand the SKU count. Is there a way to think about what is normal for inventory into the future? And then within the new product launches themselves, are there any particular pieces parts that you have not been able to source, or you're having any yield issues, anything of significance that would extend availability into next year?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. So definitely we are taking a different approach to some of these markets by offering unique kinds of products, especially appealing to people who want to differentiate themselves rather than wearing the same kind of product. So that does lead to higher SKUs. It does lead to higher levels of inventory and that's something that we use as a tool in the business.","We've seen some normalization of these amounts because we're focused on safety stock in the inventory and reducing risk, making sure that we can deliver the products that we want to deliver to the market especially during the selling season.","So in terms of yields and things like that, I mean -- again like I mentioned as new products ramp there are initial challenges, but our factory is working very hard and the product is flowing to the market.","Ben Bollin","And the last question I have is as it relates to automotive, any update on the timing of the BMW China opportunity or the broader BMW Tier 1 status? And when does the company begin to make some of the investments either in new facilities or greater headcount as you support that big or long-term opportunity as a Tier 1 vendor? Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. So the China opportunity will be ramping up starting in later 2020 and into the 2021 model year. So that's what we've been preparing for in the first phase of this opportunity with BMW.","In terms of making additional investments for our business that comes after that opportunity we're in that process right now. We've been hiring additional people in the automotive segment to support that business and we're in the process of selecting new sites that will produce the product especially in the European markets.","Ben Bollin","Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Paul Chung with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Paul Chung","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So first off, just on aviation margins, you're seeing a nice step-up in operating margins kind of over the course of the last three years some scale benefits on ADS-B and your core business I assume. So your gross margins have been pretty steady, but if you could kind of expand on what's behind that step-up there? And do you expect that mid-30% range to stand as we look beyond fiscal year 2019? And then can you also kind of help us size the ADS-B opportunity in Europe and the runway there and your kind of expectations for overall demand next year after the deadline in the U.S.? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So in terms of the operating margin in aviation, we're experiencing some solid leverage in the business as the revenues have outpaced our need to grow expenses. I would say that, we would still like to hire more people, engineering people in aviation in order to be able to support ongoing opportunities that are going on there, but we're managing and it is giving us some leverage in the business.","In terms of the expectations for the profit, I mean, at these kinds of investment levels and these kinds of revenues obviously we should be able to be pretty predictable in terms of our operating profit. But as the business changes we'll of course adjust and evaluate. For ADS-B, we're expecting that the opportunity will of course begin to flatten. That's inevitable as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, but we do see spillover business into next year particularly the first half as shop capacity still remains limited so there's mostly linear output from shops right now, and there's still more aircraft that need to be equipped.","There are new opportunities as you pointed out, so Europe is one of those and also Canada is evaluating their compliance as well. Both of these I would say are interesting to us. But obviously the majority of the aircraft and the opportunities have been in the U.S. based ADS-B but they'll be nice enhancers for the coming years.","Paul Chung","Okay. Thanks. And then on \u2013 second question on free cash flow. Looks like you got a bit larger-than-normal inventory drag this quarter and kind of less accounts receivable uplift than usual. You already mentioned, it's a combination of new products and tax probably ahead of seasonally strong 4Q. But just wanted to get your thoughts on free cash flow to kind of end the year should we expect slightly more outsized 4Q than usual? And do you have any estimate on where you think inventory balances will be in 4Q or is it too early days? Thank you.","Doug Boessen","Sure. As it relates to free cash flow for the full year, we would estimate our full year free cash flow to be around $575 million. That includes CapEx estimate for the full year of about $125 million. And regarding inventory, yeah, inventory is up year-over-year Q3, would expect that to be up at year-end compared to year-end last year also. We expect to probably be up around 25% year-over-year due to some of the things that Cliff mentioned just making sure that we do have ample days of supply to support diversified product lines we do have.","Paul Chung","So in that $525 million is that more of a timing of kind of working cap and you expect maybe slightly more normalization in the first half of 2020 or how should we think about that? Thank you.","Doug Boessen","Yeah. So \u2013 sorry, $575 million. So its $575 million we anticipate for the full year. So with that as it relates to working capital those are \u2013 as it relation to 2020 we'll kind of look at that and get planning cycle for that. But as inventory, we mentioned we do anticipate, there to be some level of inventory that's going to be higher on a year-over-year basis just due to having more inventory to support our ongoing business.","Paul Chung","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question coming from the line of Nick Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Nik Todorov","Good morning, guys. Congrats on great results. Really impressive. I have a couple of questions. So the implied 4Q EPS guidance looks soft which is not atypical for you guys. So is that a function of typical conservatism or is there a shift in operating expense dollars from 3Q to 4Q? I think that you talked about maybe increasing \u2013 having relatively higher advertising expenses or there's something else that drives that what looks on the front and the headline relative soft 4Q EPS.","Doug Boessen","Yes. As we mentioned, yes, the advertising we would expect those to be higher in the Q4 period of time just to new product launches and such that we'd have there.","Nick Todorov","Okay. And if we can shift gears to fitness, can you provide us some color on the gross margin there, which I was a little bit surprised given the revenue ramp up and the strength there. I understand tax is dilutive here, but is there anything else besides that affecting margins? And can you give us some color on the sell-through of the new products. And specifically, Forerunners, I noticed that they were not highlighted in your remarks and presentation. And I know those were a core part of your portfolio and relatively new here in 2019. And \u2013 yes, that's the question there on fitness.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So we're preparing to be very promotional in fitness in Q4, particularly in the advanced wellness products that are more of the consumer variety that are sold through the mass market outlet, so we're prepared for that. And in terms of specifics on product lines, definitely our new products have done very well.","There's a lot of interest and excitement around those. The Forerunners have been doing very well and the sell-through is meeting our expectations, so we have no concerns there.","Nick Todorov","Okay. And lastly, Doug just a follow up and clarification on the free cash flow. So it seems like you brought down the CapEx plan from $150 million to $125 million. Yet free cash flow it seems is also going down. Is the delta coming up just from higher working capital headwind?","Doug Boessen","Yes. Correct. Our working capital is what that headwind is that's causing the overall free cash flow to come down just increased inventory, as well as you will see the receivables up year-over-year. That's just a function of having higher sales but it's really a function of working capital, primarily in the inventory we talked about.","Nick Todorov","Okay. Got it. Thanks guys. Good luck.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial Partners. Your line is open.","Ivan Feinseth","Thank you for taking my call and a big congratulations on another great quarter.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks, Ivan.","Ivan Feinseth","And congratulations on the launch of this new Autoland. Can you give us some idea of what the incremental cost is added to a plane?","Cliff Pemble","I think it's something that gets sold through the OEM provider. So in many cases on these more advanced aircraft that we're targeting they contain the systems that are needed to be able to do the function, particularly like auto throttle, although there are some additional control elements that are needed. But in general, that's something that will be sold through and priced on their end.","Ivan Feinseth","And is this only available as a build into a brand-new plane, or can existing planes or will eventually existing planes be able to get this upgrade?","Cliff Pemble","There is a significant amount of complexity that goes along with the system. And so building it into the aircraft at design and production of new aircraft is the best way to do that. It's technically possible to bring it into other aircraft but I think that's something we have to evaluate on a case-by-case basis.","Ivan Feinseth","And so it's available in two planes right now, right, the Piper and the Cirrus? Did you work with both or either of those two companies in the development of this?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So the Cirrus SF50 and the Piper M600 are the first two platforms. We have been working with both manufacturers to implement and certify the system. And they are in the final process of the aircraft level certification for the function and should be a feature then that they would offer in their 2020 model years.","Ivan Feinseth","And you're going to be this will be available do you have any kind of exclusive deal with these two -- you're going to be able to work with other manufacturers integrate this as well, right?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. It's definitely something that can be offered as part of our G3000 systems. And even beyond we can do the G5000 as well. But it's something that's part of our core technology offerings for Garmin.","Ivan Feinseth","All right. Congratulations again. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks, Ivan.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Erik Woodring","Hey good morning guys. Congrats on quarter here. So I just want to get back to the aviation segment for a second. I know that in the past, we've talked about kind of this 100,000 to 150,000 aircraft runway for ADS-B upgrades. As \u2013 through the beginning of October we're kind of past that 100,000 threshold. So at the low end of this -- of the range you would imply, we're kind of through ADS-B at the high end. It implies, we could have up to five more quarters of kind of strong ADS-B growth.","And obviously the implications for the model are huge because there's other retrofit work that can be done. So I'm just curious from your perspective how we should be thinking about the ADS-B runway going forward, as we kind of head into 2020 thinking obviously about the January deadline?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. I think, it's probably somewhere in between the two scenarios you outlined. Definitely as you pointed out, we have reached the low bar if you will on the number of aircraft that we'd equip. There's probably still an additional 25% of the fleet that remains in question in terms of what kind of equipment they would select or if they even equip or if aircrafts are retired which is also a scenario that's playing out for some kinds of aircraft. But we do think that the reality lies somewhere in between and we're planning on continued activity into the first half of 2020.","Erik Woodring","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then if we just shift to kind of outdoor and fitness. Obviously, huge product launches this quarter. Just curious if you could give any color on kind of what percentage of growth was a result of the new product launches available for the last month of the quarter versus legacy products that were available for call it the entirety of the quarter?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. Outdoor was probably the one that was most impacted by product announcements within the quarter with the Fenix 6, so it did have a very positive impact on the outdoor segment. In general in fitness our new products that we introduced the running products in Q2 as well as the new activity trackers in Q3 also had a positive impact on the quarter.","Erik Woodring","And is there any way that you could detail or just break out kind of one if tax is performing in line with expectations? And then two, kind of what percent of fitness tax is it still kind of contributing half of the growth this year that you expected more less? Just any color there would be great? Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So tax is meeting our expectations so they're right in line with what we expected. The growth of the other categories was better than we expected. So it meant that for the quarter the majority of our growth was actually organic within the segment but still tax met its expectations.","Erik Woodring","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is coming from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Spingarn","Hi, just want to come back on ADS-B a little bit. And I hear what you're saying Cliff about the eventual fate that we're all trying to time. But one thing that, we learned from United Technologies earlier this earnings season was they are probably running at about 4 times to 5 times their maintenance level of sales on ADS-B.","They are somewhere between $250 million and $300 million. And I think they said the normal numbers around $60 million to $70 million. I just wanted to see if you're seeing the same kind of magnitude? I understand that you're targeting to some extent smaller aircraft or much higher volumes of smaller aircraft. But is there any context you can give us regarding this? Because obviously we're all very focused on what the fate looks like in terms of quantifiable numbers?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So definitely there is difference as you pointed out in the business models between the two companies and -- so I think some of the multiplier that you mentioned could be due to that. I would say that for us again, if we subtracted the impact of the ADS-B we still had very strong growth in our aftermarket business.","And I attribute that to the fact that we have got great products and some of them don't even have anything to do with ADS-B such as our autopilot systems for example and also our aftermarket cockpits for things like the Excel and the XLS.","So the dynamic is a little bit different. There definitely is an argument to be made that as people are motivated to upgrade to ADS-B they're also upgrading the other equipment. And we said that before, it's difficult to quantify how much of that is interrelated. And there is quite a bit of cockpit equipment that needs modernization. Many cockpits are decades old and the equipment now that is offered in the market is compelling and allows people to upgrade their aircrafts into newer safer, more reliable equipment. So we see that dynamic continuing even when ADS-B peaks and fades.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then just sticking with aviation while I'm still here, why do you get an idea how we should think about the OE side. You talked about it earlier. In earlier question you talked about the ramp, you've got the longitude here. And I think you made some positive comments about the OE side. From where we sit we see a very flattish overall OE market that is driven in some part probably for Garmin on new introductions.","But overall, unit volumes are fairly flat. And I would say there's not a lot of increase in demand. But in the context of that, I wanted to get a sense of how small that business is relative for you to the overall aviation business, given how strong your aftermarket and retrofit components are? In other words, should we worry too much about the OE side if it is indeed flat?","Cliff Pemble","Well, I feel like our OEM business is actually targeting the sweet spot of where aviation is right now. The -- as I mentioned in other questions, the trainer market is something that will see continued demand for several years to come as the pilot shortage is reckoned with in the industry, and as there's significant demand for trainer aircraft to train these pilots.","And then, the class of aircraft that we're on is kind of the midsized business jet on down. And so, again that's where this is kind of a sweet spot right now, particularly in this economy as these tend to be -- tend to tilt more towards owner flown or the fractional areas which has been a very strong area for us.","So, we see continued opportunity in the OE side. You asked the question about how significant, is it relative to the overall segment. And as we remarked in the past, the segment is roughly split evenly between retrofit and OEM. So, OEM is definitely a strong influencer in our business, and we see opportunities going forward that will continue.","Robert Spingarn","Is there a reasonable way to split OEM into its varied components, whether it's piston versus jet along those lines or trying your aircraft versus trainers?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah. I think if you look at the public information that's available for the industry through GAMA, they detail that out pretty well, but we have a strong market share across all of those platforms.","Robert Spingarn","So, you would track those numbers?","Cliff Pemble","We do track those numbers, yes.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thanks so much.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question is coming from the line of Nick Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Nick Todorov","Just a few follow-ups. One on auto line, it sounds like it's a product that -- it has a little bit more heavy on the software side. Is that correct, A?","And if it's correct how should we think about the margin contribution to the overall aviation segment? I'm assuming that should be accretive, but are you willing to provide any color on that? Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","I think in terms of margin percentage, we don't see any impact from that. We see this as an opportunity to provide additional content onto the aircraft platform which in turn leads to profit dollars. So, that's our view.","Nick Todorov","Okay. And quickly on Fenix. I know it's pretty early Cliff, but can you give us some sense on how you sell-through relative to your expectations? And specifically are you willing to talk about mix within Fenix or would suggest that you're seeing some benefit from customers mixing up and buying higher end Fenix watches. So, if you can give us any color there that would be helpful. Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. We are pleased with the sell-through and we're working very hard to deliver on the backlog that we have in that product. We are seeing people step-up to the higher end versions particularly the larger Fenix 6X and interest in 6X Pro Solar is also very strong. So, there's a lot of positives in the Fenix line that are driving our business.","Nick Todorov","Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, thank you.","Operator","And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Teri Seck for closing remarks.","Teri Seck","Thank you everyone. As usual Doug and I will be available for callbacks throughout the day. Have a good one. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"10171":["Garmin Ltd.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program maybe recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Kerri Thurston, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kerri Thurston","Good morning, we would like to welcome you to Garmin Limited\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings call.","Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin\u2019s Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/doc. An archive of the webcast and related transcripts will also be available on our website.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market shares, product introduction, future demand for our product and objectives are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K which is filed with Securities and Exchange Commission.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As previously announced Garmin reported third-quarter revenue decreased 4% year-over-year. Aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor contributed 61% of total revenues and 75% of the operating profit in the third quarter. We continue to see our revenue base diversify broadly across our business segments.","Gross margin was 53% and operating margin came in at 18.5%. Reduction in margins from the prior year reflects a combination of factors. Including downward pressure from unfavorable currency movements, a more competitive pricing environment, particularly in the fitness market and continued investments in advertising and R&D. These factors, combined with a higher effective tax rate, resulted in pro forma EPS of $0.51 in the quarter.","Throughout the year we have highlighted that the strong U.S. Dollar related revenue has been in geographies of weaker currencies. In contrast, unit delivers were up 4% for the quarter and 10% for the year, due to the contribution from growth segments. While our primary yardstick is financial performance, we are encouraged by the underlying trends reflected in unit growth.","Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first I\u2019ll provide a few comments on each business segment. Beginning with the fitness segment, revenue grew 23% on a year-over-year basis with the sequential acceleration driven by strength in activity trackers, multisport, and cycling products.","It\u2019s interesting to note that current headwinds disproportionately impact the fitness segment due to the geographical revenue mix. These headwinds have softened revenue growth while unit deliveries have remained strong. We believe this indicates that the underlying business case remains sound","Gross and operating margins were 54% and 19% respectively. Gross margin was impacted by unfavorable currency movements and competitive dynamics in the market. Operating margin was impacted by increased spending in R&D and global advertising. We believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the opportunity in this high growth segment.","We\u2019ve recently introduced a new family of Forerunner products which includes three models the Forerunner 230, Forerunner 235, and Forerunner 630. Notably, the Forerunner 235 is our first wearable to incorporate Garmin Elevate technology. Garmin Elevate is a wrist-based heart rate sensor we specifically developed to serve a broad range of used cases from all-day heart rate tracking to intense workouts. All of the new Forerunners are compatible with our Connect IQ application framework, enabling users to personalize their watches with a host of interesting watch faces, custom data fields, and useful applications developed by third parties.","We also recently introduced an exciting new activity tracker called v\u00edvosmart HR, which also features Garmin Elevate technology for all-day heart rate tracking and activity intensity monitoring. Garmin Elevate technology combined with an always-on display and smart notifications, make the v\u00edvosmart HR one of the most capable activity trackers available on the market.","To support these products and many others we have released a major update of Garmin Connect Mobile. This update features a completely new user interface making an easy to view important activity information at a glance and providing even more customizations to fit individual needs. All of these new products are shipping now and we will soon launch a major new advertising campaign to support sales during the upcoming holiday shopping season.","Looking at outdoor revenue declined 5% year-over-year, as the revenue mix shifted to geographies with weaker currencies. Gross and operating margins were stable sequentially, but declined year-over-year driven primarily by currency weakness and product mix. The Fenix 3 has been an exciting success story this year. During the quarter we expanded the available choices for Fenix 3 with new color and material options and time for the holiday shopping season.","Turning next aviation, revenue declined 5%, as the industry had been impacted by lower oil prices and stock market volatility. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 25% respectively, though operating margin declined on a year-over-year basis due to R&D growth supporting future revenue opportunities. While the industry slowdown is disappointing, we remain confident in our improving position in the business jet category and look forward to completing development and certification of additional aircraft platform, as previously announced. We remain confident in our market position and the opportunities for long-term growth.","Looking at submarine, revenue was flat in the third quarter, as the boating season ended and we passed the first anniversary of the July 2014 acquisition of Fusion. Gross and operating margins improved as mix shifted to new products with higher margin profiles. Our investment and innovation has resulted in increased market share and industry-wide recognition. Garmin was recently honored as Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association. We also won four product-specific awards in the autopilot multi-function display and smartphone applications categories. We intend to build on this momentum in the coming year with additional innovation and market share gains.","In the auto segment, revenues were down 14% in the quarter, driven by the secular decline in PND market, as expected, however, our worldwide market share remains stable and strong. The PND market is an important part of our business and we remain focused on delivering a superior in-vehicle experience. Most recent example is babyCam, which was announced earlier this month. babyCam is a back seat monitoring system that streams wireless video to compatible Garmin PNDs. This system provides front seat passengers the ability to safely monitor the well-being of other passengers or cargo and appliance.","As previously announced we\u2019ve updated our full-year guidance and now anticipate revenues of approximately $2.8 billion, which includes approximately $185 million of negative currency impact, due to the stronger U.S. Dollar.","Our revenue outlook has been adjusted in fitness, outdoor and aviation, which are the segments most impacted by the economic and competitive factors, mentioned previously. We expect gross margin to be approximately 53.5%, down slightly from previous guidance, due to unfavorable geographic revenue mix and competitive pricing dynamics in the fitness segment. Due to the revenue and gross margin revisions, we now expect operating margin to be approximately 18.4%.","Finally, we anticipate pro forma EPS of approximately $2.25, which also reflects the higher anticipated tax rate for the full year.","While it\u2019s disappointing to revise to our guidance, we believe that the underlying business trends remain positive. And our investments in R&D and advertising will create long-term opportunities.","That concludes my remarks. Next Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?","Doug Boessen","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to briefly review our financial results, then move to summary of comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $680 million for the quarter, pro forma net income of $97 million. Pro forma EPS was $0.51 per share.","During the quarter, we faced significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which resulted in a revenue headwind of $52 million or 7% of revenue. Gross margin declined to 53%, 310 basis point decrease from prior year. Operating margin was 18.5%, a 640 basis point decrease from the prior year.","Finally, effective tax rate increased to 27.7% at current quarter, compared to a pro forma rate of 21% in the prior year. This created earnings pressure of $0.05 per share. We\u2019ll discuss gross margin, operating expenses and effective tax rate in more detail later.","Next, we will look at third quarter revenue by segment. The auto segment represented 39% of our total Q3 2015 revenue, compared to 44% in the third quarter 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base, with fitness increasing to 21%, our total Q3 2015 revenue.","Next I\u2019d like to discuss gross margin. This decreased to 53.3%, driven largely by the currency headwind, which reduced revenue by $52 million on a constant currency basis. As well as pricing dynamics in the fitness segment.","Total corporate operating margin was 18.5% due to gross margin pressure and increased R&D investment.","Looking next at operating expenses. Third quarter operating expense increased by $14 million or 6%. This is a 330 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $7 million year-over-year, or 150 basis points to 15.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, with increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness, and outdoor, where we see long-term growth opportunities. Our advertising expense increased $4 million for the prior quarter, represented 5.4% of sales, a 70 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness with investments in media, point-of-sale presence with key retailers, and cooperative advertising.","SG&A was up $3 million compared to the prior quarter, increasing 100 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.8%. Increased spending was driven primarily by IT expenses, product support costs, as our customer base continues to grow rapidly.","Just a few quick highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $432 million. Our inventory balance increased to $5.3 million, prepared for the fourth quarter and launch of a number of new products simultaneously.","During the third quarter of 2015, we generated free cash flow of $124 million. Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million, repurchased $51 million of company stock with $192 million remaining for purchase through December 2016.","Finally, as I mentioned previously, effective tax rate increased to 27.7% in the current quarter, compared to a pro forma rate of 21% on third quarter of 2014. Increased tax rate was primarily result of forecasted income mix by tax jurisdiction which was negatively impacted by the overall reduction in forecasted taxable income, and the result in catch up expense for the first half of 2015.","Our full-year effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 21.5% due to the change in income mix by tax jurisdiction. Consistent with last year, the full year effective tax rate forecast assumes the passage of the R&D tax credit.","This concludes our formal remarks. Johnson, can you please open the line for Q&-A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please? James, you might have your phone on mute.","James Faucette","Yes, can you hear me, now?","Operator","Yes.","James Faucette","Okay, thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of larger, bigger picture questions. As we go into the end of this year and we start to think about 2016, how are you thinking about the appropriate levels of investment into efforts like fitness bands, et cetera. Clearly that has \u2013 you haven\u2019t done as well as you would have thought and you\u2019re still hopeful there and looking to invest. But when do you think about starting to rationalize better or reevaluate that, first.","And second I guess is more of a backwards-looking question, but as we\u2019ve gone through this year we\u2019ve seen you revise your expectations related to and the impact from exchange rates a few times, first it was just on the pure translation and then later it\u2019s been on demand. How are you feeling about where we\u2019re at from that perspective? And do you think that the lower levels of demand given the higher pricing the U.S. dollar persists into 2016 or do you need to make pricing adjustments to address that better going into next year? Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Yes thanks James. In terms of 2016 it\u2019s certainly too early to comment but I would say that this fourth quarter is obviously very crucial in terms of gauging the overall market and we believe at this point we have a very strong product line that we\u2019ll read a lot into our plans for 2016. So our approach would be to plan our 2016 based on of course how we view the market towards the end of this year.","In terms of the revisions and kind of commenting on where we are at, I think, our situation with the currency is not so much an issue of lower demand or lower quantities, but it really is pressure on the revenue side and the translation of currency. We had some particularly strong results in some of those currency affected areas which is actually a good problem to have. But from the pricing point of view it\u2019s very difficult to change the pricing in a short-term basis. So we\u2019re doing what we can in the short-term to increase prices where we have some ability to do that, that\u2019s a longer-term solution it\u2019s really with products, new products and innovation.","James Faucette","Thank very much. And then just last follow-up question for me. Can you give an update on in-dash [ph] and specifically where we\u2019re out with Honda, that seem to be a good opportunity for you. And what are you thinking about the roll out potential of pro [ph] with that partner?","Cliff Pemble","Well, Honda is currently rolling out in North America now, so we\u2019re on a quite few platforms there, including the Pilot, Civic, CR-V and the Accord. So we\u2019re excited about what\u2019s going on there and it is rolling out for plan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs, your question, please.","Simona Jankowski","Hi, I just had a couple of question on fitness, as well. Can you help us understand the relative impact to pricing and margins from FX versus the competitive elements? And then, I was curious, if the products you just introduced, the Forerunner, the v\u00edvosmart, is that the line up for the holidays or are there others in the pipeline and are you looking at expanding into adjacent categories, as well?","And then just lastly, any thought on hedging, I know you historically hadn\u2019t, but just given the moves we\u2019ve been seeing, is that something that you are now considering?","Doug Boessen","Yes, this Doug. I will talk about the breakout of the fitness gross margin, year-over-year decline, about 360 basis points of that decline year-over-year is due to FX, the remainder is due to the product mix change, as well as the competitive pricing dynamics. And as it relates to hedging, hedging is something where we\u2019ve seen the fluctuations in the currency all through our corporate history book from a favorable, as well as unfavorable and we looked that in the past. Our current plans are not to hedge, since there has been large fluctuation of currency that is already taking place.","Cliff Pemble","And in terms of the product line-up, Simona, we\u2019re basically in place now with our fourth quarter holiday plans of all of the introductions that we had planned for the year, so 19% [ph].","Simona Jankowski","And Clif, in addition to the holiday line-up, are you investing in adjacent categories. We know within fitness or outdoor, beyond the existing categories?","Clifton Pemble","In terms of, what way?","Simona Jankowski","Just new product categories, so other than say fitness, watches or outdoor devices. Are there any adjacencies that we may not be thinking of that on your internal roadmap?","Clifton Pemble","Well, we always have things on our internal roadmap and we don\u2019t share those publicly. Out one of the recent examples of course in the automotive area was babyCam and we intend to continue to see that across all of our segments.","Simona Jankowski","Great, thank you.","Doug Boessen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue from RBC, your question, please.","Mark Sue","Thank you, maybe just some further details on your competitive dynamics and pricing in fitness, well was it cutting prices and how does Garmin respond in a market, where price elasticity of demand is quite high. And you are also at the advantage of your prices being higher, because of FX. So maybe how we should think about how you stand the market share loss and also recall how you might reverse that. In fact everyone has new products, we\u2019re just trying to get a sense of how you might be able to improve this metric? Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Well, I think a couple of things, Mark, in terms of the pricing, last year we were selling our basic entry-level tracker, the Vivofit at $129. And this year in terms of product lifecycle and overall market the situation has changed where that\u2019s above sub-$99 or sometime even sub-$79 product. Of course, we have other products that are filled in towards the upper end, but the situation is just different this year than last year. In terms of FX we aren\u2019t really at a pricing disadvantage because of FX. It doesn\u2019t make our prices higher, but it makes it \u2013 the impact is on the revenue we recognize in U.S. dollars once the currencies are translated.","So that\u2019s really the factor. And then the other thing I would mention is that the overall fitness market also includes running and the running market dynamics have changed in the past year, due to the advent of the wrist-based heart rate being key features that customers want. And consequently our product line until we started introducing our products of Forerunner 225 and now Forerunner 235 have been little softer in the market because of absence of that feature.","Mark Sue","That\u2019s helpful. As it relates to your balance sheet, you have a very healthy balance sheet and your stock currencies actually quite depressed. If you look at next year and we look at all the positive trends that are going to happen, as it relates to, new products, new market entry. Any thoughts on doing a big ASR at this point, adding some debt to the balance sheet, so that you can \u2013 retire quite a bit of soft trade [ph] and make up for some of the EPS that we lost as we started the year?","Cliff Pemble","At this point of time, you are right we do have a very strong balance sheet, as well as still have significant cash flow. But as we look at that our stock buyback situation will continue to monitor that depending upon the different conditions that are out there.","Mark Sue","That\u2019s helpful and thank you and good luck.","Doug Boessen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy David from Citigroup. Your question, please?","Jeremy David","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the introduction of your Elevate wrist-based heart rate monitoring technology. How accurate is that technology versus other wrist-based heart rate monitoring technology available in the market today if you could compare that? Maybe what is the difference versus other technologies.","Maybe I want to do a clarify, when the new Forerunner 235 and the v\u00edvosmart HR when we\u2019re expecting to see the ramp of these products, unlike it\u2019s more in Q1 than Q4 based on accounting [ph] some of the lone grades you\u2019ve used in the press release, you split that, I wanted to check that with you.","Doug Boessen","Yes in terms of the heart rate technology Jeremy, you know that we are a company that comes from the technical running side of things. So heart rate accuracy is very important to us. And other things that we did with our new technologies is ensure that it works very well for both the demanding athlete, as well as the less demanding requirements of all-day tracking. So we feel very good about the accuracy of our solution we feel like it\u2019s very versatile and allows us to widely deploy it across our product line.","In terms of ramp-up of the new products, these products as I mentioned in my comments, are available shipping now and they should be v\u00edvosmart HR should be available the November 1 at Best Buy and Forerunner 235 is also shipping now. So we think that they will have a meaningful impact on our Q4.","Jeremy David","Okay that\u2019s very helpful, thank you. If I can have a follow-up, you mentioned currency headwinds for several quarters now. However, does it look at you revenue breakdown by regions? All of the growth is coming from inside of the U.S. APAC is performing very strongly up double-digits year-over-year. But the U.S. revenue was down 10% year-over-year because there there\u2019s no currency impact there. So first what are the drivers of growth in APAC and then why are sales in U.S. pretty week?","Cliff Pemble","Well we\u2019ve been doing very well in APAC in some countries like China and Taiwan particularly with wearables that\u2019s a big growth area there. But one thing I would like to highlight is that, last year in Q3 the Americas region had its strongest performance of the year, up 12%. And so we are comping against little stronger performance in the Americas region, as well.","Jeremy David","Great and then last question. If I look at your free cash flow for the year so far first three quarters of 2015. You spend more on the dividend, then you\u2019ve generated free cash flow. How do \u2013 how should we think about dividend growth going forward and dividend sustainability? Thank you.","Doug Boessen","Well I think our cash flow situation of course has been impacted by all the factors that we mentioned, particularly the reduction in revenues due to currency, as well as the increased tax rate. So this is not the ideal situation that we would have planned and of course we plan for higher levels of cash flow generation in the future with new product introductions and as things normalized around the currency rates.","Jeremy David","Okay thanks for answering my questions. Appreciate it.","Doug Boessen","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson from Dougherty & Company, your question please.","Charlie Anderson","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I wonder if you could take a stab at how fitness grew on a constant currency basis in the quarter and then sort of that exit rate for the year, would be helpful. And then secondly, on fitness, you are spending more advertising I wonder if we should think about a certain number for, sort of a percent of sales as you go forward, if there is a change there versus the past, what that number might be?","Doug Boessen","Yes, in terms of the growth on a constant currency, we kind of headlined our overall situation on a consolidated basis so we haven\u2019t been focusing on that on the individual segments. We feel like the situation is going to quickly clear as we exit the year because if you remember the currency took a major nosedive that the international currencies did around the first half of the year.","So a lot has changed between then and now because we\u2019re introducing new products, we\u2019re adjusting pricing and so the comment on constant currency, things start to get a little bit intermingled and difficult to isolate.","In terms of advertising, we are spending at a higher level strategically in fitness. And we will continue to do so in the future in order to take advantage of the opportunity. So I would expect that in the coming year that we would have an increased level of advertising over historical levels probably similar in terms of percentage of sales and as to where we are today.","Charlie Anderson","Great, then my follow-up relates to aviation. It was a couple of year ago you guys won a number of new platforms, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of new platforms been announced in the last couple of years. I wonder how that pipeline looks today as we close out the year we\u2019ve got NBAA in a month or so.","Cliff Pemble","Well, we still are working on some new platforms that haven\u2019t air reached in the market. As you know the 100 Jet and Cirrus SF50. And so those have been programs that are still in the works and of course we are constantly working on new business, but at this time we don\u2019t have anything to report.","Charlie Anderson","Thanks so much.","Cliff Pemble","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt from Raymond James.","Tavis McCourt","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Quick, my product question is on the auto business and kind of the aftermarket, specifically. This year you\u2019ve launched a lot of enhancements to kind of the classic PND line, whether that\u2019s the babyCam or DashCam or some units with forward collision warning, lane departure warning and as more technology kind of gets baked into cars at the OEM level would seem to create an opportunity for aftermarket sales. What I\u2019m getting at is, have you done any advertising around these new features or any sense of the demand levels for them yet? Is that part of the advertising increase in Q4, where the advertising increase corporate wide, really just focused on the fitness side of the business.","Cliff Pemble","Well I think, specifically for auto we have done some appropriate level of advertising around some of these new features that you mentioned. But as you know the category has matured and has been in secular declines. So we\u2019re judiciously investing there, based on the opportunity. In terms of where we\u2019re focused strategically, the fitness market and to some extent outdoor categories are where we\u2019re focusing our advertising spend.","Tavis McCourt","Got you. And then Doug you mentioned specifically $52 million of FX headwind this quarter, although like you said, I suspect it\u2019s kind of tough of nail down exactly, because of price changes and things like that. And then you mentioned, I think, $185 million on the year. What is that implied headwind in Q4 and I suspect in Q1 that gets pretty de minimis, but just wanted make sure that.","Doug Boessen","Yes, so basically, yes, we had $148 million year-to-date of headwinds. So $185 is the amount of difference from that standpoint. And as you move into Q1, as Cliff previously mentioned, some of the exchange rates hopefully will kind of be more level, year-over-year from that standpoint. But yes\u2026","Cliff Pemble","Yes.","Doug Boessen","We will have to see how the currencies, move over to next three months or so.","Tavis McCourt","And from a cost perspective, there is a change in the Taiwanese dollar, the last couple of months, impact you guys positively or negatively?","Cliff Pemble","Impacting us positively right now, as it\u2019s been swinging weaker. So that\u2019s reflected in our overall results.","Tavis McCourt","Okay, thanks very much.","Doug Boessen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research, your question, please.","Ben Bollin","Good morning, thanks for taking my call.","Doug Boessen","Good morning.","Ben Bollin","First question I had for you is when you look at the sustainability of these investments you\u2019re making, you commented advertising probably runs a little harder into next year. But when you look at R&D it\u2019s increased in absolute terms, total dollars for the last several years and growing again, as a percentage of revenue this year. Should that pattern persist or how should we think about the R&D growth on a look-forward basis? And then I have a follow-up.","Cliff Pemble","Well, certainly has increased in the past years and part of that is that the product lines have become more complicated than they used to be in the past. They used to be that we could tell a device that was engineered to kind of standalone unit. But today we not only have to do the device, but we also have to do the cloud and the mobile applications so the development has become more complicated and thus requires more investments just kind of the reality of the current state of the market. With that said, we do wish to leverage our R&D investments and overtime try to equalize out with the opportunity but it would definitely be at a higher level than what we\u2019ve seen historically.","Ben Bollin","Okay, second part, lots of discussion about the emphasis and the push into the fitness business. And if you look at the margin performance in fitness, in the quarter it was essentially at the corporate operating margin level. Obviously there\u2019s implicit makeshift towards the fitness wearables. But as you see a larger percentage of sales from fitness wearables and capabilities improve, the margins get better in that business or how should we think about the margin performance within fitness overtime?","Doug Boessen","Well, certainly, our goal is to try to bring it back towards where it was but I think, it is kind of the state of the new reality in the market. There is a lot of emphasis on the fitness, a lot of competition out there. And so I would not expect to be able to certainly, quickly or maybe even ever be able to get back to the very high levels that we had when the product mix was only specialty products.","Ben Bollin","Thank you.","Doug Boessen","All right. Thank you, Ben.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Power from Robert W. Baird. Your question please.","Will Power","Great, yes, thanks for taking the question. I guess a couple of questions. First maybe on the outdoor segment, I want the commentary you had, I think the release you alluded to growth opportunities in 2016. So I guess, I wondered if you could elaborate on that, what you think might help grow that category for you next year and I guess along those lines any updates perhaps on the golf market, camera market, et cetera.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, in terms of outdoor the opportunity there is particularly in wearables and also dog products have been doing very well. And so again next year we would intend to leverage those categories to be able to sustain and possibly even grow the overall category of outdoor.","In terms of cameras, we\u2019ve just recently introduced the VIRB X and VIRB XE. And we\u2019ve taken an approach there being more of a niche player particularly appealing to the other segment customers in our product line, particularly in marine and aviation. And we feel reasonably positive about how that\u2019s been going as more of a niche category we\u2019ve had a lot of good feedback from those markets. And it\u2019s been getting specialty distribution that seems to be good.","Will Power","Okay, and then the second question just coming back to aviation, it feels like visibility is limited and there have been some macro headwinds, I mean are there any green shoots on the horizon that you see at this point from a macro standpoint or I guess you referenced stock market and energy prices being a limiting factors. That continues to be that the principle headwind. And I guess along with that I guess I\u2019m just curious how you kind of \u2013 how do you frame you energy market exposure how big of an issue is that?","Cliff Pemble","Yes in terms of the macro side we don\u2019t really see anything in the near-term that reverses that the trends, I think, aviation tends to be a long-term play. So as a result, as the macro conditions ebb and flow it tends to impact the market and the market reacts over a period of months or years. But in terms of the oil side of things the biggest impact for us has been on the helicopter side, particularly where the oil services companies and of course the providers of equipment to those and both the OEM and aftermarket has been challenged in that environment. And the other secondary factor is the oil producing countries the people there probably aren\u2019t buying as many aircraft or retrofitting as many aircraft in that environment. But that will equalize overtime, oil prices tend to go up and down, so it\u2019s not something we\u2019re particularly worried about in the longer-term.","Will Power","Okay. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes in the line of Brad Erickson from Pacific Crest Securities, your question please.","Brad Erickson","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just following-up on fitness, I guess seems like your unit growth here in Europe has been obviously lot better than in the U.S. lately. Is that something you see continuing or will those growth rate sort \u2013 converge as we look out into 2016?","Doug Boessen","Well I think it\u2019s probably hard to predict how the different markets perform. Europe and the international scene is probably a year or two behind in terms of the overall adoption of fitness and wellness based products. But they\u2019re in a little more of a growth curve at this moment.","Brad Erickson","Got it. And then just on the aviation front, can you just talk about just briefly of the cadence of kind of new certifications you have coming out over the next year or year or two perhaps and how that compares to this past year or two?","Doug Boessen","Yes, I think, the past couple of years we\u2019ve definitely seen a lot of new platforms, particularly in late 2013, 2014 and early 2015. We still have a couple of platforms that are publicly announced out there that are yet to be certified late this year, early next year. But in terms of the new business of course I can\u2019t comment on those at this time.","Brad Erickson","Got it and then finally an apologize, I think, you may have already address this but I missed it. The operating results obviously leading to lower cash flows than we thought a few quarters ago. Can you kind a talk about how this might impact the dividend and just, I guess, more broadly how the boards thinks about changes to the dividend in light of weaker operation. Thank you.","Doug Boessen","So I think dividend is a high priority for us, particularly to be a reliable, long-term payer of dividend. So that\u2019s really our number one priority in terms of our overall usage of free cash flow. For us, at higher levels of cash flow we also want to consider other investments like acquisitions and buybacks, but will tend to fill those in based on our available cash flow in order to make sure that we\u2019re able to manage our cash appropriately.","Brad Erickson","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Doug Boessen","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Kristine Liwag","Hi, good morning everyone. This is actually Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron.","Doug Boessen","Hi, Christian.","Kristine Liwag","When you think about the target customers for new products that you are rolling out in fitness for activity trackers and baby monitors, first as your traditional customers for high and niche fitness watches and power meters, how much do you think that overlap is between the two groups?","Doug Boessen","Between new customers and the existing customers?","Kristine Liwag","I mean, buyers of newer products that seem to be a little bit more of targeted to mainstream versus your legacy portfolio that\u2019s more of niche activity tracker for marathon trainers and things like that.","Doug Boessen","Yes, I think that\u2019s a while running has traditionally been viewed as a niche, I think, there\u2019s is definitely a social movement going on now with increased activity including running. So a lot of people are starting to be interested in it, and pick up on it and a lot of people that are coming to the market of course are people that have been exposed to Garmin in some way. So we feel like we do have broad brand recognition and the ability to serve those customers, as they get interested in it.","Kristine Liwag","Sure, and also I understand that advertising dollars will pick up, I mean, you\u2019ve mentioned that a few times. But then will you also have a shift in strategy, especially, as I mentioned, right here \u2013 it seems like you\u2019re moving a little bit more towards the mainstream customer.","Cliff Pemble","Well, I mean, we\u2019re advertising those products where we see the biggest market opportunity and that\u2019s particularly in areas of activity trackers, fitness, and some of our wearables and outdoor.","Kristine Liwag","Sure. And last question from me. From my understanding, and please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, aviation products are largely manufactured in Kansas, while a lot of your consumer electronic parts are really in Taiwan. If there is a strategic decision to unlock value and split up the company, how easy is that to do on an operation and manufacturing perspective? And then, a follow-up to that, would be, first how often do you and the Board discuss portfolio shaping?","Cliff Pemble","Portfolio, shaping?","Kristine Liwag","Yes.","Cliff Pemble","Okay, understand. So I\u2019ll address the first question you mentioned about unlocking value, that is something that not on our radar right now. We view our all of our segments, as strategic components of our overall portfolio and it\u2019s something that we aren\u2019t considering.","In terms of portfolio shaping, I\u2019m assumingly what you mean by that is a strategic direction of our product portfolio and that is something that we review, on a regular basis with our Board and it\u2019s something that we review internally on a constant basis within our company, with each segment.","Kristine Liwag","Okay, great, thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Rich Valera, from Needham & Company, your question please.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Cliff just in terms of your \u2013 you mentioned sort of a plan to improve the operations of the company relative to the recent poor results and it wasn\u2019t clear to me if there was sort of anything new \u2013 any new elements to the plan. If you\u2019ve made any sort of strategic decisions, as far as how you\u2019re going to approach the market based on the recent downturn or is it kind of more of the keep investing in new products and new adjacencies and go after the markets, that way, I just wanted to know, if there\u2019s anything new or different and maybe in the way you\u2019re approaching the market, based on the recent results?","Cliff Pemble","Yes I think the recent results are obviously challenging, because on the financial yardstick point of view, we of course are experiencing pressure. But as I mentioned in my comments on the unit side of things, our unit deliveries are up and we\u2019re seeing success in markets around the world. So it really isn\u2019t a time for us to strategically peel back on some of those things. In fact, it\u2019s probably a time to increase, so that we can create more innovation out there and over the long-term, as I mentioned before, be able to reset the pricing in the market around new products and new innovation.","Rich Valera","Great, that makes sense. Thank you.","Clifton Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Doug Baesson, Chief Financial Officer.","Doug Boessen","Thanks to everyone for attending today, appreciate it. Take care.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

I want to note that today's call is being recorded. And now, I would like to turn the conference over to Kerri Thurston, Director of Investor Relations. Kerri, please go ahead.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd.'s First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call.","Please note that a copy of the press release concerning this earnings call is available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. Additionally, this call is being broadcast live on the Internet. Please note that this webcast does include slides, which can be viewed during the call. An archive of the webcast will be available until June 1, and a transcript to the call will be available on the website under the Events calendar.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market share, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ","Attending on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Dr. Min Kao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Rauckman, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. The presenters for this morning's call are Cliff and Kevin.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue and pro forma EPS growth in the first quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 10% year-over-year to $557 million, with each of our business segments contributing. Our traditional markets of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness attributed 14% revenue growth and 50% of the total revenue mix.","Gross margins improved to 51% from 47% in the prior year. Operating margins also improved 150 basis points to 16%, with our traditional markets providing 80% of the operating income mix in the quarter.","Revenue growth, combined with improved margins, resulted in both operating income and pro forma EPS growth. Operating income for the quarter grew 21% or $16 million, while pro forma EPS came in at $0.45, a 5% improvement over the prior year. We sold 2.7 million units in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year.","Next, I'll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights, segment by segment. ","Starting in the Marine segment, revenue grew 9% as the overall industry showed signs of improvement. The mild winter experienced throughout much of the U.S. may have triggered an early start to the marine season. Growth was broad-based across our product portfolio.","An area of strategic focus in the Marine segment is to strengthen our position in the OEM space through product portfolio expansion and strategic alliances. As we have mentioned in the past, 2012 will be a year of significant investment, as we pursue opportunities that we believe will lead to growth in 2013 and beyond. The near-term impact will result in some level of margin compression. However, we expect to see this reverse as revenue growth accelerates in the future.","In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 5%, with both the retrofit and OEM markets contributing. However, OEM recovery still lags the broader economy, and we expect this condition to continue throughout the year. During the quarter, we supported the successful first flight of the Cessna M2, which includes the Garmin G3000 cockpit system. This certification project, along with several others, continue to make good progress, and we anticipate the program will contribute to revenue growth in 2013 and beyond. These programs are very complex and require a higher level of R&D investment compared to what we have seen in the past. While this investment does compress our margins in the near term, we are confident that the investments we are making now will lead to growth in the future.","The Outdoor segment performed well in the first quarter with 16% revenue growth and 4% operating income growth. Revenue improvement was primarily driven by new categories such as GPS-enabled golf products, as well as dog tracking and training. In the golf market, we continued to expand our product offerings with the new Approach S3. This touchscreen watch provides an integrated digital scorecard and shows the layout of the greens with the ability to easily relocate the pin.","Throughout 2012, we will focus on creating new opportunities in adjacent markets and product categories as we have done in the past. We will also pursue utility, content and innovative form factors to capture both new and repeat customers.","Turning now to the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 26% and operating income grew 34% on a year-over-year basis. This strong performance was partially driven by the successful launch of our latest, multisport device, the Forerunner 910XT. This product has been well received and is expected to continue to perform well at the high end of the market as we enter triathlon season.","We continue to believe the Fitness category offers significant opportunity for growth going forward. In response to this opportunity, we are focused on delivering innovation in both running and cycling to drive broader adoption of GPS technology across a range of price points.","Our Auto\/Mobile segment was strong again in the first quarter, delivering revenue growth of 6%. This growth was primarily related to global market share gains in PND, sales of automobile -- mobile applications and amortization of previously deferred revenues that Kevin will discuss in a moment.","During the quarter, we announced our first factory-installed infotainment relationship with Suzuki. We will be providing a complete entertainment head unit with enhanced features and an intuitive user-interface to a number of Suzuki models in both North America and Europe, along with a number of additional regions. This represents a significant milestone for Garmin, as we seek to build relationships and credibility in the auto OEM industry.","While we are pleased with the first quarter results in the Auto\/Mobile segment, we don't expect this trend to continue in the longer term as PND represents a substantial portion of the revenue mix, and the size of the PND market continues to shrink. We anticipate that the PND market will decline approximately 10% on a global basis for the full year. ","However, we expect our margins to improve throughout the remainder of the year as volumes increase from the seasonally low first quarter. Our strategic focus in the PND market is to profitably aggregate additional market share through innovation and by delivering the best navigation experience in the vehicle. ","With the Suzuki announcement, we took another step forward in building our OEM presence. However, we also recognize that this is just the beginning, as it relates to broader OEM market opportunities. We will continue to develop these opportunities, which will contribute to revenue growth in the years to come.","Before turning the call over to Kevin, I wanted to highlight another important milestone that was announced this morning. We are pleased to report we have surpassed the 100 million units sold mark. Since our humble beginnings in 1989, we have delivered quality products to motorists, pilots, boaters, runners, cyclists, bikers, hunters and geocachers around the globe. We sold our first product in 1991, our millionth in 1997, 25 million in 2007 and now, over 100 million in 2012. It has been an incredible journey so far, and we are excited about our future. ","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will walk us through the financial details. Kevin?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and margin results, then move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, and then conclude with a few comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. ","So first, we posted revenue of $557 million for the quarter with net income of $87 million. And our pro forma EPS was $0.45 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 10% year-over-year and our gross margin came in at 51%, which was a 410-basis point improvement from the prior year. Operating margin was 16%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. The key components of this were the favorable gross margin of 410 basis points offset by advertising, which was 30 basis points unfavorable and up $4 million on a year-over-year basis.","SG&A was 180 basis points unfavorable, up $17 million on a year-over-year basis. Our R&D was 40 basis points unfavorable, up $10 million on a year-over-year basis. And each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide.","Our pro forma EPS of $0.45 represents a 5% increase year-over-year, driven by increasing revenues, improved growth and operating margins offset by a higher effective tax rate. The first quarter 2011 effective tax rate of 1.5% provided an additional $0.06 of diluted EPS. ","And finally, units shipped increased 7% year-over-year as 2.7 million units were delivered during the quarter. Our total company average selling price was $205 per unit, up 2% from Q1 of 2011, driven primarily by our segment mix.","According to the U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the first quarter of 2012 and 2011. In the current quarter, we recognized, on a net basis, approximately $1 million of previously amortized revenues, resulting in no EPS impact during the quarter. ","In the first quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $22 million or $0.09 of tax-affected EPS. While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting cash at the same time of sale, as reflected in our statement of cash flows. We now expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impacts due to deferrals in the upcoming quarters, but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred in 2011.","In total, our revenues increased 10% during the first quarter, with all segments contributing to the growth. In Q1, we generated a 6% revenue increase within the Auto\/Mobile segment, as volumes increased due to our 2011 acquisition of Navigon, and we continued to gain market share. ASP also increased slightly, driven by the recognition of previously deferred revenues.","Our Outdoor segment posted strong revenue growth at 16%, due primarily to market share gains within the GPS-enabled golf market and the acquisition of Tri-Tronics in the back half of 2011. ","The Fitness segment continued to grow with a 26% revenue increase when compared to Q1 of 2011 on the strength of new product introductions, particularly the Forerunner 910XT for the triathlete market.","Aviation segment revenues increased 5% compared to Q1 2011 with a single-digit growth in both aftermarket and OEM. In our Marine segment, revenues increased 9% compared to Q1 of 2011, as both the aftermarket and OEM markets improved for Garmin.","During Q1, all geographies posted growth, with EMEA posting the strongest growth at 16%. For Q1 2012, the Americas represented 53% of revenue compared to 55% in Q1 of 2011. EMEA increased from 34% of total revenue a year ago to 36% in Q1 of 2012, while Asia was consistent at 11% of total.","The Auto\/Mobile segment represented 50% of our total revenue during the quarter, down 52% from Q1 of 2011. And Fitness grew to 13% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 11% in 2011.","Due to the improved profitability of Auto\/Mobile in Q1 of 2012, the operating income contribution of the segment increased to 20% from only 2% in the prior year. The traditional segments of Outdoor, Fitness, Aviation and Marine contributed 80% of our Q1 total 2012 operating income.","Looking next at margins. Q1 Auto\/Mobile gross margin and operating margin were 39% and 6%, respectively. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenue and product mix. Operating margin in the quarter was 6%, with gross margin improvement offset by increased SG&A and R&D expenses, focused on auto OEM.","Q1 Outdoor gross margin was 61%, down slightly from Q1 of 2011. Operating margin was 34%, a decline from 37% in the year-ago quarter, due primarily to increased allocation of our SG&A expenses to this segment.","Q1 Fitness gross margin, 61%, up slightly from the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin in this segment was 29%, again, up slightly to the year-ago quarter as the revenue growth outpaced our expense increases.","Q1 marine gross margin was 60% compared to 65% in the year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted toward lower margin products. Operating margin was 16%, down 20 -- down from 29% a year ago, driven by the gross margin decline, increased R&D expenses to support our long-term marine OEM strategy, as well as cooperative advertising within our -- with our marine partners.","And finally, the Q1 Aviation gross margin came in at 68%, down slightly from 69% a year ago. Operating margin was 23% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year, due primarily to the decline in gross margin and increased R&D expense associated with our new OEM programs that will begin to contribute revenue in 2013.","Q1 operating expenses increased by $30 million on a year-over-year basis from $164 million, up to $193 million in Q1 of 2012, an increase to 260 basis points as a percentage of sales. A large portion of the increase was due to the acquisitions as I will highlight. Sequentially, operating expenses declined in all 3 categories.","First, R&D increased $10 million year-over-year in the quarter and 40 basis points to 14% of sales, as headcount increased with our recent acquisitions, and we continue to invest in several OEM opportunities. Our ad spending increased $4 million over the year-ago quarter, with an increase of 30 basis points as a percentage of sales to 4% in Q1 of 2012. This was largely driven by additional costs associated with our acquired entities and cooperative advertising and promotional activities in our Marine and Aviation segments.","SG&A increased $17 million compared to the year-ago quarter, an increase of 180 basis points to 16% of sales. The increase was primarily attributable to our acquisitions and to increased legal fees.","Moving next to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.5 billion. Our accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $430 million due to the seasonality of the first quarter. AR accounted for approximately 56 days of sales when calculated on a trailing 4 quarters, compared to 81 days of sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 58 days of sales in the year-ago quarter.","Our inventory balances increased slightly to $407 million on a sequential basis at the close of the first quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 102 days, compared to 102 in the fourth quarter and 119 days in the first quarter of 2011. We do not currently show a dividend payable as the $1.80 per share requires approval of our shareholders on June 1 at our annual meeting.","We continued to generate free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $122 million during Q1. We spent $6 million on CapEx during Q1, therefore, our free cash flow during the quarter was $116 million. Cash flow invested during Q1 was $55 million, including the $6 million in CapEx and $43 million net purchase of marketable securities. Our financing activities were a $74 million use of cash during the quarter, due primarily to the dividend payment on March 31. And overall, we earned an average of 1.5% in all of our cash and marketable security balances during the quarter.","We expect our strong free cash flow generation to continue in 2012. And with it, we plan to continue to fund a strong dividend. We will ask shareholders to approve a 45% share quarterly dividend at our June annual meeting. We'll also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets or tuck-in technologies, which fit our core markets. As has been our practice in the past, acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, value compatibility and a strategic fit within our company.","Tax rate for the quarter was 12.8%, and we expect our 2012 rate to be approximately 13% for the full year.","Finally, as a reminder, we provided our full year 2012 guidance in February. And we are not updating guidance at this time, as our Q1 trends were generally in line with our own expectations and it is the seasonally weakest quarter of our fiscal year. We will plan to review and update 2012 guidance following our Q2 results. ","This concludes our formal remarks, and we will now move to a period of Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And from Dougherty & Company, we'll go to Charlie Anderson.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","You guys highlighted the warmer weather. And I wonder, kind of relative to your forecast going in, how did that impact sales? And how should we be thinking about sort of seasonality in Q2, given that maybe some of these products were bought earlier than they normally are?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Charlie, I think definitely, warmer weather could have spurred some initial buying, early start to marine season, as we commented. And if that's the case, then we would expect that maybe some of those purchases were done earlier and that Q2 could consequently be a little softer in some of those seasonal markets. But it's too early to tell. And I think that we'll continue to monitor going forward.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Same goes for Outdoor, potentially?","Clifton A. Pemble","Possibly. Although, again, I think it's probably a little more difficult to tell there.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Yes. And then a follow-up for me on Marine, I think your OpEx was up something like $6 million, $7 million year-over-year. I think you guys highlighted in the press release the increase in R&D. But I think that only made up $2 million of that increase. So I wonder if there are any sort of one-time events or if it's all just sort of related to some of these OEM program costs. And then on that, I wondered if you could help us understand sort of the upside revenue potential as you're building for some of these OEM programs, that would be helpful.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, there really were no one-time events. So I think the points of investment in marine OEM apply across the board, whether it's R&D or other SG&A costs. And -- so I think we've seen some growth over the last year on our marine OEM, but we still have high hopes for winning new deals in the next year to 2. I think, Charlie, that the time to invest and then the time to win business takes somewhere between a year or 2 to gain revenues. So we're still expecting more of a longer-term benefit on the Marine segment.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer & Company.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions on the PND business. The net deferred revenue turned positive in the quarter, I think, sooner than I had anticipated. Can you give us a sense of whether the take rate decline in the quarter for lifetime apps, whether the deferral has come down? And how you expect those 2 items to trend over the year?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, it's a good question. Now the take rate really didn't change significantly over what we saw in Q4. But what's occurred is you have Q1's our seasonally lowest period but we've continued to amortize our past deferred revenues, and they actually surprised us a little bit the fact that it actually became positive. What we're expecting for the remainder of the year, as I said in my remarks, is that, that would continue to be negative in terms of the revenue and operating income. However, it will be less negative than we experienced in 2011.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of volume kind of back on the envelope, it looks like PND volumes on an organic basis were probably down low teens, if I kind of factor in the contribution for Navigon. TomTom, when they spoke last week, I guess, I guess they're seeing the market probably decline even more sharply than that on a global basis. When we think about that 10% decline that you've talked about, do you think there's a chance that needs to get revised to something a little more conservative as we move through the year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, as Cliff mentioned, we do expect that the overall industry will continue to be in decline. And we haven't changed our outlook on an overall 10% decline for the year. I think where we saw -- a little bit more strength within the European market, where we saw better sell-in and even our U.S. market didn't decline as much as we had anticipated. So we -- I think we're pleased in general with the overall PND industry. We'll just have to wait and see how the rest of the year shapes up.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Suhail Chandy with Wedbush.","Suhail Chandy - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","This is Suhail, sitting in for Scott. A couple of questions if I may. Talking -- going back to the question on deferred revenue progressing, and you said it's going to be negative, but less negative. Can we expect a turnaround there and where it becomes a tailwind to EPS? And if so, when should we see that occurring?","Kevin S. Rauckman","We don't expect a tailwind on an absolute dollar basis for the remainder of 2012. And we'll just update you all as we go forward in the year to see when that will turn around. So I think, again, we would expect both negative revenue and EPS impact due to the deferrals as we go through the remainder of this year.","Suhail Chandy - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And second question -- great job on gaining market share and PNDs. But as we look forward, how much more market share do you see out there that's open for the taking?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think there's still third-tier players that are struggling in the market. And as they continue to capitulate, there will be market share to take. And of course, we, as the global leader, it is still kind of split between us and the second player. But we would aim to try to take share from all the players as well.","Operator","And from Avondale Partners, John Bright.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Cliff, why did you decide to open auto OEM offices in Japan, China, Germany now versus years past?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think that in Japan is in response to our opportunity with Suzuki, and so each of these opportunities requires local engineering support. China is an emerging opportunity, so we're developing business there, and it requires a local presence. So each one has its own story. But in general, it's driven either by the engineering support is needed or the business development that's needed.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","My second question is regarding Aviation. In the prepared slides, I think you alluded to multiple ongoing OEM certifications. How much of this is built into the annual guidance?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, as we mentioned, I think some of the opportunities that we've mentioned publicly don't deliver in 2012. So -- though there's really nothing in the annual guidance that's reflecting these opportunities that are in the out years.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And how large could these opportunities become?","Clifton A. Pemble","We really can't comment on the specific programs and the individual contributions.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Jeff Rath with Canaccord Genuity.","Jeff Rath - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just a question around your OEM opportunities, Cliff. You talked about OEM opportunities now in Aviation, Auto\/Mobile and Marine. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the size of those opportunities and the visibility that comes with those opportunities. I'm not sure if you're willing to give us some sense of how much is coming already in those segments from OEM as well. And I have a follow-up.","Clifton A. Pemble","We generally don't split it out between OEM and retrofit in these various market segments. I think that's -- we're growing from a very small base in Marine and Auto, so we have room to grow in those areas. But the Aviation, as you know, we've been strong in over the years. And so there, we have a higher mix of OEM versus retrofit sales.","Jeff Rath - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And more specifically, Cliff, do you expect the incremental investments that you're making in those opportunities, in those 3 segments? I guess, in Auto, it's already bearing fruit. But do you expect those to start to show up in sort of I guess stronger revenue growth in 2013?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, 2013 and beyond is really when those opportunities really hit for us.","Jeff Rath - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And just one final for Kevin. Kevin, historically, you've kind of just talked generally about your free cash flow targets for '12 as being about flat with 2011. Is that still the case?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Actually, they should be a little bit down this year because of the deferred revenue impact. We've had some -- as I mentioned in my comments, we get the cash up front, but we will not see as significant of a deferred revenue benefit this year. So overall, we're looking at free cash flow somewhere in the area of about $650 million for the full year.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm not sure if I missed it, but would you be able to estimate your market share in North America and Europe? And also, did you think most of your share gains in the quarter were in Europe or in other markets as well?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think if you look at the most recent NPD data, it suggests that our U.S. share in PND could be as high as 66%, which is an increase of low-60s, about 63% a year ago. It also appears that in Europe, depending on which numbers you use, we could be looking at market share in the low 30% range, somewhere between 31% and 33%. But it does appear that we are gaining share in both of those regions for the Q1 time period.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. And the U.S. share, if you compare that 66% to 63% a year ago, it seems like most of that would be accounted for by the Navigon acquisition? Or do you feel that organically, you've had some share gains as well?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Navigon would not have been in the U.S. market. So that 66% is exclusive of Navigon. I think the European number would be inclusive of Navigon, so that could be impacting part of that. Yes.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on the PND side, how should we think about your ASPs this year? It sounds like they improved a little bit sequentially this last quarter. Do you view them as flattish, going up, going down slightly throughout the rest of the year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. We're looking at an overall full year ASP impact of neutral. So really, no price change across the board in the PND results for our 2012 segment.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to make sure I'm interpreting that correctly, do you mean full year '12 relative to full year '11, or just relative to the ASP that you had in the first quarter?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Full year 2012 versus full year 2011.","Operator","And from RBC Capital Markets, we'll move on to Mark Sue.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So the bigger you get in terms of PND market share, the better your margins should be over time, particularly when there's no ASP declines. So how do we -- how should we think about margins in the steady business over -- as you kind of amass more volumes on a normalized basis?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I would expect, as we go forward, not just in 2012, but in future years, we would expect a slight increase in gross margin. I caution, though, because the number of units that we are shipping on an absolute basis is not really moving. In fact, it's going to be down. But just given the competitive landscape that we're looking at, I'd expect slight increases in gross margin over the next year or 2.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Are there other changes in terms of component costs and also what you're paying for maps and everything else that kind of gives you a boost over time as well?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, and that's the reason for a potential benefit. We're looking at this year, cost benefit or cost savings in single digit -- low-single digits. So prices stay roughly flat. And costs come down a couple of percentage points and that should help us.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately on Fitness, have you had the opportunity to recalibrate the TAM kind of penetration, where we are in terms of the market, and how we should look at running and cycling? It does seem like a highly discretionary purchase, but yet you're seeing strengthening trends. Just kind of your thoughts of the sustainability of that market.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, Mark, there's not a lot of market research that would really point to what the TAM is, if you will. It's a little less defined than what obviously Auto market is where you can count how many cars there are. But that said, there's a growing interest in using GPS for fitness-related activities anywhere for -- from people who are more interested in the health side, to people who are competitive. So we're seeing the growth being driven by the increased interest and adoption of GPS.","Operator","And moving on to Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","I have 2 questions. The first relating to channel inventory levels, could you address where you see those for the PND business? And then also, Outdoor and Fitness? And if you see any other significant channel expansion opportunities, and then I have a follow-up.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, we talked about this in our last earnings call. We exited -- we saw the channel, both our inventories and the channel inventories at a fairly low level. And we really haven't seen much movement there. It appears that the retailers are doing a much better job of keeping their inventory clean and buying as they need. So we feel pretty comfortable with that. And no real issues on the Outdoor and Fitness segment either in terms of channel inventory.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","And then, I guess, the second one looking at margin overall, if you look at all the OEM opportunities, Auto and Marine and Aviation, can you provide a little bit of direction on each one? How these OEM opportunities will contribute to growth in operating margins?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think the way you need to look at it is we're in an investment phase in each of those. And if we can win the business that we're going after, just the incremental volume will really help push up operating margins over time. Now this isn't going to occur in 2012, as Cliff said. It's going to take us 2013 and beyond to see those benefits. But Aviation, typically, for example, would be operating margins in the -- about 30%. And we're below that right now. So we would expect margins to pick up at least in that area, in that segment in the future.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Rich Valera with Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Question on auto gross margin as you move through the year. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expected them to be higher than the first quarter level due to higher volumes as you move through the year. Wondering if you could quantify that at all, and if that includes also the fourth quarter, which is typically a lower margin quarter than, say, the second or third.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think what we would expect across our business, and it includes the Auto\/Mobile, is we had a 16% operating margin, and we would expect those margins to pick up above 20%, not only in Q2 but for the rest of the year. And even looking at Q4 for the Auto\/Mobile, we still expect that operating margins should be up. In total, I would expect it to be somewhere, just on the Auto\/Mobile segment, closer to the 10% as opposed to the 6% that we reported in the first quarter.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But I think the comment you made was specifically with respect to Auto gross margin, was it not in your prepared remarks?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. So gross -- just looking at the gross margin, 39%. We won't give specific segment expectations, just on the PND or Auto\/Mobile. We do expect those to increase again due to volume.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And you would think that would include the fourth quarter, which is typically seasonally weaker from a margin perspective?","Kevin S. Rauckman","That's all -- that's wrapped into our expectations. We naturally see Q4 below the other quarters because of the holiday season.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. And then you address seasonality to some degree in Outdoor and perhaps Marine. I'm wondering about seasonality for Auto into 2Q. Is there any reason to expect any difference from the last couple of years in terms of seasonal trends from first quarter to second quarter there?","Kevin S. Rauckman","No. We would expect similar seasonality going from Q1 to Q2 in the Auto\/Mobile space. As Cliff mentioned, we may have some negative impact due to the Marine segment on what we saw in Q1 versus Q2.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from James Faucette with Pacific Crest.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Starting with production, it seems like -- and I think, Kevin, you've alluded to this that, that inventory levels in the Fitness segment are low, seems to be low in the channel. It seems like we may not be getting enough demand -- to even meet demand for some of the new watches and so on. So can you talk a little bit about if you're having production constraints there or what may be keeping supplies tight? And similarly, I know that you talked a little bit about ramping new Aviation products last quarter. I'm just wondering if we are seeing any production constraints there? And then finally, just my last question, if we can just get an update on the timing of availability of the Vector. It sounds like there's a fair amount of pent-up demand for that product.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, James, this is Cliff. In terms of Fitness inventory constraints, we don't really see any constraints in terms of production and supplying the channel. I think some of what you may be seeing in the field is that some of the more popular products like the 910 have done much better than what our retailers and what our forecasts had indicated initially. So we are able to ramp that production up, but it does take some time to get those fed out to the field. Some of the retailers are small independents and it does take some time to fill their needs. In terms of the Vector, we are testing prototypes at this point and so we do have systems that are being filed and proven. As we mentioned in our update recently, we weren't happy with what we felt was the performance required for the cycling market. And so we've stepped back a little bit and we want to go back and try to make sure it's absolutely rock-solid before we take it out to market.","Operator","And gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing comments.","Kevin S. Rauckman","All right. Thanks, everyone, for your participation. We look forward to keeping you updated and as we move through the year. So have a great day. We'll talk to you later.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining."],"10287":["Garmin Ltd.

And welcome to the Garmin\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer Session and instructions to be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Seck. You may begin.","Teri Seck","Good morning. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Limited's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcript will also be available on our Web site.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, growth and operating margins, and future dividend, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of the risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier today, we delivered another quarter of revenue and profit growth. Revenue grew 3% on a consolidated basis. Combined revenue from outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness increased 9%, and represented 78% of our revenue in the holiday quarter.","Gross margin improved year-over-year to 56% due to favorable shifts in both segment and product mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, resulting an operating income growth of 12%. These strong results generated GAAP EPS of $0.73 and pro forma EPS of $0.79 in the quarter.","Looking briefly at our full year performance, 2017 was our second consecutive year of revenue and operating income growth. I believe this is a remarkable achievement considering the challenges that we faced. The PND market continued its decline as it is done for nearly a decade. In addition, the basis activity tracker market rapidly matured and left additional gaps to fill. We filled these gaps and more because of the strength and diversity of our business.","Revenue increased 2% over 2016 to nearly $3.1 billion. Combined revenue from outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness increased 9% and generated 90% of our operating income. Growth in operating margins improved to 58% and 22% respectively while operating income grew 7%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $3.68 and pro forma EPS of $2.94. Pro forma EPS grew 4% over the prior year.","Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I want to highlight that Garmin was recently included in the Forbes Global 2000 world's best employers list, placing 430th out of more than 300,000 companies that were surveyed. We also were ranked 41st in the Forbes Just 100 Americas best corporate citizens list. This ranking considered Company\u2019s focus on seven metrics, including producing quality goods, treating customers well, minimizing environmental impact, supporting the communities we operate in, commitment to ethical and diverse leadership and treating our workers well. We are honored by this recognition and I want to thank all of our employees for your strong commitment to our mission and values which made this recognition possible.","Next I\u2019ll highlight 2017 performance and 2018 outlook for each of our five segments. Starting with Outdoor, revenue increased 28% on strong demand for Outdoor wearables and growth in inReach subscription services. The segment posted gross and operating margins of 64% and 36% respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 36% over the prior year.","Looking back on 2017, our f\u0113nix line of adventure watches continued to show strong momentum, driven by the new f\u0113nix 5 series. There are many positive things that we can say about this product line, but one I\u2019d like to highlight is that the variety of sizes and styles offered in the f\u0113nix 5 family has successfully broadened our customer base.","In particular, the majority of customers registering f\u0113nix 5S devices are women, which was a previously underrepresented demographic in our f\u0113nix customer base. As we have mentioned in the past, our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables. Connect IQ now offers more than 3,500 apps, widgets and watch faces, and has generated over 45 million downloads since inception, approximately half of which occurred in the past year.","To further promote the power and utility at Connect IQ, we will host our second annual developers\u2019 conference in mid April, offering workshops and tools that our developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem.","Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the Outdoor segment will increase approximately 13% in 2018. We anticipate the growth will be driven primarily by the f\u0113nix series and supported by growth in other product categories within the segment.","Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 14% with revenues exceeding $500 million for the first time in our history, growth was broad based in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. Growth in operating margins were strong at 74% and 31% respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 23% for the year.","In recent developments, Textron Aviation announced that the new Cessna Sky Courier aircraft will be equipped with the Garmin G1000NXI system. We are excited to expand our partnership with Textron Aviation and look forward to supporting the certification and delivery of this new aircraft.","Last week, we announced that our D2 Charlie Aviation Watch was selected by the United States\u2019 Air Force for use by pilots of the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The D2 Charlie will provide unique benefits, such as pressure alerts and glanceable navigation information on the wrist. Our aviation team has a strong commitment to delivering quality and service to our customers. As evidence of that commitment, we received two Supplier of The Year Awards for technical support to operators and for electric and electronic systems at the recent 2017 Embraer Suppliers conference. This is a significant accomplishment considering the scope and complexity of Embraer\u2019s operations and the high expectations that their suppliers must meet. Also for the fourteenth consecutive year, Garmin was ranked number one in Avionic support by professional pilot magazine and by Aviation international news. I congratulate our team on earning these awards, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers.","Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the aviation segment will increase approximately 13% in 2018. We anticipate broad-based growth across both OEM and aftermarket product categories due to improving market conditions, contributions from new products and platforms and opportunities related to the ADS-B mandate.","Looking next at the Marine segment, revenue grew 13%, driven by growth in chartplotters, fishfinders and contributions from our recent Navionics acquisition. Gross margin improved to 57% while operating margin declined 13% due to litigation related costs. At the Miami Boat Show, we announced that Sea Hunt Boat Company, one of the top selling saltwater boat brands in the United States, is now offering Garmin electronics in their line of watercraft. We are excited by the opportunity to serve Sea Hunt and their customers.","We are entering 2018 with a broad portfolio of strong products and technologies. We anticipate revenue in the marine segment will increase approximately 18%, consisting of both organic growth as well as growth from our recent Navionics acquisition.","Turning next to fitness, revenue declined 7%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers, partially offset by growth in advanced variables and our children's line of activity trackers. Gross and operating margins was 55% and 19% respectively. Gross margin improved due to product mix while operating margin declined from the prior year. In 2018, we are targeting revenue to be flat in the fitness segment as growth in advance variables, cycling and children's trackers it is offset by further declines in basic activity trackers.","Looking finally at the Auto segment, revenues were down 15% for the full year as expected due to the ongoing decline in the PND market. However, our global market share remains very strong. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 9% respectively. While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories, including trucking, RV and cameras. We are focused on maximizing profits in this segment while leveraging these opportunities.","Looking at 2018, we expect revenue to decline approximately 17%, driven by the ongoing decline in the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.","In summary, we are entering 2018 with a strong product line up and we see many opportunities ahead. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year as growth in outdoor, aviation, marine is partially offset by ongoing declines in the Auto segment. We are projecting improved gross margin of approximately 58.5%, operating margin of approximately 21% and full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 19%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.05.","That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?","Doug Boessen","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results.","To move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes impacts from new revenue recognition standard. We posted revenue of $888 million for the fourth quarter, representing 3% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 56.2%, 150 basis point increase from the prior year driven by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percentage sales is 36%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $179 million, 12% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 20.2%, 160 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.73 and our pro forma EPS was $0.79.","Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of about $3.1 billion for the year, representing 2% percent increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 57.8%, a 220 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36.1%, 110 basis point increase over the prior year. Operating income was $669 million, a 7% increase over the prior year. Operating Margin was 21.7%, increase of 100 basis points from the prior year, driven by the increase in gross margin. Our GAAP EPS was $3.68 pro forma EPS was $2.94.","Next to look at the fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved double digit growth in three of our five segments, led by the Marine segment with 24%, fitness returned to growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, we achieved 2% consolidated growth led by robust growth in our outdoor segment and solid double digit growth in our Aviation and Marine segments.","Looking next to fourth quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the Outdoor, Aviation, Marine and Fitness segments contributed 78% total revenue fourth quarter 2017 compared to 74% prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 20% to 23%. Just given the chart it illustrates our profit mix by segment, the Outdoor, Aviation, Marine and Fitness segments collectively delivered 90% of operating income fourth quarter 2017 compared to 88% fourth quarter 2016. Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 36% to 41%.","Looking next to the full year charts. For the full year, the Outdoor, Aviation, Marine and Fitness segments made up 76% of total revenue compared to 71% in 2016. Seamless shift occurred in operating income with 90% of our 2017 operating income collectively coming from the Outdoor, Aviation, Marine and Fitness segments compared to 84% in 2016.","Looking next to the operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $9 million or basically flat as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and Navionics acquisition, partially offset by the additional week of expense in 2016.","Our advertising expense decreased $9 million to the prior quarter represented 6.6% of sales 130 basis point decrease. Decrease was due primarily to lower media spend in fitness segment. SG&A was up $15 million compared to prior year quarter, increased 120 basis points as a percent of sales to 14.5%. This increase was primarily due to litigation related costs and Navionics acquisition. ","Few highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $591 million due to holiday quarter to increase year-over-year due to stronger sales and the timing of cash receipts.","Inventory balance decreased sequentially to $518 million so we exit the seasonally strong fourth quarter increased year-over-year, primarily due to raw material requirements. During the fourth quarter 2017, we generated free cash flow of $144 million. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $96 million. We announced that we plan to take shareholder approval for an increased dividend beginning at June 2018 payment. Proposal with a cash dividend of $2.12 per share, $0.33 per share per quarter, 4% increase from current quarterly dividend to $0.51 per share.","For full year 2017, we reported an income tax benefit of $13 million, which includes $137 million of pro forma net discreet items relating to $180 million tax benefit related to the change in tax balance sheet accounts as a result of the Switzerland corporate tax selection, partially offset by $23 million of tax expense, resulting from a new accounting standard related to the expiration of share based awards. Excluding the pro forma discreet tax items, the full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the prior year. The increase in pro forma effective tax rate was primarily due to the Company's election to align certain Switzerland tax positions involving international tax initiatives. We expect our full year pro forma effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 19%, decrease is primarily due to U.S. tax reform.","Finally, I have to walk you through the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. We adopted new standard in first quarter 2018 were it state the prior financials. The Auto segment is the only segment impacted by the new revenue recognition standard. Impact to our 2017 financial statements is an increase in revenue of $35 million, which means we would have deferred less revenue from the new revenue standard. All 2018 guidance is calculated all for restated 2017 amounts to available in the appendix to earnings release.","This completes our formal remarks. Michelle, can you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charlie Anderson of Dougherty Markets.","Charlie Anderson","So I want to start with aviation kind of a two part question. Cliff, you mentioned environment getting a little bit better I think some of your peers have expressed a similar sentiment. So I just wonder what you\u2019re seeing, is it feel sustainable in terms of the outlook for that market. And then as it relates to ADS-B upgrades, I wonder if you view 2018 or 2019 as the peak year for you guys in terms of that contribution from those upgrades? And then I've got a follow-up on the Marine?","Cliff Pemble","In terms of the aviation environment, I think we're all seeing that it's incrementally better. Of course we\u2019re coming off a very low bottom and the numbers are somewhat smaller in terms of the overall growth. But I think most in the industry are very encouraged by that. In terms of its sustainability, I think things look good for the foreseeable future. Somebody recently commented to me though that some of these markets like aviation, marine are one economic bump away from downturn. So we have to recognize that they are somewhat fragile due to their nature. But in general, we feel good about that.","In terms of ADS-B and which year would be the peak year, we would certainly see acceleration in unit deliveries going forward. I think I would anticipate that 2019 would probably be even bigger than 2018 as people get serious about retrofitting their aircraft, but it's still somewhat early days and the number of aircrafts that have been equipped so far is still on the low side, less than half. So we're waiting to see more people step forward.","Charlie Anderson","And then as it relates to marine, I wonder how much benefit you guys got from acquisition in Q4 and then how much of the 18% growth anticipates, the inorganic portion?","Doug Boessen","So Charlie, related to the 2018 guidance we gave, we\u2019re basically expecting about half of that to come from Navionics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Doug Clark","First one on the auto segment, the 2018 guide implies an acceleration and decline. So I'm wondering if you can talk about what's driving that acceleration after a few years of what seems like moderation.","Doug Boessen","So in terms of our overall outlook in the Auto segment, I think PND is pretty much on the same trajectory that we've been on before. We did see some improvement in 2017 due to mandate categories such as ELD, which drove some of our fleet products as well as a new ELD categories. In 2018, the OEM part of our business is not expected to grow as fast as what it has been because we're seeing year-over-year comps in some of our major customers that have come on board like Honda.","Doug Clark","And then my other two questions, first on OpEx, so using your guidance it looks like implied OpEx is expected to be about $1.2 billion or up 8% year-on-year. So can you talk about the acceleration in OpEx spend? And then a financial question, I'm curious what the FX impact to fourth quarter \u201917 revenues was and what the expectation for FX benefit in 2018 is?","Doug Boessen","As it relates to OpEx for 2018, we\u2019re expecting about 8% type of increase about a third of that really is relating to Navionics, so we have had acquisition that we'll be hitting in 2018. Also looking at some of the different OpEx lines for \u201918 as it relates to advertising as percent of sales, we would expect to keep that relatively flat. And then in R&D obviously we're adding some additional headcount investments in our business and then also have some additional costs relating to new aviation manufacturing and consumer distribution facility, some additional costs related to that.","Then as it relates to FX, the FX impact on revenue for Q$ was about a tailwind of $28 million and then for the full year it was about $25 million of tailwind, primarily driven by the strength of euro.","Doug Clark","And then are you assuming any -- within your guidance for 2018, any FX impact? ","Doug Boessen","There's impact to that in the guidance, because for the average for the year I think the euro was probably about [113], it's quite a bit higher and now it is probably about $75 million of FX tailwind that's in the guidance, assuming the current type of euro rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research.","Joe Wittine","I guess, I'll ask on wearables here, so first off in the wearables portion of outdoor. Do you expect you can maintain your average selling prices in 2018 based on your product roadmap?","Cliff Pemble","So we believe so, that's in our plan. We believe this f\u0113nix line is generally very strong and we have product roadmaps that allow us to be able to bring in our newer products, such as the f\u0113nix 5 and to be able to offer some discounting on the older products, which helps to promote them and sell more volumes. So in general, we feel like the ASP situation is fairly stable.","Joe Wittine","And then I wanted to ask on availability for two new products Forerunner 645 still isn\u2019t available and then v\u00edvomove HR seems to be pretty limited. So just wondering if there is anything to note on production just given the fact that both have somewhat new Garmin technology, when we could expect those be in consumers\u2019 hands?","Cliff Pemble","So the 645 is eminent, we're making our final adjustment on some features and performance. So that should be coming very soon. With v\u00edvomove HR, we took a very conservative view of that as we launched the product based on our experience on the original Vivomove, which was more of a niche product. But we've been pleasantly surprised by the reception to the v\u00edvomove HR. So we've been chasing supply chain and trying to increase our volumes on that product as well. So we feel pretty good about that as a contributor but we've not been able to supply all the demand.","Joe Wittine","Then finally just on the same topic here, you got a very active six months of new product introductions in fitness, especially when you also include cycling on top of wearables. But looking forward on variables, I know you won't tip individual products. But is it reasonable to expect perhaps a lighter number of new announcements ahead in the spring given that momentum of announcements exiting 2017?","Cliff Pemble","I can\u2019t really comment on the timing of introductions, so we do have a very active roadmap of new wearables that are coming in 2018 and beyond. So we're still very much developing the product line and introducing new products and features.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yuuji Anderson of Morgan Stanley.","Yuuji Anderson","As depicted on pack the outdoor outlook there how much of that can you give us a better sense of how much that would be attributable to products that are yet to be launched versus products that's obviously you already have.","Cliff Pemble","Well, I think we said in our comments that the primary driver of the growth is certainly f\u0113nix as it's grown in the overall contribution to the segment. It's the single largest product category within the segment. But in terms of the details around new product contributions and such we won't comment on that.","Yuuji Anderson","And then on Fitness with the flat revenue guidance and just with the recent product launches. Is it -- assume that Fitness would decline towards the end of the year just given the timing of product launches there? Or is this going to be more scaled throughout the year?","Cliff Pemble","Well, certainly we will be competing against tougher numbers in the fourth quarter of 2018 as we anniversary the launch of quite a few new products in the advanced wearable wellness category, as well as v\u00edvomove HR and others. But in general, we anticipate that the advanced wearables will do well throughout the year and then our big headwind will be the basic trackers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Rob Spingarn","So Cliff, when we look at outdoor from a high level, is there any risk that f\u0113nix or the other components with an outdoor start to hit that maturation level that we saw in fitness? Or is it just a different type of market with less competition?","Cliff Pemble","Well, I think there's always risk in any of these consumer market, so for sure that's something that we're aware of. We believe the market though is still doing well and we believe there's opportunity for additional innovation and new products that can come to the market.","Rob Spingarn","Just when I think about the change in growth rates as we go forward, I'm just wondering if this is a similar dynamic just lagging by a couple of years.","Cliff Pemble","Well, I think, we're lapping against a very strong launch of the f\u0113nix 5, which drove significant growth during 2017. So we're looking at 2018 and trying to be realistic about the overall growth prospects there and trying to make sure that we can deliver on what we say.","Rob Spingarn","And then just on the margin guides, maybe this is for Doug. The gross margin picks up a little bit. Is that simply just because of the smaller contribution from automotive or is there -- and I think Cliff said a little bit earlier that ASPs are holding steady. But is that true from segment to segment, how do we think about that 58.5%?","Doug Boessen","The 58.5% is primarily a segment mix as you mentioned just because we're having a situation where our growth is going into some higher margin areas and then some of our declines some are lower margin areas such as the activity trackers and few of these things and maybe some puts and takes by each of those segments. But it will be relatively comparable to what we anticipate for the full year, but a big driver that is a segment mix.","Rob Spingarn","And then just you spoke to the higher operating expenses a little while ago. You did mention the facility I was going to ask you if CapEx has been a little elevated and if that continues.","Doug Boessen","S CapEx will go up a little bit we anticipate 2018 probably to about $145 million compared to the $140 million that we had in 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Ben Bollin","I wanted to start, when you look at the fitness business and the guidance there. Do you have any incremental share gain assumptions built into your guidance, following TomTom\u2019s exit of the category? And then I have a follow up.","Doug Boessen","I think TomTom's contribution was fairly low on an overall market basis, and the primary impact of that would be to Europe. So I think certainly that's in our overall view of the market but it's not necessarily moving the needle in terms of the overall guidance.","Ben Bollin","And then a couple of other items. How has tax reform in U.S. influenced any thoughts you have on the domicile and the potential to adjust that? And working capital levels little elevated relative to last couple of years. How do you think about where working capital should be or could be over the course of the next 12 months? Thank you.","Doug Boessen","Regarding U.S. tax reform, yes there\u2019s about -- as we talked about the big driver that we have in the tax rate year-over-year is the U.S. tax reform. And as it relates to where we\u2019re domiciled, currently in Switzerland. If you compare Switzerland to U.S. even after the current changes in those corporate rates, Switzerland is still is at a lower statutory in our effective rates from that standpoint. And then follow-up question, Ben, was regarding?","Ben Bollin","Working capital little elevated relative to last year where that goes from here\u2026","Doug Boessen","Working capital in 2017 primarily look in that inventory and receivables and. For '18, we would expect to see probably our inventory and receivables end of the year similar to what our growth in sales is. If you look that 2017 receivables did increase a little more than primarily due to some receipts there. So look at January receipts came back in line with some of our DSO comparisons that we have. But we would expect looking that our free cash flow for 2018, we probably would expect somewhere to be around $560 million of free cash flow, a piece of that would be some favorability due to less cash taxes due to tax reform we talked about. Also, we should see some favorability relating to working capital that you mentioned there, we shouldn\u2019t expect to see the type of increases in AR that we saw in 17 continuing through \u201818 more in line probably with our revenue increases.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Erickson of KeyBanc Capital.","Brad Erickson","Just two quick housekeeping questions to start for Doug. One, just what was the litigation expense exactly from in Marine in Q4? And then you mentioned the revenue impacts from FX. Just curious if you can give the EBIT tailwinds to Q4 and for 2018 guide from FX?","Doug Boessen","So as it relates to the litigation, we have settlement agreements there that we would not be able to disclose at the number as it relates to that settlement agreement. Then as it relates to the EBIT impact, what you have in the situation there is in Q4 you have some things go against with the strengthening of the Taiwan dollars that partially to offset that and then for the full year in that period also.","Brad Erickson","On that Marine litigation expense question, maybe another way to ask it. Where would the margins have been historically normal for Marine have the expense been removed?","Doug Boessen","Yes, to put in there, I think we would have comparable type gross margins, yes.","Brad Erickson","And then just a higher level question on the Auto OEM business. I guess for years you\u2019ve had pretty solid portfolio for that infotainment opportunity obviously with the shifts that are occurring in automotive towards data, autonomy, et cetera. How should we think about the investments you\u2019re thinking about or making in your Auto OEM portfolio as you look to get centered there over the target of I guess what we\u2019d call OEM\u2019s highest priority content objectives in the coming years? Thanks.","Doug Boessen","Certainly, the content view is changing and in terms of what goes into the automobile where we're still seeing market interest though in infotainment systems, people still -- those kinds of systems in the car. And we've seen a higher mix of software related business with what we\u2019ve talked about with Honda and Daimler as well. But looking forward, we've announced and talked about our relationship with BMW where we\u2019ll be supplying more of what's called the silver box, which is a generic computing platform in the vehicle, which can run all kinds of software stacks associated with infotainment and clusters and other things in the vehicle. So there is some evolution like that but there's still opportunity for computing in the vehicle and software.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Power of Baird. Your line is open.","Will Power","Actually just a couple of quick follow ups. So I know you talked about higher gross margins and some higher OpEx. Are there particular segments where you're seeing that the higher OpEx and perhaps lower operating margins, I guess that's question number one. And then I guess number two, within the Fitness category we've got this ongoing basic activity tracker weakness. Is that just continuation of the market trends? Is there any change in share there? And I guess I'd just be curious within the advanced section of that, what's the forerunner outlook looks likes do you continue to see growth there? Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Maybe I'll talk about the gross margins first of all. As I've mentioned, the gross margin consolidates really from a segment mix standpoint, so we're anticipating relatively comparable maybe a few puts and takes for each one of the segments that are out there. As relates to OpEx, what we'll see there is actually investment in where we have our advanced wearables, primarily in the outdoor area. Also, you have the Aviation we'll make R&D investments in there too. So given the decline that we're seeing in the auto areas hopefully we're looking at tightening up those expenses in those area. Then as relates to advertising as we looked at 2017, we actually cut back on our advertising in the fitness area related activity trackers so we'll need to look at that where we really have some of the more advanced wearable the products like the f\u0113nix.","Will Power","And then any color on the basic activity tracker market, how much of that is just ongoing market trends versus any share loss and any color on Forerunner sales?","Cliff Pemble","Our view is that most of that is really associated with the market trends that customers are moving towards more advanced wearables. And so consequently, the basic market has matured and is declining rapidly. So our share assumptions are pretty equal to what they've been in the past and the basic side we've typically said that on a global basis, roughly 10% market share as we look across the universe of what's going on around the world. In terms of impact on Forerunner that falls into our advanced category, so that's the area where we still see opportunity and we still see people moving towards the more advanced products. In the case of Forerunner, it\u2019s more technical runners but in the case of our v\u00edvoactive active line, which is GPS enabled smart watches, those are the folks that are coming off the basic trackers into a more advanced product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial. Your line is open.","Ivan Feinseth","My question is on the new scalable infotainment platform. What kind of feedback are you getting from automakers and can we expect any kind of partnership announcement soon?","Cliff Pemble","We\u2019re getting this feedback and much as the work of selling into these automakers is to demonstrate capability. And so I think the news you've been seeing from us is surrounding more of that prototyping and predevelopment work. We're getting good feedback from them but in terms of specific announcements, we can't comment on that right now.","Ivan Feinseth","But if you seem to be getting some good feedback and interest in it?","Cliff Pemble","Yes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kristine Liwag","It\u2019s Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron. There\u2019s discussion that Boeing may launch a new clean sheet middle of the market aircraft this year or next. And considering your avionics are certified now for Part 25 aircraft. Does Boeing shifting its strategy in managing its avionic supply chain provide an opportunity for you to provide content on the new middle of the market aircraft? And if so, what would you need to do and how much would you need to spend in R&D in order to be competitive?","Cliff Pemble","Well, certainly I think any opportunity around Boeing would certainly be hypothetical. I would say that our G 5000 system is as you have said Part 25 certified and we feel like it's the major building block that we need in order to be able to serve more advance applications such as regional and commercial aviation. But in terms of investing in specific opportunity like that, it would require a significant investment in order to be able to build up the other infrastructure we would need in the company to be able to serve a player like that. We're certainly prepared in it and taking steps to do that. But again, it would be driven by specific opportunities.","Kristine Liwag","And a follow-up to that and it seems like also Boeing and Embraer Air are considering a partnership. And so if you have -- and if should they consider that partnership to create any middle of the market aircraft, you've got content on Embraer aircraft already today. So does that mean that is their partnership goes ahead, is that give you a higher likelihood of gaining content on that plane? And then another follow-up would be, how much would that investment be, because you quantify the timing and possibly the size if you pursue that opportunity?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, so in terms of any hypothetical partnerships between Embraer and Boeing, I would say certainly we feel like we're well positioned, because of our experience with Embraer. As I mentioned, we've been winning consistently supplier awards with Embraer so they seem to be happy with what we're doing. But again, it's all hypothetical because I think any particular partnership on their part would consider all the factors they have in hand at that time. In terms of timing and size of investment, really not prepared to be able to comment on that. But as I said, I think there would be work to do and we're certainly able to and willing to make those investments.","Operator","There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Teri Seck for any closing remarks.","Teri Seck","Thanks, everyone. Doug and I are available if there\u2019re callbacks today. Have a great day. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"10168":["Garmin Ltd (NASDAQ:GRMN) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call February 18, 2015 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Kerri Thurston - IR","Cliff Pemble - President & CEO","Doug Boessen - CFO & Treasurer","Analysts","Tavis McCourt - Raymond James","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities","Jeremy David - Citigroup","Charlie Anderson - Dougherty & Company","James Faucette - Morgan Stanley","Will Power - Robert Baird","Operator","Welcome to the Garmin Limited Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kerri Thurston. Please go ahead.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you and good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Limited's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and the related transcript will also be available on our website.","This earnings call will include projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market share, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K, which will be filed with the SEC later today.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Cliff.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you, Kerry and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported fourth quarter revenue growth of 6%. And strong gross margin performance, which contributed to another quarter of pro forma EPS growth. Outdoor, Fitness, Aviation and Marine revenues increased 23% on a combined basis, which more than offset an 11% decline in Auto-Mobile. The non-Auto-Mobile segments represented 58% of our revenue in the holiday quarter.","Gross margins improved, year-over-year, to 54%, driven by the revenue mix shifting towards our higher-margin segments and due to the recognition of higher margin revenues that were previously deferred. Operating margin declined slightly to 22%, as we made significant investments in advertising. These investments were consistent with our strategy to grow our share in the Activity Tracker market, through higher consumer awareness and improved representation at retail.","Looking briefly at our full-year performance, we delivered four consecutive quarters of revenue growth and strong margin performance resulting in pro forma EPS growth of 18%. On a combined basis, our growth segments contributed over $1.6 billion in revenue for the year or 57% of the total and generated 69% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 56% and 24%, respectively, allowing us to generate over $3 of pro forma EPS for the first time since 2009.","This is a major accomplishment made possible by our growth initiatives and the dedication of Garmin associates around the world. For the full year, we returned over $600 million to shareholders via our quarterly dividend and share repurchase program in 2014.","Next, I'll review each of our business segments, highlighting 2014 performance, our 2015 outlook and a brief summary of long-term, strategic initiatives.","Starting first in the Fitness segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 60%. Activity Trackers led the way, but our core categories of Cycling and Running also delivered impressive results. Though competition is intense in this high growth area, our portfolio of differentiated products delivered stable gross and operating margin of 63% and 34%, respectively.","For the full year, we secured approximately 15% share in the highly competitive Activity Tracker market. We believe this is a significant accomplishment, especially considering the short time we've been in the market and it's one we can build upon in 2015 and beyond. 2015, we're targeting revenue growth of approximately 25% on top of the impressive growth of 2014.","At CES, we introduced the Vivofit 2 and the Vivoactive, expanding our family of products targeting the Activity Tracker market. The Vivoactive is a smart watch for the active consumer, combining smart alerts and daily activity tracking with key features for runners, cyclists and golfers. The Vivoactive is expandable through our connect IQ open API, which will be discussed shortly. This product won numerous awards at CES and was praised for its versatility, ultra-thin form factor and long battery life, which differentiates it from the rest of the market.","We also introduced the Vivofit 2, which features a backlit display, audible alerts and an exciting collection of band options that will appeal to a broad range of consumers. We're encouraged by the recent performance of the Fitness segment and we look forward to another exciting year of new product introductions and growth.","Looking beyond 2015, we believe that numerous opportunities exist within the fitness and wellness domain and we will continue to pursue these, as global consumers become increasingly health conscious. We will focus on delivering innovative products to the market, offering a complete experience via compelling form factors, wireless connectivity and sensors.","We will deliver a best-in-class experience to our Garmin Connect community with support for a broad range of activities, social networking, couching and partnerships, with companies like Strava and MyFitnessPal. We will expand on the essential nature of our products through third-party apps, offered via connect IQ. The screen captures depicted here illustrate a few of the unique applications being designed for our active lifestyle customers. Finally, we will target additional share in the growing Activity Tracking market by delivering industry-leading utility and form factors that meet the needs of a diverse set of consumers.","Looking next to Outdoor, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 4%. Wearables, dog tracking and training and action cameras contributed to this growth. The Outdoor segment continued to generate strong gross and operating margins in 2014 at 62% and 35%, respectively. This represented a slight decline in margins compared to 2013, due to product mix and advertising investment. However, we expect the margin profile for Outdoor to stabilize in 2015.","Exiting 2014, we recognized that the segment was not as strong as we had hoped, as we faced headwinds due to unfavorable dynamics in the golf industry, the mature nature of the handheld market and our niche status in the action camera market.","Looking at 2015, we expect growth in wearables, dog tracking and training and action cameras to be offset by declines in our traditional handheld business and ongoing negative trends industrywide in golf. Despite these trends, we're excited about recent product introductions the with fenix 3 and the epix, which were also well received at CES and we expect to introduce more new products as the year progresses.","Beyond 2015, we will focus on new opportunities in adjacent markets and product categories to further expand our addressable market as we have successfully done in the past. We will make additional investments in the growth areas of wearables and action cameras to broaden our product line and drive market share gains. We will support these initiatives with appropriate advertising and sponsorships, like the recently announced partnership with Red Bull, featuring the VIRB Elite as the official action camera of the Red Bull Air Race World Championships. In addition, we will utilize connect IQ to enhance utility and differentiate our unique product portfolio.","Turning next to Aviation, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 14%, driven by strength in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. Operating income increased 22% for the year, ahead of revenue growth, as both gross and operating margins improved. In 2014, we launched Garmin Avionics on additional Part 25 aircraft and this trend will continue in 2015.","For the 11th consecutive year, Garmin has ranked number one in Avionics product support by Professional Pilot magazine. And as many of you know, this world-class support is a key ingredient for success in the aviation market and particularly so in the demanding Part 25 aircraft category. I congratulate our team on earning this award once again, which is a testament to the amazing way in which we care for our customers.","In 2015, are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the Aviation segment, with growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. We will continue to support numerous partners in the completion of aircraft and helicopter certifications. In early January, Garmin and Gulfstream announced that Garmin will be providing the certified ADS-B solution for the G115, G150 model aircraft. We're pleased to add Gulfstream to our growing list of OEM partners.","Longer term, our Aviation growth initiatives are focused on continued development of our G3000, G5000and G5000H platforms with OEM partners, which is the foundation for long-term, market share expansion; identifying aftermarket opportunities, as well as commercial off-the-shelf opportunities within the military and government sectors that leverage our core capabilities; developing unique technologies that address gaps in our product portfolio; and, finally, capitalizing on opportunities created by the FAA's transformation of the National Airspace System and other global initiatives and mandates.","Moving next to Marine, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 11%, including our second-half acquisition of Fusion. Gross margin was steady at 52%, while operating margins improved to 11%. The pricing environment in Marine electronics remains highly competitive, which has pressured segment profitability. Despite this challenge, we posted improved operating margins and our operating profit grew 42% over the previous year.","For 2015, we're targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the Marine segment, driven by recent product introductions and the full-year contribution of Fusion. We will remain focused on gaining market share, while managing costs and driving efficiencies to improve long-term profitability. In the long term, our objectives include increasing our market share in recreational boating, with specific emphasis on opportunities in the fishing and sailing markets. We will capitalize on acquisitions made in recent years to further diversify our product portfolio.","In addition, we plan to grow our OEM market share by leveraging our full range of products including chart plotters, radar, sonar, autopilots and entertainment systems. As previously mentioned, we will execute with discipline to improve our profitability of our Marine business over the long term. And looking, finally, at the Auto-Mobile segment, revenues declined 5% for the full year, as lower PND revenues were partially offset [inaudible], growth in OEM and contributions from deferred revenue.","According to our estimates, we held approximately 45% market share in 2014 on a global basis and achieved 86% share in the fourth quarter in the U.S. market, representing yet another quarter of market share gain.","Though industry headwinds were challenging, segment margins improved, due to the contribution of deferred revenue and we generated over $215 million of operating income for the year. We secured additional OEM relationships in 2014, including the announcement with Honda on the Civic and CRV in specific geographies.","Looking at 2015, we expect the PND market to continue along its current trajectory and we also expect to recognize less, deferred revenue versus the prior year. These factors lead to a forecasted revenue decline of approximately 15%. We will focus on market share, leadership and maximizing profitability in PNDs, as we have successfully done for many years. We believe we will continue to gain momentum in the expanding infotainment market, as customers embrace increasing levels of in-dash technology and OEMs search for partners that can deliver unique value to the market.","Beyond 2015, we will focus on expanding our auto OEM business through; additional program wins; delivering innovative in-vehicle technology in both aftermarket and OEM applications; managing the profitability of the segment as the PND market continues to decline; and capitalizing on niche opportunities in areas such as motorcycle, over-the-road trucking and RV.","As you can see, we're excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2015. However, in addition to the market headwinds I've highlighted, we also face significant revenue headwinds in the near term, due to the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar. With this in mind, we're projecting revenues of approximately $2.9 billion, with stable gross margins at 56%.","We're projecting operating income of approximately $675 million, with operating margins of approximately 23%, as we continue to grow our R&D investment and manage other expenses in-line with revenues. Factoring in an anticipated, effective tax rate of 16% to 17%, 2015 pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.10, or flat, compared to 2014. Note that the FX situation negatively impacted our revenue and EPS guidance by about 300 basis points.","Given the strength of our 2014 results, we will propose an increased dividend at our upcoming annual meeting and we will participate in share repurchases as market conditions warrant. We believe these actions will result in stronger returns for our shareholders over the long term. So that concludes my remarks, Doug will now walk through our Q4 and full-year financials in more detail. Doug?","Doug Boessen","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full-year financial results, then move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statements, taxes and 2015 guidance. We posted revenue of $803 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 6% increase year-over-year, even with headwinds created by the weakening of the euro. Gross margin was strong at 54%, the 170 basis point increase from prior year driven by segment mix and favorable impact from deferred revenue.","Operating income grew by 2% to $176 million. Operating margin was 22%, a decrease of 80 basis points from the prior year. This result of gross margin favorability, with 170 basis points, helps more than offset by operating expense growth of 15% or $33 million, due to increased spending in both advertising and research and development. With a pro forma effective tax rate of 19%, adjustments for the foreign currency gain, the tax benefit from the release of material reserves, pro forma EPS was $0.77. This represents a 1% increase, year-over-year.","We shipped 5.1 million units during the quarter, up 14% from 4.5 million last year. Total Company average selling price was $157 per unit, down 7% from $169 in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to fitness product mix. Looking at full-year results, we posted revenue of $2.87 billion for the year, representing a 9% increase, year-over-year. Gross margin was strong at 56%, a 240 basis point increase from prior year, driven by segment mix and a favorable impact from deferred revenue.","Operating income increased 20% to $691 million compared to $574 million in 2013. Operating margin was 24%, an increase of 230 basis points from the prior year. This is a result of gross margin favorability of 240 basis points that was slightly offset by operating expense growth of 10% or $81 million, due to increased spending in both advertising and research and development.","For 2014 pro forma, effective tax rate was approximately 17%, which was in-line with 2013. After adjusting for the foreign currency loss, the tax impact of the inter-Company restructuring and a tax benefit from the release of material reserves, our pro forma EPS was $3.10. This represents an 18% increase, year-over-year. Units shipped were up 9% from 15.2 million units delivered during the year.","Next, we'll review how our fourth quarter revenue breaks down by segment. We experienced growth in three of our five segments, led by Fitness with a 70% growth. Looking at the charts on this page, the Auto-Mobile segment represented 42% of our total revenue during the fourth quarter of 2014, down from 49% in the prior year. Fitness grew to 25% of revenue in the current period, compared to 16% in the prior year.","These charts illustrate our profitability mix by segment. Our non-Auto segments delivered 68% of operating income in the quarter, flat to the prior-year quarter. Drilling down on year-over-year gross margin, total Company, gross margin improved to 54%, due to positive segment mix and improved margins in Auto-Mobile. Aviation and Marine posted the only sizable gross-margin declines. Both were negatively impacted by product mix, as Cliff discussed, bringing us further pressure due to competitive pricing dynamics. Total operating margin was 22%, down slightly from the prior quarter, due to increased advertising spend offsetting the strong gross-margin performance.","Looking briefly at full-year metrics, revenue contribution for 2014 shifted away from the Auto-Mobile segment, which represented 43% of our total revenue during 2014, down from 49% in the prior year. Fitness grew to 20% of revenue for the full year, compared to 14% in the prior year. We generated 69% of operating income in our non-Auto-Mobile segments during 2014.","As previously mentioned, fourth quarter operating expense increased by $33 million or 15%, while increasing 250 basis points as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $9 million, year-over-year and 50 basis points, to 12.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce by increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor.","Our advertising expense increased $19 million over the prior-year quarter and represented 6.7% of sales, a 210 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused primarily on Fitness to support new product categories. We will continue to manage advertising costs by segment, with a near-term focus on market share growth in wearables. SG&A was up $4 million compared to the prior-year quarter, decreasing 10 basis points to percent of sales, to 12.3%. We continue to manage these costs closely to get operating leverage when possible.","We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of almost $2.8 billion. Accounts receivable increased both sequentially and year-over-year, to $570 million, as a result of the higher holiday sales volume in 2014.","Our inventory balance decreased to $420 million on a sequential basis to close the fourth quarter, as we exited the stronger holiday quarter prepared for the seasonally lower first quarter. Year-over-year, we're maintaining adequate inventory levels to support new product categories and sufficient supply of raw materials.","We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business, with $127 million generated during the fourth quarter and $528 million for the full year. Our dividend and stock repurchase activity during 2014 returned over $600 million of cash to our shareholders.","Our pro forma effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2014 was 19.1%, compared to 20% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Pro forma tax rate in fourth quarter of 2014 excluded the tax benefit for material releases of reserves. The pro forma effective tax rate decline was driven by the favorable impact of the approval of a 2014 R&D tax credit, which was largely offset by unfavorable income mix by tax jurisdiction, resulting from foreign currency fluctuations, as well as reduced tax incentives in Taiwan.","There was no material change in our full-year, pro forma, effective tax rate between 2013 and 2014. We expect our full-year tax rate for 2015 to be between 16% and 17 %, relatively consistent with prior years. We announced, this morning, that we plan to seek shareholder approval for an increased dividend beginning with the June 2015, calendar quarter. The proposal is $0.51 per share, per quarter, or $2.04 annually, an increase from our current quarterly rate of $0.48 per share.","We also announced that the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $300 million of the Company's shares, as market and business conditions warrant through December 31, 2016.","Cliff reviewed our 2015 guidance, but I would like to further highlight that we anticipate growth in three segments in 2015 and expect our non-Auto segments to represent over 60% of our revenue in 2015. As highlighted in our guidance, we will continue to invest in 2015 for long-term growth opportunities across the entire business, positioning us to continue to generate significant shareholder returns.","Aaron, could you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will go first to Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis McCourt","I wonder if you could talk about the -- you mentioned deferred revenue be less of a positive impact in 2015. Talk about your expectations on the benefit of having 2014 versus what you expect in 2015? And then on Fitness, specifically, you mentioned a 25% growth rate, obviously, on top of a very big year this year. How should we think about the margins in that segment in 2015 relative to historic norms? Thanks.","Doug Boessen","This is Doug. I'll take the deferred revenue piece. In Q4, we had a benefit of about $0.04 of EPS. Now looking into 2015, we'll actually have some year-over-year headwinds, as a contribution of amortizations with deferred revenue will decline. Those deferred revenue headwinds have been factored into our 2015 percent down guidance that we gave for the Auto-Mobile segment, overall.","And looking at the Fitness margins for 2015, there will probably be some slight pressure on the gross margin due to some product mix there. But overall, for our operating margins, we hope to be relatively flat year-over-year.","Operator","And we will go next to Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn","Cliff, I wanted to go back to the guidance and understanding that FX and deferred revenue, as Doug just said, play a role here and, perhaps pressuring the guidance slightly. But otherwise, you're flattish as you mentioned earlier. And you've got for growth segments against one that's declining. Where are they -- in the growth areas, where are the greatest levers among the segments separately for revenue and margin upside?","Cliff Pemble","I think in terms of the Fitness market in general, as well is the wearable categories, is where we're looking to be able to increase in terms of mix of products with higher margins and sales growth.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And in addition to that, separate topic. But, there's quite a bit of cash building here on the balance sheet. You've got the buyback authorization and you're raising the dividend, it sounds like, about 6% or so. But, what other plans might you have for that cash?","Cliff Pemble","Well, we continue to look for opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. And of course, we do need a sizable amount of cash to run our business in terms of operating capital. So I think in terms of where we're today, we're slightly less in terms of our cash balance year-over-year and we've returned over 100% of our free cash flow in 2014 to shareholders. So we feel like we're in a good position.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then just a clarification question, I'm not even sure if this may have been addressed. But within Marine, how do we think about the Fusion contribution in those numbers? Clearly, the fourth quarter growth was higher than the year.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. Fusion will continue to add in the first half of the year, as we comp the year-over-year acquisition. But we'll flatten out. And in terms of product mix, it tends to be a lower margin contribution. But, they're very strong in terms of OEM and some aftermarket business in the entertainment side.","Robert Spingarn","So the organic growth in Marine in the quarter was closer to 10%?","Cliff Pemble","No. The organic growth is probably lower than that, as fourth quarter is typically our lowest season. But in the coming year, we expect it to have decent organic growth along with Fusion.","Operator","And we will go next to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski","I wanted just to ask you first on the deferred, again. So, I'm calculating about a $0.10 to $0.15 impact in terms of less contributions from deferred this year versus last year. Just wanted to check if that's in the ballpark of what's included in your guidance.","Doug Boessen"," Yes. It's in the guidance.","Simona Jankowski","Okay. And then, you significantly increased your advertising expense and I think you talk about that in reference to Activity Tracker as being strategic to Garmin. Cliff, can you expand on if you that's because you think that this is a very sustainable growth category going forward? Or is that just more of a network effect that you see here related to the number of users that you can get on the platform?","Cliff Pemble","Firstly, we see it as a strategic growth platform going forward and market share is definitely something that's important to gain early in the game. But in terms of our overall advertising, if you look at where we're and where we landed in 2014, our dollar spend as well as percentage of sales is pretty much back to where it was in 2010. So we feel like it's about right going into 2015 and we're going to continue to maintain that level of pressure going forward.","Simona Jankowski","And then just lastly on Outdoor, your guidance for flat revenues this year seems to imply that you're not expecting very much from the VIRB 2, recognizing that you are seeing some other categories declining. And I just wanted to dig into that a little bit. Is that because of the timing of when that product is coming out? Or just you're being conservative on the market share you think you can gain?","Cliff Pemble","I think we're overall being conservative in market share and action cameras, although we believe that our product strategy will yield some growth year-over-year this coming year. I think the main thing we're facing in Outdoor is pressure in the mature traditional market segment, as well as the industrywide trends in golf, which are a negative. But we're positive about our wearables. We're positive about our dog tracking and training as well.","Operator","And we will go next to Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brad Erickson","First, just want to come back to the VIRB 2 that was just referenced on that broader action camera market. Outside of marketing, point of sale etcetera, what do you think you need to bring more from a product perspective on this refresh in order to try and gain a better foothold in that market going forward?","Cliff Pemble","Well, I'm not going to comment specifically on our product plans. But we do believe that our product, our existing VIRB as well as future products that we'll create, will speak clearly to Garmin customer bases and the kinds of activities that our products help our customers do. So, we're really focusing more on the Garmin aspect of action cameras and how they play with our products.","Brad Erickson","And then just on the 15% market share reference in the prepared remarks around Activity Trackers, within this pretty strong growth guidance you've given around Fitness, what's the underlying assumption there for where you think you could get market share wise in fitness in 2015?","Cliff Pemble","Well, we're not prepared to put out a specific number on market share, but we're pleased with the initial market share that we've obtained in our first year in the market and we believe that we should be able to grow from that position with our product line plans that we have as well as our advertising plans.","Operator","And we will go next to Jeremy David with Citigroup.","Jeremy David","On Fitness, wanted to touch the on your GPS fitness watch business. It seems like the competition there is increasing. TomTom said on their call last week that they would double their GPS watch business revenue to \u20ac100 million in 2015 and the Fitbit Surge appears to be handling quite well, as well. So how do you think of the competitive landscape in your traditional GPS fitness watch category? And is that factored in your guidance for Fitness growth of 25% year-over-year in 2015? Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Well there is no question that there is increased competition in the running area. That's absolutely true. Keep in mind that some of these newer players are growing from a small base, so it's definitely easier to turn in large growth in the initial phases.","But we believe that our product line is solidly entrenched in the running community and we also believe that we have unique differentiators over this competition that's entering the market. So we feel good about where we stand today and we also feel good about our product roadmap for the coming year and beyond.","Jeremy David","Okay. And if I can have a follow-up on the impact of currency in your guidance, what would your revenue guidance have been if not for the lower euro? So let's say, the exchange rate stayed at \u20ac1.33. And if the euro continues to depreciate further, how much of a headwind is that for you?","Doug Boessen","Let me give you a little bit of an insight on that. So, we assumed a euro rate of \u20ac1.15 in our 2015 guidelines, our guidance. We anticipate that would probably be at a headwind of about $100 million of revenue, which translates, when you factor into the gross profit as well the expense impact of it, probably on an EPS of somewhere between $0.15 and $0.16 for the year.","Operator","And we will go next to Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company.","Charlie Anderson","I wondered if you could talk about the underlying assumptions you're making for the Activity Tracker market. I think it roughly doubled in 2014. Just in terms of the overall market, what are you thinking in 2016?","Cliff Pemble","We feel like the overall market will continue to grow at a robust rate, although probably not doubling. We think maybe in the 40% to 50% range.","Charlie Anderson","And then and this is always a struggle every year. You have products that are unannounced, you have newer products that you've announced but haven't hit yet. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the contribution of that category of products in the guidance, maybe this year versus other years?","Cliff Pemble","Well new products always account for a strong part of our overall growth strategy. We don't break it down, but we believe that our pipeline of newly introduced products combined with our existing products are going to give us strong results.","Charlie Anderson","And then last question from me. I wondered if you could talk about auto OEM. Are you expecting that to be up or down in 2015? And then just stepping back, what milestones do you feel like you need to hit to want us to continue to aggressively invest in that category?","Cliff Pemble","I think our outlook for 2015 is pretty much in-line with what we saw in 2014. We did experience growth in 2014, but we believe it will even out a little bit in 2015 as some programs roll-off and other new programs are spinning up. We believe we're making some progress, with recent wins like we talked about in the remarks. And we believe that going forward; we should have some additional wins that we'll be able to announce.","Operator","And we will go next to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","It's actually [inaudible] calling in for Ron today. Can you provide more color in the sales mix that weighed down Aviation margins of the quarter? And will this weaker sales mix continue through 2015?","Cliff Pemble","I think in the fourth quarter of this year, we experienced a different product mix than what we did last year. Last year, we were filling the channel and supporting our Partners with deliveries. And it included a lot of software components that were unusually high at that time. So this year, that was a different mix and it brought our margins down somewhat. We believe for the year in 2015, that the gross margin structure should be fairly similar to 2014.","Unidentified Analyst","And then as a follow-on, can you talk about how we should think about R&D spend in Aviation in the next few years, as you have new products getting certified and you've got market share gains?","Cliff Pemble","Well we continue to pursue new OEM platforms, as well as new aftermarket platforms. And we would expect that the R&D investment would continue to grow over the long term, roughly in-line with sales.","Operator","And we will go next to James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.","James Faucette","Just a couple of questions. One, a follow-up on Aviation. Your 10% revenue outlook for this year is a little lower than we saw in 2014 and maybe a little lower than you've talked about in the past. Just wondering if you can talk about what may be pressuring the growth rates in the Aviation? And I guess I wanted to go back, once again, on the margin question, particularly as it related to fitness. If you could just give a little more color about the reasons that you think that you will see a better gross margin and operating margin in Fitness for 2015 than we saw, at least at the latter part of 2014? Thanks a lot.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So in terms of our growth rate on Aviation, 2014 was a pretty big year. Where we had new Part 25 platforms hitting the market and those are higher-end systems. So, the growth was higher. Going into 2015 of course, we're comping against those and some of the newer platforms that we have in 2015 are in the part 23 category, which is the lower end business jet market.","So we tempered our growth a little bit from last year. I believe we said it would be initially 10% to 15% in our 2014 guidance and this year we're targeting around 10%. In terms of our Fitness margin, if I understood your question correctly, what is the possibility that the margin would be lower? And at this point, we feel like we've factored in all of the dynamics of the market, including the promotional activities that we have planned later in the year.","So we feel like with that in that in mind, as well as the product mix of new products coming into the market, that our margins should be relatively flat. Slightly pressured but overall, pretty much in-line with what we've seen.","Doug Boessen","This is Doug again. We see the gross margin, actually, probably getting pressured downward due to some of the product mix with the vivo family probably having not as high of an overall gross margin as some of the other type of purpose-driven type of products that we have. So we're seeing it probably down in 2015 compared to 2014.","James Faucette","But to be clear, you expect operating margins on Fitness to rebound back into the mid-30%s from the high 20%s that we saw in Q4?","Doug Boessen","I expect 2015 to be maybe slightly depressed compared to with 2014, just because of that gross margin pressure we have. But relatively comparable operating margins for Fitness for 2015 versus 2014.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will go next to Will Power with Robert Baird.","Will Power","I got a couple of questions. First, strong Q4 numbers of the Fitness category. I wonder if you could talk about, at least on the revenue side, I wonder if you could talk about sell-in versus sell-through, what you think you saw in Q4 there?","And then secondly, on the Marine side of the business, you talked about some the pricing pressure and that impacting margins. How should we think about the Marine margin outlook for 2015, given the pricing dynamics?","Cliff Pemble","In terms of our sell-in and sell-through in the fourth quarter, we feel like it was well matched. And we feel like coming into the first quarter, that channel inventory is adequate at the moment. So we don't see any particular concerns there. In terms of Marine, we would expect that the pricing environment that we're facing is going to continue. We do believe that with our new products that we've introduced, that we should be able to match or improve our overall operating margin and our gross margin.","Operator","And we will take a follow-up question from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis McCourt","A couple more questions that weren't asked. First, can you remind us if there is any additional cash payments over the legal restructuring happening in 2015? And how much those would be?","Doug Boessen","This is Doug Boessen. So, yes, there are some additional payments relating to inter Company restructuring that will probably be in the second quarter. And those amounts, if you remember, we had about a $307 million expense that we took for that. We paid about $78 million or so in the period and so we anticipate, probably Q2 somewhere around $185 million or so.","Tavis McCourt","And then in terms of the 15% market share stat on the Activity Tracker, Cliff, are you seeing meaningful differences by geography, or is it relatively similar? And to dovetail that into the question about in Q4, it looked like Asia-Pacific was exceptionally strong. And wondering if that was the reason or if there's other dynamics happening in that region for you?","Cliff Pemble","Well each geography has its own characteristics when it comes to this market. There are, indeed, stronger geographies when it comes to fitness tracking and we did see a very significant uptake of our products in Australia, particularly. We feel like that the U.S. market is also very good. And Europe because of its fragmented nature country by country is probably behind the others.","Tavis McCourt","And in terms of your market share by geography, is it reasonably consistent? Or is there opportunities for you to bring the share up where it may be in the better geographies for you?","Cliff Pemble","Well Europe really is -- and I was speaking in terms of the overall market dynamic. In terms of our share, it's relatively consistent with what we outlined.","Tavis McCourt","And the Asia-Pacific strength in Q4, is there anything specific of a reason for that?","Cliff Pemble","Well again, Australia has been particularly strong.","Operator","And that does conclude the question and answer portion of today's conference call. I would like to turn it back over to Kerri Thurston for any comments and closing remarks.","Kerri Thurston","Thanks everyone, for joining us today. Doug and I will be available for follow-up calls this afternoon which we have scheduled with many of you. Thanks and have a good day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

We would like to welcome you to Garmin Limited\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin\u2019s Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcript will also be available on our website.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial positions, revenues, earnings, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported first quarter consolidated revenue of $624 million, up 7% year-over-year. Our fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation segments, as a group, grew 17% year-over-year and contributed 69% of total revenues. Each of these segments has an exciting growth story, which I will cover in a moment, as a result of the strategic investments we have been making in recent years to grow and diversify our business.","Gross margin was 54.5% down year-over-year driven primarily by product mix. Operating margin declined to 16.6% due to lower gross margin and in expense structure that was up slightly from the prior year. These factors combined with a higher year-over-year effective tax rate resulted in GAAP EPS and pro forma EPS in the quarter of $0.46 and $0.49 respectively. We\u2019re maintaining the guidance issued earlier in the year as our performance thus far is consistent with our expectations.","Next I\u2019ll provide a brief snapshot into the performance of each business segments. Beginning with the fitness segment, revenue grew 9% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong growth of products with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology, running an activity tracker categories experience robust growth over the prior year somewhat offset by declines in the multisport category.","Gross and operating margins were 51% and 12% respectively. Gross margin was impacted by product mix shifting towards lower margin activity trackers while operating margin was further impacted by ongoing investments in advertising and research and development. As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, we believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the long-term opportunity in the fitness market. While the margin profile of our fitness segment has changed in recent quarters, we believe the performance will stabilize as we complete critical product in market transitions.","Our product line continues to grow and I\u2019m pleased to report that the v\u00edvoactive HR and the v\u00edvofit 3 are now shipping. I\u2019m particularly excited about the v\u00edvoactive HR which as Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology to our multi-activity GPS enabled smart tracker. The v\u00edvofit 3 has Move IQ automatic activity detection while caring forward the strength that our v\u00edvofit family is already known for such as industry-leading one-year battery life and an always on display.","With these additions, we have a strong lineup of products that offer something for every customer. To share this good news with the market, we have launched our Spring Beat Yesterday advertising campaign across multiple media outlets. I encourage everyone to look for our Beat Yesterday creative material in train stations, airports, movie theaters and of course on television.","Looking next at outdoor; revenue increased 33% year-over-year as we experienced strong demand for our outdoor wearables and dog products. The outdoor segment continued to generate strong growth in operating margins of 61% and 29% respectively and operating income grew 17% over the year ago quarter. We recently launched several golf products, which have brought new excitement to the market and additionally we have completed the acquisition of DeLorme and look forward to integrating their technology into a broad range of product categories.","Looking next at marine; revenue was up 29% over the prior year driven by strong sales of chartplotters and fish finders. Gross margin declined slightly in the quarter to 53% due to product mix while operating margin improved to 12% as we successfully leverage recent investments in the segment. Operating income grew 125% over the prior year. In recent years, we have made significant investments in our marine segment. As a result our product line is extremely strong as we enter the 2016 marine season. Our recently launched GPSMap 8400 and 8600 are the largest plotters we have offered and have strong differentiators that standout in a highly competitive market.","Another area of focus has been on improving our cartography offerings. We recently added depth contours to thousands of lakes in the U.S. and Canada, which will broaden our appeal in the inland fishing markets. We also added an exciting feature to our chartplotters that we call Quickdraw Contours, which enables users to create their own depth contours for small fishing lakes not covered by our HD maps.","Turning next to aviation; revenue grew 8% over the prior year as we experience growth in both OEM and aftermarket product lines. Gross and operating margins remain strong at 74% and 29% respectively, resulting in a 16% increase in operating income. During the quarter, we expanded our reach into organizations that own and operate large fleets. Air ambulance provider, Air Evac, chose Garmin avionics for their fleet of Bell 206 the Bell 407 helicopters. And the United States Forest Service chose our G950 integrated cockpit system for their fleet of Sherpa Aircraft that operate in a challenging role of fighting wildfires.","In recent years we have mentioned the ADS-B opportunity which is the transition to a more efficient next-generation air traffic management system. This mandated transition which must be completed by the end of 2019 requires the installation of an ADS-B transponder in every aircraft operating in designated airspace.","Garmin has been an early mover in the ADS-B market and we recently expanded our product offerings with the introduction of the GTX 335 and 345 family of ADS-B transponders. These transponders features an integrated dual ring transceiver offering best available traffic awareness at a value price. We will continue to invest in ADS-B solutions in order to make this transition simple, beneficial and cost-effective for a broad range of aircraft and customers.","We continue to support our OEM partners in the development and certification of new aircraft and helicopter platforms. While industry dynamics remain a factor market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for future growth.","So looking finally at the auto segments, revenues were down 11% for the quarter, primarily due to ongoing PND market contractions and headwinds caused by additional revenue deferrals associated with auto OEM programs. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 9%, respectively.","During the quarter we began shipping our Drive family at PND devices bringing driver systems and awareness features to the aftermarket. Additionally, we experienced strong growth in entertainment systems for the APAC region and also the Middle East.","Finally we delivered production software for the new 2017 Mercedes E-Class model. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in this segment.","So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?","Doug Boessen","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by reviewing our first quarter results then move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $624 million for the first quarter, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.5% a 430 basis point decrease from prior year driven by product mix.","Operating expense grew 2% or $4 million driven by increased spending in advertising and research and development. Operating income was $104 million. Operating margin was 16.6% a decrease of 250 basis points from the prior year. This is a result of the decline in the gross margin rate.","Pro forma effective tax rate was 18.1% in the current quarter compared to 12.3% in the prior year due to projected income mix by jurisdictions. We still anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 20.5%. The first quarter tax rate was positively impacted by the release of almost $4 million of tax reserves. Our GAAP EPS was $0.46 and pro forma EPS was $0.49. We will discuss gross margin and operating expenses in more detail later.","Next, as we look at first quarter revenue by segment. During the first quarter we experienced growth in four of our five segments led by robust double-digit growth in our Outdoor and Marine segments and high single-digit growth in our Fitness and Aviation segments. Collectively these four segments were up 17% compared to the prior year quarter.","Looking at the first quarter revenue charts on this page, the Auto segment represented 31% of our total first quarter 2016 revenue compared to 38% in the first quarter of 2015. Outdoor grew to 16% of revenue in the current period compared to 12% in the prior year while Marine grew from 11% to 13% and Fitness grew from 22% to 23%.","I can see from the charts illustrate our profitability mix by segment, outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation collectively delivered 82% for operating income in the first quarter of 2016. Fitness operating income as a percentage of the total operating income decreased from 31% to 16% while aviation increased from 24% to 29%. Outdoor increased from 21% to 27%, and Marine increased from 4% to 10%.","Drilling down, year-over-year gross margin by segment. Aviation posted a gross margin rate increase while fitness, outdoor, auto and marine posted gross margin declines due to shifts in product mix. Total corporate operating margin decreased from 19.1% in the first quarter 2015 to 16.6% in the current quarter, due to gross margin pressure and increased advertising and R&D investments. These same factors contributed to the decrease in fitness operating margin.","Looking next at operating expenses. As previously mentioned, the first quarter operating expense increased by $4 million or 2%. However, percentage of sales, operating expense decreased from 39.7% in the first quarter 2015 to 37.8% in the current quarter. Research and development increased $2 million year-over-year, but declined 80 basis points to 17.3% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation to increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor.","Our advertising expense increased $4 million for the prior quarter represented 5.2% of sales, a 40 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness investments in media.","SG&A was down $3 million compared to the prior quarter decreasing 150 basis points percent of sales to 15.3%. The lower SG&A expense which are primarily by a decrease in year-over-year litigation related costs.","Few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities are worth $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $408 million. Inventory balance increased year-over-year and sequentially to $518 million, so it grew product offerings to prepare for seasonally strong second quarter.","During the first quarter 2016 we generated free cash flow of $115 million compared to $64 million in the first quarter 2015. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million repurchased about $20 million of company stock with $140 million for remaining to purchase through December 2016.","This concludes our full remarks. Jonathan, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your question please.","Ben Bollin","Thanks for taking the call and the question. Two questions. The first one, good revenue performance on the quarter, no change to guidance. And I\u2019m curious why no adjustment given the good revenue upside and kind of the expectations that you finished the year. What happens later in the year that would contribute to that year-on-year revenue declines and then I have a follow-up?","Doug Boessen","Okay, good morning, Ben. In terms of guidance it\u2019s still very early in the year only one quarter behind us and for a long time now we\u2019ve been facing the ongoing challenge of PND market contractions. So we want to try to make sure that we adequately guide in terms of the uncertainties there as well as the other growth opportunities that offset it.","Ben Bollin","Okay. The other item when you look at the Outdoor and Fitness business, you commented you feel like the Fitness gross margin maybe starts to stabilize from here. Why is that the case and kind of what are your thoughts on the ability to stem gross margin pressures in the Outdoor business as well? Thanks.","Doug Boessen","Well in terms of Fitness, our first quarter margin was lower based on product mix and its seasonally lower quarter as well so it\u2019s most sensitive to those things. We feel like we have a strong product lineup at this moment going forward into the year. So we think that it will stabilize. In terms of Outdoor, there\u2019s really not any change there in terms of the overall product structure, market structure. So we feel like the margin there is sustainable going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Valera from Needham & Company. Your question please.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Just maybe to ask in a different way with respect to the guidance, it would appear that your revenue guidance implies perhaps meaningfully less than seasonal uptick that you\u2019ve historically seen in Q2. I\u2019m wondering, is there anything we should be aware of that might cause you to have a less than typical seasonal uptick in 2Q? Anything that was particularly strong in Q1, for instance, that might be a tough comp? Any color there would be appreciated.","Doug Boessen","Well, I think year-over-year we\u2019re going to be comping against some pretty strong products that we had last year. So that\u2019s one factor, but generally there\u2019s not anything material that changes the direction of the business.","Rich Valera","Got it. And then can you give any color on \u2013 I think you had about a month of DeLorme in outdoor. Can you give any sense of how much benefit you got from that in terms of either percentage points of growth for revenue?","Doug Boessen","DeLorme was really immaterial for the quarter. It closed really late in the quarter, so there was not much impact from DeLorme.","Rich Valera","Can you give any sense of how much impact that might have in Q2?","Doug Boessen","No. We\u2019re not breaking that out. But I think that we\u2019ll have a full quarter in Q2 and we\u2019ll be able to provide more color then.","Rich Valera","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Doug Boessen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Simona Jankowski","Hi. Thank you very much. The first one is for Cliff. Also following-up on the Fitness segment, can you talk about if you still see the growth rate for this year in the vicinity of 10%, and then where do you see gross margins stabilizing for that segment?","Cliff Pemble","Well, in terms of our outlook for the segment we guided to 10% growth which is still our outlook there. I think there\u2019s various product categories that are up and down for the year so that\u2019s in general where we see things. And could you repeat your second question, please?","Simona Jankowski","Well sure, where do you see gross margin stabilizing in the fitness segment?","Cliff Pemble","Well, I think it\u2019s really in product roadmap and the products that we have in the market, so the newer products should help us stabilize our gross margin. Our running line now is getting fully populated with wrist-based heart rate which is helping as well. So we feel like those things will contribute to stabilization.","Simona Jankowski","At the current level? Is that what you are implying?","Cliff Pemble","Well, we think that the margin levels in fitness should be somewhere in the low to mid 50s so that\u2019s about where we\u2019re targeting.","Simona Jankowski","Okay and then a couple of questions for Doug as well. First of all, what was the impact of FX in the quarter? And since the FX headwinds are now diminishing, therefore rates were to stay where they are, what would be the embedded FX impact for the full year?","Doug Boessen","Yes, so actually there was little impact of FX on a quarter-over-quarter basis when you look at the euro of last quarter 2015 versus Q1 2016 and that also you had Taiwan dollar impacting that a little bit on the gross margin. So as it relates for the full year, we\u2019re basically if we stay somewhere at that were probably just fitting little impact, [indiscernible].","Simona Jankowski","And then \u2013 thank you, Doug. And then a quick follow-up in terms of the recent treasury rules on inversions. Any impact for governments from a tax perspective?","Doug Boessen","No. We don\u2019t anticipate any impact relating to those regulations on our tax rate.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Paul Coster","Thank you for taking my questions. Couple, first of the Marine segment was very strong relative to our expectations anyway. I am just wondering from a year-over-year perspective, was there something that may contributed to the strength in terms of product cycle or inventory levels or whatever?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, I think year-over-year Paul. As I mentioned, our product line is extremely strong this year. We had products early in Q1. Our comparable last year Q1 of 2015 was quite a bit easier than what it will be in Q2, so all of those factors led to some early growth in Marine for this year.","Paul Coster","Okay. So you\u2019ve noted the gross margins were down in all segments except Aviation and attributed it to product mix. Is there some broader message though is it just kind of flukish that it happened in all segments this quarter or is it possible seeing a change in competitive landscape or consumer taste or you\u2019re going after new markets and market segments that explain this shift?","Cliff Pemble","No. We don\u2019t think so. In Marine, I mentioned there is a product mix factor there. So that\u2019s very understandable. I think Outdoor fluctuates up and down, so really no change there. Aviation is pretty steady. And automotive has been pretty steady as well.","Paul Coster","Okay, thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt from Raymond James. Your question please.","Tavis McCourt","Hey, thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ve got a couple of them. First, in the Auto segment, I guess if you could give us kind of the logic behind it, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a rebranding or new products between new V and drive and does this signal kind of maybe a bigger emphasis on some of the safety and camera features associated with the with your new PNDs?","And then in the prepared remarks and then freshly you mentioned the infotainment business in APAC and emerging markets, are these system sales or is this still turn by turn driving software sales?","And then had a question on the Fitness business. I think you indicated the activity tracker business for you was relatively strong in the quarter, which is a bit surprising to me, because I think you were kind of towards the end of a product cycle and launching a new one here in Q2. So did any of the v\u00edvofit 3 ship into the March quarter, or is that all June impact? Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Okay. Thanks, Tavis. That kind of the hitting from the top there in terms of our rebranding of the PND products. Yes, indeed, we are rebranding intentionally and we felt like n\u00fcvi has served as well over the years. But also probably doesn\u2019t recognize some of the great new features that have been brought into the product line over the years, and particularly you mentioned that the safety features we have, we have lane departure warnings, we have camera features in the product with collision warnings. So we felt like it was time to kind of recast the n\u00fcvi line into something else.","In terms of infotainment, those sales that we refer to were system sales that are done on a port install basis with automotive carmakers in APAC and also the Middle East. And then finally on Fitness, v\u00edvofit 3 has really started shifting now, so I\u2019d say Q2 impact, not a Q1 impact.","Tavis McCourt","Got you. And then a follow-up, I assumed if there was any impact from the earthquake in Taiwan, we probably would have seen it in March, but I just want to make sure of that.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. At this point it\u2019s limited. This is one of the reasons why we keep healthy levels of safety stock. And at this point we\u2019re working through that. At this moment we don\u2019t have any material impact.","Tavis McCourt","Great. Thanks, Cliff. Nice start to the year.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson from Dougherty & Company. Your question please.","Charlie Anderson","Yes. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results. I wanted to ask about Garmin Elevate. I think I heard you Cliff say that that was helpful to margin. If I think about that on a year-over-year basis with products that sold with a chest strap how does that compare and as you go through bringing that to more products how is that going to influence gross margins in both maybe Outdoor and Fitness?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So maybe to clarify on that, we went through kind of two-step process in getting to wrist heart rate. The first step was with a third-party solution with our Forerunner 225 and then we transitioned to our Garmin solution after that on our Forerunner 235 and Fenix3 HR.","In terms of margin structure, certainly the wrist-based heart rate products are lowest margin structure than our chest base. But at the same time, our Elevate technology is much higher margin structure than when we were using a third-party. So it is improving from where we were in that interim step, but not necessarily compared to the chest-based solutions of the past.","Charlie Anderson","And then just a quick follow-up. I wonder if you guys saw any sell-through data from any one on Marine and on Outdoor and how that matched up with the sell-through rates you reported in Q1?","Cliff Pemble","I think those markets are fairly niched and retailers don\u2019t carry a lot of inventory. So the sell-through has been fairly robust. There\u2019s been a lot of spring promotions around the some of the Marine products and it\u2019s been doing very well in channels like VesPRO and Cabela\u2019s.","Charlie Anderson","Thanks so much.","Cliff Pemble","All right. Thank you, Charlie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Power from Robert Baird. Your question please.","Will Power","Great, thanks. Yes, just I\u2019m curious on back on the Fitness side. As you look at the year-over-year growth and key drivers, qualitatively any color around U.S. growth versus what you\u2019re seeing internationally and perhaps product mix across geographies there?","Cliff Pemble","I think we\u2019re actually seeing very good results in the European region. In terms of the market development there, Europe is probably behind that of the U.S. So there\u2019s a growing market there and players are establishing themselves including Garmin. We\u2019ve also seen strong uptick of wearables in APAC including both Fitness based wearables as well as Outdoor based wearables.","Will Power","Okay. And did the U.S. still grow year-over-year within Fitness any color there?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, definitely the U.S. is still growing. No question about that, but it\u2019s a more mature market than those other regions.","Will Power","Okay. And then just on the Outdoor segment, you referenced both Fenix and Golf I guess improving, I guess just how would you characterize I guess the key pieces or key drivers of the growth there I mean, is it evenly balanced or is there something there that driving an outsize benefit?","Cliff Pemble","Well, I think two things in Outdoor that really drove the growth was Fenix line and also dog products. Those are the two major drivers. There was some incremental contribution by Golf but the other two were really the major contributors. Fenix has been strong in recent quarters and over 2015 we\u2019re going to now start to comp against those strong results in Q2, Q3 and Q4 with Fenix. So we\u2019re going to have to navigate that in terms of comparables but so far the product has been very strong, especially since we\u2019ve added wrist-based heart rate to it.","Will Power","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Eugene Anderson","Hi. This is Eugene Anderson on for James. I think most of my questions were answered. But I was hoping on Aviation, perhaps if you could give a little bit more color on the different geographies and what are you seeing in terms of OEM versus retrofit as you go region to region and I guess it will be helpful to just get your perspective on the strength of order activity generally versus everything that we\u2019re hearing in the macro environment.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. I think we still see challenges in Aviation like we noted in the remarks. Some of the underlying factors that have slowed the market recently are still there. But for us, new platforms have been a big driver of the success and we\u2019re seeing some incremental increase in revenues in the retrofit side too, especially in ADS-B products.","Operator","Does that answer your question?","Eugene Anderson","Yes. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson from Pacific Crest Securities. Your question please.","Brad Erickson","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just on the Fitness segment. When you split between the activity trackers versus the running watches, where are you looking for stronger growth this year between those two products that\u2019s within Fitness.","Doug Boessen","I think we\u2019re looking for strong growth really in both of those categories and that\u2019s what we experienced in Q1.","Brad Erickson","So fair to say roughly equal from a growth rate perspective?","Doug Boessen","That\u2019s been what we have been experiencing, yes.","Brad Erickson","That\u2019s helpful. And then ultimately, how do you think about the size of these new the emerging geographies you talk about for fitness where you\u2019re seeing sort of higher growth? How do think about the ultimate size of those markets relative to what you\u2019ve found in terms of a TAM here in the U.S. for fitness?","Cliff Pemble","I think theoretically the size of those markets is really driven by population and especially population that\u2019s interested in health and fitness. I would say generally Europe should match that profile pretty well.","I think in APAC of course, there\u2019s a lot of population that maybe not yet the kind of lifestyle or health focus that what you have in the U.S. and in Europe markets. So, nevertheless I think there\u2019s still good uptick of fitness products in APAC. I think they\u2019re very interested in running products as well as fitness and multisport products.","Brad Erickson","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I would like to hand the program back to Teri Seck for any further remarks.","Teri Seck","Thanks, everyone. Doug and I will be available for any follow-up calls later today. Thanks. Have a good day. Bye.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",""],"10029":["Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) Q2 2014 Earnings Call July 30, 2014 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Kerri Thurston - Director of Investor Relations","Clifton A.

Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kerri Thurston. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd.'s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.","Please note that the earnings press release and the related slides are available on Garmin's IR site at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and the related transcript will also be available there.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market share, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and CEO; and Kevin Rauckman, CFO and Treasurer. Also joining us today is Doug Boessen, who will become CFO tomorrow. Doug has been with us since June 2, allowing for a smooth transition to date. In addition, Kevin is committed to providing ongoing support as needed throughout 2014. Doug and I will be traveling periodically throughout the remainder of the year, providing him the opportunity to meet many of you.","At this time, I'll turn the call over Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble","Thanks, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported a second consecutive quarter of strong performance, with growth in revenue, operating income and pro forma EPS. Consolidated revenues increased 12% year-over-year, with aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor contributing 55% of total sales and 66% of the operating profit in the quarter.","Gross margins improved to 57% from 55% in the prior year due to the amortization of previously deferred revenue and improved segment mix. Operating margins were 28%, an increase from 24% in the prior year. This resulted in operating income growth of 29% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $1.02 of pro forma EPS in the quarter, representing an increase of 34% over 2013.","Before discussing segment results, I wanted to briefly mention the subsequent event that we announced this morning. Our board has approved an intercompany restructuring transaction that will result in greater access to historical earnings and will allow us to efficiently repatriate future earnings to fund dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. This restructuring will trigger onetime payments covering taxes on intercompany transactions and withholding taxes as we repatriate a portion of our cash through our Swiss parent company. Kevin will provide more context in his remarks.","Looking first at the fitness segment. Revenue grew 79% on a year-over-year basis, with growth driven by new products across multiple fitness categories. We delivered gross and operating margins of 65% and 42%, respectively. This generated operating income growth of 112% in the quarter as operating margins expanded by over 650 basis points due to strong sales.","We have a host of new products that are performing well across a variety of categories and price points. This includes v\u00edvofit, which has had a strong start in the rapidly growing activity tracking category. In the running category, the Forerunner 15, 220 and 620 are all contributing to strong growth. In the cycling category, the Edge Touring, Edge 1000 and Vector are the primary growth drivers.","The diversity of features, form factors and price points that are driving growth affirms our strategy of innovating across a broad portfolio of offerings. With that in mind, we continue to invest aggressively in fitness R&D, with the commitment to explore, develop and deliver superior products and services that our customers desire.","In aviation, we posted revenue growth of 11%, driven primarily by new and existing OEM relationships. Gross and operating margins improved to 74% and 29%, respectively, due to positive sales mix and improved operating margin leverage. Operating income grew 38% in the quarter, ahead of revenue growth due to the margin improvement.","I'd like to highlight that the business jet shown on this slide is the recently certified Citation X+ with the Garmin G5000 integrated flight deck. Cessna began deliveries of this aircraft in the second quarter, and we are pleased to be the avionics provider for the fastest civilian aircraft available in the market today. As we continue into the back half of 2014, we will focus on a number of additional certifications. These include the Cessna CJ3+ and Alpine Edition CJ2+, which are expected to be certified in 2014.","Longer term, we see new revenue contribution from the Cessna Latitude, the Bell 505 and the Bell 525. These are complex projects that necessitate a high level of R&D investment. And finally, I think it's important to note that we continue to face a challenging environment in the small business jet industry. Despite soft market conditions, our innovative products and market share gains have allowed us to deliver ongoing growth.","Turning next to marine. Revenue grew 1% in the quarter due to the strong comparable from the second quarter of 2013. While we didn't achieve significant revenue growth, strong gross and operating margin improvement driven by new products allowed us to deliver 23% operating income growth.","As announced previously, we completed the acquisition of Fusion Electronics in the third quarter. Fusion broadens our product portfolio, generating additional synergies for our customers in both OEM and aftermarket applications. We continue to face weak market conditions that are slowing the growth trajectory of our products. Long term, we believe there is upside potential for the industry, and we will be well positioned when the market improves.","Turning next to outdoor. Revenues declined 1% in the quarter compared to the strong performance in the second quarter of 2013. In addition, gross and operating margins declined in the quarter due to inventory reserves and increased advertising associated with our action cameras. During the quarter, we introduced the Approach S6 for the golf enthusiast. This new golf watch delivers unique metrics and training features, such as swing tempo and swing strength. We expect this product to be well received by the golf community.","Finally, in outdoor, I wanted to mention that we are reducing our full year revenue guidance. This is the only segment in which we do not expect to meet or exceed our original forecast given at the beginning of the year. The change has been necessitated by slower-than-expected uptake of our VIRB action cameras. While our initial entry into the action camera market delivered less than we expected, we remain committed to growing our market share through advertising, improved retail presence and ongoing product innovation.","In the auto\/mobile segment, revenues increased 2% in the quarter as PND volumes declined less than expected and were offset by amortization of previously deferred revenue and growing OEM revenues. In addition, gross and operating margins remained strong at 48% and 21%, respectively, leading to a highly profitable segment in which we continue to build market share. As we've mentioned before, we expect the PND market to continue to decline at a rate of approximately 15% to 20% on a global basis, consistent with the guidance we issued at the beginning of the year. While we're not prepared to change this outlook, we are encouraged by market trends in some geographies. We will continue to manage the category appropriately to maximize long-term profits.","Finally, having passed the halfway point for 2014, we're updating our full year guidance. In light of our solid performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing our revenue range to $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion, representing full year revenue growth in the mid to high-single digits. We've raised our margin expectations for both gross and operating margins based on the positive segment mix and leverage of our operating expenses. We also anticipate a reduction in our pro forma tax rate due primarily to a more favorable mix by tax jurisdiction. As a result, we are increasing our pro forma EPS guidance to $2.95 to $3.05, representing full year growth in the mid-teens.","So before wrapping up my comments, I want to note that this is Kevin's last conference call as the CFO of Garmin. We've communicated in the past that Doug Boessen will assume CFO role tomorrow, but Kevin will be onboard throughout the remainder of the year to assist with the transition. I want to thank Kevin again for all of the many contributions he has made to Garmin over the years. All of our stakeholders, our customers, employees, our suppliers and shareholders have been positively impacted by Kevin's contributions. So Kevin, we will miss you, but we always -- also wish you well as you move on to the next phase in your journey.","So with that, that concludes my remarks. Next, Kevin will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Kevin?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, thanks, Cliff, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our financial results then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and then cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $778 million for the quarter, with pro forma net income of $200 million. Our pro forma EPS was $1.02 per share, excluding the $20 million foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 12% year-over-year, as previously highlighted by Cliff.","Gross margin was strong at 57%, a 210-basis-point increase from prior year, driven by favorable segment mix and amortization of previously deferred revenues. Our operating margin was 28%, an increase of 370 basis points from the prior year. This is the result of the gross margin favorability of 210 basis points, as well as operating expense favorability of 160 basis points, though total operating expenses increased by $12 million or 6%. Our effective tax rate decreased to 12.8%, leading to pro forma EPS, which is adjusted for the foreign currency loss of $1.02 per share, representing a 34% increase year-over-year.","We shipped 3.8 million units during the quarter, up 6% from 3.6 million last year, and our total company average selling price was $203 per unit, up 6% from $192 in Q2 2013, driven primarily by segment mix and reduced revenue deferrals. Overall, our revenue and EPS performance exceeded expectations for the quarter.","Next, you can see how our second quarter revenue breaks down by segment. We experienced growth in 4 of our 5 segments, with fitness and aviation leading the way. I'd like to highlight the charts on this page, which illustrate the auto\/mobile segment, representing 45% of our total revenue during Q2 2014, down from 50% in the prior year. Fitness grew to 19% of revenues in the current period compared to 12% in the prior year. These charts illustrate our profitability mix by segment, with our non-auto\/mobile segments delivering 66% of our operating income in the quarter, up from 63% in the prior year.","Looking next at year-over-year gross margin changes by segment. Our auto\/mobile gross margin increased to 48% from 45% in the prior year due primarily to amortization of high-margin deferred revenues. In addition, we posted gross margin improvement in marine and aviation. Our marine margin improvement was primarily related to product mix shifting towards new products and increased ASP. Aviation marine -- aviation margin improvement was primarily due to increased software sales. And our fitness margin was stable at 65% in the quarter. Outdoor gross margin declined to 61%, driven primarily by inventory reserves.","Our total operating margin improved to 28% due to the increased gross margin and revenue growth outpacing the 6% growth of operating expense, which I'll highlight next. As previously mentioned, Q2 operating expense increased by $12 million or 6% on a year-over-year basis in Q2, while decreasing 160 basis points as a percentage of sales. R&D increased $2 million year-over-year while declining 120 basis points to 12.7% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce with increasing resources focused on compelling new aviation, fitness and outdoor products.","Our advertising spend increased $5 million over the year-ago quarter and represented 4.5% of sales, a 30-basis-point increase. The additional spending was focused in fitness and outdoor to support new product categories. And we will continue to manage operating expenses by segment to match the market opportunities presented by our diverse products. SG&A was up $4 million compared to the year-ago quarter, decreasing 80 basis points as a percentage of sales to 11.9%. We continue to manage these costs to align with the changing dynamics of our business.","Next, moving to balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.8 billion. Accounts receivable increased year-over-year and sequentially to $497 million due to our double-digit revenue growth. Our inventory balance decreased to $430 million on a sequential basis as we reduced inventory slightly exiting the seasonally strong second quarter, yet we maintain inventory levels large enough to support key new product categories. We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $164 million during Q2 and CapEx was $21 million. Our free cash flow generation was $143 million in the quarter.","We also repurchased $129 million of company stock during Q2 and still have $79 million authorized to repurchase through the remainder of 2014. Our effective tax rate for Q2 2014 was 12.8% compared to 16.5% in Q2 of 2013. The decreased rate was primarily driven by favorable income mix by taxing jurisdiction, partially offset by reduced by Taiwan tax incentives and the expired R&D credit. We now expect our full year rate to be 15.2%.","Regarding restructuring, Cliff briefly touched on our intention to move certain U.S. subsidiaries out from underneath our Taiwan subsidiary. This restructuring will occur in the third quarter, resulting in cash tax payments of approximately $300 million over the next 12 months. We're performing this restructuring to allow for 2 primary benefits. First, it will allow us to repatriate some of our existing cash that's been permanently reinvested. Secondly, it will allow us to repatriate future U.S. earnings to our Swiss parent at a rate that does not negatively affect our effective tax rate.","And finally, as Cliff mentioned, we're updating our full year 2014 guidance, given current trends across our segments. Cliff reviewed the total company guidance. So here, we provide additional detail on revenue by segment. At a high level, we have increased our expectations for auto\/mobile and fitness, while outdoor expectations have been reduced and marine and aviation are unchanged. The improvement in auto\/mobile is a result of better-than-expected industry volumes in the first half, as well as improved auto OEM revenues. Business revenue guidance is being raised due to the continued strength we are seeing across our product portfolio, but particularly with the v\u00edvofit activity tracker. Offsetting these positive trends, we've reduced our outdoor forecast due primarily to VIRB underperforming our expectations to date.","This concludes our formal remarks. We now will move to a period of Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","First question, on the -- Kevin, we'll miss you. In terms of the questions, first, on the restructuring and the repatriation, you have a lot of cash that's sitting on the balance sheet where you can get to it. It's just been piling up. What is the motivation for restructuring now and trying to get, I guess, the incremental $750 million back to where you can use it?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. Thanks, Yair, for the positive comments. I think the key point on the restructuring in terms of now is we've accumulated a sizable amount of cash in the U.S. that just cannot be efficiently repatriated. So we've commented on the fact that this transaction really allows us to take care of that problem in the future, and it gives us the flexibility to have additional cash, as we said, for dividends, buybacks and acquisitions. And the other point here, as I said, if we didn't do something in terms of a transaction, this problem would continue to grow. So as our cash accumulates, so does the cost of moving or repatriating that cash up to our parent company.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Does this, in any way, signal a willingness on your part to return cash more expeditiously to investors?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think it really just gives us, again, flexibility. We're not prepared to talk about any other increases at this time. But as you've heard from us in the past, we have consistently grown the dividend. We've been more aggressive recently on the buyback, and this just gives us, again, added flexibility.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. On the automotive piece of the business, it looks like maybe PND volumes were down mid-single digits in the quarter compared to the 15% or 20% that you've guided for the year. Why do you think the quarter shook out differently? Was there channel inventory building? Did you gain share? Have you seen anything in the end markets that suggest that maybe the market is stabilizing faster than you expected?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yair, this is Cliff. The market itself has performed pretty much as we had predicted, so there's really no change in dynamics there. We have gained some market share, particularly in North America, which has helped offset some of that. But our volumes are down more than what the revenue implies. The performance beat in the overall category is due to growth in OEM revenues, which were healthy, as well as the effective deferred revenue on the margins and the revenue.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, just a couple more questions on the tax restructuring. First, I know you said that this year it's going to be 15.2%. But does this, in any way, impact your tax rate on the operations on a go-forward basis in '16 and beyond?","Kevin S. Rauckman","No. We're expecting that, go forward, we would be neutral, if not better, on the overall tax rate as we go forward both into 2015 and 2016. So that's another benefit. To be able to do this restructuring right now at this point is to allow us to have some benefit in the future.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just to clarify, is that neutral to better than the 15.2% or on the 17%, I think, previously?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. I think we haven't given or don't plan to give guidance in the future, at this point, but it should be on the lower number.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then, does this, in any way, change the restrictions around your ability to repurchase shares, i.e. can you possibly bring the ownership stake of the founders above that 45% that you've typically been comfortable staying below?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. It really doesn't change that because that's a consistent law that's there in terms of the -- what you call the CFC rules, so it's 10% U.S. shareholders. So that still is in place. But I think, again, we've been more aggressive in recent quarters to go ahead and buy back just due to the fact that we have some overhead there to be able to give us some flexibility to buyback.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And just last question, pretty specific. On the inventory reserve for the action camera, do you have an amount on that and\/or what the impact was on the operating margin in outdoor for the quarter?","Kevin S. Rauckman","We would just say our overall gross margins in outdoor were a little bit below last year, and the primary reason is because of the inventory reserves. So it would have been more in line with what we've seen in the past on the reserves that we put in place.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe check on -- firstly, on fitness. If you can give us a sense of the sustainability of gross margins in this segment, considering that the competition seems to be intensifying as we look at what is becoming a very crowded segment for the back half. And then in outdoor, we understand that VIRB is not doing well, but it wasn't a meaningful part of revenue. So is there anything else weighing on the segment on a year-over-year basis?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I'll first address the margin sustainability on the fitness side. We've been very pleased with the fact that we're in the mid-60s on gross margin on our fitness business. And if you look at a typical seasonality, not just on fitness, but across our business, we're expecting to have some decline in gross margin as we go through the holiday selling season. So we do special promotions and pricing activity with our key retail customers, and we're expecting to do that with the fitness business as we go through Q4.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the outdoor segment, maybe just on what's -- what else can be done there. And I think, if I look at the action camera market, will advertising be enough to drive growth there? Is the product competitive enough? Do you have a sense of maybe the price elasticity of the demand for action cameras? And are there other things that you can do to stimulate demand?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. Mark, in terms of outdoor, there's a lot of moving pieces there. Some of the traditional segments of the market are mature and have been in some slight decline in recent years. So there's some pressure there. We also had a very strong comparable last year, particularly in the golf area, as there was a lot of promotional activity around the S1 watch. So we have been tracking softer in the golf category because of the heavy promotions from last year. In terms of the action camera market, we've noted before and everybody realizes that it's a market with an entrenched competitor, so definitely, we view this as a marathon activity as opposed to a sprint. We believe it will take some time, focusing on both product innovation and also increasing our level of advertising promotions and in-store exposures so that we can build share over time.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Kevin, in capital returns, you already have 100% of your free cash flow committed to dividends and share repurchases. Does the restructuring give you some thought of maybe doing a big ASR? Maybe, Kevin, that will be a great going-away present for investors.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Mark, you're funny. That's good. I think, again, we would not commit to anything specific. In terms of a dividend, the board takes an action on that once a year, so you would expect to hear from us as we close out 2014 and get into 2015 in terms of what our future dividend is. I did say that we've been more aggressive on the buyback, and I think we could continue to give back to shareholders through that means. And then, finally, I mean, we've talked about acquisitions, but this does free up some additional cash at the parent company that will allow us to be a little bit more open to buying back companies -- or excuse me, buying companies as we go forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to first clarify that the inventory write-down you took in outdoor was just specific to the VIRB. And then, another question on that product was, if you can update us on where you are in building out the channel there. I think it initially started with more of a focus on big-box retailers in the online channel, but was curious how far you are at this point in terms of expanding into outlets like ski shops or surf shops, where you haven't had much of a presence historically.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, first of all, on the inventory reserve, yes, it was exclusively for the VIRB, just given our reduced forecast for the year. And then, I'll let Cliff answer on the outdoor market.","Clifton A. Pemble","We're still continuing to build out the retail channel in VIRB and specifically focusing on increasing our presence at the retail level, both at big-box stores, as well as specialty stores where we're very strong.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then a question on the fitness segment. Can you comment on how much of the strength in the quarter for v\u00edvofit specifically was due to channel fill versus sell-through? And any visibility you have into channel inventory levels would be helpful as well.","Clifton A. Pemble","There was still some sell-in taking place in early second quarter. But as we close the quarter, we feel very comfortable with where the inventory in the channel sits, and we feel like the reorders are where we expected them to be at this time. We -- like any kind of consumer category, we expect that the back half of the year is where a lot of the volume will be driven, so we're preparing for that.","Kevin S. Rauckman","I also wanted just to quickly point out, in the fitness market, while the v\u00edvofit has done well both in sell-in and sell-through, our other fitness categories, both running and cycling, delivered part of that growth as well. So it wasn't just a one-product strength. We've seen strength pretty much across the entire fitness segment.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just one last question on the PND segment. I wanted to see if you can comment just more broadly, if you have a view on why the market as a whole has been doing a little better than expected initially. And also, just on the modeling side, what was the contribution of deferred to your EPS in the quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think, Simona, the market really, we view, is performing largely in line with what we had predicted. We're still going through a period of secular declines. Some geographies are doing better than others, and we're performing better in some cases because of market share gains. So we really don't view it as a significant trend change. In terms of effective -- of EPS, we believe there's about $0.07 on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","We'll go next to Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just as a follow-up to that question around the PND side. You've said that some geographies are doing better than others. I mean, is this a reference to the European declines slowing? Or in terms of this quarter, you're seeing some improvement in some geographies relative to others?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think, in Europe, it's true that some countries have been performing better than others on average. And we really don't see a significant change in that trend, but there are still some areas, particularly areas within Europe as well as North America, where the declines are still more steep than the average.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then, in terms of the marine business, how should we be thinking about sort of performance in the back half of the year? I know it's typically a little bit more of a first half of a -- typical product seasonality. Can you maybe give us a sense of what your thoughts are there in terms of the growth drivers?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think our new products will still be the primary growth driver into the back half of the year. There will be some promotional activities going on in the back half towards Christmas. And also, OEM customers tend to start ramping up their product lines midyear, leading up to the end of the year.","Kevin S. Rauckman","And as Cliff and I both talked about, Fusion is a part of our marine growth in the back half of the year, too, so the acquisition that just closed at the end of June. And we expect to get some revenues as we conclude the year this year.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just the last one for me is -- you guys talked about sort of the intensifying competition in fitness. How much have you sort of factored that into guidance? I mean, are you operating under the assumption that things get more competitive, about the same level as what they are today? I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about that relative to guidance.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we absolutely feel like there'll be increased competition into the back half of the year. The activity tracking market in particular is very competitive. We expect existing competitors to introduce new products, and expect new competitors to come on the market. So that is factored into our overall outlook.","Operator","We'll go next to Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","My best wishes, Kevin, and welcome, Doug. So I wanted to start with geographic mix. So I noticed that you had a lot of growth in APAC and Europe in the quarter, and I think that influenced the tax rate. Can you talk maybe a little bit about how you're building distribution for some of these new categories? And is that influencing the growth to a great degree that you're entering some geographies where you weren't before with products where you weren't there before?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think it's mostly around just the overall market performance in those areas. Keep in mind that APAC is where a significant amount of our OEM revenues are recognized, so as a result, some of that growth is due to that. And we are doing better in places like China as well, which is driving some growth. But Europe is just generally doing better than what it's done in the past few years. And particularly in our outdoor and fitness areas, Europe has delivered good growth for us.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","And the second question for me is on v\u00edvofit. I wonder if you can maybe give us a flavor of where you are today in terms of distribution, maybe in sort of door count. You don't have to give me a number, but just to compare where you are today versus where you expect to be by the end of the year.","Clifton A. Pemble","We feel like we're very well positioned, where we had hoped to be at the beginning of the year. We feel like we have almost every major big-box and specialty retailer committed to the product line in the category. So at this point, I feel like we've accomplished what we set out to do.","Operator","We'll go next to John Bright with Avondale Partners.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Cliff, let me follow up on that last question regarding the v\u00edvofit. If you felt like you're -- you've accomplished what you wanted to do, we've changed guidance. And I think, largely related to the VIRB -- if I said v\u00edvofit, I apologize saying it, largely related to VIRB. Maybe you can talk about -- I don't think you'll probably talk about your own competitive shortcomings. Maybe you can talk about what your competitor is doing well, albeit very early in this market entry.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. I think the last question was about v\u00edvofit, so I think my comments were around what we set out to do in v\u00edvofit we have accomplished. I think we've been very transparent about the fact that we have not met our expectations on VIRB. And I think the reasons for that are well known. We believe we have a superior product with great technical features, very competitive, and customers that are picking up the product really love and appreciate what it does. But it is a market that has a very strongly entrenched competitor, and in any situation like that, it is challenging to capture market share. So we know that's the position we're in, and that's what we've been saying.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","My mistake, pardon me. The OEM contribution in the PND segment this quarter, how meaningful?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think, we never give specific numbers on the subsegments, but it was double-digit growth. And that was a nice increase for us during Q2.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I know this question was somewhat asked a second ago, but I want to try it a different way, Kevin. Is there any -- I guess, people are trying to get at why now on the restructuring plan?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, let me try to reemphasize the fact that we needed to be able to move cash to the parent company, and the cost of doing a transaction, whether it's today or a year in the future or 2 years in the future, was going to continue to grow. And this, again, gives us the ability to kind of correct the one inefficiency in our structure that we've had actually since we created the company in 1989. So this has existed from the very beginning. We've always been a foreign-owned company with global businesses around the world. And this just takes, again, the one inefficiency out of the equation and gives us the ability to move forward much more effectively on repatriating earnings.","Operator","We'll go next to James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Before I forget, thanks a lot for all your work, Kevin. Good luck. Just a quick question on auto and PNDs. Cliff, you talked about that PNDs had performed a bit better or basically in line, at least from a unit perspective, with your outlook, but autos have been better. Can you give a little color what's going on in the in-dash market relative to your expectations? Is the mix better? Or are you seeing higher attach rates? Just looking for a little color on kind of what's helping things go better in that segment than expected.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we're seeing growth across a number of product categories that we offer in OEMs. We have a very strong relationship with BMW on the motorcycle side. That has contributed to growth. We have a relationship with VW that has been driving growth in that particular car segment. And we're also seeing increases from both our relationships with Chrysler, as well as Suzuki, and then, finally, new deliveries with Daimler.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And so relative to your expectations and planning though, is -- are you seeing better volumes from any of the -- from those or -- I mean, in terms of absolute numbers? Or is it the attach rate within those that's going better?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we've seen better performance in some of those customer accounts than what we expected, although we would expect that, that will probably level out towards the back half of the year. So some of our growth projections we've done internally in the -- in this particular category were front-half loaded.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, just a couple of housekeeping questions. First, on the lower tax rate that you're anticipating for the full year. I guess it's been implied, but I just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly. That -- is this primarily the result of a greater percentage of revenue and earnings coming from overseas, firstly? And secondly, do you anticipate that, that kind of geographic mix will persist?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. Actually, it's a couple of things. It is the fact that our European and Asia Pacific businesses did well. It's also the specific segments that we see growth in. So I think you know, James, that our aviation business is actually owned in the U.S. company, and all of our consumer products are owned, from a technology perspective, outside the U.S. And so when we have businesses like fitness do very well, most of those profits come out a little bit lower tax rate than our average tax rate on the company. And that's what drives down the rate, it's when we have strong performance in those segments.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. That's really helpful, Kevin. And kind of last question, the tax payment of $300 million roughly, can you give us an idea of expected timing of that payment, first? And second, is that -- are you treating that tax payment as kind of a onetime event? And hence, is that excluded from your EPS guidance and outlook?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, absolutely. We'll be -- we'll give more detail in our third quarter because we are expecting this transaction to be posted to our third quarter earnings. It is onetime in nature, and we will pro forma that onetime tax payment out, as we go through the next year. So part of the tax will be paid in -- I'll just confirm, part of the tax will be paid in 2014, but a large piece will also be paid in 2015 as well.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And I know I promised that's the last question, but this is really my last, last question. Is the -- you mentioned that you have $79 million in buyback authorization remaining. Can you remind us, can that be -- can a new authorization amount be introduced or that increased, really, any time? Or does that need to happen in a board meeting kind of once a year, similar to dividends?","Kevin S. Rauckman","So we've always -- in the last several years, we always had an authorized buyback plan in place. So if we were to burn through the $79 million, I think you would expect that our board would approve another plan, but it will always have that flexibility to buy back in market -- as market conditions allow us to.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But in terms of timing, you can do that kind of whenever you see fit?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. We don't have to -- there's no timing constraint there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Kevin, I wish you best of luck. Two questions. First, I think you may have answered this a bit, but in relation to the OEM business, so a lot of the growth this year is front-end loaded. But should we think about that portion of auto\/mobile as it leads to the point now where it's kind of consistent year-over-year growth, do you have that much visibility, and just a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter? Or could we still see years that are flat to down based on wins or losses? And then within that auto\/mobile segment, can you at least comment on what you think the global PND sell-through trend was in Q2, roughly? Is that still in the down 15%, 20%? Or do you think that has improved as well? And then, final question. In the press release, Cliff, you mentioned, in the second half of the year, increased advertising to support new product categories. Just wanted to confirm that -- whether or not that was new product categories that already exist but are new in the last year or if we should expect new product categories that have not been launched yet for launch later this year?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. So we'll try to tackle all the questions there. In terms of the OEM outlook, we're not prepared to give guidance in that particular subsegment. But I would say that it is a smaller percentage of revenues in the overall auto\/mobile category. And consequently, even though it can perform well, it's probably not going to move the needle without some help from other areas, which is what we've talked about with the deferred revenue piece. The deferred revenue piece, we've kind of reached a point where it has had a maximum contribution there, and going forward, that will change because of the way that we've deferred revenue over the past 3 to 5 years. So the segment itself could again turn negative. We would probably expect that as the PND volumes continue to decline. In terms of the global trends, again, I think our outlook there is that the market would be down in the 17% to 20% range, and that's consistent with the underlying trends we see in our business when you strip out the effects of the added market share gains that we've had. And finally, in terms of increased advertising, we're planning to promote heavily our already announced products in the market this coming fall, so that is primarily where we're focusing our energy. In terms of new things, we always have new things that we're doing. We're not prepared to talk about those right now, but we do have a pipeline of innovation that we're cultivating and will result in new products as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","Kevin, good luck. Couple of questions. The first, could you talk to the TAM or your thoughts on market sizes when you look at wellness and action camera? And any thoughts on the relative growth rates of those industries? And then, the second, any updates on timing or availability of v\u00edvok\u00ed and whether or not that is reflected in your updated fitness targets?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. In terms of total addressable market on activity trackers, last year, we estimated that market to be about a 5 million unit market. It is in a stage of hyper-growth, so we would expect that to roughly double this coming year. In terms of the VIRB action camera, last year, a very similar story in terms of numbers, about 5 million units. And the growth last year, I believe was probably close to double. We expect that market to moderate somewhat this coming year due to the various maturity levels of the market in the channel and the competitors that are there. But it's still very healthy market. In terms of v\u00edvok\u00ed, one of your questions, that product is scheduled to be released in the later half of this year. That product, though, is targeted more towards B2B opportunities. So at this point, it doesn't really factor in, in terms of a big needle mover. Most of our outlook in fitness is driven by all of the new products and particularly v\u00edvofit, which is doing well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups. First, given the nice growth in the OEM revenues during the first half, can you give us an update on that part of the business' profitability maybe relative to the segment overall and how we should be thinking about that going forward?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, actually, we did see -- because of a nice pickup in auto OEM revenue, we did see that we've made money in the quarter. If you look past -- back in the past several quarters, we've been investing heavily in the R&D side, and sales were not at a level where we were making money. But we did make operating profits -- a small amount of operating profits in Q2, so that was a nice trend change in our business.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And any comment on kind of how we should be thinking about profitability in that going forward?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, again, we won't give details from underneath the auto\/mobile segment in general. But I think we're still on a period where we're exploring and trying to win new business there, so I wouldn't expect a significant change. We've said that, at scale, if we could -- if we can get to a much higher scale, we would expect that, that operating margin would be close to 10%. We're nowhere near that, and that would be more of a longer-term goal than a short-term goal.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then, I think you've talked in the past something around -- and I apologize if I'm off on this number, but 100 new products or somewhere along those lines in 2014. Given you guys clearly have the drive to continue to innovate and come out with new products here, have you accelerated the number of new product launches you expect or changed those plans at all since the last quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think in a simple word, yes, we've accelerated, and we are driving growth through new product introductions.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeremy David with Citi.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have a couple of fitness-related questions. First off, great growth this quarter. Fitness revenue was up $67 million year-over-year. Can you guys give us a feel for the contribution of different the product lines here? Kind of maybe you could rank order v\u00edvofit versus the cycling products like the Edge 1000 or the Forerunner watches?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. I think, as we mentioned earlier in our comments, that the growth in fitness was broadly distributed across several product categories. We don't split out details on each product category. But we were pleased with the growth that we saw in v\u00edvofit, obviously, but also, in the cycling area, as well as the running area, we saw significant growth.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. Great to see that's broad based. On v\u00edvofit, I think you said earlier this year that you have aspirations to get to high-single-digit market share this year. Have your aspirations changed materially at this point?","Clifton A. Pemble","Aspirations -- I'm sorry, we probably missed -- aspirations for what kind of market share?","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","For a high-single-digit market share?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. I think in terms of that, we feel like we've already achieved that. We probably estimate that we have about 10% at this early stage, which, again, we feel like it is a strong start to that particular category.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And finally, 4Q -- you had a great fitness revenue in Q2. Should we expect for Q3 typical seasonality in fitness or maybe a steeper decline than usual because of the channel fill you saw on Q2 on all these new products you're shipping?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think there's a lot of dynamics there because of evolving new products. So we probably can't offer details in terms of what we expect on the overall trends other than what we provided, which is, for the year, we feel like the category will be up around 50%.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up question from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just -- I don't want to beat the restructuring question again, but just can you give us a sense of how much of your free cash flow previously was tied up? And what percentage will be more difficult to repatriate going forward? So kind of what's the delta between the earnings that you have access to now versus before?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think, without giving all the details you're asking, I think, if you look at our U.S. earnings, we had growing U.S. earnings because of the strength of all segments but also, in particular, our aviation business was continuing to grow double digits. And so it was a sizable amount of earnings as opposed to our total free cash flow numbers of approximately $600 million that were -- we would never -- we were never going to repatriate until we took this action of restructuring. So that's really what it [indiscernible] is to be able to take a significant part of our cash and allows us to move it to the parent to give us opportunity to use it.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess my question though was about the go forward. How much of -- maybe I'll ask it a little bit differently. How much of your earnings going forward will still wind up being in jurisdictions where repatriation is going to be difficult?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think I didn't really answer -- understand your question. But it really frees up pretty much everything in the future as we go forward because we have no limitations of a very high tax rate, withholding tax rate. And we can move that up very tax efficiently in the future. So again, it would solve the one issue that we've had in the past and not really tie up anything with trapped cash, so to speak.","Operator","With no additional questions, I'd like to turn the call back to management for any additional or closing comments.","Kerri Thurston","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And we will look forward to follow-up calls with many of you and speaking to you and seeing you at conferences over the course of the next quarter.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kerri Thurston. Please go ahead.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd.'s First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.","Please note that the earnings press release and the related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/doc. An archive of the webcast and a related transcript will also be available on our website later today.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market share, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and CEO; and Kevin Rauckman, CFO and Treasurer.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier this morning, Garmin reported strong first quarter revenue and margin performance, with revenue, operating income and pro forma EPS growth.","Consolidated revenues increased 10% year-over-year, with revenue from Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor growing 22% on a combined basis. These segments contributed 58% of the total revenue and 75% of the operating profit in the first quarter.","Gross margins improved year-over-year to 57% from 52% in 2013 due to the amortization of previously deferred revenue and improved segment mix. Operating margins were 21%, an increase from 15% in prior year. This resulted in operating income growth of 51% on a consolidated basis, with each segment contributing. These strong results allowed us to generate $0.55 of pro forma EPS in the quarter, an increase of 38% over 2013. Kevin will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first I'll walk through a review of our results segment-by-segment.","Beginning with the Fitness segment, revenue grew 38% on a year-over-year basis, as our new running products performed well and we began shipping our v\u00edvofit activity tracker. We delivered gross and operating margins of 64% and 33%, respectively. Operating income grew 68% in the quarter as the operating margin extended by almost 600 basis points due to higher sales. The launch of the v\u00edvofit in the first quarter has gone well, and we expect it to be a driver growth for the remainder of the year as the wellness market rapidly expands.","In cycling, we announced the Edge 1000, a high-end solution that sets a new standard for cycling computers. The Edge 1000 features a large sunlight-readable color display, passive touch, competitive segment capabilities and smartphone connectivity.","Finally, while we are currently expressing a period of strong growth fueled by new products, we see additional opportunities we can capture in both the short- and long-term. With this outlook in mind, we've increased our R&D investment in Fitness to support future innovation and robust pipeline of new products and services that are yet to come.","In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 19%, with both OEM and aftermarket product categories contributing to the growth. Operating income grew 38% in the quarter, ahead of revenue growth, due to the improvement in both gross and operating margins. While these are strong results, we continue to face a challenging market as new aircraft sales remained below historical levels. Throughout the quarter, we extended our aftermarket product portfolio to include portable weather receivers, angle of attack technology and additional radar altimeter solutions. These additions have allowed us to expand the addressable market for Garmin in the aftermarket space.","Another introduction in the quarter was the G3X Touch, designed for the light-sport aircraft market. The G3X has already achieved strong acceptance of light-sport OEMs with 5 partners offering the product on 13 different models. Finally, we also expanded our relationship with Cessna to include the CJ3+ and the Alpine Edition CJ2+, which will now offer Garmin's G3000 cockpit system.","Revenue in the Marine segment grew 19% in the quarter, due to the introduction of new products and a weak comparable from the first quarter of 2013. Profitability improved in the first quarter. However, the pricing environment remains competitive resulting in margins below historical levels. I'm pleased to report that we delivered our new products for 2014 ahead of the buying season and anticipate gaining market share with these strong offerings. While industry activity is far below historical levels, we remain committed to innovation that will lead to long-term improvement in market share and profitability.","Looking at Outdoor. Revenues grew 10%, with each major product category contributing. Gross and operating margins remained strong in this segment at 61% and 28%, respectively. During the quarter, we introduced the fenix 2 and the PRO series of dog training collars. The fenix 2 builds on the capabilities of the original fenix by adding advanced fitness training features and smartphone connectivity. The PRO series of dog training collars expands our offerings for the sport dog category with the integration of proven Tri-Tronics technology and new features for the dog trainer.","Finally, in Outdoor, we wanted to provide an update on our progress in the action camera market. To-date, market share gains have developed more slowly than planned due to the relative maturity of the market and the existence of strong well-entrenched competitors. However, we entered this market because we believe we have unique innovations to offer customers pursuing active lifestyles. With this in mind, we are increasing promotional activities to support our current offerings, we are also stepping up our R&D investment to develop the next generation of action cameras.","In our Auto\/Mobile segment, revenues were down 4% in the quarter. The PND unit volumes declining at a global rate of almost 20%, which is in line with our expectations. This decline was partially offset by growth in OEM, as well as the amortization of previously deferred revenues. The segment remains highly profitable with growth in operating margins of 47% and 13%, respectively, and we continue to experience gains in global market share.","As indicated in our February guidance, we expect the 2014 PND market to decline approximately 20% on a global basis. This will be partially offset by growth properties in OEM, RVs, dash cameras and other specialty automotive products.","As a final note for this segment, the Garmin equipped Mercedes E-Class is now shipping. The selection of Garmin navigation in Mercedes vehicles is a strong vote of confidence in our offerings and capabilities as an OEM supplier. We plan to build on this momentum as we pursue additional opportunities for our OEM software and hardware solutions.","Finally, while results in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, it is also the weakest quarter, with a large portion of the year still ahead. With this in mind, we will update guidance after the second quarter according to our typical practice, when we anticipate having improved visibility on the PND market trends and our progress in new product categories.","I'd like to touch briefly on the CFO transitions. As you recall on February, Kevin announced his plan to leave the CFO role by the end of this year. Speaking generally, I feel good about our progress so far, and I'm confident in our ability to affect a smooth transition as we've planned since the beginning.","That concludes my remarks. Kevin will now walk through our Q1 financial results in more detail. Kevin?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Thank you, Cliff, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our financial results and then move to summary comments on both the balance sheet and the cash flow.","So we posted revenue of $583 million for the quarter, with pro forma net income of $108 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.55 per share, excluding the FX gain in during the quarter. Our revenue represents an increase of 10% year-over-year, as previously highlighted by Cliff. Gross margin was strong at 57%, a 480-basis-point increase from prior year, driven by the segment mix with improved margins in each segment and the amortization of previously deferred revenues.","Operating margin was 21%, an increase of 560 basis points from the prior year. This is the result of the gross margin favorability of 480 basis points, as well as the operating expense favorability of 80 basis points. The total operating expenses did increase by $14 million, or 7%. Each of the operating expense categories will be discussed in detail on a later slide.","Our effective tax rate increased to 16.6% in the quarter, with the prior year rate positively impacted by a $6.3 million benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the Federal R&D tax credit, which again expired at the end of December 2013. Our pro forma EPS, which is adjusted for the foreign currency gains, $0.55 representing a 38% increase year-over-year. And we shipped 2.5 million units during the quarter, basically flat from our 2013 results. Total company average selling price was $234 per unit, up 10% from $213 in Q1 2013, driven primarily by the segment mix and reduced revenue deferrals.","Next, you can see how our first quarter revenue breaks down by segment. I'd just like to briefly highlight the charts on this page, which illustrate the Auto\/Mobile segment representing 43% of our total revenue during Q1 of 2014, as each of the non-Auto\/Mobile segments grew double digits during the quarter.","You can see from the profitability mix by segment that our non-Auto\/Mobile segments delivered 75% of operating income in the quarter, equivalent to Q1 2013 due to the margin improvement in Auto\/Mobile. I'd like to briefly discuss the year-over-year gross margin changes by segment.","Auto\/Mobile gross margin increased 47% from 42% in the prior year due primarily to the amortization of higher margins, deferred revenues. In addition, we posted gross margin improvement in each of the non-Auto\/Mobile segments. This margin improvement was primarily related to product mix shifting toward new products in Marine, Outdoor and Fitness. In addition, ASP improvement also contributed in Marine and Outdoor, and Aviation margin improvement was primarily due to increased software sales.","Total corporate operating margin improved to 21% due to the increased gross margin and revenue growth outpacing the 7% growth of operating expenses, which I will highlight next.","Our Q1 operating expenses increased by $14 million, or 7%, on a year-over-year basis in Q1, while decreasing 80 basis points as a percentage of sales, as revenue growth outpaced expense growth. R&D increased $8 million year-over-year while remaining consistent year-over-year at 16.5% sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce with resources focused on Aviation, Outdoor and Fitness segments.","Our advertising spending increased $2 million over the year ago quarter, while being consistent as a percentage of sales. The additional spending was focused in Outdoor and Marine to support new products and categories. We will continue to manage advertising expenses by segment to match the market opportunities presented by our diverse products. And SG&A was up $4 million compared to the year ago quarter, decreasing 80 basis points as a percentage of sales. We'll continue to manage these expense -- these costs to align with the changing dynamics of our business.","And finally, we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.8 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $427 million following the holiday quarter. Our inventory balance increased to $442 million on a sequential basis, as we built inventory levels to support the launch of new product categories and in preparation for the seasonally stronger second quarter.","We continued to generate strong free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $71 million during Q1, FX was $15 million. Therefore we generated free cash of $56 million in the quarter. And we also repurchased $33 million in company stock and now have $208 million still authorized to repurchase through December of 2014.","This ends our formal remarks on Q1 results. Operator, please open the phone lines for questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A question on the deferred revenue. It seems as though it came in -- the net amount of deferred revenue, a bit higher than I was forecasting. Was there any change in the way that you account for the deferred revenue?","Kevin S. Rauckman","No, we do have expected higher deferred revenue in Q1 because of this being a seasonally weaker period. So the -- so really wasn't any major changes to what we've deferred from the past. And I think, as we go through the year, will see less of a dramatic impact as what we have in Q1.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then, I guess, still trying to figure out the trajectory of the Auto\/Mobile business. Can you give me -- give us maybe a sense of what the total non-PND sales were in 2013? And how those non-PND sales might trend this year? So can you kind of back in to what do expect for the PND market?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Are you -- you are referring to just the Auto\/Mobile segment specifically?","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Exactly. How much of the Auto\/Mobile is non-PND? And what is the absolute kind of trend in 2013 -- 2014 versus '13?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, I think what you're getting at is you want us to document what our Auto OEM businesses is. We just don't make that public. But I would just say the Auto OEM revenues did grow, and we're still expecting our units decline in PND to be around 17% year-over-year, which is what, what we've said in the past. And as we go forth through the full year, I think you'll see our Auto\/Mobile segment in total still come down between 10% and 15% on revenue. So really no major changes from what we communicated at the last quarterly earnings call.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the Fitness market, particularly with v\u00edvofit. It's a very fluid market, there's a lot of sub-segmentation and changing dynamics related to competition, some people leaving, some new people coming in. Just kind of your working assumptions for v\u00edvofit unit growth? And how we should also think about ASPs that might actually stimulate the demand further?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think, as Cliff commented, we got off on to a really good start with v\u00edvofit. We believe the market is sizable market, roughly about 10 million -- probably about close to 10 million units this year. So being a new player in the Fitness area, the Fitness activity trackers, this is a key part of our growth business in our Fitness segment. However I do want to also just remind people that, while v\u00edvofit got off to a great start, the rest of our fitness business also did well, especially in the running category.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, are you finding that consumers will elect one or the other, a watch or a band? Or are you finding that there's market growth in both segments? How should we kind of think about that on a going forward basis?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think we were seeing both. I mean, we've introduced, for example, the recent Forerunner 220 and 620, which have done very well, which is the watch category and that, of course, the v\u00edvofit being the band, we think there's a lot of upside there too. so I think, there -- it's not either\/or, it's -- we're going to get both from -- growth from both of those sub-segments.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And Outdoor, it seems the outdoor camera, the VIRB, we're kind of rebooting that. Maybe some of the lessons learned from, I guess, the initial launch and how we've not actually gained some share in this market? What happens to the existing products? Are we clearing those out through the channel as we get ready for the new products? Maybe if you could help give us some sense of that would be helpful.","Clifton A. Pemble","Mark, I think as I mentioned in my remarks, we know that the market is mature, and we know that there's entrenched competitors in the market, and therefore it does take some time to penetrate the market, we're viewing this as a marathon rather than a sprint. And so, as I mentioned, we're increasing our promotional activities, we're also increasing our R&D activities to be able to have a robust product pipeline. At this stage, we're focusing on our existing offerings, and I think in the future we'll have additional innovations that we'll bring into market.","Operator","And we'll take our next call from John Bright with Avondale Partners.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Aftermarket demand in Marine and Aviation versus the peak periods, where does this stand today?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think those markets, John, have been down anywhere from 40% to 50% at -- from their highest to their lowest. They're coming off of their lows from where they were, but, obviously, and speaking just generally about industry, the industry took a massive hit as part of the financial crisis. We've been able to outperform that market by taking share, as well as new product offerings that are stimulating demand in those areas.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","In the Marine segment last year, if I recall right, the products -- new products weren't in the market for this quarter but they then actually picked up nicely in the June quarter, and you had good acceptance for the Marine products. Does that make a meaningfully tough comparison for June?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, I mentioned in my remarks that the first quarter of this year was strong, and compared to last year, it was a very weak comparable. So going forward, we do face the stronger comparables of last year that we're comping against.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","On the Auto side of the equation, you mentioned growth in OEM in the quarter. And then in prepared text talk, it seemed like you are trying about some optimism around the OEM business looking forward. Is there any additional tactical information that you can share with us?","Clifton A. Pemble","We don't have any substantial information we can share at this time. We continue to manage a robust pipeline of business development. And we do have progress that we're making in the segment as well, with our credibility as a Tier 1 software and infotainment supplier. So it's a slow-moving industry, but in general, I feel positive about the progress we've made to date.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Another question, geographically, it looks like EMEA, it was the strongest market for you. What were the products that were leading that strength?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, it's very interesting. EMEA did well across all of the different segments. I think, the one -- maybe the one positive surprise is the PND decline in EMEA was a little bit lower than what we had anticipated going in, that even in the Outdoor, the Fitness and the Marine businesses all did well in Europe.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just wanted to understand a little bit better. Like, you've talked in, I believe, both the Fitness, Outdoor and Auto segments about increasing some of the investments around R&D, as well as marketing spend. Can you maybe give us a sense around magnitude for that spending increase? As well as where you expect to sort of redirect that spending?","Clifton A. Pemble","Generally speaking, we're trying to manage the investment within the sales growth that we're experiencing. Obviously, in some areas that are very new, we have to ramp it up much more aggressively. But on average, that's what we're trying to accomplish.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then just in terms of, I guess, the progress with the VIRB, what's been sort of the feedback that you've gotten from the channel? Is this fully deployed in all of the mass market channels at this point? And just wanted to get a sense from you as to what do you think are some of the issues that will sort of help accelerate that growth over time?","Clifton A. Pemble","I feel that our deployment in mass market is probably light, compared to where we had wished to be. I think we're in a few of the smaller Outdoor retail stores, but we have yet to get placement in some of the larger big box retailers. And so product placement has obviously been an issue. As well as, as I mentioned before, I think the existence of entrenched competitors in this market is a factor.","Operator","And our next call is from Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Just starting on Fitness, I wonder if you guys could talk about sort of channel fill and maybe sell-in versus sell-through. Obviously, it was sort of a partial shipping of v\u00edvofit. What was sort of the spend dynamic there? Is this a partial quarter? Just all those dynamics to help us understand the growth rate and -- versus what we should see going forward?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, I think our -- as you point out, our sell-in on v\u00edvofit has just started partially in the quarter. It's still very early in the life cycle of this product and in the year, but I would say that we're encouraged by the sell-through reports that we're hearing from the field. I think, as Kevin mentioned, our strongest contributor to growth in the Fitness segment was our strong running product line and, of course, those have been out now for a while. And there's really no issue of sell-in, sell-through going on there. We feel like it's strong demand from customers that are pulling that product through.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","And then, you mentioned some pricing pressure on Marine. I wondered if this is a nagging issues or a structural issue? Or if you feel like it's temporary and cyclical in nature?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think it depends on what your time frame is for how you evaluate, whether it's short-term or long-term. The way we see it is that the market has experienced a lot of challenging conditions and competitors are vying for the business that's there and that's put pressure on pricing. We're seeing, as you've seen in our results, the margins come up as we've introduced new products and innovations. So we feel like over the long-term, it can move back towards where we were, but we are not, at this point, overly optimistic that, that will come in the short-term.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","One question I had on v\u00edvofit, in particular, is when you look at this market, the wellness opportunity, how do you view your position from either a market share standpoint? Or how big do you think you can be within that? And then kind of what's the backlog look like? It looks like there's extended lead times today. Does that can have any impact on when this v\u00edvoki can launch? Then I have follow-up as well.","Clifton A. Pemble","Okay. So we feel like the market is very fragmented, as you pointed out, but we entered these markets with the intention of being leaders. We are cautious in terms of how much market share that we can get in both the short-term and the long-term, if the market's very fragmented. Our experience in the PND market is that, in a highly fragmented and growing market, your ability to capture large amount of shares early is more challenging. But we again, feel like this is a market where we offer a lot of value and capability and, therefore, we're going to be continuing to work on our innovation and the products that we're offering.","Kevin S. Rauckman","And maybe a follow-up. We're just a couple of months into the sell-in of the v\u00edvofit and backlogs have continued to remain pretty strong. So we'll have to -- continue to manage that as we go forward in the next couple of quarters. But so far, the trends looks pretty positive.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","And then follow-up, commented on new products, new categories within the prepared remarks. Any detail you could provide as you think about new categories not necessarily what they are? But any thoughts on how those cam opportunities may compare with some of the recently introduced products and markets that you've entered? Are these comparable opportunities? How do you think about those market sizes?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think, really no specifics at this time. We continue to search for opportunities in closely related adjacent spaces to where we are. And as you know, many of our businesses are niche focused in general, and so we're continuing to search for those kinds of opportunities.","Operator","And our next question is with Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's actually Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron. So a few quarters ago, you guys have said it may take a few years to get Aviation margins to the 30s level again. And in this quarter, Aviation margins were 30%. So can you give us more color on what drove Aviation margin strength? Is it volume, timing of R&D spend, sales mix? And how should we think about the cadence of these items for the year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think it's all 3, it's all of the above. I think when you see a 19% growth rate, that's above what our full year guidance is. It's a very of much volume dependent business and since we have strong revenue growth that helps. But our gross margins also grew and then pricing and the new business opportunities, I think are -- has helped us hit 30%. So we want to be, I think, cautious in the fact that we were excited about that type of profitability, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's a trend. We'll have to just see how Aviation progresses throughout the rest of this year.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So would it be fair to say that if business jet volumes actually do recover then 30% is kind of the new watermark for Aviation margins?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think it probably requires more than just that. Of course, that would be helpful but the retrofit market needs to continue to perform well. And again, from our expense point of view, we're growing R&D and we're also comping against Qs 2 through 4 last year which were very strong. So I think all of those are factors that are in the mix.","Operator","And our next call is -- question is from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Kevin, I know it's kind of difficult to predict the deferred revenue. But if we look at last year, Q1, you pulled off a significant amount of revenue from the balance sheet in Q1. And then the deferred revenue balance kind of stabilized through the rest of the year. Is that a reasonable case scenario for this year? Or is there some other pattern that we should be thinking about as we try to forecast this Auto\/Mobile segment?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think it is similar to that because Q1 being our lightest quarter from a PND shipment, and that has an impact on the results. And so we are -- we also hit a threshold were about 80% of all of our PND units now have lifetime map, lifetime traffic, so we defer that percentage. That really hasn't changed. As we go through Q2, Q3 and Q4, we should see a decrease in the amount of amortized revenues that we're going to experience. So I think, it's pretty -- I think you're trend is probably pretty close.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And I appreciate you don't want to give the OEM revenues, but I was also hoping to ask around the question a little bit, maybe get a little more clarification. The shipments into the Mercedes, that is for turn-by-turn navigation app, correct? And I just wanted to make sure if that was revenue booked in the first quarter related to that? Or is that happening starting in the second quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble","The revenue was booked in the first quarter for Mercedes. It is a software application.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And that -- then the revenue rec for that is upon the shipment from the OEM?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think...","Kevin S. Rauckman","No...","Clifton A. Pemble","No, it's when we ship it.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Right. Revenue recognition is when we sell into that -- into the channel.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes.","Matthew P. McKee - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then are you willing to give kind of an aggregate percentage of the Auto\/Mobile business that made up, not just of OEM, but also of some of the specialty PND products that you think there's some growth in -- in dash cam and other kind of products that there might be growth in?","Kevin S. Rauckman","No, we really won't break it down below that. I think, the PND still makes up the vast majority of our Auto\/Mobile segments and Auto OEM, obviously, as we said, did grow, and then you mentioned dash cam, that those are more, I would say, niche opportunities for us to grow that segment, but we don't -- we won't quantify how much that is.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And final question, Cliff, I think you guys kind of run the business from an investment standpoint on a project-by-project basis. But I was wondering if there is a kind of an operating margin target or level that we should be thinking about in Fitness and Outdoor, given what appears to be all kinds of new opportunities for growth, given the improvements in sensor technology and wireless and excitement about wearables, et cetera?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think for the traditional businesses and product segments that we served in Fitness and Outdoor, we still target the margin profile that we've historically had in those businesses with gross margins, in the 60s range and the operating margins in the 30s arrange. As those market segments have new categories and also there's some expansion of the market size as we move down to more beginning customers, if you will, especially in Fitness, the margin profile will definitely come down. Especially in the Fitness market, as the wellness market gets competitive and pricing we would expect to come down in the long-term. That will tend to weigh on the margins in Fitness.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But no specific target operating margin level. So when you're investing in R&D and sales and marketing, it's not around an envelope of operating margin target, it's more project-by-project?","Clifton A. Pemble","No, it's really, I would call it, opportunities and the ability to penetrate new segments in the market and serve more customers.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Just to clarify, Tavis, you want question on the Auto OEM. Let me just make sure everybody understands the revenue recognition. We recognize revenue on any of our Auto OEM deals on a vehicle-by-vehicle. So for Mercedes, for example, we take revenue for the number of cars that they're selling, and it's not one lump sum payment that we get, it's vehicle-by-vehicle.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Doug Clark for Simona Jankowski. One more question on the deferral impact. I think last quarter you had mentioned that you expect the full impact on the EPS basis to be about $0.20 to $0.30, probably about $0.30. It looks like on my math, the full impact in the first quarter was pretty much $0.20. So for the full year, do you expect the impact to be larger than the former guidance? And again, if so, really why was the first quarter so outside?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, actually the first quarter impact was about $0.16 after net income tax effect. So as I said earlier, we're expecting that number to decline over the next couple of quarters. So there's really no major change from our earlier expectations of up to as much as $0.30 for the year.","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great, that's helpful. And then one more follow-up on the VIRB. In association with the promotion and advertising spending that's going on, does that mean that you will expand the channel and distribution ahead of the next generation VIRB product? Or would that be something that you would wait to do until the next generation comes out?","Clifton A. Pemble","No we're working to expand the distribution.","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then one more quick follow-up actually. With about $200 million left in the repurchase, do you expect to fully execute that by the end of 2014?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, we would just -- it's hard to predict what the rest of the year is going to look like. But we have been in the market pretty much every day, so we will likely be more aggressive, as we said earlier, to buy back stock this year. Whether we get all the way through it, it's hard to predict at this point.","Operator","And our next question is from Jeremy David with Citi.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions. First on Outdoor. Margins were very strong in Q1, and to me that's confirming that categories you have been in for a while are doing well, but VIRB is not doing that well. But, excluding VIRB, what really drove this strength in your Auto portfolio in Q1? I know you're expecting that strength to last for the rest of the year. And finally, considering the weaker VIRB revenue that you're now expecting, it's 10% to 15% growth for Outdoor in '14 still on the table? Or that might not be achievable?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think if you look at the entire categories of our Outdoor segment, dog tracking and training, the golf products, just the traditional handhelds markets. Excluding the VIRB, those are all very high margin products. So, we -- that's really what drove the operating result -- operating margin results for the quarter. In terms of your question on full year guidance as we said earlier, we're not planning to give any adjustment to our earlier expectations. Outdoor came in at plus 10%. We've said 10% to 15% for the full year, so we will plan to update not only our total company but also the Outdoor segment after Q2.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And if I can have a follow-up on -- could you comment on the inventory situation across your businesses. I think, TomTom had a good Q1 yesterday, part of it was channel fill for PNDs. Could you comment about PND inventories broadly speaking? And maybe anything out of the normal in terms of inventory for your other products across all businesses?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, no real changes to the inventory cycles. PND is a matured business. We're very much watching both sell-in and sell-through, we don't have any major risks there. And inventory in general, I think, the key driver of our inventory increase was really preparing ourselves for the, as I said, seasonally strong Q2 with bringing to market like v\u00edvofit, the marine products and others.","Operator","And our next question is with Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Cliff, I was hoping you could expand on your comments about the action camera market being mature. I mean, it seemed like to me one of the opportunities, big opportunities for Garmin in this market is as that sort of niche product in the extreme sport arena expanded into more mass markets like aviation, marine, swimming, cycling, where you are so strong there was an opportunity for you to capture share without necessarily having to take share from the existing markets. And so just I'm a little confused by the use of the word mature. Do you not see any underlying market growth in action cameras, or why do you describe it as mature?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, you're probably touching on a couple of different dynamics there. The action camera market has existed for several years now. And so right now, there's really no credible documentation on what the market size is and what the growth is. But it would appear to us based on the fact that these devices are used in a lot of highly active, extreme lifestyles that the market, being in existence for a while, is probably more in a flatter growth right now than hyper growth type of a mode. And that's one dynamic. But in terms of share, that's a different dynamic. Yes, it's true that we do serve all those different markets, and we do see strong interest and acceptance of our product, particularly in those niche market areas like aviation and marine where we are very strong. And so we see encouraging signs there. Whereas a lot of the more mass market distribution and the mass market customer is weaker than we like. So those are really the dynamics around the comments that I made.","Operator","And our next question is from Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","First, the press release, and you guys have mentioned that the business generally exceeded expectations in -- your own expectations in Q1. Can you corner just rank order maybe the top couple of segments that contributed in terms of being so meaningfully ahead of those initial expectations?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, clearly, Fitness has performed very, very well, and so that was 1 driver. I think Auto\/Mobile is our largest segment, performed ahead of our expectations and made big differences there as well. Aviation performed well. So I'd say those are top 3 and, of course, we're pleased with our performance in Marine as well, and Outdoor did, respectively. So across the board, we feel positive about the results.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then, just a follow-up on v\u00edvofit. Can you remind us of just kind of where we're in the time line in terms of being at full distribution on that product. And if we're not sort of when we should expect to be at full distribution?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think out of the gate, we were able to secure a lot of strong distribution for this product. So we feel very good about where we're at. We still feel like there's more doors to capture. And many of those retailers where we're currently not positioned are planning for resets in the future. Let's say, by the summer time frame and into the fall, we should be at a point where we feel like we're at full presence in the market.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up call from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just in terms of the CapEx, it expanded a little bit. Is -- are some of these growth opportunities you are also requiring -- you to grow some of your equipment and installed base and kind of what's the forecast for the year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, I think we did raise our expectation on CapEx because of the $15 million in Q1 to probably closer to $60 million for the year. And we are investing in several areas, we're investing in a few facilities, but also surface map technology to production lines to capture these opportunities like v\u00edvofit. So there's several factors that, that's what's driving a slight increase in our CapEx expectations.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then you also mentioned in your prepared remarks with respect to the Aviation market that it's still a difficult market out there. Those remarks has been echoed by others in the space. Is there any worry that some of the shipments you are expecting in the new platforms in the OE side, later this year could get pushed out? Or are you still feeling okay about the OE deliveries you had in your plan?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think there's still some uncertainty around the planning on the OEM side because of the market conditions. The business jet market remains weak as we've been saying and so we simply need to watch, as the year goes along, to see how the OEM sales follow through.","Operator","And the follow-up call from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, just with the slight increase in CapEx, how we should think about free cash flow for the full year with your working capital requirements? And also, your inclination to kind of repurchase shares at these elevated levels, how you're kind of thinking about the share repurchase?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, first of all, we haven't really changed our expectation of free cash flows, so we're still expecting in between $550 million and $600 million, which is what we stated at the beginning -- at our last earnings call. And in terms of buyback, I think, we're like many other investors, we're price-sensitive but we're also wanting to be more aggressive to use our cash to -- from a dilutive effect to take some of the shares out of the market. So I think we've proven on the last couple of quarters that we're willing to buy consistently, like I said, we've been in the market pretty much every day since our last earnings announcement. So we'll see how that progresses throughout 2014.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Okay. I think that is -- that concludes the questions for the day. So we want to thank everyone again for your contribution and for your questions. And look forward to updating you as we go through the remainder of the year. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"10174":["Garmin Ltd.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Teri Seck. Ma'am, you may begin.","Teri Seck - Manager, Investor Relations, Garmin Ltd.","Good morning. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Limited second quarter 2016 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcript will also be available on our website.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial positions, revenues, earnings, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are: Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Teri. And good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported second quarter results highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth. Consolidated revenue increased 5% year-over-year with Fitness, Outdoors, Marine, and Aviation collectively growing 20%, while contributing 70% of the total revenue in the quarter.","Each of our business segments produce strong results, which I will highlight shortly. Gross margin expanded to 57% from 54.2% in the prior year, as new products and margin improvement efforts made a clear impact on our business. Operating margin expanded 24.7% from 21.5% in prior year, and operating income grew 20% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $0.85 of GAAP EPS; pro forma EPS came in at $0.87, an increase of 21% over the year-ago quarter.","Wearable products were a major contributor to our strong second quarter performance. Over the past year, we have extended our wearable product portfolio with the goal of offering a wearable device for a wide range of active lifestyles. As part of this effort, we have been pursuing two important objectives. First, we've been extending the availability of Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology across our wearable product lines.","Garmin Elevate is now available in multiple models of our running products and our activity trackers, and in our f\u0113nix series of outdoor adventure watches. Customers have embraced Garmin Elevate, and the feedback we are receiving is very positive.","The second important objective is to increase customer engagement by offering applications, widgets and watch faces through our Connect IQ App store. Momentum in the App store continues to build as we now offer over 2,000 apps, watch faces and widgets. And we have surpassed 13 million downloads from the store since its launch earlier last year.","While I'm pleased with the progress we've made so far, there is certainly much more to do. We remain focused on a strong product road map and building engagement through Connect IQ and on Garmin Connect Community.","Looking now at segment highlights, our Fitness segment experienced robust revenue growth of 34% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth within all product categories. Gross margin came in at 56% and operating margin was 25%, an expansion of more than 400 basis points over the prior year. This generated operating income growth of 60% in the quarter.","Recent new product launches include the Forerunner 735XT, a lightweight multi-sport running watch, and the vivosmart HR+, which adds GPS capability to our smart activity tracker. As a result of these and many other recent product releases, we estimate that our share of the GPS-enabled smart wearable market in the United States has grown from approximately 43% a year ago to approximately 57% today, according to market share data. During the quarter, we also introduced the vivomove, a fashionable analog watch with activity tracking features and a one-year battery life.","Looking next at Outdoor, which also experienced robust growth, revenue increased 23% year-over-year on strong demand for our outdoor wearables and a full quarter contribution of DeLorme sales. The Outdoor segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 64% and 36%, respectively, representing an expansion over the prior year. Operating income grew 31% over the year-ago quarter.","One of the many benefits of our business model is the ability to share product platforms, technologies and components across multiple market segments. Recent examples include the Approach X40, a GPS-based activity tracker with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology and a built-in database of over 40,000 golf courses providing distance to the front, middle and back of the green. We also introduced our next-generation dog tracker, the Astro 430, which when paired to DriveTrack 70 PND can track up to 20 dogs from a vehicle. The Astro 430 can also pair with the f\u0113nix 3 wearable for convenient tracking and alerts at the wrist.","Looking next at Marine, revenue increased 8% over a very strong quarter in the prior year. Gross margin increased to 58% in the quarter while operating margin expanded to 26%. Operating income grew 19% in the quarter.","Our new fish finders have been well received and we have grown our share in the inland fishing market. Earlier in the year, we introduced Quickdraw Contours, which enables boaters to create maps of their lakes with all processing and storage taking place right on the device.","We recently enhanced Quickdraw by offering a community feature called Quickdraw Community, which is a free cloud based mapping platform for sharing user generated HD mapping content. We believe Quickdraw Community will positively impact customer engagement and will expand the availability of HD mapping content, particularly on smaller fishing lakes.","Turning next to Aviation, revenue grew 6% over the prior year, as we experienced growth in both OEM and ADS-B systems. Gross and operating margin remain strong at 74% and 28% respectively, resulting in a 13% increase on operating income.","During the quarter, the G3000-euqipped Piper M600 received type certification and we are pleased to be the avionics provider for this aircraft. As we continue into the back half of 2016, we will focus on a number of additional certifications, including the aftermarket G5000 system for the Beechjet 400A and the Hawker 400XP.","We now have several new products and product enhancements at the Oshkosh Air Show taking place this week. One such announcement is the Flight Stream 510, which is a multi-mode wireless radio system built into a multimedia card, which also includes storage for a variety of flight databases.","The Flight Stream 510 is important because it simplifies the task of updating flight databases by leveraging the connectivity of a smart phone or tablet. Flight Stream 510 also shares flight plans, traffic, weather and position information with smart phone and tablets running on our Garmin Pilot mobile app. Flight Stream 510 significantly enhances the ability to incorporate consumer devices in the cockpit.","Looking finally at the Auto segment, revenues were down 18% in the quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction, and headwinds caused by revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM programs. Gross margin came in at 46% and operating margin expanded to 16%.","We remain strategically focused on new opportunities in the auto OEM market. While we are typically thought of as a navigation and infotainment supplier, we are also leveraging our competencies in other technologies such as cameras and driver assistance to extend our ability to serve the market. At the recent 2016 Beijing Auto Show, Peugeot has showcased its model 3008, which includes a factory-installed digital video recorder designed and manufactured by Garmin.","So, in summary we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2016 and we believe we are well-positioned for the remainder of the year. With this in mind, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $2.9 billion, up approximately 3% over 2015. We are projecting gross margin of 55%, and operating margin of 19% for the full year. Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 19.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.50.","Looking at our outlook by segment, we have increased growth expectations for Fitness and Outdoor to 20% for the year. Aviation and Marine are unchanged, while the outlook for Auto has been reduced slightly based on current market trends.","That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results.","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter results then move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.","We posted revenue of $812 million for the second quarter, representing a 5% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 57%, a 280 basis point increase from the prior year, driven primarily by segment and product mix.","Operating expense as a percent of sales was 32.3%, a 40 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $201 million, a 20% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 24.7%, a 320 basis point increase from the prior year. Effective tax rate was 21% at current quarter which is comparable to the effective tax rate of 20.6% in the prior year quarter. Our GAAP EPS was $0.85, an 18% growth over the prior year quarter, and pro forma EPS was $0.87, a 21% growth over the prior year quarter. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.","Next, we'll look at second quarter revenue by segment. In the second quarter, we have growth in four of our five segments led by robust double-digit growth on Fitness and Outdoor segments and single-digit growth on Marine and Aviation segments. Collectively, these four segments were up 20% compared to the prior-year quarter.","Looking next at second quarter revenue charts. Auto segment represent a 30% of our total second quarter 2016 revenue, compared to 39% second quarter 2015. Fitness grew to 26% of revenue in the current period, compared to 21% in the prior year, while Outdoor grew from 14% to 17%. You can see from the charts illustrate a profit mix by segment, Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 80% of operating income in the second quarter of 2016. Fitness operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 20% to 27%. And Outdoor increased from 22% to 24%.","Looking at year-over-year gross margin by segment. All segments posted gross margin rate increase due to shifts in product mix. Total corporate operating margin increased from 21.5% to 24.7% due to gross margin improvement.","Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expense increased by about $10 million, or 4%. Research and development increased $5 million year-over-year, was flat as a percent of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and increasing resources, focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. Our advertising expense decreased $1.5 million over the prior year quarter, represented 5.5% of sales, a 50 basis point decrease. Additional advertising spend on Fitness was more than offset by decreases in Auto and Marine. SG&A was up $6 million compared to the prior year quarter, increasing 170 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.8%. Increase in SG&A were driven primarily by expenses associated with the addition of the DeLorme business, and compensation-related costs.","A few highlights from the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash marketable securities of about $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $510 million. Inventory balance decreased sequentially to $508 million. As we exit the seasonally strong second quarter, it remains higher year-over-year due to new product offerings.","From second quarter 2016, we generated free cash flow of $135 million, a $71 million increase from the second quarter of 2015. Also, during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $97 million, repurchased about $25 million of company stock, approximately $123 million remaining for purchase through December 2016.","As Cliff mentioned, we're updating our tax guidance and now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 19.5%.","This concludes our formal remarks. Jamie, can you open the line for Q&A? Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Co. Your line is now open.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks and thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a great quarter.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask, Cliff, it's been interesting, Garmin Elevate has been very helpful for you. This year, I wonder how much do you think the rest of the product portfolio can get penetrated with that technology? And then also just thinking about, as that's helped you this year, if I think about future versions of these products, are there other biometric sensors you feel like you can add so that this is a continuous trend for you as opposed to maybe a one or two-year phenomena?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, in terms of penetration of the heart rate technology, we have expanded it broadly across the line, as I mentioned in my remarks. I think we're mostly there. There's probably still a few areas where we believe we can add, and we will do so. But I think, for the most part, over the past year, we've been able to accomplish what we set out to do.","In terms of other sensors, we're certainly working on that as a lot of people say they are. I think the biggest challenge is the next level of sensing technology has to prove that it has utility for the customers and it has to be technologically feasible. And so I think we, like everyone else, is searching for that next breakthrough.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","And then follow-up question for me on gross margin. Very strong in Fitness and Outdoor in the quarter. I think implied in the guidance is that we come down a little bit off that level in the back half of the year. I'm wondering if you could talk about the puts and takes there.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the back half will certainly come down in terms of gross margin because of promotional activities and going into the fourth quarter.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Bollin, Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of items. The first one, looking at the Outdoor and Fitness businesses exiting 2Q, could you tell us your impressions of channel inventory, where it stands with a large number of products that you've launched? How you feel going into 3Q? And then also any impressions or thoughts you have longer term about the gross and operating margin profiles of those businesses? How are you managing them? What's kind of your targets? And then I have a follow-up.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Ben. So, in terms of channel inventory, especially with the launch of new products, I think it probably varies by regions and by stores, but in general, we feel like the inventory is in a good situation, we feel like our products were selling out well. So, we don't think that there is any issue with our new products stacking up in the channel.","In terms of growth and margins, certainly, we've been on a deliberate effort to improve our margins across all of our business segments. I would say that in Fitness, as the mix continues to shift towards the activity trackers that that profile will continue to have pressure on it. While in Outdoors, it's probably somewhat stable at its current trend levels.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then looking at the Automobile business, on a standalone basis, a little worse year-on-year performance there. Any adjustments to your thoughts longer-term? It's kind of been a declining mid-teens type business. Any reason it gets progressively worse from that level?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think what we saw so far in the first half of 2016 is that the European market has weakened more than what it had been up to that point. So, I think that's probably the big change in our outlook. But generally, we still feel like, it's a good market and we feel like we're doing very well in that market in terms of market share.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, I guess you mentioned the market share data and I believe it was the GPS-enabled smart watches, so that was helpful. In terms of activity trackers, can you provide any market share update for that particular subcategory?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Brad. The market share in activity trackers, we believe we're roughly at the 10% level in the U.S. market. Internationally, there's areas of strength and weakness across the whole world that we're actually doing very well in bigger European countries, and also in Asia.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. And then you've obviously come out with a lot of new products here in Fitness recently. Can you talk about the second half and how we should be thinking about the cadence of new products on a relative basis to first half? Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think the first half was, certainly, a big part of what we had planned for the year, but we still have some additional releases that we'll be announcing here in the second half, as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a few of them. But first, for clarification, can you remind us what your previous guidance was for year-over-year decline in the Auto segment?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","It was minus 15%.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So, you think the rest of the year will look more similar to what we saw in Q2?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think roughly similar, yes.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. And then if I look back now going back six quarters or more, you've had a nice run here in your Asia-Pacific business. And I'm wondering, is all of that attributable to Fitness wearables or are you seeing some broader strength beyond Fitness in that region?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","We're doing very well in Fitness and Outdoor wearables in that region.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Doug, do you have the impact from net deferred revenue drawdown in the quarter?","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yes. Overall, deferred revenue had a headwind of about $8 million. We anticipate probably full year, probably about an $0.08 to $0.10 headwind for revenue.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And then Cliff, a product question. You mentioned in your prepared script, vivomove, and this was an interesting one I think because, really, a departure from the look and feel of Garmin's activity trackers historically. And so I know it was just very recently launched, but do you have any early indications of sell-through on that device?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think it is still very early. I think that product appeals to a slightly different kind of customer than our traditional base, so we're waiting to see how it does.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","All right. Thanks, Tavis.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry Liu with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Jerry Yuan Liu - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you. Can we talk a little bit about some of the drivers for earnings in the second half of the year? It looks like your gross margin will be better compared to second half of last year. So it looks like this is \u2013 the lower year-over-year earnings in the second half this year are mostly has to do with higher OpEx, maybe higher advertising. Can you talk about any other drivers, potentially fewer product launches or anything else?","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yeah. As it relates to the gross margin in the back half, you'll see probably some improvement related to segment mix. They're primarily \u2013 but looking at the gross margins for the full year, we anticipate most of the segments for the full year to be comparable to 2015 except for Fitness, which Cliff quickly mentioned, probably be lower due to higher percentage of activity tracker wellness. We think that's probably going to be \u2013 fitness gross margins full-year probably in the low 50s%.","As it relates to expenses, a couple of things to think about expense in the back half, the first of which is relating to acquisitions. DeLorme will have full two quarters of expenses relating to DeLorme acquisition, as well as in 2016, this is the year we have a 53rd week, so we have one extra week of expenses in 2016 compared to the previous years.","And as it relates to advertising, we think that advertising probably as a percentage of sales will be comparable year-over-year. So, there'll probably be some increase in dollars, talking about for full year here, but in there, but as percentage of sales, we think advertising will be relatively comparable to 2015.","Jerry Yuan Liu - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just one question in terms of the different geographies. It looks like Americas was maybe a little weaker in the second quarter. I know you said EMEA was probably weaker, but maybe just some details on the Americas' growth rate. And then going forward, would you expect because of the depreciation in the pound, any need to maybe raise prices there and potentially any demand impact from that? Would any of that be factored into your guidance? Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jerry, I think in terms of all the factories you mentioned, it's definitely rolled into our guidance. Americas has been a little weaker for two reasons. One is that we are more exposed in this market, the Americas market, due to PND market cycles. So, that's one dynamic. And then the second thing is that the activity tracker market in the Americas is more competitive than what we see on the other areas of the world where we're doing comparatively better. So, those are two moving pieces there in terms of the Americas performance.","In terms of the specific impact of the pound, we're definitely working that situation, and much like what we did with the euro situation last year, there could be some impact on prices, but I think all of this is like threading a needle. You need to see where you have the ability and the power to raise prices and also where you do not and make the appropriate moves.","Jerry Yuan Liu - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Will Power with R.W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you. Maybe just a follow-up a bit on the previous question, thinking about the Americas and the competition you're seeing in wearables there. I think one of the market share leaders planning new products here in the second half of the year. So is that something that can stabilize year-over-year for you or should we expect that to actually worsen and be offset by this continued better performance in EMEA and APAC?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think longer term, we would expect the Americas to grow as well. But again, the near-term dynamics of the PND decline are outweighing the growth we've had in some of the other segments.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then I have a couple of financial questions. Just looking at R&D, at least on an absolute dollar basis, at a higher level this quarter. Is that the right number to look at moving forward as you move into Q3 and Q4, or there were some things that elevated that this quarter?","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yeah. So, as I mentioned, R&D will be increasing, primarily because of that DeLorme acquisition, which we'll be adding in there, and also as we add head count just for newer product introduction. So, we'll see overall from operating expenses, as percent of sales, will be increasing overall full year.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, all right. And then just on the buyback, I know you still have some remaining, but I wonder if you could just give us a broader thought process on use of cash once you exhaust that? Do you return to a buyback or how do you think about buybacks, cash, once you get through the current authorization?","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yeah. So, when look at \u2013 basically our goal is to return about 100% our free cash flow back to the shareholders between dividends and share repurchases. As it looks at share repurchases, we look at a number of things there, one of which, obviously, is our business conditions, as well as our market condition there, and we'll play that out depending upon how that goes throughout the rest of the year and the future.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul A. Simenauer - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. This is Paul Simenauer for Paul Coster. Thanks for taking my question. Can you confirm the DeLorme contribution to both margins and topline in 2Q? And in which segments can we expect incremental M&A, given the large cash balance?","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yes. So, in terms of DeLorme's contribution in margins, we don't break any of that down. I would say in terms of topline, it's attributed to the Outdoor segment. And it represented less than half of the overall growth that we had in the segment for the quarter.","In terms of our outlook for M&A, we don't really comment on our plans, of course, as you can understand. I think our strategy has always been to look for good fits in technology or product lines that would complement our overall portfolio. And that's what we've been doing, and that's what we continue to do.","Paul A. Simenauer - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. And then, a quick housekeeping. The recognition of deferred has slowed somewhat. How should we think about the timeline or recognize the full balance? I know you mentioned some incremental was booked this quarter but that seems like a one-off. Thank you.","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","As it relates to deferred revenue?","Paul A. Simenauer - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","So basically, in the second quarter, we had $8 million of headwind on deferred revenue, and for the full year, we're anticipating a headwind of our EPS of between 8% and 10%. So, probably a little bit less than that in the back half.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you. First, in terms of growth margins in the quarter, which obviously expanded quite a bit both in Fitness and Outdoor, could you help us quantify and understand the drivers behind that? I imagine there is some benefit from leverage but then other factors, like pricing or mix within those segments, that would be helpful.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Simona, I think probably the biggest factor I would attribute it to is the refreshing of our product lines and the ability to reset pricing with products and new features that are more competitive in the market. So, I think that's the main contributor. We're also very focused on product cost that we're working cost out of the products continually, and that's also had an impact on our business.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And then somewhat similar question in the PND segment, you also refreshed and rebranded that product line earlier in the year. Are you seeing a benefit there from the price increase that you were able to put in and is there a bit of a change in the trade-off that you are willing to strike in PNDs between pricing and volumes?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think we've definitely seen a benefit in the launch of the new lines. They have great new features that we believe are the best anywhere. But in terms of limits, certainly there is a limit in terms of pricing versus volume and our goals has been to maximize profitability.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So in other words, are you giving up a little bit of market share there as you try to price higher?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think we're certainly sensitive to pricing and profits in the segments, I will say. I think in terms of our current approach and the evidence of the market share that's out there, there could be some slight degradation of market share, but I think the evidence is very slight for that and in general we feel like our market share is still very strong, both globally and in the U.S.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then just lastly, what was the FX impact in the quarter?","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","The FX impact in the quarter was about $3 million of headwind, so a small amount.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial. Your line is now open.","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Seems like we don't hear Ivan.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Hello, I'm sorry. Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on an incredible quarter...","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ivan.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","...and really putting out some great products. My question is more about your marketing focus and your marketing spend. Now there are a lot of places where I expect to see Garmin presence and I do but there's a lot of places where I would either expect and hope to see the presence, especially in the wearables and even in the action camera, and I still don't see it. What is your overall big picture of marketing plan and do you see also more integration on a lot of your apps with, let's say, healthcare or fitness apps, or gym apps and things like that?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. In terms of product placement, certainly, there's puts and takes, but we think we're generally represented well at every major retailer. And we also have a very strong presence with the product that you mentioned, particularly in the Fitness and the Outdoor area in specialty retailers. So, generally, we've been working hard on expanding our retail presence. We've been working hard on improving the presentation of our products at retail over the past year. And we think that we've made a lot of progress.","In terms of integration of our apps with others, we already do quite a bit of that, for instance, we have integration with MyFitnessPal for nutrition tracking. And we also have integration on the cycling side with Strava as well. So, we're very open to partnerships and we've been demonstrating that.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Who do you see as like your strongest marketing partner?","Clifton A. Pemble - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we're our strongest marketing partner. We're focused on the Garmin brand and we're focused on partnerships that enhance the Garmin brand.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you. Congratulations, again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I saw that reference to the ADS-B contribution to the growth in Aviation in the quarter, and I'm just wondering if you could step back and give us a snapshot of where that opportunity is today. I know it's multi-year process. Is it still building? Is it going to become bigger and bigger contributor over the next couple of years for you? And is it still \u2013 are you still strongly positioned as you were a year or two ago there?","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Yes, in terms of where we're at, it's probably difficult to precisely nail it down, but we think it's somewhere in the 20% to 25% equipage that's occurred so far in the market with the vast majority of the equipage yet to come.","I think pilots and aircraft owners are just like everybody else, they'll probably \u2013 a lot of them will wait until the last minute so, we do see a building momentum as time goes on as we lead up to the 2020 deadline. In terms of how we're doing, I think we're doing very well, it's one of those areas where it's difficult to precisely nail down market share, but we believe our share so far in the equipped airplanes is north of 70%.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And Doug, how does the ADS-B product line impact the margin profile of aviation? Is it in line or potentially better?","Douglas G. Boessen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","It's in line.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","In line. All right. Thank you very much","Clifton A.

And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Kerri Thurston. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd.'s third quarter 2013 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and the related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet. An archive of the webcast and a related transcript will also be available shortly after the call.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market share, product introductions or future demand for our products are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning specific risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2012, which is on file with the SEC.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and CEO; and Kevin Rauckman, CFO and Treasurer. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier this morning, Garmin reported strong third quarter revenue and margin performance, with revenue growth in Fitness, Marine and Aviation largely offsetting declining revenues in PND. Consolidated revenues decreased 4% year-over-year. However, our non-Auto\/Mobile market segments grew 12% on a combined basis, contributing 50% of the total revenue and 65% of the operating profit in the third quarter.","Gross margins improved year-over-year to 55% from 53% in 2012, as deferred revenue was less of a headwind and segment mix improved slightly. Operating margins were 24%, consistent with the prior year, as gross margin improvement was offset by growing research and development spending. These strong results allowed us to generate $205 million of free cash flow in the quarter and raised our EPS guidance for the full year. Kevin will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but next, I'll walk through a review of our results, segment by segment. Starting first with Outdoor, revenues declined 4% as we faced a much stronger comparable in the third quarter of 2012. Gross and operating margins remained very strong in this segment at 69% and 44%, respectively. During the quarter, we announced our entry into the action camera market with the VIRB and VIRB Elite. This new family of products delivers industry-leading features to the action camera market, including sunlight readable color displays, GPS location awareness, extended battery life, integration with our broad range of fitness sensors and ability to control the camera via other Garmin devices.","We believe VIRB will be a catalyst for growth within this segment in 2014, and look forward to participating in this exciting new market. In the fourth quarter, we do not expect a significant change in revenue trajectory due to the late season launch of VIRB and due to the strong results in fourth quarter of 2012, when the segment delivered almost $120 million of revenue.","Turning next to the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 25% on a year-over-year basis, as our entire portfolio of products sold well in the summer season. Deliveries of Vector accelerated our cycling category, and contributed to the strong result in the segment. We delivered gross and operating margins of 61% and 33%, respectively, and operating income grew 25% in the quarter. We introduced a number of new products in the quarter, including the Forerunner 220 and 620. These watches delivered new features, and have captivated significant customer interest, including a high-resolution sunlight readable color display and real-time tracking through wireless connectivity with a smartphone. In addition, the Forerunner 620 offers an intuitive touch screen user interface and innovative running dynamics measurements to give runners powerful new tools to improve their performance. The form factor of the 220 and 620 establishes a new standard for running watches as they are lighter, thinner and more comfortable to wear for both running and everyday use.","In the cycling market, we launched the Edge Touring, designed for casual and commuter cyclists, which is our first product line specifically targeting this growing subset of the cycling community. Looking at 2014, we anticipate entering new adjacent markets, and we will continue to make investments that position us for long-term growth opportunities. In Aviation, we experienced another quarter of strong revenue growth of 15% with both OEM and aftermarket product categories contributing to the improvement. Operating income grew 37% in the quarter, ahead of revenue growth, due to the improvement in both gross and operating margins.","I'm very pleased to note Garmin received the AIN Avionics Support Award for the 10th consecutive year during the quarter. I congratulate our Aviation team on this amazing accomplishment, and thank them for their passion and dedication to being the best. Outstanding customer support, combined with superior products, are key differentiators as we compete for new opportunities.","We have made significant progress in finalizing deliverables required for avionics certification on the Learjet and Cessna platforms. We are actively supporting our OEM partners as they work to complete their respective aircraft certifications. Our near-term results have been positive. The Aviation market remains challenging, and this has been further intensified by shutdown-related furloughs at the FAA causing short-term delays in certifications, field approvals and shipments. While this may create headwinds in the fourth quarter, we continue to believe in our long-term growth story in this segment.","Revenue in the Marine segment grew 24% in the quarter, as we experienced stronger-than-expected demand across our range of new and existing products. While the segment was profitable in the third quarter, the margin structure remains challenged due to product mix and the competitive pricing environment of the market. As we approach the winter months, we are already anticipating the beginning of the 2014 marine season. We have a full line up of new products that will be announced in the coming weeks and delivered in time for the upcoming boating season. We are confident that an intensive focus on superior new products and innovation will lead to improved market share and profitability in this segment.","In our Auto\/Mobile segment, revenues were down 16% in the quarter, with PND unit volumes declining at a global rate of approximately 20%, which is in line with our expectations. This decline was partially offset by growth in our OEM and mobile categories, as well as the amortization of previously deferred revenues. The segment remains highly profitable with gross and operating margins of 46% and 17%, respectively. As we previously mentioned, we expect the PND market to decline approximately 20% on a global basis. While the PND market development has been and continues to be a significant headwind, we feel confident with our execution in 2013, and we will continue to carefully manage the business going forward.","As a final note in the Auto\/Mobile segment, OEM opportunities have been slow to develop, which is the nature of the Automotive business. We remain optimistic as Garmin navigation begins to play a significant role in the 2014 Mercedes-Benz lineup, and we continue to pursue new opportunities for software and hardware solutions. Finally, as stated in our press release, we are updating our guidance for 2013. Due to our strong performance in the third quarter, we now anticipate pro forma EPS of $2.40 to $2.45, with improved gross and operating margins, slightly offset by higher a anticipated tax rate. The PND market will continue to create headwinds for our top and bottom line. However, these headwinds will be partially offset by growth across our non-Auto\/Mobile market segments.","This concludes my remarks, and Kevin will now walk through our Q3 financials in more detail. Kevin?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Thank you, Cliff, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and segment results, then move to summary comments on the balance sheet, cash flow, taxes and guidance. We posted revenue of $644 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $136 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.69 per share, excluding foreign currency loss and a $52 million tax adjustment that I will discuss later. Our revenue represents a decrease of 4% year-over-year.","Gross margin came in at 55%, a 140 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment mix and reduced impact from deferred revenues. Our operating margin was 24%, down only 20 basis points from the prior year. The components were gross margin favorable by 140 basis points and an unfavorable operating expense impact of 160 basis points. Total operating expenses increased by $2 million in the current quarter, with reduced spending in advertising, offset by a $6 million increase in R&D. Each of the expense -- operating expense categories will be discussed in detail on a later slide.","Our pro forma EPS, which is adjusted for the foreign currency loss and the tax adjustment was $0.69, represents a 7% decrease year-over-year. We shipped 3.3 million units during the quarter, which represents a 12% decrease year-over-year, and our total company average selling price was $197 per unit, up from $182 in Q3 of 2012, driven primarily by segment mix and the amortization of previously deferred revenue. Cliff has summarized revenue changes by segment. However, I'd like to briefly highlight the charge on this page, which illustrates the Auto\/Mobile segment, representing 49% of our total revenue during Q3 as Fitness, Marine and Aviation grew during the quarter.","Looking at profitability by segment, our non-Auto\/Mobile segments delivered 65% of operating income in the quarter, an increase from 59% in Q3 of 2012. Fitness and Aviation each contributed an increasing proportion of total operating profit in Q3 due to revenue growth.","I'd like to briefly discuss year-over-year gross margin changes by segment. Total corporate gross margin increased by 140 basis points in the quarter, driven by improved margins in Auto\/Mobile and in Aviation. The Auto\/Mobile gross margin increased to 46% from 43% of the prior year, due primarily to amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenues. Marine and Fitness gross margins declined in the current quarter due to product mix and pricing dynamics during the quarter, and our total corporate operating margin was steady at 24%, with the increased gross margin offset by increased R&D spending of $6 million.","Looking briefly at year-to-date metrics, revenue contribution for 2013 is shifting toward our growth segments with Aviation, Fitness and Marine each growing in contribution, and a similar shift is occurring at operating income as well with 67% of our year-to-date operating income coming from our non-Auto\/Mobile segments. As previously mentioned, Q3 operating expenses increased by $2 million on a year-over-year basis from $199 million in Q3 of 2012 to $201 million in Q3 of 2013, while increasing 170 basis points as a percent of sales. R&D was the only expense category that increased with a $6 million year-over-year impact, and this represented a 150 basis point impact, as R&D increased to 14% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce with a heavy emphasis on Aviation. Our advertising spend decreased $4 million over the year ago quarter and decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 4% in Q3 of 2013. Much of the decrease was related to declining volumes in PND, as well as reduced promotional activity in Fitness. We will continue to scale our advertising expense to match our revenue trends.","SG&A was flat compared to the year ago quarter, increasing 60 basis points as a percent of sales to 13%. We are working diligently to manage these costs as our PND market declines. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of nearly $2.8 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $476 million due to declining sales in the quarter. Accounts receivable accounted for 66 days of sales compared to 66 days of sales in the second quarter and 65 days of sale in the third quarter 2012. Our inventory balance increased to $417 million on a sequential basis at the close of the third quarter in preparation for the stronger holiday quarter. Our days of inventory were 124 days compared to 116 days in the second quarter of 2013 and 125 days in the third quarter of 2012. We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $217 million during Q3. CapEx spending was $12 million during the third quarter. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $205 million during Q3. Our year-to-date free cash flow is on plan at $439 million.","We didn't pay a dividend in the third quarter due to the timing of our fiscal versus calendar quarter. We will pay 4 quarterly installments in the 2013 fiscal year, with 3 paid in the first half and a fourth dividend payment in the fourth quarter, and we repurchased 14 million of company stock and have 273 million still authorized through December of 2014.","I have a few more items to discuss relative to our Q3 announcement. Our pro forma effective tax rate for Q3 of 2013 was 15.7% compared to 13.7% in Q3 of 2012. The increased rate was primarily driven by an unfavorable change in income mix by taxing jurisdiction and reduced tax holidays in Taiwan. We did have a significant reserve release of $52 million in the quarter, which drove our GAAP effective tax rate negative. This represents an expiration in the statute of limitations for uncertain tax reserves. We now expect our full year pro forma tax rate to be 16%, an increase from 13.1% in 2012 due to the geographic mix of income. Finally, as Cliff previously discussed, we have updated our 2013 pro forma EPS guidance to be $2.40 to $2.45. Our current revenue forecast does anticipate that Auto\/Mobile will continue to be less than 50% of our total revenue in 2013.","This concludes our formal remarks. Operator, please open the line for Q&A at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","First question about VIRB. Can you give us a sense kind of so far what are you seeing in terms of market adoption? And as you look at the trends today, do you have any targets in terms of market share in that segment for 2014? And then maybe looking out a few years from now?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yair, this is Cliff. Right now, it's still very early days in terms of our rollout of the product, and as we mentioned, we don't expect that it will have a significant impact on Q4. And I think for 2014, again, it's very early days in a new market, and so we're not speculating yet in terms of market share, but we do believe we have a superior product, and we've heard a lot of good reports from our retailers that suggest that customers are interested in what we have to offer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one more, in terms of the Auto\/Mobile business, I noticed that the deferred revenue balances appear to be flat sequentially. I guess it's surprising given the fact that volumes seem to be decreasing. Can you give us a sense of what we should be anticipating in terms of the deferred revenue balance going towards the back -- the final quarter of the year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, thanks, Yair. You're exactly right. We had a nominal impact in Q3 on deferred revenues. And as we've stated in the past quarters, we're expecting that amortizations of our past deferrals are going to outweigh any of the incremental deferrals that we put on the balance sheet. So you should expect for the full year 2013 and then going forward that we'll continue to have a -- actually, a tailwind as we move forward in our business.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to see if you could give us some additional color in terms of the Marine business and some of the strength that you're seeing there, and whether you expect sort of this trend to persist throughout the rest of the year?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Jonathan. I think there's a couple of factors at play. As we've mentioned, our new products have been very well accepted by customers and the pricing environment has been favorable as well for customers as we clear out old inventory. So people are buying even later than what they traditionally do in the marine season. The weather situation for 2013 probably delayed the season somewhat. So we were seeing later buying than what we usually do, but we also see some of those trends continuing in the fourth quarter, as particularly, our OEM systems are doing very well, and boat builders are now ramping up production for 2014.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just in terms of the new Vector power meter systems, I mean, did you have sort of a backlog of orders in advance? Was there sort of a onetime lift from -- in the new product release? Just want to get a sense of how you're seeing maybe the linearity of demand for Vector and continuation to the current quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Jonathan. We did see an initial bump from what we call pipeline fill of that product, and there was pent-up demand. As you know, the product was widely known in advance of its release. But now that, that bubble has kind of gone through, we're seeing more of the static demand, if you will, which is certainly a lower level than what we experienced in the initial stages of the deliveries, but still what we would call strong for a product like this. It's a very niche product.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask a couple more questions on the Fitness segment. I think you referenced some pricing dynamics there. So if you can just expand on what you're seeing in the pricing environment and what your expectations are as we get into next year. And then could you size the impact of the Vector for the quarter, and what you're assuming for the fourth quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, let me take the easy one first. We don't ever break down by product segment, so we aren't breaking down Vector, but we do believe that it has a second order effect with our overall biking products, which were strong in the quarter.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Fitness pricing?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think it's marine pricing, Simona, is that correct?","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It was on Fitness.","Clifton A. Pemble","Okay, thank you. So Fitness pricing, in general in the past year, actually, a year ago in Q3, we introduced the Forerunner 10, and that has been a significant success for us in terms of market share and volume. But as you know, the ASP is lower so we have seen those pricing drift lower in the running segment, but it's very strong in terms of volumes. Our high end continues to be strong in the 910. And now with the introduction of our 620 and 220, we're clearing out product transition in the -- in some of the other product ranges, which will then boost the pricing going forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","You guys made a reference in the slides on Fitness to adjacent market opportunities, and I think there had been talk maybe earlier this year that, that would happen this year, and that looks like more next year. I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more color there.","Clifton A. Pemble","I think we've talked about that being more of a 2014 opportunity for us, and we're not at the point where we can offer any details in terms of what we have in mind there, but we continue to invest and look for new opportunities in -- across all of our segments in adjacent product categories.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Great. And then, on Aviation, you mentioned the impact of government shutdown. I wonder if you could help quantify that for us. Obviously, Aviation continue to grow and outgrow the markets. What is it going to look like in Q4 for you guys?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, so far, it's pretty much been on a similar trajectory. We did experience some blip because of the shutdown. Basically, any kind of field approval that was occurring with the installation of avionics, aircraft registrations, certifications, all those things are basically shut down for the period that the government was in the shutdown mode. So we saw that as a blip, and the industry is quite sensitive. So we don't know, as we roll into Q4, what the impact of ongoing budget talks will be as we move towards the end of the year. So we're maintaining kind of a conservative outlook there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I look at the Fitness division for next year and just trying to get a sense of how you developed product planning, and what will kind of -- in what will become an even more competitive market next year, perhaps, how you think about your discipline in R&D spending, which segments of the market you might double down into or push deeper into? And how you kind of plan for higher unit growth next year, but lower ASP trends? For example, should we be looking for a $99 Forerunner watches next year? Just some financial parameters so that you may be able to hold operating margins in this division.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Mark, thanks for the question. I think we feel like we have a very disciplined process in terms of analyzing what our expectations are for not only growth, but also what we need to do in terms of development of new products. So Cliff's already talked a little bit about some of the Fitness products, whether it's Vector or the Forerunner 220 and 620. Those have been planned for quite some time, and we've put a product roadmap together that makes an estimate what our businesses are going to be at every level within the segment. And so if we look out a year from now or even a couple of years from now, we have an estimate of what each of our product categories are going to do, whether it's running or cycling or some of the new products like Vector. So we believe we've got a pretty good handle on what the new products are going to do and how they're going to contribute to our bottom line. You can see from the margin results that it served us pretty well.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I see. So if I extrapolate your discipline on just the growth and also the profitability and the margin, are there any reasons why corporate earnings on a consolidated level would not increase next year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","You're asking for a formal guidance number, and we're really not ready to talk about 2014 yet. I think some of the trends that you've seen with the continuing secular decline on Auto\/Mobile with growth across the other segments is what we would expect to see, but we're really not prepared to talk about 2014 EPS expectations at this point.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But it does seem very process-oriented in terms of the way you're running your product portfolio as opposed to, I guess, other vendors that are moving into this market of Fitness and wearable technology. But then it's really spaghetti on the wall, but I guess, a lot of it is very disciplined focus, I think, on your part.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, again, we know what our pricing points are going to be. We've got our plan to address the demand of our customers, and so we feel -- we still feel like we've got some good opportunity for growth, especially in these non-Auto\/Mobile segments.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Kevin, first, a clarification on the free cash flow. Have you given us a guidance for that previously for full year, and kind of looks like about $600 million of free cash flow flat year-over-year next quarter. Is that kind of a reasonable guess at this point?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, we had given an estimate of about $525 million of free cash flow, and through the third quarter, we're sitting at $439 million. So we're well on plan for that. We feel good about our overall free cash flow generation for the year.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Cool. And Cliff, I think 3 for you. First, on the Vector, I mean, I guess is it fair to ask in terms of -- is it actually working customer response? Obviously, this was in -- had been delayed for a number of years due to kind of quality issues and wanting to perfect that a little bit more. What has been your experience in terms of the customer response so far?","Clifton A. Pemble","So far the experience has been very positive, and it's been working as we expected. We believe the accuracy and the ease-of-use installation and portability of the product met all of the goals that we had in mind.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And a PND question, your biggest competitor reported this morning, and I think they're talking similar kind of metrics for the industry, but definitely framing it as Garmin taking share in the U.S. and Garmin losing share in Europe. Would you be willing to comment on that as being kind of consistent with what you're seeing? And then also, if I adjust for the deferred revenues, it looks like ASPs in that segment, PNDs are kind of roughly flattish. Is that an appropriate conclusion to draw?","Clifton A. Pemble","ASPs were roughly flat, and in terms of share, yes, according to NPD, the share in the U.S. has definitely grown. I think, in Europe, our view is that we probably held steady. Some of the countries, the bigger countries, we gained some share based on product innovation, and then some of the other countries are a little harder to track. The tracking agencies over there have soft reporting on some countries because the market has gone down due to economic and other reasons so -- but in general, our view is that it's probably held steady in Europe.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Bright with Avondale Partners.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Cliff, first question. You seem to express some optimism on Auto OEM. What's driving that optimism? And along the same lines, what are you going to be able to do to combat the incumbency question that exists as you're competing to get into the auto market?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think to add some color to my comments, I would say we were expressing some realism in terms of the fact that it's slow to develop. We still believe that we have unique value to offer in the industry through our solutions, and that's been borne out through J.D. Power kind of results and things that show the customers really appreciate the solutions that we have. But what you're highlighting in terms of incumbency is absolutely true and is a big headwind. Some of these suppliers have been embedded in the system for a long time, and we realize it takes some time to break in.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Second question, Kevin, it's for you. It does go to '14, and I recognize you're not giving guidance, but you've done a terrific job managing your OpEx and the realities of the puts and takes of revenue, the last quarter and this quarter, in particular. As you look forward to '14, do you have the leverage to pull to continue to manage, particularly your SG&A and your advertising expense?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think we've chosen to make certain decisions on both of those areas. I think on the SG&A, we do believe that we have managed that pretty well in a period where we've got a strong headwind on PND. Going forward, we do not expect that we would need to increase SG&A significantly. On the advertising, I think we'll look at it more as a percent of sales and hold it pretty consistent. We've got -- we have some new product categories that we'll be introducing and have introduced, and so we look at that kind of the key metric is the whole advertising consistent as a percentage of sales as we go forward.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Let me squeeze one last one in for you, Kevin. I assume the potential headwinds from the FAA furloughs and Aviation that you talked about, that's built into your guidance expectations?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, and we didn't really -- we haven't really changed our guidance for the full year on the top line. So we've definitely baked that in into our Q4 expectations.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Kevin, if you could just give us some sense of anything unusual in terms of channel inventory going into the fourth quarter, and the unrelated question actually is in Fitness and in other segments, maybe Outdoor as well, it looks like software that's listed on your PC, on your tablet, is an increasingly important part of the value proposition to the consumers as they sort of try to analyze their activity. What percentage of your R&D investment is going into software now?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well when we first of all talk about channel inventories, because of the decline in the overall market of PND, we've seen less seasonality in Q4. So really, what used to be somewhat of an issue on -- or at least a challenge in inventory management is less so. We don't really have any issues that we're aware of in the channel. We're -- it's pretty clean going into the fourth quarter with our retail customers. So no major issue there. In terms of the software, I don't think we've really ever quantified that. Software is a key part of our investment across Fitness, Outdoor, pretty much every segment, even Aviation. If you look at the number of people we have working on content and software, it's substantial within our business. So we really never quantified how much that is.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And related to that, do you expect to bring out a sort of platform in relation to VIRB to allow people to basically process their video and then publish?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Paul, we actually already have a utility available for our users that's called VIRB EDIT, which basically allows them to process the videos, edit them, and the unique value that we offer in the market is that a lot of the sensors that customers are using in streaming activities can be overlaid on top of the video so you can see speed, acceleration, heart rate, all these kinds of things. So that tool is already out there and available. And in terms of sharing, most people tend to share over common means like YouTube and others that are out there. So that's not something that we're doing, but we're at least providing the tools for people to be able to create the videos that they like.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, you guys had pretty good Auto margins in Q3, and trying to think about 2014 in terms of the OEM spend, is there -- was there a greater spend in support of that business in 2013? And sort of all things similar in 2014, would you expect similar types of spending levels or has that been coming down or was that at all a help in Q3?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think we don't break down by category, other than Auto\/Mobile, but clearly, with the declining PND business, we've spent less this year on our operating expenses, but -- and we have increased on the OEM -- Auto OEM side in order to innovate and bring about new opportunities and platforms in that area. Going into 2014, I think, again, we haven't settled on any numbers yet for 2014. We're evaluating our 2014 budget now. But I think, in general, we will continue to spend less on PND, and slightly up potentially in Auto OEM, as we pursue opportunity there around the world.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then Cliff, on the K2 system that you've been working on, is it simply incumbency that's the problem? Or have you found that there are any features or aspects to that, that are maybe falling short of what the OEMs are looking for?","Clifton A. Pemble","I don't really see features as being an issue. I think the vision for K2 is pretty encompassing that touches a lot of things in the vehicle. So the scale of the project involving K2 is probably pretty significant. So that's maybe one factor that OEMs might be considering in terms of what they -- what effort they have to go through to incorporate the system. But in addition, it's a very conservative industry, so they tend to choose suppliers with known track records, and building that track record is obviously a challenge.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Makes sense. And then just lastly, your operating income trajectory is obviously improving, and I'm wondering, are you still thinking about returning cash to shareholders primarily through the dividend? And when would you possibly look to raise that? What time of the year do you address that?","Kevin S. Rauckman","We look at the dividend decision. Our board discusses that in the first half of the year, and then we -- because we're a Swiss parent company, we actually have to have -- get Swiss shareholder approval in our Annual Meeting. So it will be in the first half of 2014, specifically in the second quarter because we already have approval to pay a dividend through Q1 of 2014, not only dividend, but I also want to emphasize stock buyback. Those are the 2 primary means in which we return our cash to shareholders.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Kristine Liwag, calling in for Ron. My question is in Aviation, can you give us an update of the expected ramp of the R&D spend on new aircraft development programs?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think we commented this year on the reason why our increased R&D is there, primarily due to Aviation, and we have -- we're gaining share in the business jet space, and we're going to be -- have every anticipation to continue. So at this point, we would expect, not only our top line Aviation business to grow double digits, but we would also need to continue to ramp our R&D to be able to serve the customers in that industry.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. And as a follow-up, for Aviation margins to get back into the 30s level, is it a function of shifting from development to production or the business jet cycle taking off, or taking cost out of the system? How should we think about this? And also, any information on timing would be helpful.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, Kristine, as you know, these programs are very intense in R&D, and that continues to be, and will be in the future, our biggest portion of the spend within the segment. I think, historically, there were times we were around that level, but it was probably driven by different kinds of factors in terms of our product mix, and which are different today. So I think in order to serve these OEM opportunities, I don't believe that, that level is as easy to achieve as it was in the past. And the most important thing is to be able to win and execute on the programs.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you, and I think that concludes our earnings call today. So thank you very much for listening, participating. We look forward to closing out the year and updating everyone shortly thereafter. So thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"10286":["Garmin Ltd.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Teri Seck. You may begin.","Teri Seck - Garmin Ltd.","Good morning. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Limited's third quarter 2017 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcript will also be available on our website.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, growth and operating margins, and future dividend, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter consolidated revenue of $743 million, up 3% over the prior year. Outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness collectively increased 9% year-over-year, and contributed 75% of total revenues.","Gross margin improved to 58.4% and operating margin improved to 22.8%. GAAP EPS was $0.78 and pro forma EPS was $0.75 in the quarter.","Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to make a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. Beginning with the outdoor segment, revenue grew 31% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong demand for wearables.","Gross and operating margins expanded to 64% and 37%, respectively, while operating income grew 38% over the prior year. We experienced strong demand for the f\u0113nix 5 watch series and expect this trend to continue throughout the holiday quarter. In addition, we experienced solid growth of inReach devices and subscription services. We recently announced our entry into two new product categories with the introduction of Descent, our first wearable for the dive market and the Impact bat sensor, our first product for the baseball market.","The Descent is a beautifully designed smartwatch with integrated dive computer functions and electronic logs managed through Garmin Connect. The Impact bat sensor delivers instantaneous feedback on the device, while coaches and players can see further details using the Impact mobile app. Looking forward, we remain focused on the wearable opportunity and expanding into new product categories.","Turning next to aviation, we reported strong revenue growth of 16% driven by growth in both OEM and aftermarket categories. Gross and operating margins came in at 73% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% over the prior year. We recently announced the TXi series of touchscreen flight displays that offer enhanced integration features and target a broad range of aftermarket aircraft from light singles to business jets. We also started shipping the GFC 600, our first aftermarket autopilot solution. These new products are welcome additions to our line-up and further expand addressable market opportunities. Looking forward, we are focused on maximizing ADS-B mandate opportunities and gaining share in the OEM market.","Looking next at marine, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by growth in multiple product lines and led by strong demand for our fishfinders and chartplotter combos. Gross and operating margins were 58% and 24%, respectively. We recently completed the acquisition of Navionics, a leading worldwide provider of electronic marine content and mobile applications. Combining content from both Navionics and Garmin will result in best available breadth and depth of coverage for our marine customers.","For the third consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of the Year. This award, along with eight product of excellence awards, affirms our commitment to designing, manufacturing and selling industry-leading products for the marine market. Consistent with that commitment, we announced the 2018 line-up of marine electronics, which include updated echoMAP and STRIKER models with Wi-Fi capability, enabling connected boating experiences. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovations and gaining share in the inland fishing category.","Moving next to fitness, revenue declined 12%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers and product introduction timing, partially offset by strong growth in our running product lines .","Gross margin improved to 58%, while operating margin decreased year-over-year to 20%. Our product line-up is very strong as we enter the holiday quarter. Recent product launches include the v\u00edvoactive 3 with wrist-based payments, the v\u00edvomove HR analogue watch, with wrist heart rate and smart notifications and the ultra-slim v\u00edvosport activity tracker with built-in GPS and smart notifications. In addition, we launched our v\u00edvofit jr. 2, featuring Disney, Star Wars, and Marvel-themed bands and mobile app adventures. Looking forward, we're focused on areas of opportunity, particularly in the advanced wearable category.","Looking finally at the auto segment, revenue declined 12% due to the ongoing PND market contraction, partially offset by solid growth in OEM and niche product categories, such as cameras, truck, fleet and RV. Our global market share in the PND category remains very strong. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 44% and 8%, respectively. We recently launched Garmin Speak with Amazon Alexa, which is the first digital assistant with integrated turn-by-turn navigation. We also started shipping the eLog device in time for the upcoming electronic data logging mandate for truck operators. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to optimize profitability in this segment.","Well, the three quarters of the year behind us, we are updating our projected revenue for the year to $3.07 billion, an increase of about 2% over 2016.","Projected gross margin remains at approximately 57.5%, but we are raising our projected operating margin to approximately 21.5% for the full year. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.90, assuming an updated pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 21.5%.","Looking at guidance by segment, we've increased growth expectations for outdoor, aviation, and auto by 200 basis points to 300 basis points. Our outlook for marine is unchanged, while the outlook for fitness has been reduced slightly by 200 basis points.","That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details of our financial results. Doug?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $743 million for the third quarter, representing 3% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.4%, a 220-basis point increase from the prior year, driven primarily by segment and product mix.","Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.5%, a 140-basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $170 million, a 6% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 22.8%, a 70-basis point increase from the prior year, as the increase in gross margin more than offset the increase in operating expenses.","Our GAAP EPS was $0.78 and our pro forma EPS was $0.75, consistent with the prior year.","Next, we'll look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 3% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in three of our five segments. For the third quarter 2017, outdoor grew 31%, while aviation grew 16% and marine grew 10%.","This growth was partially offset by the continued decline in auto PND business, and decline in our fitness segment, which was primarily due to a significant decline in basic activity tracker category. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness were up 9% compared to the prior year quarter.","Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 75% of total revenue in third quarter 2017, compared to 70% in the prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 19% to 25% and aviation grew from 15% to 17%. As you can see from charts illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments, collectively, delivered 91% of operating income in the third quarter 2017, compared to 84% in third quarter 2016.","Looking next at operating expenses, our third quarter operating expenses increased by $18 million, or 7%. Research and development increased to $130 million, or 17.4% of sales, a 130-basis point increase year-over-year. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing the resources focused on our fitness, outdoor, marine, and aviation segments, where we see long-term growth opportunities.","SG&A was up $5 million compared to prior year quarter, increased 30 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.7%. Our advertising expense was relatively flat to the prior quarter, so additional spend in the outdoor segment was offset by decreases in all other segments.","A few highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $457 million, which is relatively flat year-over-year.","The inventory balance increased sequentially to $575 million to prepared for the fourth quarter and was higher year-over-year due to several new product launches at the end of third quarter 2017. During the third quarter 2017, we generated free cash flow of $153 million. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million and purchased approximately $11 million of company stock, and about $1 million remaining for purchase through December 2017.","The effective tax rate was 20.8% in the current year quarter, compared to 16.5% in the prior year quarter. Increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions to international tax initiatives and income mix by tax jurisdiction, partially offset by the release of income tax reserves in the third quarter 2017. We expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5%.","This concludes our formal remarks. Jody, can you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on the auto business. Talk about growth in the OEM and other niche products. Can you help quantify that a bit? Did OEMs see an inflection, and if so, what was that driven by?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, we don't quantify any of the particular categories within our segments, but I would say that auto has been performing well this year, particularly around new programs such as the Honda programs as well as our existing programs with Daimler and others.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. My other question was in the fitness category. Last quarter, we kind of talked about the declines in the activity tracker market. Did the activity tracker business decline again sequentially, and if so, does that put it kind of below one-third of fitness sales? And then a quick question, just on the impact of FX. Can you quantify what that was or how that impacted growth on a year-on-year basis in third quarter and what your expectation is for, for the contribution in the fourth quarter as well?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, so activity trackers declined on a year-over-year basis. We don't really track sequentially, but year-over-year, as we said in our remarks, they continue to decline. In terms of quantifying what those represent, we don't comment on specific categories, but as the decline has been fairly steep, I would say that the basic trackers have become much less of an influence in our overall results.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. This is Doug. Regarding the FX impact, for Q3, there was about a $13 million tailwind. Assuming that we have similar FX levels currently, we would expect a Q4 tailwind to be similar to what we saw in Q3.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. I was hoping you could give a little more color on the drivers of the aviation growth. It sounds like it's pretty balanced between OEM and aftermarket, but if you could talk about the prospects for growth and the two pieces of that, and if there's anything you could say about maybe the growth prospects for that into 2018, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, as we remarked, OEM and aftermarket categories both grew in the quarter. I think that we have been fairly hesitant to call a growth inflection on OEM, because I think seeing trends in the market and trying to establish those has been difficult in this market, but it is encouraging. In terms of the aftermarket size, as we remarked, ADS-B is a significant driver of growth in that area, and there is also pull-through effects of other equipment that we're selling as people upgrade their aircraft. That will continue into 2018 and 2019, as well as the mandate that operators have to comply with as at the end of 2019.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. And then on the marine segment, can you talk about Navionics, kind of what the revenue run rate was there, how much we think that might contribute in the fourth quarter or sort of on an annualized basis on a trailing basis if you could do that?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. On an annualized basis, it's approximately $30 million. In Q4, it's the seasonally lowest quarter for any marine business, so we're not expecting any significant impact on our Q4.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. And then in terms of tax rate, again looking out to next year, any reason to assume a meaningful deviation from the tax rate you just provided for this year?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. We'll give you more color on that in February when we give our 2018 guidance, but we expect it to be relatively similar to what you're seeing currently. We'll update you if anything changes while we're going through our planning process with that.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Kristine Liwag in for Ron. I was wondering, when you think about industry investments in autonomous systems, can you discuss any technology that you have in aviation that you're introducing or can introduce into the autos market?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think you know there's a lot of investment going in the auto market for sure. Our focus has really been in other categories such as aviation and marine. We do have sensor technology and attitude technologies that could be useful, but our focus is really on our primary markets.","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And in aviation, can you quantify the market opportunity for ADS-B and what your market share is today?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So in terms of overall market, we believe there's somewhere around 100,000 to 120,000 aircraft that will be equipped over time. We're approximately 20% to 25% through that cycle; and up to this point, we've been commanding in terms of unit share approximately 75% of the market.","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Kristine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yuuji Anderson of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. And another follow up on aviation. The full-year guidance, it looks pretty conservative for Q4. So just curious to hear what are the puts and takes we should be thinking about there?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So Q4, we are up against a stronger comparable from last year. So that's factored into our thinking. Also it's the end of the year, so while aviation tends to be a little more steady business, certainly some of that business will slow down in terms of overall activity as people think about holidays and so forth. So, we're putting something out there that we believe is achievable. And that's the situation as we see it right now.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that makes sense. And on aviation margins, just on the downtick we're seeing there, is that related to your investments in that area, and if so, over what kind of horizon should we expect to see regain the operating leverage?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think in terms of the gross margin, there's some puts and takes quarter-to-quarter, but we did have some additional warranty expenses for the quarter that impacted our gross margin, but we would expect that to normalize as we go forward.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks so much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Hey. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you, Joe.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","I want to start with Doug on operating expenses. Doug, to the extent you're willing, can you talk through the go-forward trajectory, specifically I'm wondering whether the R&D and SG&A trajectories change. This year R&D is up by about $50 million, SG&A by about $10 million. So, is that 2017 inflation rate the reasonable go-forward growth assumption or does the 2017 contain any kind of exceptional or one-time investments?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. Well, obviously, we'll go through and can give you a little more color on that in February 2018, but we expect similar type of run rates going forward.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And can you remind us of the impact of last year's 4Q's, 14th week on OpEx, did you run through a full extra week?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. Sure should give you a little impact on the 53rd week. On the revenue line item, there was about $18 million relating to that one week, and then as it relates to operating expenses, there was about $10 million of operating expenses.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Great. And then Cliff, quickly, do you have any early insights on vivoactive 3 from kind of a market perception or from the perception of the discussions with your partners, the influencer reviews looked decent. So, talk perception and maybe some view on selling dynamics as well, since it looks like supply is still pretty limited here in early November, especially for the high-end variant?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, I think so far the feedback has been favorable on the device. I think people appreciate the device for its size, for the features and what we brought to the market. We're still rolling out additional features in the product as well. Our Garmin Pay will launch later this month. So, there's still more work to be done. In terms of channel sell in, we're still shipping products into the channel, so there's probably some constraints that are still out there, but we're still filling in anticipation of the Q4 selling season.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And finally also on wearables, do you expect to feel any quantifiable impact from TomTom's exit especially in Europe?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think particularly they were strong in certain European countries and we've positioned ourselves in that market to be able to try to pick up as much of that share as possible.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Good morning.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","I wanted to start, when you look at the outdoor performance notably with f\u0113nix, how much of the growth you're seeing do you feel is organic versus refresh to existing, a couple other parts to that. How much do you \u2013 channel expansion do you think is left and what are your thoughts on carrying of the portfolio from here? Can pricing keep going higher? Can you continue to expand that? And then a follow up for Doug? Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. So, in terms of I think maybe your question was around, how much of our sales are going to perhaps existing customers who are upgrading. We definitely see some of that, especially people that bought into the early generations of f\u0113nix, but we're also expanding the base quite a bit. And I think f\u0113nix is becoming a brand name that's associated with both adventure lifestyles and aspirational lifestyles and so we're seeing some expansion because of that. In terms of our future roadmap and pricing, certainly we have a very active roadmap. So, I can't comment on the details of that, but our goal is to be able to continue to bring innovation to the market and to be able to keep an established price point as we go forward.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","And Cliff, I'm sorry and Doug when you look at the aviation capacity expansion could you remind us how much CapEx is left, when does that capacity come online and how quickly do you expect to fill that capacity? Thanks.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, as it relates to CapEx that we have, so basically, we have about $130 million that we're expecting for CapEx this year, about $70 million or so of that is relating to the late expansion here. And we expect to continue with expansion for the next couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson of Dougherty and Company. Your line is open.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. So just looking at outdoor, the sort of the 200 basis point guide up on the growth rate and then fitness the 200 basis point sort of downtick. I wonder if you could just speak to what's outperforming in outdoor relative to your earlier expectations and what's underperforming in fitness relative to your earlier expectations and then I've got a follow-up.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. So, outdoor, f\u0113nix again as we've remarked has been doing very well also our inReach devices and subscription-based services that have been doing very well. So, that's the primary drivers behind the increase in outdoor. In fitness, as we've been saying the basic activity tracker market has been in steep decline, so that's been an impact on us throughout this year. And also our product introduction timing came later this year versus what it did in 2016. And so those two factors impacted both the outdoor and fitness. I would mention that if you combine those two and look at the combined revenues and the growth on a year-to-date basis, we're up 7% in both outdoor and fitness combined, which reflects, I think a better picture of the overall wearable category and where it's going.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Great. And then sort of my follow-up is related to fitness. So, I think the guidance calls for and it sort of always has stabilization to a degree in Q4, I know there's new product introductions that are helping that. But I wonder, as you look out over the next few years, is it your view that what sort of the mix changing that you are going to start to stabilize there. And then what's your long-term outlook on sort of the margin profile of that business? Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, naturally we are looking for and hope for a stabilization out there. I would remind people that this is a consumer market, so we don't know exactly where it goes and it can change rapidly, as we've seen in the activity tracker market, but our strategic focus is on a healthy growing market. And the second part of your question, I'm sorry?","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Was the long-term margin profile of that business?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, I think for fitness, we're targeting you know mid-50s and a 20% kind of range in terms of operating margin.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Elliot Arnson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is Elliot Arnson on the line for Brad Erickson. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering on auto with the implied \u2013 with the improved guidance for this year, was wondering if that implies better or I guess muted declines of PNDs going forward?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. We still see PNDs running in the same trajectory as what we've been seeing. The improved outlook is really around the OEM outperformance as well as some of the new categories that we're shipping into the market such as Speak the eLog.","Elliot Arnson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks. And then just another question kind of around fitness. I was wondering if you guys are seeing \u2013 if you guys are planning like a similar product evolution in fitness is kind of what there's been in the outdoor segment kind of with more fashion-type form factors with those products?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I can't really comment on the future plan, but as I mentioned with outdoor, we've got a very active product roadmap in fitness as well, and so we'll continue to introduce new products as we go forward.","Elliot Arnson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Elliot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial. Your line is open.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Thank you for taking my call and congratulations on another great quarter.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Ivan.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","And the introduction of a lot of great new products. Those new marine products and the dive watch was incredible. Now the new Impact swing sensor to me looks like a totally new direction for a product or product line. Could you give us some idea of some of the things you're thinking about, what new areas you'd like to be going into?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So you're right. Impact definitely is a new category for us. It's a totally different market. I think like many products that we deliver here at Garmin, they're driven by our own passions within the company. So this is something we wanted to explore and we thought we had some innovation we could bring to the market. In terms of other categories we're exploring, I really can't give any color on that right now, but I would say that we are actively working on some new things and we should have some new things to offer in the coming year.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Now would this be, the Impact be something you could also use on a tennis racket? Could you design something for tennis for example?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, I think the physics are fundamentally similar. I think at this point we don't have any thoughts around that particular market, but I think the platform is something that could be extended to tennis.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Then I have one more question about your app platform. Pretty much for all the apps, you have an extensive number of apps that are available for a lot of your products, but occasionally like some of the developers, so you could pay them if you want, but there's no formal process. Do you plan on eventually having a more formal process for applications to be marketed and new partnerships and people let's say could buy apps and you can participate in the revenue for that?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think you're probably talking about Connect IQ on our watch platform. And so the answer is, yes. We do have monetization in our roadmap for Connect IQ, and that's something we're working with our developers on.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. A couple of financial ones. First, as it relates to the jury verdict against you in the quarter, was there any accrual related to that in Q3 or in the Q4 guidance or is there no accrual because of the appeal?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So Tavis, yes, we went through that process. And right now we have concluded that it's not probable. We have a loss based upon the accounting terms. And so we do not have an accrual recorded for any of the Navico. But we did file our Q this morning to give full disclosure transparency to the situation and we did indicate that it's reasonably possible that we could incur a loss up to $114 million, but no accrual is probable at this time.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And then the inventory balances look like they were up quite a bit year-over-year and I know sometimes Septembers can be a little tough to gauge in that regard due to holiday shipping. Is that, I guess, maybe give us an update on where we should expect inventory balances either in terms of days or turnover over time.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. Sure. So Tavis, at end of Q3, we had a few things, one of which you know we had strong demand for you know finished product, aviation products. Also it was relating to the timing, some of the product launches. So we had a large number of product launches here in the Q3, so we had to build up for that. So the inventory was higher here in Q3. Sequentially going into Q4, we should expect that to go down, but year-over-year Q4 2017 versus Q4 2016, we'll still be up.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got you. And then when you referenced the foreign currency benefit I think $13 million, was that relative to year-over-year or sequential?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","That's the year-over-year.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then final question, it looks like the full-year advertising expense is going to be pretty flattish after a number of years of growth. Do you think you've kind of reached a run rate level there or is that just kind of the result of the fitness business coming down and not reallocating that spend somewhere else?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think it's probably a combination of both, Tavis. I think definitely we've realigned our spending around fitness in terms of the opportunity there, and targeting where we see potential for growth. And then, also really kind of fixing our number around what we think is a sustainable run rate going forward.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And then, I wanted to make sure I understood one aspect of the guidance in the auto business, to get to that full year kind of mid-teens. I'm getting to about a mid-teens decline in Q4 as well, which I just want to make sure that's kind of what you guys expect because again answering one of the other questions, you kind of sounded a little more optimistic than that on that business?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So the implied Q4 is minus 14%, which is slightly ahead of where we had started the year.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got you. Cool. Great. Thanks a lot.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Tavis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my follow up. I just had a question just to the extent that you'll comment on sell-in versus sell-through dynamics on the f\u0113nix thus far?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","I think for f\u0113nix, sell-in and sell-through is pretty much normalized. We've spent part of Q2 and into Q3 building the channel and I think at this point we feel like the channel is mostly stabilized.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then, my other question was heading into the holiday season, how do you expect your store footprint to be this year fairly comparable to prior years?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","I think we definitely have all of the same doors that we've had in the past for sure. In some cases, the shelf space within those doors has been expanding. For example at Best Buy, our overall shelf space has been expanding there. But we're also expanding into other channels as well. For instance, we're in Macy's. We're in several jewelry chains, such as Kay, Zales and Jared, we'll be in Dillard's and JCPenney as well.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking my follow up.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Audrey Preston - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. This is actually Audrey on for Rob Spingarn. So thank you for taking my question. So, I would just like to follow up on avionics. So, first could you quantify some of your market share going into the OEMs? Like I know that you've mentioned that you're running around 75% of market share in aftermarket, but how much does is that for the OEMs on the planes, and do you have any outlook on that moving forward?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. So, in terms of market share the previous comment was around specifically ADS-B, which is one particular product category within mostly the aftermarket segment. So that's where the 75% number came from. In terms of OEM, our market share really depends on the product or the aircraft category. So, in the smaller piston-engine aircraft category, it's north of probably 90%, but as you move up into the various categories particularly beyond light jets then our share starts to come down.","Audrey Preston - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Great. Thank you. And then just digging a little bit deeper on the margins as well. So \u2013 and on the R&D spend, could we talk a little bit about how much of that R&D spend is allocated to avionics versus say outdoors and how much would that be impacting the margins?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, relating to \u2013 you were saying to aviation versus outdoor, we actually do break out the R&D with each all of our segments in our Q, so you can get that from our Q.","Audrey Preston - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Okay.","Audrey Preston - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then just digging in a little bit more into the warranties. How much do you see that moving forward in terms of impacting margins say in Q4 or the 2018?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. We probably think that was a one-time hit on that warranty that hits in Q3. We don't expect that specific item that we referred to recur in Q4.","Audrey Preston - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Paul J. Chung - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. This is Paul Chung on for Coster and thanks for taking my question. So I was just wondering if you could provide a split between the growth in outdoor, whether it's from the f\u0113nix and how much of that growth was from the inReach products. And on the subscription services, can you provide any metrics there and how material it was and do you see that sales model potentially applied to other segments? Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, we don't break out numbers by categories within segments. So, I can't really provide specific color on that. Again, only commenting generally that f\u0113nix family and particularly f\u0113nix 5 has been a significant driver of growth in outdoor. And in terms of inReach, it's a very nice incremental category for us, but probably not moving the needle the same way that f\u0113nix 5 is.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Hey. Thanks. Just a follow up on cycling, which I know is small, but I wanted to ask specifically an Alphamantis. Could you talk though the strategy there? It's essentially a service provider. So is the strategy to add the service revenue stream, is it to perhaps benefit Vector's market share or could it potentially lead to different hardware-based products on the bike? Thanks a lot.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So Alphamantis brings additional technology to our portfolio allowing us to create new product categories within our cycling area. I think as a company, they've been focused on more the technical side of the business, particularly with very technical and professional riders, but it's our goal to be able to try to bring that technology down into the mass market.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Could that be a new form factors or would that be in modifications to Edge, et cetera?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Could be new form factors.","Joe H.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue for the first quarter of 2019 with growth and operating income and EPS. Consolidated revenue came in at $766 million, up 8% over the prior year. Revenue from marine, aviation, fitness, and outdoor collectively increased 12% year-over-year. Gross margin was 59% compared to 60% in the prior year. Operating margin was 19.8%, and operating income grew 6% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.74. Pro forma EPS was $0.73, up 7% over the prior year. We are encouraged by our first quarter results. Since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year and much of the year remains ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February.","Before moving on to segment highlights, I want to mention the recognition we received recently from Forbes, who ranked Garmin as one of the top five best employers in America. Speaking on behalf of all Garmin employees, we are truly honored to receive this recognition. Garmin employees are passionate about what we do, and we share a deep commitment to serving our customers and each other. Of the many qualities that make Garmin a great place to work is the commitment of our employees that sets us apart.","Moving next to our segment highlights, revenue in the Marine segment increased 18% on strong demand for chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars. Gross margin was 58% and operating margin improved to 19%. During the quarter, we announced the ECHOMAP Ultra series, combining built-in Panoptix LiveScope compatibility with new mapping content. Also in our first year as their exclusive electronic supplier, we were named the 2018 Supplier of The Year by Independent Boat Builders Incorporated, the boating industry's largest purchasing cooperatives. It's an honor to be recognized by the IBBI, and I want to thank our marine team for delivering superior products, service, and support to our customers.","Looking next to the Aviation, revenue increased 17%, driven by growth in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 34% respectively. During the quarter, we delivered the new G1000 NXi upgrade for the Citation Mustang, which is the first business jet to adopt our G1000 system. We announced compelling new products, such as the GPS-175, GNX-375, and the G3X Touch, which expand the addressable market for our retrofit systems. Our aviation team was also recognized as an outstanding supplier to the industry. At the recent Embraer Supplier Conference we were named Supplier of The Year for electrical systems. This is the 10th supplier award we received from Embraer, and again, reflects the strength of our products, service, and support. I want to thank our aviation team for their deep commitment to being the very best.","Looking next to Fitness, revenue increased 9% driven primarily by strong growth in our wearable category. Gross margin was 50% and operating margin was 10% in the quarter. Margins decreased due to a combination of factors, including lower selling prices, and a shift in mix as certain products in our consumer wellness categories experienced significant year-over-year growth. In early April, we completed the acquisition of Tacx, expanding our reach into the indoor cycling and training market.","Yesterday we announced a fully refresh line of running watches with the Forerunner 45 in two sizes, the Forerunner 245 with optional music storage, and are Forerunner 945 which has it all. These new smartwatches offer features that will appeal to a broader range of running enthusiasts.","Also we announced the availability of our menstrual cycle tracking feature. This new feature was developed by Garmin Women focusing on the special needs of those who are highly active. This feature will help women make connection between their current cycle phase, physical and emotional symptoms, and their overall wellbeing. We also announced that we are cooperating with the University of Kansas on research to better understand how wearables and the biometric data they produce can help women manage and improve their health.","Moving to Outdoor, revenue increased 7% on strength across multiple product categories. The Outdoor segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 63% and 27% respectively. During the quarter we introduced MARQ a collection of five premium smart tool watches, these watches were created from our active lifestyle DNA to inspire adventures and flying, racing, sailing, exploring and sports performance. Also we recently announced the Approach S40 a stylish golf watch featuring a color touch screen display and smartwatch capabilities. ","Looking finally at the Auto segment, revenue decreased 10% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline in the PND market, partially offset by growth and certain specialty product lines, our global PND market share remains very strong, gross margin was 45% and operating margin improved to 6% during the quarter we launched the BC40 a new wireless backup camera that's easy to install and provide drivers with a wide clear view behind your vehicle also during the quarter we announced that BMW selected us as their lead design and production partner of infotainment modules for the BMW Group validating us as a tier one supplier to the world's most respected brands. I congratulate our automotive team and thank them for their hard work and dedication in securing this win.","That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results, Doug.","Doug Boessen","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I will begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results then move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes, we posted a revenue of $766 million for the first quarter represent 8% increase year-over-year, gross margin was 59%, 100 basis points decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 39.2%, 80 basis points decrease from the prior year.","Operating income was $151 million a 6% increase year-over-year, operating margin was 19.8% relatively consistent as prior year, our GAAP EPS was $0.74, our pro forma EPS was $0.73, next we will look at the first quarter revenue by segment, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $766 million, consolidated revenue grew 8% where by double-digit growth in both marine and aviation. Also both the fitness and outdoor segments achieved solid growth during the quarter. Combined basis marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 12% compared to prior year quarter.","Looking next, the first quarter revenue and operating income charts, collectively marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor contributed 83% of total revenue first quarter 2019 compared to 80% in the prior year quarter, the marine grew from 16% to 17%, and aviation grew from 21% to 22%. The fitness grew from 23% to 24%. You can see from the charts it illustrate our profit mix by segment. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments collectively delivered 95% operating income in the first quarter 2019 compared to 98% in the first quarter of 2018.","Looking next at operating expenses, our first quarter operating expense increased by $16 million or 6%, research and development increased $4 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources. Our advertising expense increased $3 million year-over-year represented 3.6% of sales consistent with the prior year quarter.","SG&A was up $10 million or 16.5% of sales consistent with prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to legal related costs and personnel related expenses, few highlights from the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities for approximately $2.7 billion, cash receivable decreased sequentially to $453 million following seasonally strong fourth quarter, inventory balance increased on a sequential and basis compared with the seasonally strong second quarter upcoming product launches.","During the first quarter of 2019, we generated free cash flow of $134 million; $53 million decrease from the prior year quarter, also during the quarter we paid dividend of $201 million which includes both the December 2018, the March 2019 payments. During the first quarter of 2019, we reported effective tax rate of 15.7% or 16% prior quarter. ","This concludes our formal remarks, Shannon can you please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Ben Bollin","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to start in the fitness business, could you talk a little bit about the mix overall, what drove the higher mix of kind of wellness devices in the quarter? What were the incremental legal expenses within that business in the quarter, and does that persist? And then any thoughts on margin trajectory through the year with new product launching, and then I have a follow-up?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So in terms of mix, Ben, we saw strong sales of our Vivomore HR line as well as our Vivoactive 3. So, those were drivers of mix towards the consumer wellness categories. In terms of legal, we wouldn't comment on specific other than to say we wouldn't expect a repeat of some of these, but again, the environment is unpredictable, so we don't really know in the future what additional things we might face, but we view it as somewhat of a one-time thing. And in terms of margin trajectory depending on how the mix goes, we would probably still anticipate some downward pressure on overall fitness margins probably in the low to mid 50s range, but that will depend on again the overall product mix and the sales trajectory on some of those product lines.","Ben Bollin","Okay. And within outdoor, any thoughts you have on the initial interest for MARQ, or how you feel about the current line-up and what MARQ does to the overall TAM [ph] as you move into these higher price point products?","Cliff Pemble","Well, we feel like the initial interest in MARQ has been very encouraging. So we are now starting to deliver those devices into the field. So we will start to see some impact from that. In terms of what it does to our overall product line-up, I think it expands our reach towards the upper end of the watch market. In terms of where we are today, obviously not the upper end of where watches are in total, but for us it does expands our reach and we feel very good about it, we see high MARQs in terms of the design of the product and the materials we have selected. So we feel very good about it.","Ben Bollin","Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Rich Valera","Thank you, I was wondering if you could comment on the BMW deal and sort of how you get paid on that and what you will actually get paid on. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Well, I think maybe you are referring to some capitalized costs, so that basically an agreement that we have to be able to recover some of our R&D cost that go into that project, and those will be capitalized as we go along. But in terms of once we reach the production point, then it's like any other arrangement, where we sell a product and [indiscernible].","Rich Valera","Yes, I guess the question was what exactly will you be selling them; software, hardware if you kind of just give us a sense of the magnitude of what will be going into each vehicle?","Cliff Pemble","Well, it's the main media computing modules that go into every vehicle, and it drives the instrument cluster as well as the center stack and then some configurations that will also drive entertainment in the back seat.","Rich Valera","Got it. And then just on aviation, can you kind of give us an update on your thoughts on the ADS-B, one that sort of contribution this year, and then how you think about that going into next year post the mandate?","Cliff Pemble","But we don't break it out by categories but it is generating growth. It's not the only growth driver though in the overall Aviation segment because we're also seeing strong demand for retrofit systems, integrated cockpit systems as well as display systems and GPS systems that go in the cockpit. We think the trajectory is still strong for this year although towards the back half of the year there could be some tailing off of the growth rate. We do see that in 2020 that the market will probably continue somewhat because we don't think that every airplane that wants to be equipped will be. But we'll have to see how that goes as we reach that point.","Rich Valera","Okay. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company. Your line is open.","Charlie Anderson","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the wearables and some of the gross margins you're seeing there. I know Cliff you've had sort of a multi-year trend of people going maybe more up-market on wearables as opposed to down market. I wonder if we're seeing a reversal of that trend at all or this is just a function of where we are point in time on the product cycle and then I've got a follow-up.","Cliff Pemble","Well actually in the tracker category, it is people going upmarket because they're moving towards the higher end even when they charge as opposed to basic tracker band. It so happens that the margins on those products are lower than the headline of fitness. So depending on mix of course that impacts the overall segment margin.","Charlie Anderson","Okay, great. And then just a housekeeping question for Doug. I noticed in the Q that we did see that reclassification of SG&A a little bit more to aviation, a little bit less to Marine. I wonder if you could just walk us through the basis behind that change? Thanks.","Doug Boessen","Sure. Actually it's refinement of our methodology for the general and administration expenses and now as time goes by, there's evolution of our different segments, different dynamics with it some of which relating to the late facility expansion here some of which is Aviation becoming a bigger piece of our business, international. So looking at all those different dynamics, we took a look at by allocating our administrative expenses where we thought to be each one of our segments. So yes, there are incremental additional expenses being allocated to aviation.","Charlie Anderson","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Doug Boessen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Paul Chung","Hi, thanks. This is Paul Chung on for Coster. Thanks for taking my question. So I have a couple on marine, where you kind of seeing pockets of growth whether it's region, product, subsets of the boating market and then given the strong start for both marine and aviation for the years, how is your outlook for 10% growth for both segments changed at all?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So in terms of marine growth, I'm trying to add a little more color to that, I would say it's strong globally particularly it's strong here in the U.S. market. A large majority of our revenue is generated in the Americas market and so products like Panoptix LiveScope and our chartplotters are driving some significant growth there.","In terms of our outlook for both marine and aviation, as we mentioned we're not ready to think about guidance yet because it's still early in the year but we're encouraged by the results we've seen in both of those segments. I would say as I mentioned earlier in aviation that towards the back half of the year, we would naturally expect that the growth rates of ADS-B might come down a bit as the rush of people that are trying to get into the installed tapers off a bit but that's what we're anticipating and that's why we're just holding back a little bit.","Paul Chung","Got it. And then my follow-up is on tax. What's your go to market strategy there. Can you give some more details on margins, revenues. I think you mentioned maybe six points of growth for fitness but has that view now changed that you closed the acquisition? Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","There's really no changes in terms of the go to market. They are the market leader particularly in the European region. And so we expect to continue to capitalize on that strength. And we see opportunities for growth in the Americas and Asia where they're less represented. So we're working hard to implement those sales strategies right now. In terms of margins, it's fairly consistent with the overall headline margins of fitness. So we don't anticipate really any impact there. There will be allocation of the purchase price to fitness. So that will impact some of the operating margins. But on a pre-amortized basis, it's very positive to our fitness segment on a cash flow basis.","Paul Chung","Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Nick Todorov","Hey, guys, good morning. First [indiscernible], just on aviation, my sense is that results came a little better than expected maybe can you talk some aftermarket OEM, what surprises you saw in this quarter? And then secondly, some of your competitors have talked about the pricing environment given and saw supply constraints. Maybe you could comment on that. I was wondering if you see anything different.","Cliff Pemble","So Nick I'm sorry to say but your call quality was kind of challenging. So I'm not sure that we've really tracked your question. I don't know if you could maybe try to restate it or help us out a little bit there.","Nick Todorov","Sorry about it. Can you hear me?","Cliff Pemble","It's incrementally better.","Nick Todorov","Sorry, can you hear me better now?","Cliff Pemble","It's better now, thank you.","Nick Todorov","Okay, sorry about it. So in aviation, the sense is that results came a little bit better than expected. Maybe can you talk about whether you saw some surprises either on the OEM or on the aftermarket side? And secondly, can you comment that if you see any changes in the pricing environment and the aftermarket side, some of your competitors have talked about some changes given the supply constraints. I was wondering if you see anything different.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, so in terms of aviation in our view there and what we saw, I would say that aftermarket was very strong and that reflects true demand and sell through to customers that are out there. In terms of OEM, there is some timing related things that helped us in Q1. But in general we still feel very positive about the OEM environment. In terms of pricing and aviation, I would say that pricing has been firm, we did go through some pricing increases at the first part of the year which didn't seem to have any impact in terms of our demand that we're seeing in the segment.","Nick Todorov","Okay. So you said you went through some price increases in the first -- in the first quarter this year or that was last year, I'm sorry.","Cliff Pemble","It was basically in January.","Nick Todorov","Okay, okay, got it. And Doug can you comment on what are some of the changes in OpEx allocation changes your outlook? I believe last quarter you were talking about expecting about 100 basis points increase, OpEx as a percent of sales. Had that outlook changed?","Doug Boessen","No, we are consistent with that outlook for the full-year, so we have about 100 basis points increase for total operating expenses, we expect advertising as a percentage of sales to be relatively consistent year-over-year and probably about 50 basis point increase in R&D on a full-year basis and then a 50 basis point increase in SG&A on a full-year basis. I should also mention the tax acquisition about 25% of that year-over-year increase in operating expenses will be attributed to the tax acquisition which we closed on here in the second quarter.","Nick Todorov","Okay. And lastly from me, Automotives gross margin came a little bit stronger than the trend over the last couple of years. Is there anything worth calling out or was it anything maybe tied to the specialty products that offset some of the PND declines, or that's something else?","Doug Boessen","Yes, one thing we did see in PND is that we had a new drive line of PND that was launched here in first quarter, so with that new launch we did see some improvement relating to our gross margins.","Nick Todorov","Okay guys, thanks. Good luck.","Doug Boessen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial Partners. Your line is open.","Ivan Feinseth","Thank you. Thank you for taking my call and congratulations on another great quarter and being named one of the top five places to work.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks Ivan.","Ivan Feinseth","I have a few product questions and platform questions, first at this year's Connect IQ Developer Conference like year-over-year how is attendance growing and what have been some of the topics covered? And I really do like also the new Connect IQ App that organizes the applications.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, so our Connect IQ Summit was actually very, very good. We had strong attendance same as the previous year, so we're not seeing any decrease in the level of interest. We announced new features for Connect IQ that allows App developers to further leverage the platform, so they can have better access, through access to the wireless capabilities of devices. There's great new animation tools that they can use to create more lively apps, so, a lot of enthusiasm around the things that we've been doing.","Ivan Feinseth","Is there any plans to create like a marketplace, so that those who want to offer apps that they could charge would be able to do that because I know there are, most of the apps are free, some of the developers say if you'd like to send the money let's say through PayPal you can do it but is there eventually going to be a flick of formalized e-commerce process on the platform?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, so we're evolving the platform to be able to support monetization and as we say right now, it's not as strongly linked in terms of helping our App developers that we're working on a roadmap that gets us there and I think in the coming year, we should have improvements.","Ivan Feinseth","Very good. I love the new product cadence and the number of new cycling computers. My one question is on like the Zumo line for example it connects to the tire monitors, so are you going to be offering the ability to have tire pressure monitors on a bicycle that connects to the cycling computers. I think that's a pretty cool feature.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, it's definitely a technology we can leverage in cycling. And so I wouldn't rule it in or out at this point because we're evaluating our roadmaps but it is something that we can leverage across multiple product categories.","Ivan Feinseth","And as far as product line. Are you looking to want a refresh to Zumo or what is your thoughts on the Zumo line?","Cliff Pemble","Well the Zumo line is an integral part of our overall PND lineup and so we have a strong roadmap there as we do in the other areas as well.","Ivan Feinseth","And then like the Garmin Connect is pretty cool. And have you thought about some kind of other onboard diagnostic port connection to any of your other GPS devices that could incorporate that data into the screen of the GPS?","Cliff Pemble","We've invested some effort in understanding OBD connection to the vehicle and of course on our OEM side, we have a lot of access to the vehicle in terms of the can buses and things. But in terms of aftermarket diagnostics, it's somewhat of a crowded market and so we've struggled to find a place where we can really carve out our own unique niche there. So it's not something that we've been actively pursuing recently.","Ivan Feinseth","Okay, understood. And then I love the Newmark watches. They are beautiful. Can you give some thoughts on unit volume?","Cliff Pemble","Well, we don't break out by volume but I would say as we mentioned in the remarks that the reception has been good and we're pleased with that and so we're just at the front end now of delivering those products to market. And we'll have an updated view in the future.","Ivan Feinseth","Thank you. And also on tax, can you give us some thoughts as far as product branding. Are you going to maintain the tax name or somehow incorporate the Garmin name with it, also do you see any focus on specific products and expanding the product availability into the U.S. and the marketing strategy behind it?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, so the tax name is very strong. So we want to maintain that. And so the branding will be definitely taxes. The headline on those products and for the Web site and things we're calling it a Garmin company. In terms of our specific product focus, our emphasis at taxes emphasis before acquired them, it was that smart trainers and advanced trainers is their specialty and so we're going to continue investing in that. And then in terms of bringing the product to other markets where we're working very hard to bring it into U.S. distribution now in a more complete way and so that's ongoing and should be more evident as we as we move into the back half of the year.","Ivan Feinseth","Thank you very much. Congratulations again.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks Ivan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Erik Woodring","Hey, guys, congrats on the quarter. Good morning. I just want to get at first quarter revenue growth of 8% was strong but in the past you've talked about how the ramping of product launches and new product launches flew essentially help accelerate that growth in the back half of the year versus the first half. And so with guidance unchanged, I just kind of wanted to reconcile those data points given the outperformance in the first quarter?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, so we mentioned in the last call that our product releases were back half loaded. And I think that's certainly playing out as we're just now getting our new fitness products to market and we'll have more releases as we go through the year. So we'll have to wait and see. We've mentioned before that this quarter is literally the smallest contribution to our overall yearly revenues. So we don't want to get too excited or disappointed on first quarter because there's a lot that lies ahead of us in terms of the overall sales environment and the competitive environment.","Erik Woodring","Okay, thanks. And then just as my follow-up, auto results revenue down 10% was essentially the best performance you've had for that segment since the first quarter of 2016. So just curious is that just the new drive on PND that was launched or was there something else that contributed, any puts and takes there and understanding any puts and takes would be helpful there? Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Drives certainly help, that was a selling event although we've heard good remarks from our retailers on the sell through of that product. So that's one dynamic but we also saw strong demand for our specialty PNDs particularly in the truck RV and motorcycle areas and that helps a lot. And so that represents really true demand in the market. So we were pleased with the result and we'll have to wait and see how things go throughout the remainder of the year.","Erik Woodring","And I'm just curious is that a trend do you think that could continue or is it would you call that or think of that more as a one-time, a one-time benefit to the quarter?","Cliff Pemble","Well, it's hard to say again we're waiting to see more data as we experience the sell through of the new products especially and as the driving season comes upon us here, so we'll have to wait and see.","Erik Woodring","Okay. Great, thank you for taking this time.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, thanks Erik.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Teri Seck for closing remarks.","Teri Seck","Thanks everyone. Doug and I are available for callbacks throughout the day. Have a good one. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day."],"10176":["Garmin Ltd.

Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you, Teri. And good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin finished 2016 on a strong note. Revenue for the quarter increased 10% over the prior year to $861 million. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively increased 25% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 54.7%. Operating margin was essentially flat at 18.6%, while operating income increased 10%. These strong results generated GAAP EPS of $0.72 and pro forma EPS of $0.73 in the quarter.","Looking briefly at our full year performance, 2016 was a remarkable year as we delivered four consecutive quarters of revenue and profit growth. Revenue increased 7% over 2015 and exceeded $3 billion for the first time since 2008. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation increased 21% on a combined basis, contributing over $2.1 billion in revenue for the year or 71% of the total and generated 84% of our operating income.","Gross and operating margins improved to 55.6% and 20.7% respectively, while operating income grew 14%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.70 and pro forma EPS of $2.83, both representing strong increases over the prior year. Unit deliveries increased 4% to 16.8 million, which is the second highest in our history and broadened our total units shipped to over $173 million since Garmin's inception. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to highlight the 2016 performance and 2017 outlook for each of our five segments.","Okay. Starting with Outdoor, revenue increased 33% on strong demand for outdoor wearables, contributions from DeLorme and growth in all other product categories. Segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 62% and 34% respectively while operating income grew 32% over the prior year. Looking back at 2016, our f\u0113nix line of adventure watches continue to show strong momentum while high-end Chronos variations are opening new retail channels at watch stores and specialty retailers.","Our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables. Connect IQ now features over 2,500 apps, widgets and watch faces and has generated more than 24 million downloads since inception. To further promote the power and utility of Connect IQ, we will host our first ever developer conference in mid-April, offering workshops and tools that developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem.","Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2017. We anticipate that wearables will continue to be strong, led by the new f\u0113nix 5 series. f\u0113nix 5 comes in three different sizes and features our new QuickFit band replacement system, allowing users to quickly change the style of their watch. We are also expanding our handheld device portfolio with inReach satellite communication technology, and we will introduce inReach devices into new geographic markets.","Looking next to Fitness, we reported robust revenue growth of 24%, driven by strong demand for wearables with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology. In addition, v\u00edvofit jr. was well received by retailers and customers during the holiday shopping season. Gross and operating margins were 53% and 20% respectively. Gross margin was impacted by product mix while operating margin was relatively flat to the prior year, resulting in operating income growth of 19%.","Much has been said recently about the momentum change in certain wearable categories specifically basic activity trackers. However, demand for products with more advanced features particularly those with GPS capability was very strong in the holiday quarter. One possible explanation is that customers want more than just a basic activity tracker.","We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend with the broadest portfolio of activity trackers, many of which include GPS capability. In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the Fitness segment with strength in cycling and advanced wearables offsetting anticipated softness in basic activity trackers.","Looking next at the Marine segment, revenue grew 16% ahead of the overall market, pointing towards market share gains driven primarily by strong demand for fishfinders and chartplotters. Gross margin was steady at 55%, while operating margin improved to 16%, resulting in operating income growth of 82% over the prior year. The marine season is off to a great start, and we are ready to serve with a strong portfolio of products for every boating pursuit. For 2017, we're targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% for the Marine segment.","Turning next to Aviation, we reported solid revenue growth of 10%, driven by ADS-B and retrofit upgrades, as well as growth in our OEM categories. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 12% for the year.","In recent developments, Textron Airland announced that the Scorpion light attack aircraft will be equipped with Garmin avionics, expanding the addressable market for our commercial off-the-shelf equipment into military and government applications. We are excited about our expanding partnership with Textron, and we look forward to serving on the Scorpion aircraft.","I also want to mention that for the 13th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked number one in avionics support by Professional Pilot Magazine and by Aviation International News. I want to congratulate our team on earning this award once again, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers.","In 2017, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the Aviation segment. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains, new platforms, and the ADS-B mandate provide opportunities for growth.","Looking finally at the Auto segment, revenues were down 17% for the full year, as expected, due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. However, our global market share remains very strong. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 12%, respectively. While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we do see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories, including trucking, RV, cameras, and in our OEM business. We are focused on maximizing profits in the segment while leveraging these opportunities.","Earlier today, we announced that BMW selected Garmin as a Tier 1 supplier of infotainment computing modules for future BMW models produced in China. This is a pivotal win for us and validates the investments we have been making in the OEM category.","Looking at 2017, we expect revenue to decline approximately 17%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.","In summary, we see many opportunities ahead in each market we serve, and we are well positioned, with a strong product lineup. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.02 billion, flat year-over-year, as growth in Fitness, Outdoor, Aviation, and Marine is offset by anticipated declines in the Auto segment.","We are projecting steady gross margin of approximately 56%, and operating margin of approximately 20%. We expect a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22% for the year, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $2.65.","So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results, then move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and taxes. We posted revenue of $861 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 10% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.7%, a 180-basis-point increase from the prior year, driven by the shift towards segments with higher margin.","Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36.1%, 200-basis-point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $160 million, 10% increase from the prior year. Operating margin was 18.6%. Our GAAP EPS was $0.72. Our pro forma EPS was $0.73.","Looking at full year results, we posted revenue of over $3 billion for the year, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 55.6%, 100-basis-point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35%, consistent with prior year. Operating income was $624 million, 14% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 20.7%, increase of 100 basis points from the prior year, driven by the gross margin increase. Our GAAP EPS was $2.70, 13% increase from the prior year. Pro forma EPS was $2.83, 14% increase from the prior year. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.","Next, we look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. In the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in four out of five segments led by the Outdoor segment at 46%. Collectively, these four segments were up 25% compared to prior-year quarter. For the full year 2016, we achieved 7% consolidated growth led by robust growth in our Outdoor and Fitness segments and solid double-digit growth in Marine and Aviation segments.","Looking next, the fourth quarter revenue charts, during the quarter, Fitness grew to be our largest segment as it grew to 32% of revenue in the current period compared to 29% from the prior year. Outdoor grew from 16% to 20%. The Auto segment represented 26% our total fourth quarter 2016 revenue compared to 35% fourth quarter 2015. You can see from the charts illustrate profit mix by segment. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 88% of operating income the fourth quarter 2016, compared to 74% the fourth quarter 2015.","Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 27% to 36%. Total corporate operating margin was relatively flat per year as gross margin improvement was offset by increased operating expenses.","Looking next to the full year charts, for the full year, the non-Auto segments made up 71% total revenue compared to 62% in 2015. Similar shift occurred in operating income with 84% of 2016 operating income collectively coming from the Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation segments compared to 75% 2015.","Looking next at operating expenses, fourth quarter operating expense increased by $44 million or 16%. Research and development increased $23 million year-over-year, 140 basis points to 15% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness, Outdoor and Marine where we see long-term growth opportunities. The fourth quarter 2016 was also impacted by the additional weaker expense from the addition of the DeLorme business.","Our advertising expense increased $11 million to the prior quarter, representing 7.9% of sales, a 60-basis-point increase. Additional spending was focused on the Outdoor and Fitness segments to support growth in wearables.","SG&A was up $9 million compared to prior quarter, but decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.3%. Increased spending in SG&A was driven primarily by additional weaker expense in addition of the DeLorme business, partially offset by year-over-year decrease in litigation-related costs.","A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash, marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially due to holiday quarter and decreased year-over-year to $527 million. Inventory balance decreased year-over-year to $485 million as we exited the seasonally strong fourth quarter.","In the fourth quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $165 million, a $34 million increase to the prior quarter. Also during the quarter (15:45) we paid two quarterly dividends for approximately $96 million for a total of $192 million. We purchased $28 million of company stock.","We extended the expiration date for our share repurchase program to December 2017, have approximately $75 million remaining for purchase. We expect to repurchase as business and market conditions warrant. Assuming our dividend payments were normalized, the four dividends totaling $385 million returned $478 million of cash to our shareholders through dividend payments through share purchases in 2016.","The effective tax rate was 19% in the current quarter compared to 13.2% in the prior quarter. Increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit being recorded in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to being spread over all four quarters 2016. Our full year 2016 effective tax rate was 18.9%, a 70-basis-point decrease from the prior year primarily due to income mix by tax jurisdiction.","We expect our full year 2017 pro forma tax rate to be approximately 22%. Switzerland is in the process of aligning corporate tax rules from evolving international tax initiatives. We've elected at this time to align certain Switzerland tax positions with these initiatives resulting in year-over-year increase to pro forma tax rate. The utilization of a deferred tax asset will reduce our cash tax liability so we do not expect to pay any additional cash taxes in Switzerland 2017.","We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for a dividend of $2.04 per share payable in four installments, $0.51 per share per quarter beginning with the June 2017 calendar quarter.","This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, could you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Joe Wittine from Longbow Research. Your question, please?","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thanks. First of all, I want to be clear on Fitness, specifically trackers, because the guidance is a lot better than many had feared and would kind of suggest you intend to take share at least relative to the main competitor in 2017. So, the key driver from your perspective is that you're seeing consumers adopt GPS-enabled more strongly. Is that right?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","We saw, Joe, particularly strength in more advanced trackers, as I said in my remarks, particularly those with GPS.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Cliff, how would you expect the GPS-equipped product set to evolve? And I don't know if you have data to show it or not, but are you seeing your dedicated running customers move from traditional Forerunners to products like v\u00edvoactive HR and\/or the Forerunner 35?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","I think, probably, we see more the other direction where people who got started and wore basic activity tracker or something in our vivo line might wish to move up into more advanced running devices as they explore the sport. But I think v\u00edvo, its quality is daily wear, so it certainly wouldn't preclude people from moving the other direction, but we think mostly, it's an upward movement.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then, on f\u0113nix, in what quarter will f\u0113nix 5, which obviously looks great, by the way. In what quarter will the channel fill occur? Will it happen mostly in March or end of the second quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. Thank you on that. Definitely, we'll start late in Q1, so it will be mostly a full impact in Q2.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. I'll step aside. Congrats.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your question, please?","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. First one is, the revenue outlook for 2017 looks pretty conservative to me. I'm just wondering, Cliff, whether you'd be kind enough to share the assumptions, sort of big macro assumptions, that have gone into that guidance? Then I've got a couple of small follow-ups.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think some would say it's conservative, others might say it's not. But, as you know, there's a lot of dynamics going on in the market right now. I think everybody is focused on fitness and what the dynamic will be there. I think it is an area where there is uncertainty because of everything that's going on. But we believe that we still have ability to grow.","Outdoor, we see ongoing opportunities for f\u0113nix, as we mentioned in our remarks, as well as expansion of the DeLorme opportunity. Marine is off to a great start, and we do think that our product line is strong. We should be able to have a strong year in Marine. And then finally, Aviation is an industry that has had ongoing challenges with the economic situation. That's not really changing, in our view, but we do see these opportunities that we've been pursuing adding to incremental growth.","And then finally, in Auto, there's not much more to say there, except that the PND market decline continues, as you're well aware, and we are excited, because we are to a point now in the business where the growth in the other segments are offsetting the declines in PND.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Your nearest competitor in fitness is very visible with headlines regarding corporate relationships. You're, I think, less so. How important is that market to the growth of that category for Garmin?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, we're investing in that category as well. We have had our own sets of successes, which have been published out there, some of them, and some of them have not. We don't break it out by categories in that area, but we are investing there. We have dedicated teams, both on the sales and engineering side, that are working on product customizations and engagements with customers that allow us to win deals there.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Last question is on the PND side. You obviously are still investing, because otherwise you wouldn't win such key accounts as BMW in China. But why bother investing? Isn't it time to just harvest the cash from that segment and let it kind of fade away, or even cut it at some point?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, there's still opportunities in PND. And one thing I'd like to clarify is that the BMW opportunity is not PND. That's auto OEM. And that's a different category of products within our overall Auto segment. But PND, we do still see opportunities there, as I mentioned. Some of the specialty opportunities in RV and truck are things that we're investing in, as well as camera technology. And we're taking a pragmatic approach, as I mentioned in my remarks. We believe there's still customers that are interested in those products. And with the right amount of innovation, we can keep the category healthy.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Congratulations on the good print. (22:53)","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson from Dougherty & Co. Your question, please.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions, and my congrats on the strong results and the BMW win.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","I wanted to start on BMW. I wondered if you could talk to us about timing, when we may see the first revenue there? And then also scope, I think there's a lot of ways you guys approach that market, be it hardware, software. Anything you can give us in terms of additional color, and maybe even roughly ASP per vehicle, is it measured in tens of dollars, hundreds of dollars? Any additional color there would be helpful. Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","So, BMW, we anticipate the program will be starting in the 2020 model year, which means late 2019 for production and revenue, start of revenue ramp. It is for vehicles in the China market. So, this is local production for local vehicles. It is a hardware-based Tier 1 opportunity. So, we invested in our factory capability in order to be qualified as a Tier 1 supplier to BMW. And as such, because it's a hardware opportunity, the ASPs are definitely much higher than what typical software opportunities are, although I can't share the details of what those are.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And I just have a couple of follow-ups for Doug. Number one, on the FX. I think your original guidance for the year was euro at $1.10. I wonder where you'd finished and then what you're implying in the guide for 2017. I don't know if I missed this, but CapEx for 2017, if you could share that with me.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, what we're anticipating for FX assumptions for 2017 are basically the current rates that are out there, at $1.05 for euro. Then as it relates to CapEx, we anticipate the CapEx to increase in 2017 primarily due to the Olathe expansion probably between total CapEx between $130 million and $140 million.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your question, please.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, could you tell us a little bit more about what's happening with the Swiss tax position? What exactly are you doing? Is this onetime in 2017 and the rate declines going forward or is 22% kind of the new baseline? And then I have a follow up for Clift.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Sure. As I mentioned, Switzerland is in the process of aligning their corporate tax rules with evolving international tax initiatives. You may have heard corporate tax reform in Switzerland was proposed and voted on recently, but it didn't pass. They're working on a new proposal but the timeline for that is not known at this time. So, as a result of all of that, we elected this time to align our certain Switzerland tax positions with international tax initiatives. And I also mentioned that we don't expect to pay an additional cash tax in Switzerland in 2017 since we have deferred tax that's reduced our cash tax liability.","As it relates to beyond, we to anticipate this 300 or so basis point increase to be in there in the future and depending upon what other kind of initiatives that come up from Switzerland or such, but we think that will probably continue at that type of rate from a book standpoint.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Cliff, you talked about the rollup, maybe your thoughts in Fitness and a little bit in Outdoor with f\u0113nix and handheld on DeLorme. Do you have any thoughts on what you expect to see on golf and in dog training in 2017? It looks like those grew organically in 2016. Are you expecting more of the same there? Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. Ben, definitely, all of the categories in Outdoor showed growth in 2016. Golf and dogs are both very nichey categories in comparison to some of the other categories and there's been a lot said in the last year or two about the situation in the golf market and declining interest and even some notable bankruptcies in golf-specific retailers. But we're generally believing that those will be flat in the coming year. Again, they're niche categories and they have cycles. So, they'll generally be trending in line with what they have been.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Liu from Morgan Stanley. Your question please?","Jerry Yuan Liu - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. Just first on Outdoor and Fitness, could you give us a little bit more color on this past holiday season? Some of your competitors had weaker-than-expected performance. So, were you able to take share, gain shelf space or were you able to use some promotional activities to help generate demand? Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think, Jerry, many of our products that we offer in Outdoor and Fitness are beyond some of the notable news that's been circulating in terms of the overall activity tracker market. So, our product lines were strong, particularly those with GPS. f\u0113nix was a good performer. And we see people wanting to step up to a more advanced smart watch kind of a product which f\u0113nix definitely falls in that category.","Jerry Yuan Liu - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And when we look at 2017, I think you're looking at a second straight year where Outdoor is going to grow faster than Fitness and Outdoor, again, two years or strong growth compared to, at least the prior three years when you were roughly flat. So, it seems like there's more than product cycles that there's some pretty strong secular trends for you.","So, other than some of your maybe existing customers moving up from the v\u00edvo lines, are you seeing even more retailers stock your Outdoor products for the first time? Are you seeing sort of a higher level of new users coming to Garmin and coming to especially to f\u0113nix products?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think we talked about the secular trends, particularly in Fitness, and we do anticipate that basic activity trackers are going to see a maturing cycle starting now and going forward into the future. But with that said, on the Outdoor side, we do see positive response to our f\u0113nix 5 announcement, and we anticipate starting deliveries of those soon. And we also do see increasing interest from retailers in the outdoor wearables. So, for example, we're gaining additional shelf space in some of the key retailers particularly in the U.S. and expanding our shelf space in the U.S. market.","It is attracting a different kind of customer. There's certainly a strong, running bias in people that buy f\u0113nix product, but we're also seeing people that are just generally aspirational and love any kind of outdoor activity move up to the launch.","Jerry Yuan Liu - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And lastly, when we look at channel inventories, both how it turned in the fourth quarter and what you're expecting for the first quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","We believe our channel inventories are reasonable exiting the year and into Q1. Many retailers particularly in the U.S. try to manage their inventories very carefully as they close out their year. But we believe our inventory situation is okay.","Jerry Yuan Liu - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt from Raymond James. Your question, please.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Cliff and Doug. A couple of quick follow-ups on the BMW announcement. Is there any upfront cost, either expensed or capitalized, heading into that 2019 launch? And should we think of this as kind of a scalable solution that BMW could use for a range of cars, or kind of specifically for high end?","And then, secondly, on the wearables business, I wondered if you can give me a sense of, I guess, the mix of the wearables business or if you just want to talk about it in terms of Fitness terms, of products that do not have GPS at this point? How small a portion is that of the mix, and if there's any chance we can get an update on number of Garmin Connect users, active or otherwise, however you guys define them internally? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. Starting first on BMW, for this program, there's not any significant upfront investments for this particular program. We had already made investments in our factories in order to be able to accommodate this kind of win, and those are already costs that we've incurred. For the solution, it's the media graphics unit, which actually is a common architecture piece across the entire BMW line, not only in China but around the world. So, consequently, this is production of that architecture for the China market, but it's scalable elsewhere.","In terms of Fitness, in terms of the mix there, as I mentioned, we are seeing stronger interest in more advanced product in the wearable side, and that includes what we would call our wellness line, like vivo, as well as, obviously, Forerunners which are all GPS products. We don't split those out by category, but I would say that GPS was the stronger performer, and basic activity trackers were weaker.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then, any chance we can get an update on number of Garmin Connect users?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","We don't have numbers to share right now, but we can certainly prepare those and share them in the future.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you. Another follow-up on the Fitness segment. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that gross margins were impacted by product mix. But I would've thought that the weaker basic activity trackers would actually have helped margins. So, just wanted to clarify that point. And then curious to hear what, if any, impact you saw from the new Apple Watch that included GPS?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. So, definitely, product mix is still a factor, even though basic activity trackers were weaker. Basic activity trackers have a very low cost basis. So, their margin profile doesn't necessarily improve the overall fitness market if they're weaker. That said, also the v\u00edvo line in general, including those with GPS, they're feature rich products, and they have to sell at a competitive price. So, consequently, their margin profile is generally lower.","In terms of Apple and the specific impact on our market by the Series 2, I would say that certainly, their initial results would appear like they're doing very well with Series 2. But we don't see the impact on our customers and our segment from that device. I think that it's a very competent device and it does a lot of things, but as we've said before in the past, we believe that it's attracting a slightly different customer base than what we speak to.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Power from Baird. Your question, please.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. I guess within the Marine segment, you know, looking at the growth outlook for 2017, how much of that is macro, and maybe your thoughts on what you're seeing from the broader environment there versus share, and specifically maybe any other color on what's helping drive the share gains?","And then, Doug, just any color on how to think about free cash flow for 2017. You gave us the CapEx number, but as we kind of fold that in, any other framing to that for 2017 would be helpful.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Okay. Well, starting with Marine, definitely, there's a component of our outlook that reflects the improving macroeconomic conditions surrounding Marine. Marine has been kind of on a slow growth trajectory since the downturn, and we continue to see that. So certainly, some of that is due to organic market growth.","But, certainly, the other part is the momentum we see in our business and particularly we believe we're taking share from the major competitors. And we believe the reason for that is our strong product lineup and superior features and technologies that we have in our products.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Great. And regarding free cash flow, currently, for 2017, based on the current guidance we have, we anticipate free cash flow about $500 million. And as you mentioned, that includes the increased CapEx as well as you saw in 2016, we had quite a bit improvements on working capital. You probably won't see as much of those working capital improvements inventory, as well as the assumed year-over-year change in the operating income also.","Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson from Pacific Crest Securities. Your question, please.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, guys. This is (37:01) on the line for Brad. Thanks for taking the questions. Two things. Just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on the types of content you would be providing for BMW or potential content? And then, I was also wondering if you could run us through the OEM margin profile and profitability looking to 2017 and beyond. Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","So, as I mentioned on BMW, what we'll be supplying is a hardware component that drives the overall media system in the vehicle. So, it is a higher dollar value type of product which will definitely benefit on the revenue side. I think in terms of margin profile in OEM, we don't break it down by category, but we generally said that the margin profile from the OEM business is generally lower than that of the overall auto business. So, there would be some downward pressure as those revenues ramp up.","Unknown Speaker","That's helpful. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Right. Thanks, Elliot. (38:00)","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program.

Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock.

The prior periods presented here have been restated to reflect adoption of this new standard. This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business.

Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone.","As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter consolidated revenue of $894 million, up 8% over the prior year. Fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor collectively increased 17% year over year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.5% compared to the prior year due to segment mix. Operating income improved to $218 million, up 4% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1 and pro forma EPS of $0.99 in the quarter.","We are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full-year guidance. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.","Starting with the fitness segment, revenue increased 24% driven by growth in advanced wearables and in cycling. Gross and operating margins were 56% and 23% respectively, and operating income grew 40% over the prior year.","During the second quarter, we launched the v\u00edvoactive 3 music, expanding our music offerings into the advanced wellness category. We also launched new Edge cycling computers and the next-generation Varia radars targeting the cycling safety market.","The basic activity tracker category continued to decline during the first half of 2018. However, the impact on our fitness segment was more than offset by growth in other categories.","Looking forward, we believe, we are well-positioned in this segment, with a strong line-up of wearables and cycling products.","Looking next at marine, revenue increased 24% as weather conditions improved and boats were brought out of storage for the season. Approximately half of the growth came from our recent acquisition of Navionics, while the other half was organic across multiple product categories. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 21% respectively, and operating income grew 14% over the prior year.","During the quarter, we introduced Panoptix LiveScope, a sonar system that generates real-time images underwater. LiveScope was quickly recognized by the marine industry as disruptive new technology. At the recent ICAST sportfishing trade show, LiveScope won the award for Best New Electronics and received the prestigious award for Best of Show. We believe LiveScope is a game changer for the fishing market.","Also during the quarter, we announced Sportsman Boats selected Garmin as their exclusive marine electronics supplier beginning with their 2019 model year boats. Sportsman is one of the fastest-growing boat companies in the U.S. market and it's an honor to be selected as their exclusive electronics provider. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovation and gaining share in the inland fishing category.","Turning next to aviation, revenue increased 23%, driven by growth in both OEM and retrofit product categories. We experienced particularly strong growth in our ADS-B offerings and from recently introduced products such as the G5 indicator system, TXi displays, and GFC autopilots. Gross and operating margins remain strong at 74% and 34% respectively, resulting an operating income growth of 34% over the prior year.","We were recently selected by Tactical Air Support to provide an integrated flight deck to their fleet of supersonic F-5 fighter aircraft. We also introduced the G3000H integrated flight deck for the Part 27 turbine helicopter market.","As I mentioned earlier, ADS-B has been a significant driver of growth in our aviation business, with just under 18 months to go before the December 31, 2019 deadline we wanted to provide an update on the market development and how we see things playing out as the deadline approaches.","According to the FAA as of July 1, 2018 approximately 59,000 aircraft have been equipped. The FAA has estimated that approximately 100,000 aircraft to 160,000 aircraft will eventually be equipped with ADS-B. Based on the more conservative estimate the market is just past the halfway point in the ADS-B cycle.","There are a few key observations that we would like to share. First, significant opportunity remains in the ADS-B cycle. According to FAA estimates anywhere from 40,000 aircraft to 100,000 aircraft remain to be equipped. Interest in ADS-B is increasing and many customers are using the opportunity to refresh their panels with additional equipment. This enhances the growth opportunity for Garmin.","Second shop capacity appears to be a limiting factor in ADS-B adoption. With a modest increase in shop capacity it is possible to reach the low-end of the FAA estimates by December 31, 2019 deadline. If shop capacity does not increase or if the final equipage level increases above the more conservative estimate, the opportunity would continue past the deadline.","Finally, ADS-B is a significant opportunity that is only one of many that we are pursuing. To prepare for the future beyond the ADS-B cycle, we're investing in long-term opportunities such as gaining share in the OEM market, establishing a position in government and defense markets, and developing new product categories. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of our aviation business and we are optimistic about its future.","Turning next to outdoor, revenue increased 4% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth across all product categories. While this growth rate is below recent trends, we feel it is a remarkable accomplishment considering the strong growth we experienced in Q2 of 2017, driven by the initial channel fill of the f\u0113nix 5 series. Gross and operating margins were 64% and 36% respectively. Late in the quarter, we launched the f\u0113nix 5 Plus series, adding music, color maps and mobile payments to all three watch sizes.","In addition, we expanded our sensor technology with the addition of Pulse Ox to the f\u0113nix 5X Plus, providing blood and oxygen saturation awareness for athletes and outdoor enthusiasts.","We also launched the inReach Mini, a compact versatile satellite communicator that can be used with other Garmin products paired with a smartphone or used as a standalone device. Looking forward, we are focused on opportunities in wearables and other product categories within the outdoor market. Looking finally at the auto segment, revenues decreased 19% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 42% and 7% respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring the desired level of innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.","In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first half of 2018. In light of the strong performance, we are raising our projected revenue to $3.3 billion for the year, up about 6% over 2017. Gross margin is projected to be 58.5% for the year, which is unchanged from the previous estimate. Operating margin is projected to be 21.5%, which is a slight improvement over our previous guidance. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 17.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.30.","Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment, we have increased our growth expectations for the fitness segment to 10% and the aviation segment to 18%. Outdoor and auto are unchanged, while the outlook for marine has been revised down slightly to 15%.","That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, including (11:15) comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $894 million for the second quarter, representing an 8% increase year over year.","Gross margin was 58.5%, 30-basis-point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.2%, 120-basis-point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $218 million, a 4% increase year over year. Operating margin was 24.3%, 90-basis-point decrease from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1 and our pro forma EPS was $0.99, a 9% increase from the prior year.","Next, I'd like to look at our second quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth led by robust double-digit growth in our fitness, marine and aviation segments. This growth was partially offset by decline in our auto segment, which resulted a continued decline in the auto PND business. On a combined basis, fitness, marine, aviation, and outdoor were up 17% compared to the prior-year quarter.","Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor segments contributed 80% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 73% in the prior-year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 25%, aviation grew from 15% to 17%, marine grew from 13% to 15%.","As you can see from the charts, illustrate our profit mix by segment. On a combined basis the fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor segments delivered 94% operating income in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 84% in the second quarter of 2017. The fitness and aviation segments, year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.","Looking next in operating expenses, second quarter operating expenses increased by $31 million, or 11%. Research and development increased $15 million year over year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Our advertising expense was up $2 million for the prior quarter was relatively flat as a percent of sales.","SG&A was up $16 million compared to prior quarter, relatively flat as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.","Few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year over year to $533 million. Inventory balance decreased sequentially and year over year to $501 million as we exited the seasonally strong second quarter. During the second quarter of 2018, we generated free cash flow $157 million, a $28 million increase to the prior-year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $100 million.","During the second quarter 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 19.4% compared to the pro forma effective tax rate of 21.4% in the prior-year quarter. The decreased effective tax rate is primarily due to the benefits from U.S. tax reform. We expect our full-year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5%.","This concludes our formal remarks. Julie, could you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Joe Wittine from Longbow Research. Joe, your line is open.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Hey, good morning. Congrats on the results. In aviation, I appreciate the color Cliff, and we've heard of the tight capacity too. Can you just take it a step further and help us understand how this may play out in your reported results in 2019 and 2020?","Like, let's say, the FAA's conservative scenario plays out, so the 100,000 total sales and you do get that modest increase in shop capacity to, let's say, allow the industry to meet a 100,000 by the end of 2019. So the question is would you still see healthy growth in 2019 versus 2018? And then if it were to drop off there and be \"complete\" at January 1, 2020 would that be enough of a drop off to potentially drive Garmin aviation down in 2020? Just a little more help taken into the model would be great, thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think just to shed some light on that specific category of ADS-B, it's only one category within our broader aviation segment. So if we just speak generally about that, I would say that with some additional shop capacity, of course that would drive additional sales in that category.","As I mentioned in my remarks, there is a follow-through trend with customers adding additional equipment to their aircrafts when they bring in the aircraft in for work. A lot of times it makes sense to add other things that they want to have in the aircraft. So, we're seeing compounding effect from that, and we would expect that to continue as the mandate approaches.","In terms of specific numbers around aviation for 2019 and 2020, we can't really provide specific color on that. As I said in my remarks, we're working on more than one opportunity. So, we believe that we have growth paths beyond the ADS-B cycle. And given what we see playing out with ADS-B, we do anticipate more of a soft landing than a hard cliff of revenues in terms of that category.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Perfect. Thanks. And I wanted to move to fitness where the numbers were very impressive. I think the product cycle is, obviously, your friend today, looking to the second half, should we anticipate, I don't want to say a pause, but simply an easing in the timing of new product introduction, especially in advanced wearables? Or do you have these things based out to the point, where you'd have us expect a \"typical slate of new product announcements\" into the holidays?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","We do have some additional announcements that will come in the back half of the year, but for the most part our product line-up is set. We do have a very refreshed product line-up this year. So, we feel good about our positioning and of course last year, we did have the introductions of some of our advanced wearables and new categories in wellness in the back half of the year. So, we're comping against that.","The fitness market, you know, has shown that it has been a little more dynamic, so we're taking a more cautious view on the back half that we believe there's strong reason that our products and our business should perform well.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks. And then last one for me. Doug, can you help us on ad spend at all, especially modeling the second half here on a year-over-year basis. Your ad dollars were kind of flattish, a little bit up in the second quarter, but you're still down for the first half in total, so how will the second half look year-over-year, especially considering I think you pulled back some in last year's fourth quarter?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So as it relates to advertising, to give you a full year perspective on it. Yeah, we expect full-year advertising dollars to be relatively flat year-over-year as well as percentage of sales. So, second half will even out, so that we're basically a situation that will be flat, hopefully, for year-over-year.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yuuji Anderson from Morgan Stanley. Yuuji, your line is open.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much and good morning. My question is on the auto's guidance. It seems to imply some accelerated declines at the end of the year. So, hoping to get a little bit more color on that? And similarly, on that point, how should we think about the mix between PND and the other categories exiting the year?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So in terms of auto and as we \u2013 it's been our practice really for years as we do take a fairly conservative view of that given the situation of the market. We do see the ongoing decline of PND. During the quarter, we did experience strength in both truck and camera products, so we're offsetting some of those declines with new categories.","And in terms of OEM, we are seeing some programs roll off like Chrysler and other new programs, which have not contributed yet, such as BMW. So, we'll see some ups and downs in the OEM portion of the contributions, but that's our outlook for the remainder of the year and then, of course, as we move into future years, we'll be able to update that as we see new programs coming on and as the categories change.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just a quick clarification on the prepared remarks for the outdoor segment there, with the guidance and it looks like there should be some acceleration off of Q2. Is that building in some additional product launches there? Thanks so much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So in outdoor, we do have additional launches in the back half of the year, but for the most parts, our major categories are set. And I think we're right where we expected to be in the segment, and so that's why we left our guidance unchanged.","Okay. Thank you. I guess, move on to the next question.","Operator","All right. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Brad, your line is open.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Just a few follow-ups here. First, on the fitness business, I guess it's kind of interesting, if you look at that business, it's like, I don't know $160 million or so higher than it was three years ago or so, margins seem to be tracking kind of in line though, or below where you were at those levels.","Talk about just overall fixed cost leverage you start to get, particularly as you get some of these nice channel fill quarters, it seems like you've returned a little bit of margin expansion. Just what should be the expectation around fitness margins there?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think we've been targeting our margins around the mid upper 50s% and our operating margins in the low to mid-20s in the segment and as we see lumpiness around the seasonality as well as product launches, that can be up and down, but that's generally the long-term targets that we're shooting for.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then just on the aviation, do you have any sense \u2013 can you give us a sense rather of what's the attach rate that your resellers are seeing for when they're selling ADS-B with, say, other avionics products?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","I would say it's very high, probably close to all of them.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then lastly just around FX, it seem like that should have been maybe a bit of a tailwind to start the year, probably neutralize as it becomes a headwind. What's the \u2013 any clarity you can give us on the net benefit your \u2013 or headwind you're contemplating owed to FX for the year in the updated guidance? Thanks.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So for Q2, you're correct, there was a tailwind on revenue about the $20 million. And looking at the back half of the year, we expect very little, probably immaterial impact. The euro right now is pretty well consistent at what, I'll say, the average was sort of back half. So probably, it's everything stays the same as it is right now, a very little impact on the back half.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson from Dougherty & Company. Charlie your line is open.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong start to the year.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask you about geographic again, I know I asked this last quarter, but Asia was very strong, again I wonder if there were any particular geos you could call out there that are doing well? And is that a sense where you're building there and you're in sort of an expansion phase or just kind of roughly what's going on there?","And then also in Europe, it seems like there was one geo that slowed down. It was Europe a little bit, so wondered if you could maybe unpack, what's going on there? And then I've got a follow-up.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So in Asia, there are some larger countries that are driving some growth there, particularly China and Japan have been superstars in terms of the overall APAC market that there are other markets as well that are doing very well.","In terms of the Europe dynamic, I think our year-to-date performance there can be completely attributed to the f\u0113nix effect from last year. They were super strong in their launch of f\u0113nix from last year and they had almost really as a whole quarter of Q2 to be able to launch f\u0113nix 5. This year, we announced the f\u0113nix 5 with less than two weeks to go in the quarter. So consequently, they had very little opportunity in terms of their channel fill as compared to other markets. So I think the dynamics there can be completely attributed to f\u0113nix.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Got it. And then on the fitness, it's going to be up 10% in the year. I wonder to what degree do we attribute that to ASP relative to units? And I wonder, as you move to these higher-end wearables, does it feel like that's a multi-year trend or just kind of roughly how do you look at that going forward in terms of consumers willing to sort of pay up for more features? Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, definitely, the dynamic of the market is that customers are stepping up for more capability and for unique offerings like what we have. And so there's definitely an increase in the ASP that we see there. But we also see growth in units as well as we had super strong performance in our advanced wearables category.","Okay?","Operator","Pardon me. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Ben, your line is open.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit, going back to fitness, were there any unique items in the quarter? Did you continue to see some selling benefits for Forerunner 645? Are you seeing any further box expansion or linear square foot expansion in your existing partners?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, we did announce the v\u00edvoactive 3 music and that product seemed to have been received well in terms of its unique design and capabilities adding to the v\u00edvoactive line of music. So that was one dynamic.","In terms of overall distribution, I think for the most part our distribution is pretty well set. Although, we see some countries in some areas, some markets improving incrementally but for the most part it's what has been for a while.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. And then within fitness in the press release you talked about the potential for more high-end wearables or more high-end features in that product category. What is your assessment of what those characteristics or features are, what makes it a high-end wearable?","And then last item would be, have you seen any benefits from TomTom exiting the market in the first half? And how do you think that opportunity could play out in the back half? Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","So in terms of customer preferences they do seem to be moving towards products with more features. It seems like smart features are table stakes if you will. Customers like the sensor technology and especially the additional features that that we bring to the table such as stress monitoring and sleep tracking. And then just in general, I think our products are very strong around the GPS side and the position, location focus of our watches, which make them very strong in the active lifestyles. Music, payments and maps are certainly adding to that. So, we see those as all positive points for the customer.","In terms of shifts in the competitive landscape, I would say, you know in terms of TomTom to exit, there's probably some effect, depending on the country that you talked about. Some countries still report that there is strong inventory of competitive products in the market and so those areas probably haven't changed as much well as others. The channel is pretty much flushed through and so that does lead to increased opportunities for our products.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial. Ivan, your line is open.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Thank you. Congratulations on another great quarter and thank you for taking my questions.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Ivan.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","I have questions in three areas. First, congratulations on the F-5 win, can you give us some idea of the number of units and the price of that product?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. In terms of number of units, of course, you know these are very specialized aircrafts, so it's a small quantity, but we view it as a stepping stone into that market and it shows the capability of our cockpit systems to be able to be used in a very advanced specialized application like the F-5.","In terms of our shipset prices, we can't talk about those details, but again, we're very excited about the opportunity and we believe that will be a stepping stone for us into more.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Okay. That's why I thought do you have \u2013 can you give us some color on some other potential wins in the pipeline?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","In terms of things that haven't been announced like, we can't speak to those. Definitely there are a lot of exciting opportunities that are coming that have been announced. For instance, the Longitude is in its final stages of certification. Also, we have positions on the Cessna SkyCourier and the Denali as well.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Very good. Also, on your infotainment platform, can you give us any progress on potential OEM adoption?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. We're very encouraged by what we see in the deal pipeline and we believe that we'll have additional news to share this year in terms of more customers.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","And I just have one last area, I see recently expanded the sleep monitoring function in the Connect app to work with your wearables. And I know that you had announced a partnership with University of Kansas to focus on sleep apnea. Are there some \u2013 did that come from some of that progress, or will you be expanding (30:28)? Can you give us some insight into what's happening with the research relationship there?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. We believe that our sensor technology shows a lot of promise in being able to play in the light medical device market. And so, participating in these studies is one way to start verifying the technology and proving that it can be used for certain applications. That's a long pathway in terms of our development there. It involves qualification of the product and certification of the product with various FDAs around the world. But it's a step in towards a growth opportunity in the future.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Yeah, I really like that, because sleep is probably the next frontier in improving health. And I also like the new oxygen sensor in the f\u0113nix 5 Plus. So, congratulations, again, and thanks for taking my calls.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Ivan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine from Longbow Research. Joe, your line is open.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you. No one wants to ask a f\u0113nix question. I will. Can you talk us through what you've seen so far for Plus? So how does the launch compare to the F5 launch? And are there any interesting insights you've gathered on the current mix of Plus versus f\u0113nix 5 purchases? It seems like you'll be selling them side by side?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, so early days, but we're very encouraged by what we see in terms of the market feedback, and the real-time information we get as people register their products. I think out of the gate, the higher-end versions, the f\u0113nix 5X Plus have been very strong. And we're starting to see the momentum gather around the other versions as well.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Can you say how the channel fill will compare to the channel fill for the f\u0113nix 5, which is pretty substantial in the last year's second quarter? Will it be a little bit smaller, because you'll be selling them side by side or not necessarily?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, definitely, there's the factor that that a very competent product is side by side with the f\u0113nix 5 Plus, there's no question about that. We will use that in terms of our overall strategy in the market, in terms of pricing, the two different versions. But that said, it's still very early days with only just literally days in the back half of the quarter that that we had to ship products. We were very pleased with our overall contribution from the f\u0113nix 5 Plus.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Understood. Thanks, Cliff.","Clifton A.

And good morning everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded second quarter consolidated revenue of $817 million up 1% over the prior year. Outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness collectively increased 8% year-over-year and contributed 74% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.5% compared to the prior year due to favorable segment revenue mix. ","As a result of our increased [indiscernible] and gross margins, our operating margin improved to 24.9%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.91 and pro forma EPS of $0.88 in the quarter. Our results were positively impacted by growth in advanced wearables. Our Connect IQ app stores are a direct reflection of enduser engagement with our wearables. During the past 12 months there have been over 17 million downloads of an app, watch face or data filed from our Connect IQ store. And the total downloads increased to over $30 million since inception.","Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first I\u2019d like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment. Beginning with the Outdoor segments, revenue grew 46% on year-over-year basis, driven by a strong growth of our F\u0113nix 5 smartwatches.","Gross and operating margins expanded to 66% and 38%, respectively. While operating income grew 53% over the prior year. We experienced on strong demand for the F\u0113nix 5 watch series and anticipated will continue to have a positive impact on our outdoor segment for the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to see solid growth of our new inReach devices and subscription based services. Finally, we launched the Approach S60 of premium watch for the golf enthusiasts and we recently announced the newest members of our Foretrex and Rino product lines.","Looking forward, we are focused on opportunities in wearables and inReach.","Turning net to Aviation, we reported strong revenue growth of 15%, driven by growth in aftermarket products. We also experienced positive contributions from our OEM product categories. Growth in operating margins remain strong at 75% and 32% respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 28% over the prior year.","During the quarter we introduced our first Head-up Display, which is designed specifically for aircraft with integrated flight decks. We are pleased with the Cessna Citation Longitude will the launch platform for this new product category. We also received European approval for our G1000 NXi system expanding the reach of this aftermarket offering for King Air 200, 300 and 350 aircraft models. Looking forward, we are focused on maximizing ADS-B mandate opportunities and gaining share in the OEM market.","Looking next at marine, revenue declined 3% however, this segment is performing as expected on the year-to-date basis with 10% revenue growth. We believe that favorable weather earlier in the year accelerated buying, which impacted the results of the second quarter. Growth and operating margins were 57% and 22%, respectively.","During the quarter we completed the acquisition of Active Captain, a developer of crowd sourced content for boaters. In addition, we launched our next generation quatix wearable.","Looking forward, we are focused on product innovations and gaining share in the inland fishing category.","Looking next to business, revenue declined 15% driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers and the timing of new product introductions. Gross margin was steady at 56%, while operating margin decreased year-over-year to 21%. While the quarter has been challenging for business, we remain positive about the opportunities in the segment. We expect these trends to continue into Q3, however, we anticipate ending the year on a stronger note as our product refresh cycle is completed.","Looking forward, we are focused on areas of opportunity, particularly in the advanced wearable category.","Looking finally at the auto segment, revenues were down 15% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in several new categories such as fleets, cameras and RVs. Growth in operating margins declined year-over-year to 45% and 13% respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong.","During the quarter, we launched the VIRB 360, a compact, full spherical, immersive camera, built for adventure. VIRB 360 is an amazing device that captures video up to 5K 30 frames per second and makes it easy to share memories on the go. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring the desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.","Turning finally to guidance, we are pleased with our consolidated performance in the first half of 2017 and believe we are well-positioned for the remainder of the year. As a result we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $3.04 billion, up about 1% over 2016. We project gross margin to increase to approximately 57.5% to the segment mix and we project operating margin of approximately 21% for the full-year. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 22%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.80.","Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment, we have increased our growth expectations for the outdoor segment to 25% and the aviation segment to 10%. Marine and auto are unchanged, while the outlook for fitness has been revised to down 5% due to the continued decline in activity tracker category.","That concludes my remarks, next Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?","Doug Boessen","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results to move the comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $817 million for the second quarter, representing 1% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 150-basis point increase from the prior year created by the shift towards segments with higher margin.","Operating expense, as a percentage of sales, is 33.6%, 130 basis points increase from the prior year. Operating income was $203 million, 1% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.9%, 20 basis point increase from the prior year. The increase in gross margin was an offset to increase in operating expenses.","Our GAAP EPS was $0.91, pro-forma EPS was $0.88, 1% increase from the prior year.","Next, we\u2019ll look at our second quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 1% consolidated growth, led by double-digit growth in our Outdoor and Aviation segments. This growth was partially offset by the decline our fitness segment, as a result of the steep decline activity tracker category. The continue decline in the auto PND business. Collectively, outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness were up 8% compared to prior year quarter.","We\u2019ll go next to second quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contribute 74% of total revenue in the second quarter 2017, compared to 70% prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 17% to 24% and aviation grew from 13% to 15%. As you can see from the charts illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 86% of operating income in the second quarter 2017, compared to 80% second quarter of 2016. The outdoor and aviation segments, a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.","Looking next to the operating expenses. Our second quarter operating expenses increased by $12 million or 5%. Research and development increased $13 million year-over-year, 150 basis points to 50.6% of sales. We continued to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused on fitness, outdoor, marine, aviation, segments that receive long-term growth opportunities.","SG&A was up $1 million compared to prior quarter, was relatively flat as a percent of sales. Our advertising expense was $2 million less than the prior quarter, traditional spend in outdoor segment was more than offset by decreases in the fitness in all the segments.","A few highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $515 million. Our inventory balance decreased sequentially to $525 million for actually the seasonally strong second quarter. During the second quarter of 2017, we generated free cash flow of $129 million, a $6 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million. We purchased $36 million of company stock, $11 million remaining for purchase through December 2017.","During the second quarter 2017, we reported an effective tax rate of 25%, which includes $7 million of income tax expense result from a new accounting standard related to the expiration of share-based awards. Excluding the $7 million of income tax expense second quarter 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was $21.9%, compared to 21% the prior year quarter. 90 basis point year-over-year increase pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the Company\u2019s election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions, international tax initiatives partially offset by income mix by tax jurisdiction. We continue to expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. This concludes or formal remarks. ","Takeya [ph] could you please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions comes from Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company. Your line is now open.","Charlie Anderson","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Cliff I wanted to start with, I noticed that APAC revenue growth had accelerated versus Q1. I wondered if you could just talk about what\u2019s going on there? I think may be F\u0113nix is playing a part there. I just wondered as we think about distribution and opportunities in Asia for some of your products kind of where we sit? And then I had a follow-up for Doug.","Cliff Pemble","Yeah good morning Charlie. Definitely Asia has been doing well. It is growing from a smaller base. Wearables are definitely popular in that market, as well, but we\u2019re also seeing growth in some of our other segments such as Marine and Outdoor.","Charlie Anderson","Okay. And then for Doug, I was wondering I know currencies have changed since we started the year as you\u2019ve updated your full year guidance. I wonder if you get update us on some of the FX assumptions.","Doug Boessen","Sure.","Charlie Anderson","And then CapEx and free cash flow for the year, thanks.","Doug Boessen","As it relates to FX for talking about Q2 impact, we had about a $10 million headwind in revenue in Q2. And as relates the forecast and the guidance for the remainder of the year, what we do is we update our FX assumptions based on the current trends. So what the current FX rates, we currently seeing out there is pretty similar to what we used in our guidance and our forecast. As it relates to free cash flow, right now, for free cash flow for full-year, we are expecting about $550 million. Of that we\u2019re expecting CapEx to be about $130.","Charlie Anderson","Great, thanks so much.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Doug Clark","Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first one is on the fitness segment. Last quarter you talked about the revenues from fitness trackers or activity trackers being about a half of sales. Can you talk about what that was this quarter, given the declines that you saw?","Doug Boessen","Well, the market is down significantly. NPD shows that the market is down about 32% in Q2 and so our mix has definitely come down a lot, our advance wearables and running in GPS-based trackers are much bigger part the segment now.","Doug Clark","Okay. That makes sense. And just to be clear the 32% decline that\u2019s for the activity tracker portion specifically?","Doug Boessen","Yes that\u2019s the basic activity trackers in the U.S. market.","Doug Clark","Got it. And then my follow-up question was on the outdoor segment. Can you talk a little bit about the F\u0113nix sell in, versus sell through in the quarter and where we are from a availability and distribution standpoint.","Doug Boessen","We believe that availability is good right now, we are still expanding some retail channels that are taking the product in their summer reset, but in general it\u2019s fully available in most retail outlets out there. There definitely was some pent up demand for the device as we announced it at CES and delivered a few weeks later. So there\u2019s some pipeline effect, for sure. But we do see follow-up orders and strong interest in the product.","Doug Clark","Okay great. And then final one for me. Can you talk about just the historic, I guess, the go-forward refresh cadence of the F\u0113nix product line. I think last year or this is actually two years between the F\u0113nix 3 the F\u0113nix 5. Is that what we might expect to see going forward?","Doug Boessen","Yes I can\u2019t comment on our future plans, but we do have a very active roadmap in all of our wearables.","Doug Clark","Got it thanks for my questions.","Doug Boessen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Joe Wittine","Hi everybody, great quarter.","Doug Boessen","Thank you Joe.","Joe Wittine","Maybe I\u2019ll stick on F\u0113nix 5 just as a quick follow-up to that last question. Have you learned anything from a demographic perspective based on the various flavors you offer and smaller \u2013 and what many would consider more approachable case sizes? Any data that suggests you\u2019re expanding the tent?","Cliff Pemble","Yes for sure. So three case sizes 42, 47 and 51. 51 was the size of the previous model of F\u0113nix. In the small size, we\u2019re definitely seeing a majority of those customers trend towards the female demographic. So that\u2019s a totally new demographic for us and very exciting to see this expand into the area of lady adventurers. On the larger size, adding the masses has really expanded the opportunity for the bigger products, so we\u2019re excited about that as well.","Joe Wittine","Makes sense. Shifting to fitness, I know the low end of fitness garners completely outsized share of investor questions for you. So can you talk about whether the most current segment guidance represents, for lack of a better word, a kitchen sink? I asked because the magnitude of the decline have obviously been a little bit of a surprise throughout the first half. So you may not want to use the word kitchen sink, but is there some capitulation in your thoughts when you assembled the new guide? It seems like based on the magnitude of the decline that may be the case.","Cliff Pemble","Well certainly we\u2019re counting on a steep decline in the activity tracker market. We\u2019re following the rising and falling tides in that area, so that\u2019s baked into our assumptions. And also, we\u2019re comping against strong product introductions from last year. Our product introductions will take place a little later in this year in terms of refreshes. So that\u2019s brought into our guidance. That said we do expect Q3 to continue the softer trends and moving into Q4, then we believe that things will improve.","Joe Wittine","Thanks. And then finally from me automotive. Can you help us understand at all when segment declines could narrow? I mean, I guess you could look at the second quarter and say, we saw a slight narrowing. But there\u2019s a thought that eventually, PNDs obviously should become less of an anchor in your OEM business will become a bigger piece of the mix. So give us some high-level thought on potentially when that could happen. And within that if you could update us on what\u2019s happening with OEM today from a volume perspective, so ex-ing out the impact of the deferred rev rec. Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, so PND has been a slowly declining market for the last eight to nine years, and it\u2019s been a little difficult to predict when is the bottom. We continue to believe that there is a base of business out there, a certain class of customer that likes these kind of products and will continue to be a reasonable category going forward, but certainly not mass-market levels like it was in the past. The predicting has been very difficult, and we probably are in a better position of doing that today than we were in past.","In terms of OEM, we\u2019re continuing to build a business base there. There\u2019s a lot of dynamics with OEM in terms of the wins, the time frame it takes to get those to market as well as the revenue recognition model that take place. A lot of our revenue taking place right now is being deferred because of software-based revenue recognition rules. So we\u2019re excited about the progress in terms of wins. We believe that it will contribute to growth in the future, but as of right now, it\u2019s still a smaller part of our overall auto category.","Joe Wittine","Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Cliff Pemble","Yes thanks Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yuuji Anderson of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Yuuji Anderson","Great, thanks for taking my question. A question on the running watches. How did it do this quarter, year-over-year? And are you seeing kind of like the similar strengths and weaknesses there, where the advanced models are driving demand versus the entry-level watches?","And then a question on operating margins for fitness generally. How should we think about potential expense management in that category given the current weakness that you\u2019re seeing? And then just balancing that against your coming product launches, is there some opportunity to kind of realize some savings there? Thanks so much.","Doug Boessen","Yes, so in our Forerunner category, which is what I\u2019d call our made-for-running product line, we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth, strength in that product line, so we feel very good about that category of the market, if you will. In terms of the expense structure overall in fitness, certainly, there\u2019s been a big increase year-over-year. Much of that is due to kind of a comping effect of adding resources over the year, and they\u2019re just now being recognized on a full year basis. We believe we\u2019re pretty well situated when it comes to overall resources in the segment. And we do think there\u2019s opportunities to fine-tune our investments, particularly in marketing and advertising, as the categories \u2013 category mix is changing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Ben Bollin","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The first one, I wanted to circle around on the outdoor business. If you look at the first half performance, I think the overall business is up 35% year-on-year. And the implied or the guide for the year now at 25% would imply kind of lower-than-seasonal back half relative to what you\u2019ve seen the last couple of years. So I\u2019m curious how you think about the seasonality in the back half and how much maybe channel benefit you got in the near term. And then I have a follow-up.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks. Yes. So definitely, 25% for the year does imply a back half rate that\u2019s different than what we\u2019ve seen in the first half. As I mentioned earlier, the pipeline effect of F\u0113nix definitely had an impact, so we recognize that those pipeline fills occur once in a product introduction. But that said, we\u2019re also comping against very strong growth rates of F\u0113nix 3 HR last year. So we\u2019re just trying to look at all those factors and come up with a guide that we feel is achievable for the entire year.","Ben Bollin","Okay. And then looking at the aviation business, obviously, the retrofit opportunity has been pretty good on ADS-B and maybe incremental attachment there. But could you talk a little bit about each subset and the degree of visibility you feel you have from both OEM and retrofits? And what type of progress do you think you\u2019re making on a market share front?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So continued strong interest in ADS-B, and it\u2019s growing as we move into \u2013 towards the mandate deadline, which is the end of 2019. People basically say beginning of 2020. We believe we\u2019ll continue to see that kind of momentum as the mandate approaches and people realize that they need to equip in order to be legal in their flying going forward.","In terms of other product categories, ADS-B is definitely a strong category, but I\u2019ve mentioned before in the past that we see a pull-through on other categories, particularly the aftermarket navigators and communication navigation, those kinds of things, as people think about are creating their entire panel. So we believe that is a positive trend, and we believe it will continue to go that direction as ADS-B moves towards the mandate.","In terms of OEM, we\u2019re incrementally positive, I guess, about what\u2019s going on in the industry. But I would point out that industry growth on the OEM side has lacked any kind of conviction, and so as a result, we\u2019re remaining conservative. But overall, we\u2019re pleased with what we see so far.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Tavis McCourt","Hey everybody thanks for taking my questions. Cliff I just had one for you and then a couple of clarifications for Doug. In your commentary around the auto business, Cliff, you mentioned managing it for profitability. It looks like this year, you\u2019ll get pretty close to that 10% EBIT margin level and may end up below it, depending on cost in the back half of the year. And obviously, if the revenue growth continues to decline 10% or more next year, that will be tougher next year.","Is that 10% EBIT margin levels a line in the sand? Or are you willing to run it for any level of reasonable profitability as the revenue scale down? And Doug, I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll mention, while I\u2019ve got the line, a couple for you. The full year tax rate, 22%, is that what we should be baking in for Q3 and Q4 as well? Also, you mentioned capital spending, I think $130 million for the year. That\u2019s a pretty significant uptick, especially in the back half of the year here. Just wondering if there\u2019s any specific projects that\u2019s related to. I think that\u2019s it. Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So Tavis, on the profitability on the auto side, we\u2019ve said for a while that our goal is to manage the segment for maximum profitability, and that continues to be our mindset. I believe that as we move into the back half of the year and holiday buying season, we\u2019ll see some uptick in overall seasonality that will allow us to leverage our expense base there. I think it\u2019s hard to speculate on what-ifs, but 10% profit on a business like this is still good profit dollars. So we continue to try to maximize those opportunities through the right levels of innovation and also focusing on niche categories to bring more margin to the segment. ","Doug Boessen","Great. Regarding first item, regarding CapEx. So yes, the project that we have that\u2019s going to increase the CapEx in 2017, probably going into 2018, is some of the expansion we have here of late regarding our distribution center as well as manufacturing for aviation. We announced that last year. So we\u2019ll see some spend here, some heavy spend come in the back half of the year that gets back up to the $130 million type of number. As it relates to tax rates, yes, our full year guide is 22%. For the first half, we\u2019re somewhere close to that. Q3 and Q4 is going to be dependent on what kind of reserve releases we have in that period of time. We don\u2019t factor those in until the actual reserve releases happen. But I think right now, the purpose is probably \u2013 your purpose is probably 22% full year, and each quarter is probably fair.","Tavis McCourt","Got you. And on the free cash flow guidance Doug. ","Doug Boessen","Sure.","Tavis McCourt","Are you expecting any meaningful change in working capital ending the year versus where you were last year?","Doug Boessen","Yes. So last year, we had quite a bit of favorability in working capital, primarily on the inventory side. So this year, if you look at the numbers, getting to the $550 million, we do expect some operating income improvement year-over-year and increased CapEx. But also, we won\u2019t see as much improvement year-over-year in our CapEx or in our \u2013 simply our working capital as we saw in 2016 primarily because of inventory. We expect inventory probably to be up year-over-year. Probably maybe a similar type of year-over-year change that we saw in Q2, we should expect to see at year end.","Tavis McCourt","Great, very helpful. Thanks guys.","Cliff Pemble","Sure. Tavis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson of KeyBanc Capital Markets, you line is now open.","Brad Erickson","Hi guys thanks. So back to the fitness margins real fast. Does the commentary you gave about the basic wearable declines, did that lessen the margin headwinds over time on the fitness segment? Or should margin erosion just generally be sort of the working expectation for going forward, at least for the foreseeable future?","Cliff Pemble","So definitely the basic trackers have a lower margin profile so they\u2019re becoming a smaller mix of the segment. It will improve our overall segment margin performance. We\u2019re relatively flat on a year-on-year basis, and the reason for that is that our overall product line is more mature this year. So there\u2019s some margin erosion that naturally occurs, and that\u2019s we had fairly flat margin even though we had a lower mix of activity trackers.","Brad Erickson","*Got it. And then in terms of the holiday, can you just kind of talk about what you\u2019re targeting for marketing and promotional activity, particularly for outdoor and fitness, relative to the year-ago period? Thanks.","Cliff Pemble","I think you\u2019ll see us do similar types and sizes of campaigns in the holiday buying season to support our overall revenue plan in our retailers as they carry our products.","Brad Erickson","Got it, thanks.","Cliff Pemble","Clif, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Kristine Liwag","Okay, good morning guys, it\u2019s Kristine Liwag on for Ron. In aviation, what was the growth in business jet OEMs in the quarter? And also, could you provide more color on which programs contributed to this growth. Is it light jets, medium-size jets or the super-mids?","Cliff Pemble","I think generally, the industry has already kind of reported single-digit kind of growth in aircraft deliveries. And I would say that we\u2019re heavily indexed into the small to midsize area of the market. So the light jet market, as you know, has been fairly weak and the mid-size has been more robust.","Kristine Liwag","And then maybe switching gears. Boeing recently announced a new business unit focused on avionics. What do you think Boeing\u2019s foray into avionics could mean for the industry. And how do you think this could trickle down to the large jets and affect you? I mean, a lot of your competitors in business jets also are suppliers to large aircraft like Boeings and Airbuses?","Cliff Pemble","We can\u2019t really speculate on all of their reasons for doing that. I think certainly, there\u2019s some hurdles to understand and going from zero to full avionics capability, and so it does require significant investment, significant staff. But at this point it\u2019s hard to speculate on what they have in mind.","Kristine Liwag","Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you, Kristine.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial. Your line is now open.","Ivan Feinseth","Hi, thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on another great quarter. My first question is on new product rollout. Can you give us some idea of what kind of new products can we expect to see in the second half of this year? And then I have a question about automotive.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So we can\u2019t provide any additional details. We\u2019ll be making announcements as we\u2019re ready on the new products.","Ivan Feinseth","Is there any area specifically we could hope to see certain products in?","Cliff Pemble","Again, I can\u2019t comment beyond what we\u2019ve already provided.","Ivan Feinseth","Okay. And then on the automotive and OEM side, since many companies like Apple and Google and even Microsoft are getting involved in supplying some kind of software or data to the self-driving car, how do you envision your role concerning cameras, autopilot systems, GPSes? And you have extensive OEM relationships. In the bigger picture, where do you see your role in enabling the self-driving car?","Cliff Pemble","Well, I think the car of the future definitely has lots of components and a huge amount of technology that\u2019s rolled in. There probably won\u2019t be one clear supplier or clear winner in all of that. We have our areas of expertise, as you pointed out, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focusing our effort in terms of finding opportunity.","Ivan Feinseth","And also, like, for example, one of the apps you have available for the F\u0113nix is the remote control for the Tesla, which, by the way, seems to be an incredible app. And people that own Teslas that hear about it don\u2019t even know Garmin makes a watch. They\u2019ve been buying the watch and are impressed with the app. Now that app happens to be made by a third-party developer on your platform. Do you envision working with some of the OEM manufacturers to develop apps for your wearables such as the Tesla app?","Cliff Pemble","Well, certainly, one of the greatest strengths of our wearables is our app platform. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve invested in early. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a very positive amount of momentum going on in our app store. So people are able to create new utility and new applications for our devices, wearable and other devices as well using our Connect IQ. But in terms of specifics and working specifically with them, I can\u2019t comment at this time.","Ivan Feinseth","Okay. Thank you very much.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. Thanks, Ivan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul Chung","This is Paul Chung on for Coster. So just to go back to outdoor, can you confirm the breakout between DeLorme versus F\u0113nix and other products? And on F\u0113nix, how much of that growth was from the smaller form factor targeted at women? And then finally, on the operating margin for the increased multi-function scale DeLorme? Or was it something more structural?","Cliff Pemble","Yes. In terms of breakout by categories, we don\u2019t do that in detail. Certainly, with the growth of F\u0113nix, it\u2019s becoming a bigger part of our overall outdoor segment revenue. And DeLorme as well, the growth there is making a positive contribution, although from a smaller base.","Doug Boessen","Operating margin.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, the operating margin situation, definitely there\u2019s leverage when you have significant revenue growth such as what we did. And as I mentioned earlier, we believe, generally, our investments in terms of engineering and, to some extent, marketing and advertisement, we\u2019re getting some leverage benefit out of those","Paul Chung","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Will Power of Baird. Your line is now open. ","Will Power","Great, thank you. I guess a couple of quick follow-ups. Just coming back to aviation, you raised guidance there for the year. I know you had continued ADS-B strength, but maybe just any further color on what the upside surprise has been relative to your expectations? And then I got a second one.","Cliff Pemble","Yes. So upside on aviation, definitely stronger growth in the aftermarket area than we anticipated.","Will Power","Okay. Any key particular products, I guess, within that?","Cliff Pemble","Well, again, ADS-B devices are strong growth area. And we are seeing the positive benefit of additional products being pulled into purchasing decisions as people retrofit their aircraft. ","Will Power","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask on the gross margin front. Based on the full year guidance, it implies slightly lower gross margins in the second half of the year versus the first half. I assume that\u2019s principally a function of mix, but any other color there would be helpful.","Doug Boessen","Yes. It really relates to the fourth quarter. What you see basically relates to our promotional activity in the fourth quarter. But in gross margin, yes, the improvement we saw in the first half of the year, while that was due to segment mix, is having a higher percentage of our business in outdoor and aviation, which have higher margins, and then the decrease in the activity tracker business and the auto PND business.","Will Power","Okay. Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Thanks Will.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to over to Teri Seck for any closing remarks.","Teri Seck","Thanks, everyone. Doug and I are available for callbacks this afternoon.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Teri Seck - Garmin Ltd.","Good morning. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Limited's first quarter 2017 earnings call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/stock. An archive of the webcasts and related transcript will also be available on our website.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, growth and operating margins, and future dividends, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products, and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of the risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded first quarter consolidated revenue of $639 million, up 2% over the prior year. Marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness collectively increased 12% year-over-year and contributed 75% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.3% as both segment and product mix were favorable. As a result of our increased revenues and gross margins, our operating margin improved to 18.2%, while operating income increased 12%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.26, which includes a significant income tax benefit recognized during the quarter. Pro forma EPS which excludes this benefit grew 7% to $0.52 in the quarter. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits and earnings.","However, since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment.","Starting with marine, revenue grew 26%, ahead of the overall market resulting in market share gains. All major product categories performed well. Gross margin improved to 57% while operating margin improved to 17%, resulting in operating income growth of 76% over the prior year.","Marine season is in full swing and we have seen strong demand for our latest product offerings. We started shipping our new GPSMAP chartplotters early in the season and the feedback from customers has been very positive. Looking forward, we remain focused on gaining market share through innovations that will clearly differentiate us in the market.","Looking next at outdoor, revenue increased 20% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. The segment continue to generate strong gross margin and operating margin of 63% and 30%, respectively, while operating income grew 24% over the prior year. We began shipping the highly anticipated f\u0113nix 5 adventure watch series late in the quarter. Orders have been very strong and we expect that it will take several weeks to catch up with demand.","We also recently hosted our first Connect IQ Developer Summit, bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshops and breakout sessions with our product managers and engineers. At the event, we announced new capabilities for Connect IQ, including the ability for app developers to implement a revenue model. We also announced new integration partners including SmartThings, which gives us a strong presence in the emerging home automation market.","Turning next to aviation, we reported solid revenue growth of 16%, driven by growth in aftermarket products and led by strong growth related to our ADS-B offerings. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 27% over the prior year. During the quarter, we started shipments of the G1000 NXi, the next generation integrated flight deck featuring wireless connectivity and enhanced safety features.","We received European certification for the GTX 345, expanding the addressable market for this popular ADS-B transponder. In addition, we continue to support our OEM partners in the development and certification of new aircraft and helicopter platforms. Much has been said about the challenging market conditions, which remain a factor. However, we continue to believe that market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for long-term growth.","Looking next at fitness, revenue declined 3% driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers, especially those which lack GPS capability. Despite this challenge, we are very pleased with the performance of advanced wearables with GPS capability, which experience robust growth during the quarter and nearly offset the steep decline of basic activity trackers. Gross margin increased to 56% as product mix shifted to the higher-margin devices. Operating margin increased to 13%, resulting in operating income growth of 11%.","During the quarter, we launched the Forerunner 935, which is our most advanced multisport watch with new running dynamics features and enhanced performance and recovery monitoring. We also introduced our latest v\u00edvosmart 3, an ultra-slim smart activity tracker with wrist based heart rate and an innovative stress tracking feature. While we continue to see the market for basic activity trackers mature, we also see growth opportunities in advanced wearables with GPS, and we are confident in our product roadmap going forward.","Looking finally at the auto segment, revenues were down 19% in the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market and partially offset by growth in our Auto OEM product lines. Gross margin was 44%, which is consistent year-over-year while operating margin declined to 4%.","During the quarter, we began shipping our next generation Drive family of PND devices, which has wireless connectivity and enhanced driver alerts. We also introduced the Dash Cam 45 and 55 offering high-quality recording in an ultra-compact form factor.","We remain focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.","Okay, finally, before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to mention the recognition we recently received from Forbes Magazine ranking us among the Top 100 Most Reputable Companies In America. I'm pleased to work very hard to make Garmin the best at everything we do and to operate the business with integrity. It's a special honor for all of us to be recognized in this way.","So, that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details of our financial results.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results to move the comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $639 million for the first quarter representing a 2% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.3%, a 380-basis point increase from the prior year created by the shift towards segments with higher margin as well as product mix within certain segments.","Operating expense as a percentage of sales is 40.1%, 230 basis points increase from the prior year. Operating income was $116 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 18.2%, 160 basis points increase from the prior year. And the increase in gross margin was an offset to increase in operating expenses.","Our GAAP EPS was $1.26 to include a $169 million income tax benefit due to reevaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. Our pro forma EPS was $0.52, a 7% increase from the prior year.","Next, we'll look at our first quarter revenue by segment. In the first quarter, we achieved 2% consolidated growth led by double-digit growth in three of our five segments. Collectively, marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness were up 12% compared to the prior-year quarter.","Looking next, the first quarter revenue charts. Collectively, the marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness segments contributed 75% total revenue in the first quarter 2017 compared to 69% the prior quarter. Marine grew from 13% to 16%, while aviation grew from 17% to 19%, and outdoor grew from 16% to 18%.","You can see in the charts where we illustrate profit mix by segment. Marine, outdoor, aviation, fitness segments collectively delivered 94% of operating income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 82% first quarter of 2016. Marine, outdoor, aviation, fitness segments had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.","Looking next to the operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $20 million or 8%. Research and development increased $14 million year-over-year or 180 basis points to 19.1% of sales. We continued to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness, outdoor, marine, where we see long-term growth opportunities.","SG&A was up $6 million compared to prior quarter, and increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 16%. Increased spending in SG&A was primarily driven by increased legal-related expenses and information technology costs. Advertising expense was relatively flat compared to prior-year quarter, representing 4.9% of sales.","A few highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable had decreased as expected sequentially and year-over-year, $391 million. Our inventory balance increased over the prior year sequentially to $533 million as we prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, we generated free cash flow of $95 million, a $21 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Also during quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million. We purchased $28 million of company stock, with $47 million remaining for purchase through December 2017.","In the first quarter of 2017, we reported income tax benefit of $150 million, which includes a $160 million (sic) [$169 million] (12:22) income tax benefit due to revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. Excluding the $160 million (sic) [$169 million] (12:28) income tax benefit, the first quarter 2017 pro forma effective tax rate was 21.3% compared to 18.1% the prior quarter (sic) [prior year quarter] (12:37).","The 320 basis point year-over-year increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland tax positions with international tax initiatives. We continue to expect our full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.","This concludes our formal remarks. Christy, could you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company. Your line is open.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","...for taking my questions, Cliff, I noticed in outdoor, marine and aviation, you're sort of well ahead of where you laid out the segment guidance for the year. So, I wonder if you could kind of talk about how that flows the rest of the year considering we started that these kind of high levels to begin the year and then I have a follow up.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, I think, for outdoor and marine, the first quarter tends to be the lowest quarter particularly in outdoor and marine it's a little higher. Aviation is more sequential. In aviation, we did see some benefit from increased mandate activity, some of which are expiring. So, just looking forward, we felt like it's best to maintain where we're at until we have more clarity around second quarter.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Okay. Then on f\u0113nix 5, I know it's very early right now. But I know part of the rationale for that product was to expand the market beyond the current users. I wonder if you have any data back yet on who's buying, are they existing Garmin owners or are they new people, are the demographics changing? Any color on that would be helpful. Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, definitely the demographics are changing, particularly around the f\u0113nix 5S model, which was designed specifically around the female adventure audience. And the data we're getting back through our online registrations and of course our cloud platform, Garmin Connect, suggests that we're being very successful with that.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you very much. Can you give us a sense for the split within the fitness segment between the basic activity trackers and the advanced wearables?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","It's about even.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It's about even, okay. And then your inventory days are really high, 183, which I think may be an all-time record. And I did hear your comments about preparing for the seasonally strong second quarter. But it still seems like a high level of inventory. So, is that because you're seeing stronger than usual demand in the June quarter or is there something in there that like activity trackers that is maybe the result of some of those categories coming a bit short of expectations?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","No, I wouldn't say it's due to shortness at all. We are preparing for what has become \u2013 Q2 has become nearly as big as Q4 in terms of its overall contribution. And we do have some new product ramps such as the f\u0113nix 5, which are driving additional inventory. I think our goal is to have in-stock situation, so that we can ship to any customer that wants our products during high season. And we'll continue to manage it pragmatically then throughout the rest of the year.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Simona.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tavis McCourt of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a clarification, Cliff, on the roughly 50\/50 split in fitness between basic and GPS-enabled given the ASP differences. Is that a unit split or a revenue split?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","I think it's a revenue split.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then a couple of other follow-ups on cost structure. So, obviously, we've seen a big increase in memory prices the last six months or so. How has that impacted you guys in the first half of this year or is there an impact that we should expect in the second half of the year related to that? And then it looks like advertising expense was down year-over-year for the first time in a while, is that something you would expect to continue or was that timing related?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, on the memory prices, definitely, there's a tighter market and prices have been going up. We have some longer term buying arrangements that have allowed us to continue at more favorable pricing during the first part of the year. We do expect to see some impact towards the later half of the year, but we think the impact will be minimal.","In terms of ad spending, Q1, we basically have reserved a lot of our activity until Q2. So, I would expect that to increase sequentially and possibly a little year-over-year as well. But since Q2 is one of the higher quarters, we're going to be promoting our more popular wearables particularly during the quarter.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And I just wanted to make sure I understood correctly your commentary around aviation given the strong Q1. Was it stronger than you had expected entering the quarter or did you expect a lot of the aftermarket strength and that will ebb and flow throughout the year?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, we were pleased. We outperformed our expectations for sure and, as I mentioned, there is some mandates particularly around EMS helicopters that drove some sales, plus we did have very popular aftermarket products that also performed well along with ADS-B.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Wittine of Longbow. Your line is open.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thanks. In fitness for the half of the segment that's non-GPS, Cliff, are you able to give some sense of the magnitude of the declines you're seeing in that market for simple devices?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, just to clarify, fitness consists of both the wearable fitness trackers as well as the running watches and then bike. But in terms of overall, its contribution, we saw sharply lower revenues in the quarter and offset by very strong growth in the running products.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Are you able to provide any sort of idea of just the severity of those declines just to help us level set our models (19:08)?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think \u2013 we don't break it out by segment for sure but as we expected when we came into Q1 based on what we saw in the latter half of 2016, activity trackers were down sharply. I think there's probably lots of different reasons for that and I think there'll be obviously more color around that even as we move through the day. But it seems like there's a lot of inventory in the channel particularly with market leaders that's being worked through. And as that clears and as new products get in such as our v\u00edvosmart 3, we believe that it will moderate as the year goes forward.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","With that dichotomy between the low-end and the high-end, are you making any strategic changes to your development resources for the segment, either pulling back on the low end or reassigning to higher-end devices? Or is the strategy to remain every bit as committed to continuing to add features to the below GPS product set?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, we have a strong roadmap on the basic trackers, as we've evidenced by the release of our initial products this year. We have additional products coming but obviously, we're taking a pragmatic approach to the investment and applying it where we see the most opportunity.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then finally for me, f\u0113nix 5, the availability remains pretty spotty, including through April, a bunch of big retailers still don't have it. I don't think you're selling it on garmin.com just yet. So, you referenced orders are strong. I just wanted to confirm there's no supply-side issues to be aware of. And I suppose it's more difficult to manage them prior launches given the higher number of individual SKUs than previously. Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think definitely we're pleased with the initial response, and it's not just a matter of low supply, we've been delivering in very nice quantities, for sure. But the orders and the reorders have been very strong. So, it's going to take some time to work through all of the orders that we have.","Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. As the mix shift goes towards more ramps, devices in the fitness category, what should the impact on gross margins and operating margins in that segment be, please?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, it'll definitely mix up because the higher-end devices tend to have the higher gross margin. So, we would expect it will have an overall positive impact on gross margin percentage and operating margin percentage.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And my second question is, you appear to be gaining market share again in marine and possibly in aviation. Can you just talk us through what's giving rise to that? How that's coming about and can it be sustained?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think our product lines particularly in marine and also I mentioned some strength in aviation too, but our product lines are very strong. We've been keeping them fresh and, as a result, we believe that customers are seeing the value and the differentiation that Garmin brings to the market. Keep in mind, these are both very niche segments, without a lot of dynamics in terms of the overall channel and the consumer. So, consequently, I think obviously there's some limit to what the potential growth trajectory looks like over the long term. But our goal is to be the market share leader and to continue to be able to grow with the market.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Yuuji Anderson of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. A question on gross margins, just overall, you saw a good improvement year-over-year in Q1. But just kind of assuming things kind of trend back towards your 56% guidance for the year. Are there certain segments that are going to see more volatility than others? Just any color will be helpful there.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. I think a lot of it's going to depend again on product and segment mix. In Q1, we had the benefit of higher than expected growth in marine and aviation, which mixed to be overall consolidated up more. As we move into Q2, which is seasonally higher and sequentially higher, we'll see how that mix develops both in terms of segments and products.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just a question on fitness, is it fair to say that \u2013 did you see a pause in shipments ahead of the new product launches in Q1? So, are you expecting to kind of make back a lot of that in Q2?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, we really didn't pre-announce any of the products in Q1. We were basically ready to ship when we announce the products. So, we didn't see any market impact from announcements that impacted order. That said with the new products, we've seen excitement around those and we're encouraged by the follow-through in the market on these new products.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Yuuji.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Good morning.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","I wanted to start on the aviation business. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the OEM category on the business jet side? Any expectations you have for how that develops through the year if visibility does improve and kind of your market share impressions? And then I have a follow-up.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, on the OEM side of aviation, I would say, it's business as usual from what we've been reporting for a while now. The overall OEM side of the business as has been widely reported by many players has been kind of lethargic in terms of the market. We're doing, I would say, okay. But, we kind of move along with the ups and downs of our OEM partners. We do have the benefit of some newer platforms that we're still comp-ing against from last year. So, that's an incremental benefit but in general OEM continues to be somewhat sluggish.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","And a broader question when you look at kind of the wearables category as a whole, how do you view the impact of what Apple has done with Watch? Last night they said, the units for their Apple Watch grew nearly 100% year-on-year. I'm curious if you think it's having any impact on your outdoor and fitness business.","And then, a last housekeeping item, maybe for Doug. Could he talk about the FX impact to operating profit in the quarter before, including the FX hedges? Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, Ben, in terms of impact from the Apple Watch, we are also seeing steep growth in our advanced wearable category. It doesn't seem to us that there is an impact from the Apple Watch. We have said before that we believe the customer-base for the Apple Watch versus our devices are slightly different.","So consequently, I think we're seeing a strong performance and even some pull through from their success as people see the opportunity for improved health and for pursuing active lifestyles. And they probably recognize then that Garmin offers strong products for those pursuits.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. And regarding the FX impact in Q1, there was a revenue headwind about $6 million, so not a significant amount of impact in the quarter.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Erickson of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Brad D. Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First, can you just lay out how much Q1 outdoor benefited from the f\u0113nix 5 channel fill, or I guess how much it added to the overall outdoor growth rate in the quarter?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","We don't break it out by product categories. But we were pleased with what we're able to deliver in Q1.","Brad D. Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. And then I guess a higher level question on fitness. Given the maturity in basic trackers you're calling out, is that a business Garmin really wants to be in longer term? We've always known that pricing and margins would inevitably sort of compress in that segment. But with calling out maturity, it seems like it's a headwind worth addressing now from a strategic standpoint. Any comment there?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, let's say, it's still a very large market. It's still a market that is adjacent to our interest in the overall active lifestyles. And so, it's an area that we still have a lot of interest in.","Brad D. Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Brad.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Cliff, I just wanted to try to clarify your comments about the basic trackers being \u2013 I think you said 50% of the wearables in fitness, but that would exclude the cycling products. Is that correct?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","That's correct.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","And so, it's less than 50% of the total fitness category revenue, right?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","And would you be willing to give any sense of how big the cycling piece is?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","No. Sorry. We don't break it down more than that.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Fair enough. And just on the marine category, obviously, you saw a very strong growth there. And I would guess you got some year-over-year benefit from the partial quarter contribution of the DeLorme in the first quarter of 2016. Would you be willing to give any sense of how much of year-over-year benefit you might have gotten from that sort of partial quarter DeLorme impact in the first quarter of 2017?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. So, DeLorme is actually recognized in the outdoor segment and the majority of our growth in outdoor was driven by wearables with less than half of that really coming from DeLorme.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Teri Seck for any further remarks.","Teri Seck - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, everyone. Doug and I will be available for callbacks today. Have a great day.

The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you, Kerri and good morning everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, with consolidated revenues increasing 9% year-over-year to $910 million. This growth was broad based with each of our business segments contributing.","Gross margins improved year-over-year, up 240 basis points to 47.7%. Revenue growth combined with improved gross margins resulted in both operating income and EPS growth. Operating income for the quarter grew 8%, while pro forma EPS came in at $0.96, a 16% improvement over the prior year. As a group, our traditional market segment for the aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness contributed 61% of our total operating income for the quarter and revenue from these segments grew nearly 19%.","We sold 6.1 million units in the quarter, which was flat year-over-year. Auto PND unit volume was down slightly; however this was offset by higher volumes in outdoor, fitness and marine. We generated $213 million in free cash flow during the quarter, resulting in a cash balance of just under $2.5 billion.","Looking at highlights for the full year, consolidated revenue increased 3%, as new product categories increased market share and emerging market opportunities delivered results that exceeded the expectations we established at the beginning of the year. As a group, our traditional market segments grew 14%, contributing $1.2 billion in total revenue for the year. The revenue growth in these segments combined with their strong margin profiles generated 71% of our operating income.","We delivered over 15.8 million units in 2011, a decline of only 1% year-over-year. Weakness in the North American PND market was partially offset by stronger PND shipments through the EMEA and APAC markets. Unit growth in the outdoor, fitness and marine markets also helped close the gap.","From a geographical perspective, the EMEA region grew 19%, outpacing all other geographies. All market segments contributed to the growth including PND. We generated $784 million of free cash flow in the year, which was partially used to fund our quarterly dividend and to complete numerous acquisitions aimed at further diversifying our revenue base.","Next, we will review each of our business segments highlighting 2011 performance, outlook for 2012, and a summary of long-term strategic initiatives. Starting with marine segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 12%, driven by improved market conditions and share gains across our product portfolio. We experienced strong market share gains in the OEM segment and expanded our presence in the inland market, with the introduction of our new echo fish finders. During the year, we expanded our product portfolio with SONAR and autopilot solutions that brought new innovation to the marine market and enhanced our ability to serve the sail and large boat market.","Throughout the year, we invested heavily in the marine segment, with increased research and development and rebuilt additional support infrastructure to serve our growing base of OEM customers. This has compressed margins in the near term; however we are confident that these investments are critical to growing revenue and market share going forward.","For 2012, we are targeting revenue growth of 5% to 10% in the marine segment, as market conditions continue to improve and as recent OEM wins and product introductions provide revenue contribution for the full year. At last weeks\u2019 Miami Boat Show, we announced relationships with Teleflex and Viking, both of which will target the larger boat market and will contribute to revenue in 2012.","2012 will also be a year of significant investment as we develop products and opportunities that will contribute to growth in 2013 and beyond. In the coming years, we seek to increase our share in the mid-to-large sized boat categories. Leveraging our relationships with Volvo Penta, we will create equipments that will embed us deeper into the boat, with innovative new engine and navigation displays. In addition, we will be working to expand our share of the inland market through innovative content and technologies leveraging the recently announced acquisition of Interphase.","Turning next to aviation, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 9%, which we view as a significant accomplishment in light of the ongoing challenges facing the general aviation industry. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association reported a 10% decline in aircraft shipments through the first three quarters of 2011. This decline is in addition to the already depressed shipment levels of 2009 and 2010. Despite the ongoing negative trends, revenues generated from OEM customers were relatively flat for the year outperforming the general market.","During 2011, we made significant progress in securing wins in the Part 23 and Part 25 business jet market. Cessna selected our G3000 system for the citation M2, a Part 23 aircraft that will enter the market in 2013. Additionally, Cessna selected the G5000 for the citation latitude, a Part 25 aircraft that will enter the market in 2015. We also made additional inroads into the OEM helicopter market where our primary flight display system was integrated into the Bell 407GX.","Last year, we introduced the GTN 650 and 750, which were the first panel mounted products to feature touchscreen operation. These new products have been well-received by the markets and were a significant contributor to the growth we experienced in 2011.","In 2012, we are targeting revenue growth of 5% to 10% in the aviation segment, as recovery for the industry continues to ride out of the overall economy. We are hopeful that the OEM market will stabilize in 2012. However, we do not expect to see meaningful growth from OEMs this year. Despite this soft outlook, we see many opportunities in years ahead and we will continue to invest in certifications with our business jet partners that will result in significant growth opportunities when the market begins to recover in 2013 and beyond.","In light of these opportunities, our growth initiatives are focused on continued development of our G3000 and G5000 platforms with OEM partners, which will be the foundation of growth in 2013 and beyond, identifying and capitalizing on additional retrofit opportunities, further expansion into the helicopter market with recent announcements at the HELI-EXPO naming Garmin as the standard avionics provider on the Bell Relentless, which will launch in 2016 and an optional avionics provider on two Eurocopter models launching in 2013. And we are well positioned for opportunities created by the FAA\u2019s transformation of the National Airspace System from a ground-based system of air traffic control to satellite-based system of air traffic management.","In the outdoor segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 14%, which was primarily driven by new product introductions, expansion into new categories and contributions from recent acquisitions. A few highlights from the year include the acquisition of Tri-Tronics, which expand our offerings to include training devices for both sport dogs as well as household pets. Capturing significant share in the GPS-enabled golf category with unique products such as our Approach S1 golf watch and offering a range of products and price points with something for every customer.","Our new Montana series is a premium device, offering advanced features and improved versatility over existing handhelds in the market. Our totally refreshed eTrex series is perfect for customers looking for a basic device and has been well received by the market.","Looking at 2012, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 10%, driven by ongoing momentum from recently introduced products, and we will leverage opportunities in the dog training markets through the Tri-Tronics acquisition. Our growing market share in the GPS-enabled golf category presents an opportunity to expand our distribution channels, both domestically and abroad, as more shops wish to stock our products.","Long term, we will create new opportunities by identifying adjacent markets and product categories as we have done in the past. We will maintain our focus on utilities, content and innovative form factors to engage both new and repeat customers in the segment.","In the business segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 24%, as the market expanded and we maintained our leadership position in the GPS-enabled fitness category. We remained focused on offering a broad range of products appealing to both elites, athletes as well as recreational participants. We refreshed our premium Forerunner product line in 2011, with the 610 touchscreen watch. This product offers unmatched utility, ease-of-use and innovation and has been very well received by athletes around the world.","In the cycling market, we introduced the Edge 200, which appeals to value-oriented cyclists who wish to experience the benefits of GPS-enabled cycling computers. In 2012, we are targeting revenue growth of 20% to 25% in the fitness segment. One of our key initiatives for the year is the completion of the Vector power meter, which we expect to deliver this summer. Across each of the fitness categories we serve, we plan to offer a broad range of products that appeal to all athletes.","Looking beyond 2012, we believe the fitness segment will continue to grow as society becomes increasingly aware of the important roles that fitness plays in the pursuit of a healthy lifestyle. We will focus on delivering compelling and useful products to the market with a complete solution, including devices, wireless connectivity, measurement sensors and a well-developed web portal. We will continue to build the Garmin Connect community, which has logged over 1.5 billion miles by delivering a satisfying and complete user experience that complements our devices and our mobile applications.","We plan to increase our share in the cycling market by offering a broad range of innovative products and by leveraging opportunities created by the Vector power meter. And longer term, we seek to capitalize on the profitable opportunities within the wellness base where we can leverage our knowledge of hardware, software and connectivity.","Turning to the auto\/mobile segment, we are pleased with our financial performance in light of the ongoing challenges in the PND markets, with revenues up 4% for the quarter. For the year, we posted a 5% revenue decline, while maintaining strong profitability. When normalizing for the deferral of high margin revenue associated with bundle PNDs, our full-year 2011 operating margin in the segment was 17%.","In addition, we grew our market share during the year, thereby strengthening our position. Notably, we exited 2011 with greater than 60% share in North America and approximately 30% share in the EMEA. In 2011, we introduced the simplified family of newbie products offering something for every lifestyle and budget, beginning with the Essential series, followed by the Advanced series and finally the Prestige series. This new product family was well received by both our retail partners and consumers during the Holiday shopping season.","Also, in 2011, we acquired Navigon. We will continue the integration of Navigon in 2012 building from the foundation that made the acquisition important to us, their OEM customer base and well-respected technology, their European PND market share and their strength in the mobile application space.","Looking at highlights from the auto OEM market, we were pleased to be recognized by J. D. Power and Associates for the Highest Customer Satisfaction with Factory-Installed Navigation during our first year of eligibility. The Garmin navigation system in the 2011 Dodge Charger ranked 1st, with the Chrysler 300 system ranking 3rd. This recognition confirms consumers value a seamless navigation experience that is intuitive and feature rich, an experience that Garmin has successfully delivered to our markets for over 20 years.","Additional programs announced and delivered during the past year include the Volkswagen UP compact vehicle where Navigon was selected as the exclusive provider of navigation and the Suzuki Grand Vitara and SX4, which features a semi-installed version of our nuLink 2390 connected navigator.","Looking ahead, we expect PND unit delivery to continue to decline in 2012, driving revenues down 7% to 10%. We will look for opportunities to grow in emerging markets and to profitably gain market share to offset the continued declines we foresee in the North American and European markets.","We will continue to invest in auto OEM opportunities in 2012, leveraging our broad capabilities as an OEM and consumer electronic supplier. In addition, mobile applications provide a near-term opportunity for growth, as the smart phone segment continues to expand, and we will realize a full year contributions from Navigon\u2019s popular smart phone application.","Beyond 2012, we will be focusing on expanding our auto OEM business through the additional program win, as navigation becomes an integral part of the dashboard and maximizing profitability in the PND markets as the market leader.","Given our revenue outlook and expectations for each segment, we are projecting revenues of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion in 2012, with gross margins stable to slightly increasing from 2011 levels. We are projecting operating income between $520 million and $540 million, with operating margins of 19% to 20%. The decline in operating margin is a result of increased investments in strategic long-term growth initiatives mentioned earlier, factoring in an effective tax rate of 13% results in forecasted 2012 earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.60.","In summary, we are pleased to have delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by revenue growth in each business segment and geographically area we served. During 2011, we were able to increase our share in several key markets, we delivered desirable new products and we were able to leverage the growing market segments in order to achieve better-than-anticipated results.","Looking forward, we see significant opportunities ahead as we anticipate improving economic conditions and we are well positioned to serve with a strong lineup of new products. With confidence in our business and the improving conditions we see around us, we are pleased to announce a proposal to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share, which will be considered at our Annual Shareholders Meeting in June. Kevin will provide more details on our dividend proposal in just a moment.","Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated associates for their efforts during the past year. While there are many uncertainties around us, you maintained the focus and worked hard to make 2011 a great year. Thanks so much for your contributions. This concludes my remarks. I will turn the call over to Kevin, who will walk us through the financial results in more detail. Kevin?","Kevin Rauckman","Thanks Cliff and good morning everyone. I would like to begin the financial update with a walkthrough of our income statement followed by review of our margins and then conclude with our balance sheet and cash flow position.","In Q4, we posted revenue of $910 million, with net income of $166 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.96 per share, which excludes the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 9% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 47.7%, which was a 240 basis point improvement from the prior year. The first time in six quarters, we experienced year-over-year operating income expansion going from $185 million to $200 million. Operating margin was 22% flat from the prior year.","The components of our operating margin were gross margin being 240 basis points favorable, offset by our advertising which was 90 basis points unfavorable, up $12 million on a year-over-year as we utilized TV advertising in the holding quarter combined with increased co-op expenses.","SG&A was 80 basis points unfavorable, up $14 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to the acquisitions. While 70 basis points unfavorable, up $13 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to acquisitions as well. Our pro forma EPS of $0.96 represents a 16% increase year-over-year, driven by increasing revenues and a slightly lower effective tax rate.","Our units shipped were flat year-over-year at 6.1 million units were delivered during the quarter and our total company average selling price was $150 per unit, up 9% from 2010 driven by product mix.","For the full year, we posted revenue of $2.76 billion, with net income of $521 million. Our pro forma EPS was $2.73 per share, which also excludes our foreign currency losses. Our revenue increased 3% year-over-year, while our pro forma EPS decreased 5% when excluding FX and a $0.50 per share one-time tax adjustment we posted in 2010.","Our gross margin at 48.5% was a 150 basis points decline over the prior year, due to warranty adjustments during 2010, which contributed 150 basis points. Operating income fell 13% to $554 million compared to $637 million in 2010. Our operating margin was 20.1%, down 360 basis points of 23.7% last year. Gross margin was 150 basis points favorable. Amortizing 10 basis points favorable and flat on a year-over-year basis, our SG&A was 170 basis points unfavorable, up $53 million on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by acquisitions, web-based commissions, product support and legal costs.","R&D was 50 basis points unfavorable, up $22 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to the acquisition. Our pro forma EPS of $2.73 was a 4% decrease year-over-year, on increasing revenue and slightly lower effective tax rate, offset by declining growth and operating margins.","Units shipped were down 1% year-over-year as 15.8 million units were delivered during the year. The decrease in North American PND volume was partially offset by growth in other geographies in our other segments. Our total company average selling price was $175 per unit, up 4% from 2010 due to product mix.","The non-GAAP measures that we have reported net income per share excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and a one-time tax adjustment booked in Q3 as I mentioned. The Q4 2011 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss was $0.11 and Q4 2010 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss was $0.15. The full-year 2011 GAAP impact from foreign currency loss of $0.06, while the 2010 loss impact the $0.38 offset by a $0.50 gain related to the large one-time tax adjustments.","Going to U.S. GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products. And this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in the fourth quarter and full-year 2011 and 2010. First, in the current quarter, we deferred approximately $0.26 of EPS in the future periods compared to $0.19 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Most of these revenues and costs will be amortized straight line over a three-year period.","For the full year, we deferred approximately $0.66 of EPS in 2011 compared to $0.42 in 2010. While we are deferring revenue according to U.S. GAAP, we are collecting the cash at the time of the sale, which is reflected positively in our statement of cash flows, which I will review in a minute.","In total, our revenues increased 9% during the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. During Q4, we experienced a 4% revenue increase within the auto\/mobile segment as volume declines were offset by improved pricing due to product mix. Our outdoor segment posted accelerating growth at 35% due to pent-up demand for new products and market share gains with the GPS-enabled golf market.","The fitness segment continued to grow with a 17% revenue increase when compared to Q4 2010 on the strength of our fitness products during the Holiday quarter. Aviation segment revenues increased 1% compared to Q4 2010, as retrofit growth was largely offset by program contribution related to our business jet cockpit win.","And marine segment revenues increased 15% compared to Q4 2010 as both the aftermarket and OEM markets improved for Garmin. During Q4, all geographies were stable or growing, with EMEA posting the strongest growth at 28%. For the full year, EMEA grew 19%, while Asia Pacific grew 13%. Geographies were partially offset by a 7% decline in the Americas, driven by the PND volume declines.","For 2011, the Americas represent 55% of revenue, EMEA increased to 31% of total revenue in 2010 to 36% in 2011, and Asia from 8% to 9% in the same period. So, the auto\/mobile segment represented 64% of our total revenue during the fourth quarter, down from 67% in Q4 2010. Outdoor grew to 13% of revenues in the quarter, an increase from 11% a year ago.","The operating income contribution of the outdoor and fitness segments increased to 30% and 20% respectively, or 50% of our total business. In total, the traditional segment contributed 61% of our fourth quarter operating income.","On a full-year basis, auto\/mobile revenue contribution declined from 62% to 58% in 2011, with games and outdoor, fitness and marine, which contributed 13%, 11%, and 8% respectively.","The operating income contribution of the auto\/mobile segment shrank 29% in 2011 compared to 39% a year ago. Our traditional segment contributed 71% of the full-year operating income, with strong gains in both our outdoor and fitness segments.","Looking next at the margin by segment, our fourth quarter auto\/mobile gross margin and operating margin were 38% and 13% respectively. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin, it was primarily driven by improved average selling prices due to product mix shifting towards higher priced bundled offerings.","Operating margins in the quarter were 13% or 20% when adjusted for deferrals. This is slightly higher than the normalized operating margin of 19% fourth quarter of 2010. Q4 outdoor gross margin was 68% consistent with Q4 of 2010. Operating margin was 49%, a decline from 53% in the year-ago quarter due to increased allocation of advertising and SG&A expenses for this segment.","Q4 fitness gross margin was 64%, stable from the year-ago quarter and operating margin was 43%, again consistent to the year-ago quarter, as both revenue and expense growth were evenly paid. Q4 marine gross margin was 60%, compared to 63% in the year-ago quarter, as product mix shifted towards lower margin products. Operating margin was 22%, down from 29% a year ago, driven by the gross margin declines and increased R&D and SG&A expenses to support our long-term marine OEM strategy.","Finally, Q4 aviation gross margin was 65%, down from 70% in Q4 of 2010, due to OEM program contributions. Operating margin was 18% for the quarter, down from 26% in the prior year due to the decline in gross margins and increased R&D expense associated with our new OEM programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013.","Moving next to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of almost $2.5 billion. Our accounts receivable balance increased sequentially to $607 million due to sales growth during the Holiday quarter. Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 81 days of sales when calculated on a trailing four quarters, compared to 101 days of sales in the fourth quarter of 2010. We have already collected approximately $350 million of our year-end balance.","Our inventory balance has decreased to 398 million on a sequential basis at the close of the fourth quarter. Our days of inventory metric was 102 days, compared to 119 in the fourth quarter of 2010. We ended the quarter with the following amounts and number of days of inventory","$129 million in raw materials, representing 31 days; $52 million in work in process and assemblies, or 13 days; and $246 million in finished goods, or 58 days of inventory and we closed the year with $29 million in inventory reserves. You will also notice on our balance sheet, that we show a $78 million dividend payable to be paid on March 31, 2012.","We continue to generate strong cash flow across our business, as cash from operations was $225 million during the quarter. Our CapEx spending was $12 million during Q4. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $213 million. Cash flow invested during the fourth quarter was $164 million, including the $12 million in CapEx and $157 million net purchase of marketable securities, offset by a $4 million gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment.","Financing activities were $160 million use of cash during Q4, due primarily to the dividend payments we made on both September 30th and December 31. We earned an average of 1.5% on all cash and marketable securities balances during the quarter and our full-year operating cash was $822 million, with free cash flow of $784 million. We expect our strong free cash flow generation to continue in 2012, and with it, we plan to continue to fund a strong dividend.","As Cliff mentioned, we will ask shareholders to approve a $0.45 per share quarterly dividend at our June annual meeting, representing a 4% yield, at the stock price of $45. We will also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets or tuck-in technologies, which fit with our core markets. As has been our practice, acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, values, compatibility, and strategic fit within Garmin.","Our tax rate for the full year 2011 was 10.8%. We do expect the 2012 rate to be approximately 13%, and the increase in this forecast of effective tax rate is attributable to revenue mix by different tax jurisdictions.","And finally, Cliff has reviewed our 2012 guidance, but I will just further highlight, that we have four solid growth segments, and we will continue to invest for long-term growth across the entire business. Our strong profitability and market diversity position us well for both 2012 and the future. This concludes our formal remarks for the morning. We will now move to a period of Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions) And we will take our first question from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer & Company.","Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company","Congrats on a very strong quarter. So, first question, you mentioned that you expect the auto\/mobile to be down about 7% to 10% next year. How much are you figuring in terms of deferrals next year compared to this year?","Kevin Rauckman","I think the deferrals, as we made a change in estimates at the end of the third quarter, will be \u2013 have been coming down on a per-unit basis. We will not comment or quantify how much, just given the fact that there is lot of variables into 2012, but in general, we would see a little bit lower amount as we go through the 2012 year.","Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company","And then on the outdoor segment, it was very strong and I think unusually strong is kind of a seasonal sense. Is that reflected of any one-time factors or does that reflect the fact that you have a different mix of golf products and training products that maybe more gift to you than your prior product portfolio?","Cliff Pemble","Hi Yair, this is Cliff. There is probably a combination of factors. I think in the last call, we mentioned that we were unable to deliver all of the Montana products in Q3 that we had hoped to deliver that we went into Q4 with some backlog that we were able to catch up on, but we also had strong interest in our golf products as well as in our eTrex line, which helped drive growth.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, thanks so much. Just wanted to make sure I understand your guidance a little bit better. So, your EPS in the quarter you just reported was up 16% year-on-year, but then the guidance you are giving is for mid-to-high single digit decline for 2012. So, can you just expand a little bit on what drove that conservatism? And then just as a follow-up, in terms of the PND units in the quarter itself, if you can just give us a bit of a sense of what drove that strength and how much the extra week in the quarter might have contributed?","Kevin Rauckman","I think the first question is, when we look at each of our business segments, we did have a very strong Q4, but looking forward, we did still see the North American market declining on PND next year, which is driving a lot of our overall PND expectation of down 7% to 10%. And as we said in the formal remarks, the fitness business is going to continue to perform quite strongly, and the other businesses will be into single digits, 5% to 10%. So, I mean, those are the primary reasons that we want to continue to and we need to continue to invest in some new opportunities primarily in the auto OEM and the aviation and marine OEM segments. So, that will pull us to the roughly to $2.45 to $2.60 EPS number we commented on.","In terms of the PND strength, I think primarily we saw market share gains in Europe. I think Cliff mentioned the Navigon business, we did see a pretty decent Q4 and the Holidays Q4 in the U.S. market, which helped our overall PND numbers for the quarter.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank. Mr. Goldberg, your line open. Please check your mute button.","Jonathan Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, can you guys hear me now?","Kevin Rauckman","Yes. Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just hoping you can give us some more color on outdoor and fitness. There are a lot of \u2013 I think you have a lot of product lines in those categories. I was just hoping if you could give us a little bit more details, some of the highlight by category. And also if you could help us understand your share position in some of the key segments in those products.","Cliff Pemble","We don't typically break it down by product category. As I mentioned earlier, we did have some strength in backlog products, so we came out of Q3 with orders from Montana that we were able to fulfill. We also had strong uptake on our golf watch in the outdoor segment. So, we are growing market share there and we feel good about our position in that market. Fitness, in general, has been broadly strong across both running and bike products, and so it just continues to grow as the market expands, and we are able to maintain leadership position there.","Jonathan Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Do you have a sense of what your growth rate in the fitness category was versus the overall market? We grow at double the rate of the market?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, I think it's difficult to say. There is not a lot of good research in the market. I think the dynamics of the market are such that there is a lot of sales driven out of small shops and that's not the kind of thing that can be tracked easily like big box retailers.","Operator","And we will take our next question from James Faucette with Pacific Crest.","James Faucette \u2013 Pacific Crest","Thanks very much. Wanted to touch on a couple of things also related to outdoor and fitness. First, I think in the prepared comments, it was mentioned that Vector power meter would be shipping in the summer. Is this a push out from kind of the March-April timeframe that we have understood, you were looking for, firstly? And secondly, can you talk a little bit about what the margin outlook is for the outdoor and fitness segments going forward? I am sure we \u2013 are you expecting margins to be sustained or do you expect there to be some more competitive pressures there? Thank you.","Cliff Pemble","Yes, James, I will handle the first part of the question and I will turn it over to Kevin for the second. But regarding, Vector, yes we did push out the Vector deliveries by approximately three months. The development is going well and still ongoing, there are some manufacturing issues we are resolving, but we have confidence that we will be able to deliver.","Kevin Rauckman","And then from a margin perspective, I think we do expect strong margins across outdoor and fitness in general. I think we can still see gross margins in the mid 60s and above 40% on operating margin in the outdoor segment. And our projection right now is that we would still be above 30% operating margin within the fitness segment in 2012.","James Faucette \u2013 Pacific Crest","Great, thank you.","Kevin Rauckman","Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Securities.","Scott Sutherland \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Hi, great. Thank you, good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.","Kevin Rauckman","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Sutherland \u2013 Wedbush Securities","First of all, maybe talk about the deferrals, it has been a drag on the EPS line. Are you still expecting that to start to turn neutral or positive this year or into next year?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, we have been saying for quite some time that we would expect that dynamic to change, and at this point, it looks like we will start to get some tailwind. It's very difficult to know whether that's going to be Q1 or Q2, or the back half of the year, but we would expect it to be less of a year-over-year drag than we have seen in the past.","Scott Sutherland \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Okay, And two part question, when you look at the fitness segment, can you talk about how you view competition from smart phones, a lot of that applications there at CES. Maybe, where you can drive growth, is it new categories, or is there still some global expansion opportunities or other areas that you can drive growth here on the business segment?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, Scott, we definitely see what's going on with the smart phones, in fitness, I think particularly, bikes is a popular area to use the phone. We offer applications on the phones as well and are beginning to get a sense of what that market is. I would say that, we feel that those applications tend to complement the devices and people that may be get introduced to fitness through applications, are interested in using a dedicated device as they continue to be serious going forward. So, we have not really seen that, that has been a major impact.","Operator","And we will take our next question from J.B. Groh with DA Davidson.","J.B. Groh \u2013 DA Davidson","Good morning, guys. Kevin, sorry if I missed this. Did you give an organic growth rate for the quarter?","Kevin Rauckman","No, we did not. I think what we would have experienced is, we picked up, due to acquisitions about $60 million within the quarter. So we would have had with a lower single digit growth, but still growth.","J.B. Groh \u2013 DA Davidson","And the vast majority of that shows up in the PND area?","Kevin Rauckman","That\u2019s correct.","J.B. Groh \u2013 DA Davidson","Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Thanks a lot Kevin.","Kevin Rauckman","Thanks JB.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Tavis McCourt with Morgan Keegan.","Tavis McCourt \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you could quantify the Navigon impact in Q4 either in terms of revenue contribution or maybe the share contribution in EMEA, and even if you can give real detail, just something qualitative would help? And then also in terms of the PND trends, you said U.S. had a strong quarter in Q4. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of the divergent trends if there are any, between kind of the U.S. market and Europe for PNDs?","Cliff Pemble","Okay. So the first question on Navigon, as I said, we experienced about a $60 million benefit due to the acquisitions, and most of that came from Navigon and they were \u2013 we won't give ultra details. They did have a little bit of a drag on EPS for the fourth quarter. So, looking next at the PND in the fourth quarter, I think we did see \u2013 again we saw a very strong performance in EMEA and also the U.S. market was still in decline but at a much less rate than we had projected going into the quarter. So, I think we were pleased with the overall results in our North America or U.S. PND sales.","Tavis McCourt \u2013 Morgan Keegan","And in terms of the overall market for EMEA?","Cliff Pemble","Overall markets, are you looking next year primarily?","Tavis McCourt \u2013 Morgan Keegan","No, I mean, just in Q4 specifically?","Cliff Pemble","Okay. I think that's where we were able to pick up some gain. I think that was your other question, how much did Navigon help us? It moved us from the mid-20s on market share up to about 30% on overall market share in EMEA. But the market overall still continued to be down.","Tavis McCourt \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Great. And then the follow-up for Kevin on the net deferred revenue that you kind of quote in the press release of $71 million or so for the quarter, is that net of what's being amortized from previous deferred?","Kevin Rauckman","Yes, we always record our numbers net of amortization.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Bright with Avondale Partners.","John Bright \u2013 Avondale Partners","Thank you. Good morning. Kevin, assuming market share gains in the marine, auto and aviation OEM segments, can you characterize the ASPs and profitability expectations there?","Kevin Rauckman","Just during the quarter?","John Bright \u2013 Avondale Partners","No, looking forward.","Kevin Rauckman","For looking forward, okay. So, looking forward on PND as we project 2012, we are really not projecting any kind of meaningful ASP change. We are looking at about a flat ASP difference year-over-year. Now, there are some geographical differences between the various North America, EMEA and APAC and rest of the world, but overall, we see ASP staying neutral. And then for the rest of \u2013 for the other segments, we typically, pricing is not a big issue. Our average selling prices have remained fairly consistent over the last couple of years. So, no meaningful changes there either.","John Bright \u2013 Avondale Partners","Kevin, I was trying to refer to the OEM market share gains, OEM in marine, OEM gains auto, aviation. What do the ASPs look like in those segments and does the profitability differ dramatically from what you see today?","Cliff Pemble","Yes, I think, John, to maybe address that question a little bit, this is Cliff. The OEM market does tend to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing in order to be able to offer OEMs value to bring the product through their channel, but we are factoring all that in terms of our overall results, and we can't specifically quantify obviously what that pricing is.","John Bright \u2013 Avondale Partners","As Garmin transitions and auto\/mobile declines as a percentage of revenue, how should investors expect Garmin to manage the allocation of the respective operating expenses?","Kevin Rauckman","So, I think on the auto\/mobile, we are still investing pretty heavily on auto OEM for the future, but our other operating expenses, because the sales are expected to come down, will make some meaningful changes there on that segment due to PND, but the other businesses, which are all growing, were investing in increasing our operating expenses to be able to fund the growth in those other traditional segments.","Operator","We will take our next question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.","Paul Coster \u2013 JPMorgan","Yes, thanks for taking my question. A quick one, what channels are particularly working for you at the moment? And is there a channel kind of expansion opportunity for you in Asia Pacific? And in relation to that, can you also comment on channel inventory going into the New Year, where do we stand in terms of the level? Thanks.","Kevin Rauckman","Paul, are you primarily concerned around channels within the auto\/mobile or just in general?","Paul Coster \u2013 JPMorgan","Yes, I think PND in particular, though I am also interested in the fitness and outdoor.","Kevin Rauckman","I think we have had full channel, distribution channel for years if this market is growing enough, then in decline for few years. The Garmin's distribution is quite strong. I think from an emerging market, we are looking at Latin America some opportunities to expand our growth opportunities in PND products. And then as far as the channel inventory, I think we feel very comfortable with where not only our inventory into the year, but also the inventory in the channel, the retailers have done a reasonably good job of managing that inventory during the holiday season.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up question from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer & Company.","Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company","Yes. First, on the lawsuit that was dismissed with Triangle Software, what is that going to imply in terms of lower SG&A costs going forward?","Kevin Rauckman","Yes, we have never given lawsuit settlements in terms of absolute dollars. I would put it as a fairly small number in our total SG&A in 2012.","Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company","Okay. And then, in terms of the other big line there, R&D. Should that $84 million that we saw in the fourth quarter be kind of the right go-forward rate?","Kevin Rauckman","I think we had some one-time expenses in Q4, but in general, yes, going forward, we are going to be at that level, if not a little bit above as we add some engineering headcount during the year. So, R&D for 2012 would be the one area that would have the most significant increase to our operating expenses.","Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company","Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Kevin Rauckman","As Cliff said, we are very pleased with the results, and we thank you for your interest in Garmin and look forward to a successful 2012. Thanks everyone for participating.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Kerri Thurston. Please go ahead.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd.'s First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call.","Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet. An archive of the webcast and related transcript will also be available on our website later today and will be posted through the end of May.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its businesses. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market share, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2012 filed with the SEC.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and CEO; and Kevin Rauckman, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin generated solid margin performance, with revenue growth concentrated in highly profitable segments. While consolidated revenues decreased 4% year-over-year, 2 of our most profitable segments, Aviation and Fitness, posted revenue growth. In total, our traditional market segments of Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation contributed 52% of the total revenue mix in the quarter.","Gross margins improved to 52% from 51% in the prior year. We experienced margin improvement due to the amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenue and the shifting of revenues towards high gross margin segments.","Operating margins were 15%, a slight decline from 16% in the prior year, with traditional markets providing 75% of the operating income in the quarter. Kevin will further discuss our financial results in a few minutes.","We sold 2.5 million units in the quarter, down 8% year-over-year. Declining PND volumes were partially offset by growth in Fitness, Aviation and Outdoor.","Next, I'll walk you through a review of our results segment by segment.","Revenue in the Marine segment declined 10%, driven by several factors, including an aging product lineup, unfavorable weather conditions and ongoing economic uncertainty. Unfortunately, we also reported an operating loss in the quarter as gross margin was pressured by discounting of existing products. At the same time, R&D expenses were higher, creating further profitability headwinds.","While the first quarter marks 2 consecutive quarters of operating loss in Marine, we are committed to returning this segment to long-term profitability through improved efficiency and with the contribution of new products. One of the most important new products is the GPSMAP 8000 series, which will ship this month. This series of glass helm products offer unparalleled features and design while also providing the ease-of-use that customers expect from Garmin.","In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 10%, with the OEM market contributing to strong gains in the quarter. In particular, we saw growth from new customers and recent certifications and expanding presence in helicopters and the emergence of Hawker Beechcraft from bankruptcy. Revenue growth, along with strong margin performance, in the segment translated to 22% operating income growth for Aviation.","During the quarter, we continued to gain market share in the helicopter industry, with Enstrom announcing their selection of our G1000H for their 430B helicopter. Also in the quarter, we expanded our leadership in ADS-B solutions, with the delivery of certified products that meet the requirements of the FAA mandate for tens of thousands of impacted  ineligible aircraft.","While our first quarter performance was strong, we recognized that demand for light business jets remains under pressure, and thus, we are cautious. We continue to look towards the future by investing in multiple business jet certifications slated for entry into service later in 2013 and beyond. In addition, we've introduced innovative new products for the experimental aircraft market and mobile applications that solidify Garmin's leadership in a broad range of solutions for general aviation.","Outdoor segment revenues declined slightly in the seasonally weak first quarter. We also experienced some gross margin compression, as pricing declined slightly and product mix skewed towards low-end devices. Given that the first quarter is traditionally the weakest for the segment, we expect margins to improve for the remainder of the year.","As we look at 2013, we continue to see significant opportunities for growth. There are new products that we'll be shipping throughout the year; ongoing market share gains in key categories, like golf, dog tracking and training; and ongoing expansion into new adjacent markets.","Turning next to the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 2% on a year-over-year basis, as our new cycling products performed well in the marketplace. While this growth may appear lesser or less than expected, it's important to remember that the Fitness segment experienced 26% growth in the first quarter of 2012 with the launch of the Forerunner 910XT resulting in a challenging year-over-year comparison.","During the quarter, we made significant enhancements to Garmin Connect with improved social features and training plan capabilities that enhance the utility and appeal of our online fitness portal.","As we reflect on the fitness market, we remain excited about the opportunity as active lifestyles continue to gain popularity. To illustrate, Running USA estimates that participation in half marathon events in the U.S. increased by 15% in 2012, and the trend is expected to continue in the future. USA Triathlon reported a 20% increase in memberships in 2012, with a 10% increase in adult memberships and over 40% increase in youth memberships. These trends support our belief that the fitness market will continue to grow for many years to come.","Finally, we anticipate entering new adjacent markets in the future. In particular, we are pleased with the progress our Vector power meter is making, which remains on track for delivery this summer.","Finally, in Auto\/Mobile, revenues were down 10%, with PND volumes declining as anticipated, partially offset by the amortization of previously deferred revenues and growth in our OEM product categories. Given that we entered 2013 expecting PND market declines, we are managing the business to this reality in order to ensure long-term profitability for this segment. Overall, our expectations for the PND category remain unchanged, with annual volumes down approximately 20% on a global basis.","Our R&D efforts in this segment are focused on essential features that enhance the driving experience and building upon our success in the OEM market by providing superior integration of technologies with an intuitive user interface.","One recent success to highlight is our announcement of the partnership with Mercedes-Benz. We will provide Garmin branded navigation solutions beginning in some 2014 models, with the expansion into additional models over the next 4 years. This software-based solution provides seamless integration with the entertainment system using the award-winning Garmin user interface.","Our software system provides navigation information to the instrument cluster directly in front of the driver, which is known to reduce driver workload and distraction. Our system also includes the underlying engine providing location data for the advanced driver assistance functions that Mercedes-Benz will be offering in future models.","This is an exciting partnership and highlights the success that our OEM team has achieved in gaining new business opportunities across the automotive brand spectrum.","That concludes my formal remarks. Kevin will now provide a more detailed review of our financial performance for the quarter. Kevin?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and segment results, then move to summary comments on the balance sheet, cash flow, taxes and guidance for the year.","We posted revenue of $532 million for the quarter, with net income of $89 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.40 per share excluding the foreign currency loss and tax benefits due to the release of reserves. Our revenue represents a decrease of 4% year-over-year.","Gross margin came in at 52%, a 90 basis point improvement from prior year, driven by the benefit of deferred revenue amortization.","Operating margin was 15%, down 120 basis points from the prior year. The components were the gross margin favorability of 90 bps, offset by an unfavorable operating expense impact of 210 basis points.","Total operating expenses increased by $3 million in the current quarter, driven by an $8 million increase in research and development. Each of the operating expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide.","Our pro forma EPS, which is adjusted for both foreign currency losses and tax benefits from the release of reserves, was $0.40, representing an 11% decrease year-over-year.","And we shipped 2.5 million units during the quarter, which represents an 8% decrease year-over-year. The total company average selling price was $214 per unit, up from $205 in Q1 2012, driven primarily by the amortization of previously deferred revenue.","Cliff has summarized the revenue change by segment, but I would just like to briefly highlight the charts on this page, which illustrates the Auto\/Mobile segment representing less than 50% of our total revenue during Q1 2013, as both Aviation and Fitness grew in the quarter.","Looking at profitability by segment, we have almost equal operating income contribution from each of our profitable segments in Q1 2013, with an offsetting loss in Marine. Due to the improved operating margin of Auto\/Mobile in the current year, the operating income contribution of this segment increased to 25% from 20% in 2012.","Aviation also contributed an increasing proportion of the operating profit in the current year due to revenue growth and improved margins. The Aviation segment contributed 26% in the current quarter compared to 19% in the prior year.","I'd like to briefly discuss year-over-year margin changes. Gross margins improved by 90 basis points in the quarter, as both Auto\/Mobile and Aviation margins improved. The Auto\/Mobile improvement is attributable to the increased amortization of previously deferred high-margin revenue. Aviation gross margin improvement is primarily due to improving volumes and sales mix. Offsetting this improvement was a significant decline in Marine gross margin, as Cliff previously discussed.","Operating margin decreased -- declined 120 basis points due to increased R&D spending in every segment. Marine was the most impacted, with a 24% increase in R&D leading to an operating loss in the quarter. And Outdoor operating margins also declined, driven by gross margin pressure caused by product mix and pricing, a 17% increase in R&D and a slight increase in SG&A based on expense allocations.","As previously mentioned, Q1 operating expenses increased by $3 million on a year-over-year basis from $193 million in Q1 2012 to $196 million in Q1 of 2013 and increased 210 basis points as a percentage of sales.","R&D was the only expense category that increased with the $8 million year-over-year impact. This represented a 220 basis point impact as a percent of sales to 16% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce.","Our advertising spending decreased $2 million over the year-ago quarter and decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales at 4% in Q1 2013. We will continue to scale our advertising expense to match our revenue trends.","SG&A decreased $4 million compared to the year-ago quarter and remained steady at 16% of sales. The decrease is primarily attributable to legal fees.","Instead of showing an eye chart with full balance sheet and cash flow statement, we just wanted to highlight a few items allowing you to reference the full statements in our press release. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.7 billion. This is a decline from the end of 2012, as we paid both the December 31 and March 31 dividends in the quarter.","Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $451 million due to the seasonality of the first quarter. Accounts receivable accounted for 64 days of sales compared to 81 days of sales in the fourth quarter and 66 days of sales in the first quarter of 2012.","Our inventory balance has increased slightly to $396 million on a sequential basis at the close of first quarter in preparation for the stronger seasonal period. Our days of inventory were 119 days compared to 117 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 102 days in the first quarter of 2012.","We do not currently show a dividend payable, as the $1.80 per share proposed by the board requires approval of our shareholders on June 7 at the annual meeting.","We continued to generated free cash flow across our business, as cash from operations was $59 million during the first quarter. This was negatively impacted by a $41 million tax related prepayment that will be reimbursed in the second quarter.","Our CapEx during Q1 was $12 million. Therefore, we generated free cash during the quarter of $48 million. This would have been $90 million without the tax prepayment.","Financing activities were $174 million use of cash during Q1 due primarily to the dividend payments on December 31 and March 31. We expect our second quarter will show a significant lift in free cash generation.","A few more highlights -- items to highlight during our Q1 results. Our recorded tax rate for Q1 was negative 8.6%. The favorability resulted from reserve releases associated with completed audits and the expiration of statutes in certain jurisdictions. Without this benefit, our tax rate would have been 11.6%.","Also in the quarter, we recognized 2012 R&D tax credits due to the delayed enactment of applicable tax legislation. As we indicated in February, this credit was factored into our overall tax rate forecast for the year.","We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter, but we do intend to repurchase shares throughout the year.","Finally, at this time, we are maintaining our full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion in revenue and $2.30 to $2.40 of pro forma EPS.","As in prior years, we will update 2013 guidance by segment after the second quarter, which is a seasonally stronger quarter, providing a better preview for the back half of the year.","This concludes our formal remarks. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, if we consider the moving parts related to the segments, the better Aviation, the better, solid Fitness side, and then you had some weakness in the Marine and the slowing trends in Outdoor, how should we think about the full year EPS, the moving parts there? I know you're maintaining the outlook, but I would imagine that the higher-margin businesses are doing better, so -- and you're minding your expenses, so you probably have better clarity on the EPS at this point?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Mark, we had a little bit of trouble understanding you, but I think what you're asking about is the EPS trends for the rest of the year. As we've said, Q1 is our seasonally weakest period, and so as we go into Q2, we're expecting both growth and operating margin to increase as we go into Q2 and then through the remainder of the year until we get into the holiday season. So at this point, as we've stated, our earnings per share target of $2.30 to $2.40 is still intact.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as we think about the cash flow, any reason to think that the bracket for the cash flow generation for the calendar 2013 may be dramatically different from what we saw last year? Just to kind of moving parts, I would imagine that your CapEx is still very low and you're still seeing very good cash flow generation?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. The earlier expectation on free cash flow is somewhere around $525 million for the year, which is lower than 2012. But as you pointed out, our CapEx is still expected to be in the range of about $40 million for the year, and that's in line with what we saw in Q1 as a seasonal rate.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. One last question. Conceptually, if you think longer-term, in a few years out down the road for Garmin, is there any new category that's in early development, or is what we see what we get for the foreseeable future? Just trying to think as we see some maturation of the core business, you're seeing growth in some other segments, but if there's anything else in the horizon that you can invest in.","Clifton A. Pemble","Mark, as has been our history, we continue to work on new applications in new adjacent markets for GPS. We're unable to share details of those at this time, but we do have some innovations that we continually work on and we'll continue to do in the future.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Yair Reiner from Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So first, I think you had a little bit less disclosure about the deferred revenue. According to my math, that is about $22 million to revenue and about $0.07 to EPS. Is that the right way to think about it?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, we have elected to -- now that we're in a period where deferred revenues are a positive. We did have a positive benefit. And those numbers are pretty close. We're actually looking at about an $0.08 EPS impact from Q1.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then a question about the fitness market. I understand that you're facing difficult comps this quarter. But I guess in general, there's a little bit of a delta between some of the market indicators that you cited in terms of growth and the more moderate growth that you've been experiencing. So I guess the question is, what have you seen in terms of competition both from direct competitors like TomTom and also from adjacent devices like smartphones? And how do you see kind of the R&D that's going to be required in that segment to stay competitive going forward?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we do see more competitors entering the market. You mentioned one of those specific cases, and there are definitely more. We -- you mentioned the statistics that we cited, which is true that there is a big increase in fitness-related activities. And I think generally, we've been seeing that reflected in our business. Last year, we did have the big boost from the 910, which reflects that upper-end market that I was talking about. And our Forerunner 10 has also been doing very well in the marketplace, but it's lower ASP, so it's more difficult to generate the revenue increases. But in general, we feel good about our positioning in the market, and we continue to work to expand the market both at the top-end and the low-end.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can I just -- give us your view of what you think the market did in PNDs in the first quarter, and how you think your market share did?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we think that the market continues to decline pretty much in line with expectations that we have, which was down on a global basis about 20%. We saw that, and reflected in the U.S. figures and in Europe, the figures are lagging a little bit behind, so we don't have precise details on those. But in general, we feel like it's performed about what we expected.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And from a market share perspective?","Clifton A. Pemble","Market share in North America, we grew our share quarter-over-quarter 6 points. So from last year Q1, it was 64%, and this year, it was 70%.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then within the PND segment, you typically have an ASP increase in the first quarter, just following the discounting in the holiday quarter. Was that the case this time as well?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Actually, we have the deferred revenue benefit that if you strip that out, our PND pricing came down in single digits in Q1. So from a sequential basis, we saw an increase, but year-over-year, it was down in single digits.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. And again, just stripping out the benefit from deferred, we calculate about a 200 basis point decline in gross margin in the PND business on a sequential basis. So I'm just kind of trying to square that with the sequential increase in ASPs. It would seem that the cost per device would have gone up, but I just wasn't sure why that would be.","Kevin S. Rauckman","No, I don't think the costs have actually increased at all. I think we're expecting overall costs during the year to be down in single digits, around 3%. So I think we may need to take that offline to see what you're looking at on the change in both cost and gross margin on PND.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the auto OEM business. If you can update us on whether that's approaching EBIT breakeven at this point, and also if you still expect any potential infotainment wins for the 2014 model.","Kevin S. Rauckman","So the first point on auto OEM, we did see an increase on the sales during Q1 as a part of our overall Auto\/Mobile segment. From an EBIT positive, we're not at that point, so we're still investing very heavily on the R&D to -- for future infotainment wins. And Cliff identified the Daimler-Mercedes-Benz relationship that we will have to wait on future announcements when they become available.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Bright with Avondale Partners.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Following up on the OEM discussion and Mercedes-Benz. You mentioned that this is a navigation software. Was hardware potentially part of this? And if so, you didn't win that, why not?","Clifton A. Pemble","No. The program that we were competing for was strictly a software-based program.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Who did you win the business from?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think they've had many solutions in the past, driven mostly by the suppliers that they've selected in-house solutions. So this is a solution now that they're going with a branded navigation from Garmin.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","On the Aviation side, in the prepared text, you mentioned numerous business jet certifications slated for completion in the months ahead. Can you give us some more detail there, who, maybe the size of the opportunity?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we've talked about those in the past, but I think that the players are well-known. We've got the Learjet 70 and 75, as well as the Citation Sovereign and the Citation 10 that's coming this year. And then there's new models, the M2, the Latitude and others coming in the future.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And then lastly -- well, actually 2 more. One on the Marine side, also in the prepared text, I think you talked about innovation forthcoming in glass helms, maybe a timeframe on that?","Clifton A. Pemble","As I mentioned in my remarks, we'll be shipping that product this month.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And then, I guess, the last question probably would be for Kevin. Kevin, the -- you managed your advertising and SG&A well. Talk about the factors to doing that and the sustainability.","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think we're sensitive to being able to maintain a strong operating margin, so we've been able to scale advertising as a percentage of sales, and we're still expecting that to be around 5% for the full year. SG&A, we had some benefit on administrative costs. And I think as we go through the year, we'll be able to sustain that as well to manage those expenses. We're very sensitive to not growing that during the year as we go through 2013.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brad Erickson","Just a couple. First, in terms of replacement rates as it pertains to the Outdoor and Fitness business specifically. Can you kind of talk about what you've been seeing there and how you expect that to develop going forward?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, they typically tend to be driven by product releases and innovation, so it's probably longer than like the PND market would be, but probably in the range of 2 to 4 years.","Brad Erickson","Has that changed at all recently, or are you expecting any change in that going forward?","Clifton A. Pemble","Don't expect any change in that.","Brad Erickson","Okay. And then on the Aviation side of the business. I think you guys had always anticipated that, that would be somewhat back-end weighted, and I know you don't want to update any specific guidance. But can you give us any sense of how you're feeling about your targets for the Aviation segment for 2013?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think we stand by our estimates that we gave there.","Brad Erickson","Fair enough. And then on the Marine side, I won't go at it from, I guess, the same direction, but obviously, that business got off to a little bit of a slow start, and you talked about the muted part of the early buying season. Can you kind of talk about what you need to do to get caught up there or what has to happen in order for that to occur?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think specifically, we need to get our new products to market, which we're doing. Some of the new 2013 line has already launched and is in the market. And then, as I mentioned, our biggest contributor, the 8000 series will be launching this month. So we have to execute on those. We are waiting to see, in terms of the full year, how things go here in Q2. As you pointed out and as we mentioned in our remarks, the market has been somewhat muted due to the weather and the economy. And so we're hopeful that we can, with the delivery of our new products, make up some of the lost ground that we've lost here recently.","Brad Erickson","Great, that's helpful. And then finally, just on the cash flow from ops being obviously a bit lower, you commented on the prepaid expense for the taxes. Can you kind of go and give us any color on any of the other puts and takes there, and kind of why there was so much more movement this year than years past?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think in addition to that, we had some other prepayments during the period that impacted us. And I think if you at look at deferred revenue that was -- from a cash perspective year-over-year was actually a negative. So if you take that into account, if you look at Q1 2012 to Q1 2013, we were actually on even ground, it's not a little bit higher, factoring in those adjustments for free cash flow.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Kevin, with respect to the full year guidance, what do you estimate the deferred add-back on revenue and the impact on EPS would be for the full year?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, we were expecting it will be positive. And I think if you look at just the seasonality, we had most of that benefit in Q1, so I think it'll be pretty nominal as we go into Q2 and Q3. And then at this point, we're expecting just a small negative hit actually in Q4. So for the full year, positive but not that much different than what we saw in Q1.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, got it. I know that for several years now, you've expected that the traditional business, the growth therein, which is a little bit more subdued at the moment than we'd expected, would eventually outweigh the decline in the PND business and the overall company would return to growth. Are you in a position to make a call as to when you think that inflection point is going to take place?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I don't think we're in a position now other than we're optimistic on the Outdoor, the Fitness, the Aviation business. Absolutely, Aviation performed very well during Q1. If you look at the overall trends, I think we're still expecting that we'll get to a point where we have to do that -- to the point where we can say when that will occur.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is there any market research you've done recently that has changed your view as to where the PND market stabilizes in terms of unit volumes in the developed nations?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think over the years, the market research has repeatedly called the PND market wrong both on the upside, as well as on the downside. So I don't think there's any crystal ball for that. But we're managing the business to what we think -- this year is the reality, which is down 20%.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","I had a couple of questions. The first one, looking at the Marine business. A lot of gross margin pressure there on some pricing actions. Can you talk a little bit if those were preemptive pricing actions to clear out inventory, was it reactionary? And how was that split between OEM versus aftermarket customers?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think it's really more surrounding the launch of our products, so it's really preemptive in clearing the channel from existing inventory. I think OEM and retail pricing tend to follow the same trends, so I don't think there is anything material in OEM that would differ from retail in terms of the trend.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Another item, looking at this auto OEM opportunity. Could you walk us through how you look at the dollar content per vehicle and then longer-term how you view the total adjustable market developing?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think the dollar content per vehicle is extremely high if you consider every kind of electronic that's in the vehicle. Naturally, there's certain areas where we can play, and the number of players in the spaces where we have confidence is high. So at this point, we're really in a building mode. We're gaining credibility and winning opportunities in order to try to bring the business to a sustainable point.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, got it. And the last question, all sorts of stories and rumors about looming competition from smart watches. I'm curious as to how you look at the potential impact of competition, what you're doing now to mitigate all these vendors that are potentially coming into this market.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think there's probably 10 stories today on smart watches, so the rumors are definitely rampant out there. We believe that the kinds of markets that we serve with the kinds of products that we design are specifically what our customers want for the activities that they have. I think a lot of the examples that we've seen, again, they're all just speculation, but they aren't really products that you could do some of the activities and have the utility that we have in our products. So we're continuing to innovate and respond with anticipation for where the market will go. But at this point, they're mostly just rumors, and there's not a lot we can comment on.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","I wanted to hone in on Outdoor, the margin being a little weak in Q1, and you talked about it improving. I wonder if you could talk about which products are going to allow you to do that. And is that sort of a high-end dynamic, mid-range, low-end? Any color there would be helpful.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, the -- in Q2, we'll be releasing our new Oregon series, which should help improve some of the gross margins. And one of the factors we mentioned in the comments was the shift to lower-end devices. We think the Oregon series will help us move towards more of the higher-end mix. Also, we did start to deliver our fenix watch again in the quarter, and we should be doing more of that in Q2, so that will also help.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","And then on the buyback. I wanted to ask -- you didn't buy back anything in the quarter. I think your guidance for the full year implied some buyback, and you said you intend to do some in the year. I wondered if there's anything sort of structurally or, call it, back office holding you back in Q1, or if it was just an opportunistic thing?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Not really. It's more opportunistic. And we realized that Q1 is our seasonally weakest quarter. So we had very few days actually to be in the market outside of the blackout period, so we like to just to wait until we got into Q2 to be -- again, to be more opportunistic in the buyback.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just a big picture question. We're seeing lots of investments called venture investment in devices that use sensors other than GPS called accelerometers, gyros and then if you move over navigation, LIDAR-type sensors for self-driving cars, those sorts of things. I wonder just sort of long-term how you view your play as it relates to GPS versus other sensors, if we're going to see a shift over time to more investments in some of those other categories utilizing those other sensors.","Kevin S. Rauckman","There's no question that some of those other sensors are getting a lot of attention, and there's a lot of activity around how to utilize those in the vehicle. We strongly believe that GPS will always play a strong role in whatever navigation solutions are in the vehicle because inertial sensors alone aren't sufficient to be able to guide the vehicle and accomplish what drivers want to do. So we still believe strongly in that. And at the same time, we have our own expertise in the area of inertial sensors on many of our product lines that include accelerometers and gyros and things like that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just starting out with the Marine segment, I just wanted to see if you guys have seen any change in the competitive environment, particularly new entrants into the freshwater market or potentially maybe some resurgence from some legacy players that are under new management?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, we don't really see any impact from new players at this moment. I think there's basically a group of 3, particularly in the North American market, and probably 4 in the international market that continue to compete together. And the market, as we view it, is somewhat capped and limited. So that is a game of trading market share through product innovation and winning customers.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then in terms of the seasonality pattern for the year, are you guys still thinking about this as being fairly similar to last year, or how should we think about seasonality from that perspective?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes, we don't see any major trends. We would expect, as we mentioned, a Q2 uptick in seasonality due to spring buying and then as we get into Q4, clearly, still expect a holiday buy. I think the impact on magnitude is probably less, but we saw that last year as well. So again, Q2 is stronger, and then Q4 is the strongest seasonality during the year.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just one last question in terms of the Mercedes-Benz deal. Just wanted to understand from a reputation standpoint if this is a really significant milestone, or should we just think about it as sort of a step-function improvement in terms of your ability to compete in the OEM segment?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think it's safe to say that Mercedes-Benz is an iconic nameplate in the automotive industry, and they're known for their particular quality and reputation. And so we view it as a very significant milestone and something that we attribute to the strength of our brand, as well the ease-of-use of our operating system.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just finally, on the Mercedes deal. How should we think about the margins that are associated with the deal just given that it's more software-oriented relative to the other portions of the Auto [indiscernible] business?","Kevin S. Rauckman","So we haven't commented on specific margins other than that, I would say, they're in line on our auto OEM business similar to what we have in PND. So the overall Auto\/Mobile segment margins shouldn't be impacted materially due to this deal.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In mid-March, you guys filed an 8-K relevant to the Lear 70 and 75 opportunity, and there were some delays there, and a sort of interest-free loan that you had to make the Bombardier. Can you give us some color around what happened there, how things stand now, and whether you think you'll recognize some revenue in 2013 from those platforms?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, so that situation was surrounding some delays in the program that were impacting Lear's ability to ramp up their production. And so as part of our partnership, we did agree to provide a free cash flow bridge for them to be able to do that. We're tracking to plan in terms of the terms of that and the program in general so that we can start the repayment cycle. And in terms of revenue recognition, yes, we have been recognizing some of that as they've been starting to spend on their production line.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then you made the comment earlier about continuing to heavily invest in the auto OEM platform, and I'm just trying to think about what that might mean. Because if I think about the K2, you developed that essentially, to the best of our knowledge, on spec.  You built it, now you're out there, I suppose, selling it. And given where you are with that platform developed, what would be the spending going forward? Are you adding new capabilities to the K2? Or is it specific spending related to opportunities or RFPs? And also, when you talk about heavy investment, you're talking about sort of similar levels on an absolute, or do you see those levels growing in dollars?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think in general from where we are today, they're growing -- our levels of investment will continue to grow year-over-year, but we're flattening that peak now as we kind of see the level of business that we have there. In terms of K2, we're continuing to develop features and be able to showcase the system for opportunities that are being vetted to us through RFPs and the like. So in general, I would say, it's more incremental work at this point.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just lastly, would you say that given your recent win with Mercedes and with the K2 and the Suzuki product in production, I know you can't give us sort of wins, but do you feel like you've -- your traction in this market is improving? And that's it for me.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think all of the things that you mentioned are significant milestones, becoming a Tier 1 supplier on a hardware infotainment system, winning an opportunity like Mercedes with an incredibly respected nameplate in the market. So we believe we've been making steady progress. As we've been saying in the past, the progress is slow because this industry is a slow-moving industry. But in general, I think we're pleased with where we're at.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's actually Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron. On Aviation, Cessna citation's kind of your first Part 25 aircraft. Is there anything about the FAA certification process that may have surprised you so far?","Clifton A. Pemble","I don't think anything has surprised us. I think every time you move up a level of certification complexity, there's more work involved, and there's some learning process that goes on with that. But in general, I think it was along the lines of our expectations. I would point out that one of our previous programs, the Phenom 300 was a Part 23, it was called Fast 4, which is actually in terms of requirements very close to Part 25, so we did have some previous experience as well with that level of rigor.","Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. And then it seems like there's a possible refresh opportunity in the horizon with Gulfstream as they kind of look at the G450, G550. Can you kind of talk about your capabilities with regards to pursuing large cabin business jet platforms?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we think our G5000 system is well positioned to be able to compete in the large cabin -- larger business jet market. So at this point, we feel pretty good about where we're at. And as we get some of these certifications under our belt, I think we'll be in a good position to compete on future programs.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Yair Reiner from Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Aviation. You had a very strong quarter there. I was wondering, was there any impact there from maybe some inventory build at the OEMs ahead of the entering to service, or should we think about that $80 million you had in the first quarter as the new base rate from which we'll actually see some growth as production begins to ramp on these new platforms?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we feel good about where we are in Aviation right now. In terms of the Q1 results, we mentioned 3 factors: one was new platforms, the other was helicopter and the third was the reemergence of HBC from bankruptcy. And pretty much we felt like the improvement was spread evenly amongst all of those different causes. So we think going forward, we should continue to be growing, and we feel good about our estimates for the year.","Operator","And we have no further questions over the phone at this time.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Okay, so thanks again everyone for your contribution, for your interest in Garmin. We look forward to progressing throughout the year, and we'll update you for the 2013 as we conclude Q2. So thanks again.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"10027":["Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) Q4 2013 Earnings Call February 19, 2014 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Kerri Thurston - Director of Investor Relations","Clifton A.

Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Kerri Thurston. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kerri Thurston","Good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd.'s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.","Please note that the earnings press release and the related slides are available on Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com\/doc. An archive of the webcast and a related transcript will be available on the website later today.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market share, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K that is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will be filing our 2013 10-K later today.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Rauckman, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong fourth quarter revenue and margin performance, which contributed to a 12% increase in pro forma EPS. Outdoor, Fitness, Aviation and Marine increased 14% on a combined basis, which largely offset lower revenues in Auto\/Mobile. These growth segments represented 50% of our revenue in the holiday quarter.","Growth in operating margins improved year-over-year to 52% and 23%, respectively. Gross margin strength was driven by the revenue mix shifting towards our higher-margin segments and a lower amount of revenue deferrals on a year-over-year basis.","Operating income increased 16% due to stronger gross margins combined with expense control. This allowed us to maintain our emphasis on R&D while keeping overall expenses relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. As a result, operating income grew in each of our 5 business segments and we generated $135 million in free cash flow during the quarter. We are pleased with our Q4 performance and it gives us a strong foundation to build upon as we begin 2014.","Looking briefly at full year performance, we achieved record revenue in our growth segments. However, ongoing declines in the PND category resulted in lower consolidated revenue, as we expected, down 3% for the year. On a combined basis, our growth segments contributed over $1.3 billion in revenue for the year, or 51% of the total, and generated 67% of our operating income.","Gross and operating margins were stable compared to 2012, resulting in strong profit generation despite pressure in the PND market and an increased level of R&D spending during the year. Kevin will further discuss margins in his remarks.","For the full year, we generated $574 million of free cash flow, exceeding our expectations of $525 million. The cash was primarily used to fund our quarterly dividend and share repurchase programs throughout 2013.","So next, we'll review each of our business segments, highlighting 2013 performance, the 2014 outlook and a brief summary of long-term strategic initiatives.","Starting first with Outdoor, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 2%, with growth accelerating in the fourth quarter due to new product introductions. Wearables, golf products, dog tracking and training and action cameras contributed to this growth. The Outdoor segment continued to generate strong gross and operating margins in 2013 at 64% and 39%, respectively. The most significant product introduction in 2013 was the VIRB action camera series, which contributed to stronger growth in the fourth quarter. Looking at 2014, we expect revenue growth of 10% to 15%, driven by growth in action cameras, golf, and dog tracking and training devices.","Beyond 2014, we will focus on new opportunities in adjacent markets where we can leverage our brand and global distribution. We will make additional investments in the action camera market to broaden our product line and drive market share gains. In addition, we will maintain our focus on utility, content and innovative form factors to track both new and repeat customers, while embracing the opportunities to enhance the user experience via connectivity.","In the Fitness segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 11%, which outpaced both our expectations and prior year growth. We expanded our leadership position in the GPS-enabled Fitness category with the introduction of new Edge cycling computers and Forerunner watches. In addition, we expanded our role in the cycling market with the introduction of the Vector power meter. The return to double-digit growth in the second half of 2013 gives us confidence that the Fitness market remains underpenetrated and that our products continue to be well-positioned from a competitive perspective. Though we have faced significant competition in recent years, our portfolio of differentiated products has resulted in strong gross and operating margins of 63% and 34%, respectively.","In 2014, we are targeting revenue growth of 10% to 15% in the Fitness segment. A key component of this growth is the recent launch of the v\u00edvofit and v\u00edvok\u00ed activity monitors, which establish a new standard for utility and innovation in this emerging product category. In addition, we plan to further penetrate the cycling and running markets with our recently launched products and others that are yet to come during the year.","Looking beyond 2014, we believe that opportunities within fitness and wellness will continue to expand as global consumers become increasingly health conscious. We will focus on delivering compelling form factors and innovative products to the market, offering a complete solution of device, wireless connectivity, measurement sensors and a compelling web portal. We will leverage the redesigned Garmin Connect website to further expand our community of users with enhanced support for a broad range of activities and social networking among participants.","Finally, we'll gain share in the activity monitor market by delivering industry-leading utility and form factors that meet the needs of a diverse set of customers.","Turning next to Aviation, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 16%, as both OEM and aftermarket performed well. Operating income increased 20% for the year, ahead of revenue growth as gross margin improved and expenses were in line with sales. A key achievement in 2013 was the completion of our first Part 25 certifications with Cessna and Bombardier. In addition, we launched new or enhanced systems with Embraer, Piper, Bell and AgustaWestland.","In 2014, we are targeting revenue growth of 10% to 15% in the Aviation segment. Stable conditions in the OEM market, combined with a full year of revenue contributions from new platforms, will result in growth for OEM products. In addition, we anticipate positive signals in the aftermarket will continue in the coming year and contribute to overall segment growth.","Longer term, our growth initiatives are focused on continued development of our G3000 and G5000 platforms with OEM partners, which is the foundation for long-term market share expansion, identifying aftermarket opportunities, as well as commercial off-the-shelf opportunities within the military and government sector, developing unique technologies that fill gaps in our current product portfolio, and capitalizing on opportunities created by the FAA's transformation of the National Airspace System from a ground-based system of air traffic control to a satellite-based system of air traffic management.","Moving next to the Marine segment, we reported year-over-year revenue growth of 7%, with accelerated growth in the second half of the year when we delivered a significant number of new products to the market. Gross and operating margins declined as we faced competitive pricing pressure, unfavorable product mix and higher R&D expenses associated with expanding our product portfolio. Though this reduced segment profitability in the short term, we expect to see revenue growth and improved profitability going forward.","For 2014, we are targeting revenue growth of 10% to 15% in the Marine segment as we anticipate market conditions will improve and recent product introductions will generate new revenue opportunities. New product contributions include a full year of our Glass Helm products, as well as contributions from new chartplotters and fishfinders, which we introduced late last year and have already been delivered to the market.","In the long term, our objective is to increase our market share in recreational boating with specific emphasis on fishing and sailing markets. We plan to grow our OEM position by leveraging our full range of products including chartplotters, radar, sonar, autopilots and audio systems. And finally, through continued innovation and efficiency, we will deliver new products and improve the operating margin performance of our Marine business over the long term.","Looking finally at the Auto\/Mobile segment, revenues declined 13% for the full year as lower PND revenues were partially offset by growth in OEM and mobile product categories. According to our estimates, we exited the year with approximately 45% market share on a global basis and achieved 81% share in the fourth quarter in the U.S. market, representing an all-time high watermark for Garmin. Though the industry headwinds were challenging, segment margins remained strong, generating over $188 million of operating income for the year. A key highlight in 2013 was the announcement of our relationship with Mercedes, providing navigation solutions beginning in some 2014 models and all models by 2017.","Looking at 2014, we expect PND unit deliveries to decline in line with 2013 rates, driving revenues down 10% to 15% in the segment. We will focus on market share leadership and maximizing profitability in PNDs while capitalizing on new opportunities such as dash cameras and portable HUD solutions. We will continue to invest in Auto OEM opportunities, leveraging our complete range of capabilities from fully integrated entertainment platforms to navigation-focused software solutions.","Beyond 2014, we will focus on expanding our Auto OEM business through additional program wins, delivering the most intuitive and advanced in-vehicle experience, managing the profitability of the PND segment as the market size continues to decline and capitalizing on niche opportunities in motorcycle, fleet management, over-the-road trucking and RV.","While no single product can offset the trends in the PND market, we are excited about the numerous incremental opportunities to enhance revenue and profitability in 2014. With this in mind, we are projecting revenues of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, with gross margins increasing to 54% to 55% due to segment mix. We are projecting operating income between $530 million and $565 million, with operating margins of approximately 21% as we grow our R&D investment and manage other expenses in line with revenue and opportunity. Factoring in an anticipated effective tax rate of 17%, 2014 pro forma earnings per share should fall in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 with free cash flow generation of $550 million to $600 million.","Given our cash flow outlook, we will propose an increase in the dividend at our upcoming annual meeting, and we will participate in share repurchases as market conditions warrant. We believe these actions will result in strong returns for our shareholders over the long term.","And finally, you'll see in our press release that Kevin has decided to change the intense pace he has managed over the years. We wish Kevin all the best in the future, but we're going to miss him very much. Kevin will offer some additional remarks on his transition in a moment, but I want to take this opportunity to thank you, Kevin, for all you've done for Garmin over the past 15 years.","That concludes my remarks. Kevin will now walk through our Q4 and full year financials in more detail. So Kevin, take it away.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Thanks, Cliff, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our financial results then move to some summary comments on the balance sheet, cash flow, taxes and, finally, 2014 guidance.","So we posted revenue of $760 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $150 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.76 per share, excluding the foreign currency gain. Our revenue represents a decrease of just 1% year-over-year. And gross margin came in at 52%, a 330 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment mix and reduced impact from deferred revenues.","Operating margin was 23%, an increase of 320 basis points from the prior year with gross margin favorability of 330 basis points, offset by an unfavorable operating expense impact of 10 basis points. Total operating expenses decreased by $2 million in the current quarter with reduced spending in advertising, partially offset by a $10 million increase in research and development. Each of the operating expense categories will be discussed in detail on a later slide.","Our pro forma EPS, which is adjusted for the foreign currency gain, was $0.76, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. We shipped 4.5 million units during the quarter, which represents an 11% decrease year-over-year. Our total company average selling price was $169 per unit, up 11% from $152 in the fourth quarter of 2012, driven primarily by segment mix and the reduced revenue deferrals.","Looking at full year results, we posted revenue of $2.6 billion for the year, with pro forma net income of $514 million. Our pro forma EPS was $2.62 per share, which excludes FX gains and $68 million of our income tax reserve releases during the year.","Our revenue decreased 3% year-over-year, and our gross margin was 53%; it had a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year. Operating income decreased 5% to $574 million compared to $604 million in 2012. Our operating margin was 22%, down 40 basis points from last year. The pro forma of $2.62 was down 8% year-over-year. Units shipped were down 10% with 13.9 million units delivered during 2013.","Next, you can see from our -- how our fourth quarter revenue breaks down by segment. I would just like to briefly highlight the charts on this page which illustrate the Auto\/Mobile segment representing 50% of our total revenue during Q4 of 2013 as each of the non-Auto\/Mobile segments grew during the quarter.","You can see from our profitability mix by segment that our non-Auto\/Mobile segments delivered 69% of operating income in the quarter, an increase from 66% in Q4 of 2012. Fitness, Aviation and Marine each contributed an increasing proportion of total operating income in Q4 due to revenue growth and improving or stable operating margins.","I'd like to briefly discuss year-over-year gross margin changes by segment. Auto\/Mobile gross margin increased to 40% from 38% in the prior year, primarily due to less deferred high-margin revenues. Marine and Fitness gross margins improved in the current quarter due to product mix shifting towards new products in the quarter. So our total corporate operating margin improved to 23% due to the increased gross margin during the period.","Looking briefly at year-to-date metrics, revenue contribution for 2013 shifted toward our growth segments, with Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor each growing in contribution. A similar shift is occurring in operating income with 67% of our 2013 operating income coming from our non-Auto\/Mobile segments.","As previously mentioned, the Q4 operating expenses decreased by $2 million on a year-over-year basis from $224 million in Q4 to $222 million in Q4 of 2013 while increasing 10 basis points as a percent of sales. R&D increased $10 million year-over-year, and this represented a 140 basis point impact as R&D increased to 12% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce with a heavy emphasis on Aviation, Outdoor and Fitness.","Our advertising spending decreased $12 million over the year-ago quarter, and decreased 150 basis points as a percent of sales to 5% in Q4 of 2013. Much of the decrease was related to declining volumes in PND, as well as reduced media spending. We will continue to scale our advertising expense to match our revenue trends.","SG&A was up $1 million compared to the year-ago quarter, increasing 20 basis points while holding steady at 12% of sales. We are working diligently to manage these expenses as our PND market declines.","Next, to balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.8 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $565 million due to holiday sales. Our accounts receivable accounted for 79 days of sales compared to 81 days of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Our inventory balance decreased to $382 million on a sequential basis at the close of fourth quarter, as we exited the stronger holiday quarter. Our days of inventory were 114 days compared to 117 days in the fourth quarter of 2012.","We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business as cash from operations was $150 million during Q4. CapEx was $15 million during the fourth quarter. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $135 million during the fourth quarter, and our free -- full year free cash flow was $574 million, coming in ahead of forecast. We repurchased $31 million of company stock and have $241 million still authorized through December of 2014.","A few more items to discuss relative to our Q4 announcement. Our effective tax rate for Q4 of 2013 was 20% compared to 16.5% in Q4 2012. The increased rate was primarily driven by an unfavorable change in income mix by a taxing jurisdiction and reduced tax holidays in Taiwan.","Our full year pro forma rate adjusted for the $68 million of reserve releases was 16.8%. We expect our full year rate for 2014 to be approximately 17% due to the geographic mix of income.","We also announced in our press release this morning that given our strong free cash flow generation, we plan to seek shareholder approval for an increased dividend beginning with the June 2014 calendar quarter. The proposal is $0.48 per quarter, or $1.92 annually, an increase from our current $0.45 per quarter.","Cliff has reviewed our 2014 guidance, but I would just further highlight that we have 4 solid growth segments that we anticipate will represent over 55% of our revenue in 2014. As highlighted in our guidance, we will continue to invest in 2014 for long-term growth opportunities across the entire business, positioning us well for the future.","And before moving to Q&A, I wanted to briefly address the CFO transition that was also announced this morning. I've enjoyed being part of the Garmin family for the past 15 years, and I'm very excited about the future success of Garmin. It's been so rewarding to be part of building such an amazing organization since we went public in the year 2000. Yet, it's time for me to change pace personally. I look forward to helping the executive team with the CFO search process and ensuring a smooth transition. I will also continue to be actively involved in the Investor Relations activities during the transition, where, hopefully, will be able to see many of you in person over the course of this year.","With that, operator, we now open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll first go to Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. Kevin, congrats to you, and you've done a great job for 15 years.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Thanks very much. Thanks for the well wishes on the quarter.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So I guess looking at 2 of the products you've highlighted as driving growth this year, VIRB and v\u00edvofit, I don't know if you can tell us how much you're estimating that contribution. And if you can't give us a number, maybe you can help us think kind of structurally about how you go about estimating a new product, and maybe what you're seeing in the near term in terms of sell-in for those products over the next couple of quarters?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, we're not prepared to give specific expectations on each of those products. I think maybe the better way to put it is, we -- for both VIRB and for the v\u00edvofit, these are exciting markets to be in, and there's some strong incumbents in both areas. We hope to gain some reasonable market share, and it is -- I'd say in both of those instances, it's a reason for some of the growth that we're planning for both Outdoor and Fitness segment that we're not planning to quantify how much that is at this point.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I look at the midpoint of your revenue guidance 2014, it looks like you should inflect to some top line growth for the first time in a while. You're sitting on an awful lot of cash on the balance sheet. Given the inflection point, is it time to get more aggressive in terms of buybacks and returning some of that or a lot more of that cash to shareholders?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think your first point, yes. We do anticipate being slightly up in revenue at the midpoint, like you say. And we've been more aggressive and we still, like I said, we still have $241 million in the outstanding buyback plan, and we plan to use our cash to continue to buy back stock based on stock price. We were always sensitive to the stock price like many of our shareholders are, but I don't know if I would say we're going to be more aggressive other than we're -- it's a part of our use of cash, and we can balance that with the other needs across the business.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Yes. Best wishes for Kevin. I wondered if we can focus on the Aviation gross margins, extremely strong in the quarter, maybe some of the underlying drivers of that. I know you're moving to maybe more of a more software as a portion of mix, but the sustainability of that, especially as Part 25 starts to layer in, detail on that would be great.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think on the mix of gross margin within that business, I think -- the nice thing is whether it's an OEM or it's a retrofit business or even our portable business, as part of our Aviation segment, we have high margins. You mentioned software, so without a doubt, software is a strong component of our overall suite of avionics that we put into play. So I think that's going to continue. We don't -- these aren't really changing anytime soon, and we've been very stable at our gross margin within the segment.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","And then, also in Aviation, how should we think about sort of the leverage in 2014? Is it somewhat muted by some of these R&D investments you guys are talking about? Help us understand sort of where you're trending there as well.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, we mentioned -- both Cliff and I mentioned the Aviation is a significant part of our story in the future, and it is a large part of our R&D investment in 2014. So we're expecting that, I think, at a minimum, the operating margin should stay flat, if not increased, depending on how that market develops over 2014.","Operator","Next, we go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more into the Outdoor segment guidance. It seems that the action camera market is a couple of billion dollar market, yet you're not expecting that much of a bump to this year's revenues. Is that just conservatism as you're still relatively new to the market? And also, if you can give us some insight into how much of the channel you've developed in terms of either big box retailers for the VIRB or also some of the specialty ski shops and things like that.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, Simona, the action camera market, according to our estimates, is probably in the range of $1 billion to $2 billion. As you know, it's heavily dominated by an entrenched competitor right now, who has established and defined the market. So we know we have an uphill battle to gain share, and we are admittedly being cautious and conservative in terms of our expectations around the market. But that said, we're -- we feel like we're in this for the long haul. This is a marathon, not a sprint. And so, we're willing to be patient, develop our product line and create innovation in the market that customers are wanting. In terms of the channel, last time we talked, I think we mentioned that the rollout of the VIRB was admittedly conservative, because it was late in the season, and wasn't able to catch a lot of the retailer resets that occur in the early -- late summer, early fall time period. So we anticipate that things will start to pick up this year, and we'll also be ramping up our promotional activities as well.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, just on the Aviation segment, you seem to be assuming some modest deceleration for this year? Is there anything in particular driving that? I would have thought that based on your pipeline of wins, the growth rate there should remain pretty constant, if not accelerate.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think we probably had higher than our expectations in 2014. So we feel like the aviation market still faces some challenges. As we mentioned, we expect stability in the OEM market. We don't expect things to go down. We do expect our new platforms to contribute, and the aftermarket is showing some signs of modest growth. But again, we don't want to be overoptimistic about aviation, because it is very insensitive to things like government shutdowns and the economy and the various things that can happen in the course of the year.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. Hopefully, you don't have any more of those. Just last one on the model, can you just remind us the contribution from deferred in the quarter and then what you are embedding in your guidance for 2014?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. So the contribution on deferred just for Q4 was actually just about $6 million is all from a sales perspective. As we go forward, we're going to continue to see more amortizations than deferrals, so this will be from here on out as a tailwind for us and help us throughout 2014. If you look at the balance sheet, you can still see that we have quite a bit of deferrals that are sitting there that will be amortized over the next several years and help our EPS as we go forward.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So kind of a $0.20 to $0.30 contribution to this year would be a reasonable range to think about?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit less than that.","Operator","Next, we'll go to John Bright with Avondale Partners.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Congrats and, as well, Kevin, good luck, sir. I'll dig into the same questions -- or a couple of the same questions. In Outdoor, can you talk about some of the underlying assumptions behind the 10% to 15% outlook beyond the VIRB product, specifically in the golf and the pet mark -- technologies, how you plan to gain market share?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, John, as I mentioned in my remarks, we do expect continued growth in the golf market. That's been a market that has continued to show expansion as we've come out with new products and innovation there. The dog tracking and training market is an area that we can see additional growth in the coming year and then, of course, the contribution from action cameras. The other product segments in Outdoor tend to be mature and are either stable or in a slight decline type of a mode, according to our assumptions. So there's some offsets going on.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And then in Aviation, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about G3000 and 5000 market share opportunities there -- upcoming opportunities? Can you expand on those?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. We have delivered, of course, at the end of the year, certifications for Sovereign and M2 and the Lear 70 and 75. So we'll see a full year contribution there. And in the upcoming year, the Citation X should be moving toward certification, so that will also contribute.","Operator","We'll go to the next caller, that is Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kevin, thanks for all the help throughout the years. I guess if I look at the Outdoor Fitness market, the investor concern has always been that there's a lot of competitors. It's a market defined by declining ASPs. If anything, you're gaining share and actually you're seeing an ASP lift. Do you think of the business from a unit growth and then an ASP point of view? Or is it really rather contribution margin and cash flow to the business? Just kind of -- I think there's so many subsegmentations of the market. We're just trying to see which direction you might move into and the underlying financial reasons why.","Kevin S. Rauckman","So I think we still expect unit growth, clearly, within both of those segments. ASPs, as you point out, are -- really, we don't see much of a price issue at all. I think we have maybe in the Fitness side, lost a little bit on the very low end of the market. But if you look at our overall ASP, because of the product mix and the new products that we're bringing out, for example, the VIRB having a little bit higher price point, that's going to let things rise, not only increased units, but also increased ASPs. So much of what we would look at on an ASP in those segments just have to do with new products rollout and the contribution from those products.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Did I answer your question?","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I think so. Is there a floor to kind of where -- how low your prices will go for some of your products? I just think back to the days when we saw a bunch of PNDs and bins at Best Buy and trying to see, I mean, if those days are way behind us in terms of how low prices will go for some of the Outdoor and Fitness products.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, I think, Mark, you're combining Outdoor and Fitness, which probably have different dynamics in each one of those markets. In the Outdoor segment, we would anticipate that it's a very mature market for the most part and with the exception, of course, new and emerging opportunities like Fitness or VIRB action cameras. But we would anticipate stable to increasing ASPs there. In Fitness, the market has trended down in ASP, driven by the introduction of lower-end products like our Forerunner 10. But even with that, we're selling the Forerunner 10 at a premium compared to the market, and we have not been in the mode in our business of just competing on price. We always compete on value, performance, innovation, utility and differentiation. So that's basically our outlook on those 2 markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And, Kevin, one last thing on Marine. I guess there's a lot of new products and you would need to -- that you might need to get out there into the marketplace. The -- on Marine, would it require additional R&D? Or is that mostly behind us? So it's really about getting products out the door at this stage?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. I think we've ramped up our team there over the last year. And as Cliff mentioned, we made some changes structurally, but we feel like we have a pretty solid Marine R&D team right now. So most of the increase that we would expect in 2014 on the R&D line would actually come from some of the other segments like Aviation, Outdoor and Fitness.","Operator","Now we'll go to Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had a question about the VIRB launch. I guess I thought you might ramp up advertising spending in support of that launch in Q4. It didn't seem to happen from what I saw in the results. And then, your comment about 2014 is that ad spending should sort of move with revenue. And so I'm assuming aggregate revenue is going to be flattish, then your ad spending might be flattish. So what's your thinking around advertising to support that product and the v\u00edvofit, and what's necessary?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I think as we've mentioned before, we launched the VIRB late in the year, and we missed opportunities to be able to catch resets that occurred earlier in the year. So we knew that distribution was not optimal, and we also had constrained production as we ramped up a totally new category for Garmin, which includes complex optics and new processes that were developed for our company. So we knew that we had just a limited amount of product and it didn't make a lot of sense to go out too strong in Q4. That said, as we've mentioned, we plan to increase our activity on promotion for VIRB in the coming year. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're going to scale our advertising based on both revenue and opportunity. So in this case, VIRB is an opportunity, and we will be investing to promote that product in the coming year. And similar things apply for the v\u00edvofit. It's a new category. We're already shipping the product, and we believe we have good retail placement for the product early in the year, so we're excited about that. But we're also going to be increasing our promotion of that as the year goes forward.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It makes sense. And then, in Auto, I guess that's the one segment where your outlook is maybe better than I was thinking. And if I think about the sort of low end there, that down 10% in Auto, I guess TomTom made some comments that maybe they think the PND market is going to continue to decline at the same magnitude but a little bit better than previously. What would it take to get you to that 10% with PNDs, new products, OEM, what are you thinking?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think, without a doubt, the Auto\/Mobile includes Mobile, Auto OEM revenue and also PND revenue. That 10% to 15% actually includes a little bit deeper decline on PND specifically. But I think to your points, we've seen a little bit better strength in the European market, so it's declined slower. And we'll just have to see how that shakes out as we go through 2014. But I think we were assuming at a 10% level PND would be down maybe closer to 15% on revenue for the year.","Operator","Let's go to Paul Coster with JPMorgan.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The impression I get is that the number of products and categories that you announced [indiscernible] is increasing. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the overall product strategy, maybe excluding Aviation, Marine, and how you think about your role in these categories. Are you sort of a pioneer or a fast follower? But also, how do you manage this overall portfolio? What is going to be the sort of strategy for introducing products, refreshing them, and then retiring them? And what I'm trying to get to here is the implications for R&D and also what the R&D might lead to in terms of future proliferation of products.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, Paul, I think in terms of how we view these various segments, including Aviation, Marine is that we're constantly looking for new areas where we can create new product categories, new niches in the market or new bolt-on adjacent market areas as we've done in every market segment. We're not in a mode of trying to trim back or figure out ways we can cut some of our product lines because we feel like there's opportunities everywhere across the business. And so, for R&D, what we will do is we'll continue to invest in developing and finding these niche and adjacent categories, as well as to keep our core product lines fresh, which is important because it keeps buyers interested in the market and we bring new innovations to those product lines.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the rate of innovation is accelerating in some areas particularly around health products. Does this mean that we should expect more releases from you every sort of -- the cycle time is basically reducing?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. I think recently, we've been performing well in terms of our product releases. As I mentioned in my remarks, we introduced an entire new line -- 47 new Marine products late last year. Those have already been delivered to the market. We introduced our v\u00edvofit and v\u00edvok\u00ed at CES. That is already shipping. So we believe that in many areas of our business, we're performing well. And many of our product releases that we'll have in 2014 have already been delivered to the market in Q1. And so that represents more than half of what we anticipate doing in the coming year.","Operator","And now we go to Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Best wishes to you, Kevin, as well. Just wanted to start out with sort of your expectations around M&A and what you guys are thinking about just given sort of your balance sheet position, whether anything has changed in terms of your overall M&A outlook.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, no real changes to the M&A. I think you, Jonathan, you know us well. We have been selective in our -- in the companies that we've acquired, and we've acquired several over the years, actually dozens over the years, and we're still looking for other opportunities, but we're also not going to be overly aggressive. But the fact of the matter is we have good flexibility there. We are always evaluating businesses. I would still say that the sweet spot for us still remains the smaller to medium-sized businesses that are easier to integrate as opposed to going out and doing a life-changing type of an acquisition. So it is a part of our strategy, and it's one of the 4 uses of our cash that we intend to capitalize on.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And you guys referenced a couple of times sort of challenges around ramping production around VIRB, it being sort of a new product category. How do you guys feel about your production capacity today? I mean, do you feel like you have sort of the right processes in place? Do you have the ability to sort of meet the demand in the marketplace and sort of scale to the level that's needed for some of these mass-market broad line retailers?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Jonathan. We don't have any concern at all about our capacity. In fact, we've got quite a bit of excess capacity that we could ramp up pretty quickly if we need to. I think our comments around spinning out products especially relates when we have a new technology like VIRB, which introduces things like optics into our production line that we haven't been doing on a significant scale in the past. So it takes some time to do that, but those issues are basically behind us, and we don't have any concern over the capacity and our ability to support retailers.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Kevin, congratulations. So in terms of 2014, 2 questions on the outlook. One, given kind of some new products in the categories here, should we be anticipating anything different from a seasonality standpoint than we typically see either in the business in aggregate or in certain product categories? And then, secondly, if I look at kind of the overall operating margins guided to be down a couple of hundred bps year-over-year, but gross margins up quite nicely, you indicated Aviation to be kind of flat to up operating margins. Where is that margin decline going to be most pronounced, which segment? And I guess that's it.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. So first of all, Tavis, seasonality. We don't see much change in the seasonality within our business. I mean, business as usual as we go forward with the new products and the continuing products. From an operating margin standpoint, it is really an investment in -- primarily in R&D, so as I mentioned, Aviation. So we hope that the sales growth rate meets or exceeds the R&D growth rate there from an operating margin standpoint. But the other segments, Outdoor, Fitness and even Auto\/Mobile, I think, we're still evaluating what that looks like in the future. But the other areas of R&D growth, as I mentioned, were Outdoor and Fitness, but that's going to be a little bit of a decline on those segments. And the other thing is product mix. So VIRB, for example, is a lower-margin product than our average Outdoor gross margin. So there's just going to be some natural product mix that influences the operating margins within segments like Outdoor and Fitness.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And if I can ask a follow-up on the Auto OEM business. What should our expectations, or what are your expectations of kind of full-blown infotainment business at this point? And how long are you willing to support that effort without meaningful progress there versus just making this more of an application-type business like you have with Mercedes?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, Tavis, I think as we mentioned in the past, we realize that progress in the Auto OEM business is -- takes place at a very slow rate. We do have some foothold in the infotainment business in some smaller OEMs and aftermarket, but developing bigger opportunities does take time. So we're still working on developing more of those opportunities, and we continue to be patient. We also are managing that investment as best as we can to make sure that it's scaled towards the opportunities that we see.","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","Kevin, congrats. Good luck on what lies ahead.","I wanted to -- first, you mentioned margin implications for VIRB. Could you talk to the margin implications for the v\u00edvo products as those come to market? And could you also talk a little bit about when you look at VIRB and the v\u00edvo products, how do you view your offerings and kind of the differentiation versus competitors? And then, I have a follow-up.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think, Ben, in terms of margin on the v\u00edvo, we would -- I believe that margin structure is very similar to our entry-level Fitness watches today. So we don't think that there's any significant change in terms of the margin profile of the product. As that product of course delivers and increases in mix, then it could bring down our Fitness margins slightly as it increases its contribution. And your second question on VIRB, please?","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","When you look at VIRB and v\u00edvo, those 2 kind of new market entrants for you, how do you view those offerings as being differentiated versus competitors? What are your kind of strongest attributes versus incumbents in those markets?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we believe both of those products are highly differentiated versus competitors. If you start with the v\u00edvo and look at what we brought to the market there, we have an industry-leading battery life of 1 year, and we have a very friendly readable LCD display. And this product is expandable, so you can add your heart rate later if you increase your level of fitness. It has intuitive innovative features such as motivational features that allow people to increase their level of fitness over time as they start to see progress. And finally, the web side of it can be underestimated in terms of the impact there. We have a very well-developed web presence with Garmin Connect, and with the new launch of the updated website, it's tailored now to all kinds of users from basic entry in the fitness area with v\u00edvo to the high-end users on the running watches. So in terms of VIRB, our main differentiation there has been bringing sensor integration and integration with other Garmin products through the market. We have GPS capabilities with accelerometers, and all that information can be overlaid onto your video, including information from heart rate monitors and our other fitness products. And so, we offer a level of integration into the market that it previously didn't have.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And one other question, when you look at our working capital, do you have any thoughts, longer term, about where that goes? Are you comfortable with the level of working capital as it stands today. Would you like to reduce that level and improve cash flow? What are your thoughts on working capital?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think we're fairly comfortable with our working capital management. There's always some puts and takes there on what we can do better on -- accounts receivable and inventory, in particular. But the numbers that we shared from a free cash flow of 550 to 600 seems just modest changes year-over-year in the working capital.","Operator","We'll next go to Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest securities.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups. First, in terms of the Q4 Fitness growth, can you kind of rank order the drivers of growth in that segment between the new watches, Vector and then Edge, and then kind of how we should be thinking about those within the Fitness outlook for 2014, along with the v\u00edvo products?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Brad, I think that all the things you mentioned were strong contributors to our Q4 performance. There was a lot of pent-up demand for the new running watches, and Vector and byproducts certainly also contributed to the mix as well. In terms of 2014, we see those dynamics continuing. The Forerunner 620 and 220 redefines the high-end running watch market, and with the running dynamics features. And we see that product being very popular in the coming year. We'll have a full year of Vector as well, and then of course v\u00edvofit is all new revenue for us.","Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, in terms of the VIRB product so far, you obviously made some comments around intentions to ramp up advertising, et cetera. Given you're, obviously, a very strong competitor in that category, from kind of more of a point-of-sale perspective, can you talk about what needs to happen in order to improve demand, which it seems like you've been implying has been a bit soft so far?","Clifton A. Pemble","The point-of-sale, as you point out, is really critical, and so we're working hard to get point-of-sale presence, an improved presence where we have it today. And many retailers of course are looking for our -- evidence of our promotions as well. And so as we ramp those up in -- starting here, in March, they'll start to see more demand driven from the customer side as well.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Jeremy David with Citi.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question is about Garmin Connect. It looks like the growth of miles logged is moderating. It took about 170 days to get from 3 billion miles to 4 billion miles last year, implying about 6 million miles logged every day. And as of yesterday, 4.57 billion miles were logged, implying just about 4 million miles logged on average every day since Garmin Connect with 4 billion miles logged in that September 2014, so a deceleration from about 6 million miles logged last summer to about 4 million miles a day now. Is that seasonality? I don't think we've seen it before. Or is it a sign that the user engagement on the Garmin Connect platform is declining? And maybe you could tie that up with the changes you're making to that platform.","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, Jeremy, I think that seasonality definitely is something to consider. It is winter, and a very cold one in many parts of the country, and I have not been able to get out and run as much as I like. So I would anticipate, as summer and spring come to us, that you'll see an acceleration there.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Can you comment on the changes you're making to the platform to make it more social?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. That's been an ongoing process where, last year, we introduced groups and ways for people to be able to share their activities with members of their groups. This year, we're focusing on things like leader boards and challenges which will help enhance the ability for people to engage with the site.","Jeremy David - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. As a follow-up, you still -- you've only used $59 million of your $300 million buyback authorization. I believe it's expiring at the end of this year. So should we expect to see you complete the buyback by the end of 2014? Would you consider extending it? Or would you consider letting it expire unused?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think, implied in our guidance, we assume that we are going to continue to be in the market consistently after we get out of the blackout period here in a couple of days. So of course, it depends on price and how aggressive we will be. But at this point, we plan to be more aggressive as we go through 2014. I can't say if we're going to use it all up yet, but it's not our intention to let it expire.","Clifton A. Pemble","All right. I think that concludes our call for today, so thanks, everyone, for participating. And we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you, Teri and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today Garmin recorded record revenue for the first quarter of 2018 with double digit growth in revenue, profit and EPS. Consolidated revenue came in at $711 million, up 11% over the prior year. Outdoor, fitness, aviation, and marine collectively increased 18% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 60% due to segment and product mix.","Operating margin improved to 20% while operating income increased 22%. This resulted in GAAP and pro forma EPS of $0.68 with pro forma EPS growth of 31% over the prior year.","We're pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits, and earnings since Q1, represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year, and much of the year remains ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February.","Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll provide a few remarks on our performance in each business segment.","Starting with outdoor, revenue increased 24% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. Segment generated strong growth in operating margins of 65% and 30% respectively, while operating income grew 27% over the prior year. During the quarter, we began shipping the Descent dive watch, Descent brings innovation to the dive computer market by combining smartwatch utility with dive computer functions for the underwater adventure. Descent has been well received and we are excited for the opportunities we have in this new product category.","Also, we recently announced the tactix Charlie, a tactical themed smartwatch, with unique features such as night vision compatibility and Jumpmaster mode for skydivers.","Looking next to fitness, revenue increased 20% percent driven primarily by growth in the advanced wearable category. Gross margin improved to 58% due to product mix. Operating income improved to 20% resulting in operating income growth of 81%. During the quarter, we began shipping the Forerunner 645M, our first GPS running watch with integrated music and mobile payments.","We recently announced several new cycling products including the Edge 130 and the Edge 520 Plus. The Edge 130 is an entry level cycling computer packed with features and the Edge 520 Plus offers advanced mapping and navigation capabilities. We also announced the Varia RTL510, the latest in our series of products that focus on cycling safety.","We hosted our second annual Connect IQ Developer Summit bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshop with our product managers and our engineers. The momentum behind Connect IQ is accelerating with more than 54 million Connect IQ downloads to more than 8 million compatible devices shipped since inception.","And finally just yesterday, we announced the collaboration with the University of Kansas Medical Center on multiple research projects exploring the use of wearable technology for the early detection of under reported health conditions such as sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation.","Turning next to aviation, revenue increase 19%, driven by broad based strength across the market. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 33% respectively resulting in operating income growth of 25% over the prior year. During the quarter we started delivering on new TXi flight decks including a version for the helicopter market.","We also announced the first flight of the Citation XLS with the G5000 integrated avionics suite. This represents a significant step forward on our path to certification.","Looking next at the marine segment revenue increased 9% driven by our recent acquisition of Navionics excluding Navionics our revenue was essentially flat year-over-year due to unfavorable weather conditions that have delayed the start of the boating season and due to the challenging comparison to first quarter of 2017 when our marine segment grew 26%.","Gross margin improved to 59% while operating margin declined to 12%. During the quarter we announced the GCV 20 an ultra-high definition sonar offering, higher resolution imaging at greater depths. Also we were selected as the exclusive Marine Electronics supplier to the Independent Boat Builders cooperative known as IBBI. IBBI is the boating industry's largest purchasing cooperatives and is comprised of a 19 member network of leading brands. Beginning in 2019, members of the IBBI will get direct access to our full line of Marine Electronics.","Looking finally at the auto segment revenues were down 12% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market partially offset by growth in niche product lines. Gross margin was 43% while operating margin was 2%. During the quarter we announced the next generation diesel T&D for trucks which uses dash camera technology to provide enhanced driver alerts.","That concludes my remarks, next Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results, then move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $711 million for the first quarter, representing 11% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60%, 190 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment and product mix.","Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 40%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $142 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20%, 100 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP pro forma EPS was $0.68.","Next, looking at our first quarter revenue by segment. In the first quarter we achieved a record first quarter revenue of $711 million. Consolidated revenue grew 11% led by double-digit growth in three of our five segments, both the outdoor and fitness segment grew over 20% for the quarter. On a combined basis outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine were up 18% compared to the prior year quarter.","Looking next, first quarter revenue and operating income charts. Collectively, the outdoor, fitness, aviation, marine segments contributed 80% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 75% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 23% and outdoor grew from 18% to 20%.","You can see from the charts illustrating our profit mix by segment, outdoor, fitness, aviation, and marine segments collectively contributed 98% of operating income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 94% in the first quarter of 2017. Outdoor, fitness, aviation segments each had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.","Looking next to the operating expenses, our first quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million or 11%. Research and development increased $20 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Advertising expense decreased $7 million year-over-year representing 3.5% of sales, 150 basis point decrease. The decrease was primarily due to lower media spend and lower co-op expense.","SG&A was up $50 million compared to the prior quarter increased 60 basis points percent of sales (10:11) to 16.5%. Increase was primarily due to personnel related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions partially offset by lower litigation related expenses.","Few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially or (10:35) $10 million following on the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our inventory balance increased on a sequential year-over-year basis to prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter.","In the first quarter of 2018, we generated free cash flow of $188 million, $93 million increase from the prior quarter, we benefited from working capital improvements.","Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million. In the first quarter of 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 16% compared to a pro forma effective tax rate of 21.2% in the prior year quarter. Decrease in effective tax is primarily due to benefits from the U.S. tax reform and the impact of the (11:15) release of reserves.","This concludes our formal remarks. James, could you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Our first question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow. Your line is open.","Nikolay Todorov - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. This is Nick Todorov on behalf of Joe. Congrats on a great quarter, guys. Really good job!","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Nikolay Todorov - Longbow Research LLC","Since you don't guide the quarter, I think it will be helpful if you can walk through which areas of the business were ahead of your expectations, I guess what was the biggest surprise?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well we don't really provide information on our expectations by segment other than the basic guidance that we've earlier laid out. So I think quarter by quarter, we have a lot of seasonality in our business and also cadence of our product releases and so that can create certainly ups and downs in terms of the overall yearly averages.","Nikolay Todorov - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Understood and in outdoor, the data we track on f\u0113nix showed surprising strength throughout the first quarter even though you had to fill the \u2013 anniversary (12:43) the f\u0113nix 5 launch. I'm just curious is that strength surprising you? Can give us some color on its performance?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well I think we didn't start delivering the f\u0113nix 5 until late in the first quarter of 2017 and so consequently much of Q1 of 2018 was not comping against that initial fill-in and Q2 was our biggest fill-in quarter in f\u0113nix 5.","Nikolay Todorov - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Got it. And on fitness, are you seeing any changes in the trajectory for basic trackers and is it safe to assume that basic trackers are now less than a quarter of your fitness segment?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","I think the general trend for basic trackers, continues as we have been remarking and as the market has been demonstrating, there is pockets of strengths geographically and also by product lines that we have, but generally we see a downward trend to that in terms of breaking that out as a percentage of sales of fitness, we don't do that.","Nikolay Todorov - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys, and good luck.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, great. Thanks a lot. First question on the aviation business, I'm wondering if you can give a little bit more detail, you talked about kind of broad based strength, but it looked like in that quarter there were a number of certifications or deliveries. So if you can give maybe a little bit more detail on kind of aftermarket versus OEM and in particular the strength of the pipeline for certifications?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. So, I think we saw broad strength in retrofit and OEM product lines. I think there's a lot of data on the overall situation with OEMs and I think they're seeing some incremental improvements in their business although it's a low-single-digit. For us, I think it's a matter of product mix \u2013 the products that we're delivering as opposed to the general market, the small and medium size airplanes as well as single-engine airplanes are doing well.","And also on the retrofit side, we're seeing general strength due to the ADS-B mandate which is also pulling in additional equipment purchases as people upgrade their panels.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then my other question was actually back on outdoor, you had mentioned \u2013 lapping of the launch of the f\u0113nix 5 and the selling in the second quarter of 2017. So, two questions. How do you think the business trends for the rest of the year given that the comps get more difficult? And secondly, any visibility into what the refresh on that product looks like, is it a one year cadence or two year cadence or anything touching on new solutions in the f\u0113nix lineup?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Definitely, we have a much more difficult comparison through the remainder of the year because of the f\u0113nix 5 launch. So we're expecting that and that's reflected in our outlook. In terms of product refresh I can't comment on the specific timing, but we do have a very active roadmap across our segments including in outdoor and so we expect more product releases throughout the remainder of the year.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Great thanks a lot, guys.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham. Your line is now open.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. I just wanted to clarify that the guidance for all of the segments remains unchanged is that correct?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. We're basically reiterating what we outlined before.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. And I guess you spoke to the fitness category, the plus 20% comp in the first quarter, but you're basically guiding for that to be I guess down in aggregate for the remainder of the year and that's because of the tougher comps with the f\u0113nix. Is that fair?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, fitness is really driven by other tougher comps we had significant selling of new products in Q4 of 2017 and so that's a factor and then we also have the issue of the ongoing decline of the basic activity trackers which we're factoring into our overall outlook.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then the margins in auto were a little lighter than we've seen recently. Was there anything unusual in the mix in auto this quarter? I'm just wondering how we should think of those margins as we go through the year maybe any bounce off the 1Q levels?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","No, I would say it was mostly just some general variance that we would see, especially with lighter sales as we did some promotions and things that could have impacted the overall margin level but we would generally expect mid-40s kind of gross margins. We would expect the operating margins to come up, because Q1 is the seasonally lowest quarter and we should be in a much better position Qs \u2013 Q2 through Q4 with more sales leverage.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it, that makes sense. And then finally on the tax rate, I think you guided 19% for the year but you came in at 16%, are we still thinking that 19% is the right tax rate for the full year?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Oh, yes. We still stay with our full year 19%. Part of the 16% there were some reserve releases there, so \u2013 maybe some lumpiness in the quarters depending on how those reserve releases that come out. But 19% is still our full year rate that we're anticipating.","Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks. Thanks for the clarification. Nice job on the quarter, gentlemen.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Yuuji Anderson with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. A quick one on outdoors. How did the other products besides f\u0113nix do in Q1? Is there anything to call out there in terms of \u2013 a specific product that might have surprised the upside there?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think in terms of surprise, no, I think we are doing very well with our inReach business both hardware and subscription base so that provide us some additional boost to the segment as well. But beyond that everything was pretty much in line with what we would have expected.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then on aviation when we think about seasonality and sequential growth for the rest of the year, should it be kind of similar to what we saw last year or is there something you would call out last year or this year that would make them kind of unique?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, aviation doesn't really have the seasonality that many of our other markets do, but we would generally expect that our business would follow the trends in the industry and also be driven by these upside opportunities with ADS-B.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And if I could just do one more follow-up on aviation just and I think this was alluded to one of the previous questions, how much of visibility do you have on the OEM side of things just with some of the positive data points we see out there. Is there a probability that things might actually accelerate to the end of the year or do you think not materialize that quickly there? Thanks so much taking my questions (19:49).","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, I think there is a \u2013 excuse me, there's definitely a long supply chain in aviation. And so the rapid moves in terms of growth are probably a little bit more challenging. I think the remarks that some of our partners have already made on the state of the industry really reflect how we would view it as well.","Yuuji Anderson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks so much.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Erickson with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. So, first, just curious on marine, understand the weather seems to play a role there, but doesn't necessarily fit with some of the other public companies that have reported in the space. Results seem to have been better, frankly. So wondering if fuel pricing is weighing on things, are there other factors that may be going on that are weighing on marine that we should be considering?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, some of the boat builders have reported that their business was slightly down in the quarter and I think weather is definitely a real thing, when people are thinking about bringing out their boats and there's feet of snow outside that's a little bit challenging. So we believe that the start of the season was impacted.","And the other thing that I mentioned in my remarks is that last year, we are comping against the significant growth of 26% which the season kind of started earlier last year. So there's a little bit of variance in terms of how the seasonality has gone, but we would expect that Q2 should be stronger.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then Doug, can you just remind us what the original guidance contemplated in terms of the euro FX rate. And then, may have missed that in the press release, but if you could provide just any \u2013 what the FX tailwind was in Q1, that'd be great?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. The Q1 \u2013 the tailwind was about $30 million and basically for our guidance we're assuming roughly the current euro rates.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then one last one if I could I guess just historically and not updating your guidance after Q1 I think you've always said in the press release and I may have missed this in the prepared remarks that it's because of seasonally lowest part of the year you're simply not updating whereas this time you're reiterating should we discern any difference between those two messages?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","No. No.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. That's all. Thanks.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Could we start with \u2013 within fitness when you look at Forerunner 645 how much sell-in benefit do you think you saw in 1Q. Is it readily available at this point or is there any more sell-in benefit into 2Q and then a couple of brief follow ups?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","I think 645 is a great new product launch and we did see some benefit from the sell-in phenomenon. We're basically now waiting to see how things go with the sell-through. So I would say at this point we're probably pretty much caught up in terms of overall sell-in.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. On the advertising numbers, Doug, you mentioned down year-over-year on I think some lower co-op figures and lower media spend. Is there anything different in how you think about advertising at this point through the course of the year? Does it get back to normal? Is this the new normal? What's the right way to think about that line item?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, Ben. I'll maybe comment on that, I would say that as our product mix and as the market has evolved we're fine tuning our approach. So we were able to take some benefit in Q1, we would expect that we would probably have similar to 2017 in Qs \u2013 Q2, Q3, Q4 in terms of our overall advertising.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And my last items, looking at the aviation business what's your characterization of the aviation retrofit capacity today, how much \u2013 do you any thoughts on backlog or how utilized these guys are? What percent of the fleet, do you think, has migrated ADS-B and how are the capacity expansion plans progressing with the aviation build up and I'll cede the floor? Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, I would say that the shop capacity is constrained. Right now we're seeing increasing lead times that shops are reporting when customers are coming in, looking for options to upgrade their airplanes. I think the availability of the technicians is definitely a factor and then just overall the number of shops and their general floor space capacity is a challenge. That said, people are still getting in, people are making appointments and they're starting to realize that it's definitely time to upgrade.","In terms of percentage of fleet, I would \u2013 it's a little bit hard to specifically quantify it. We believe we're roughly 50% through the fleet. People that will upgrade and there will be some tail laggers (24:55) that probably spillover past 2020 or into 2020 as they perhaps sunken into (25:02) the shop or maybe they don't think they need to upgrade until they try flying in the new environment.","Operator","Thank you.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charlie Anderson with Dougherty & Company. Your line is now open.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions and my congrats on a strong start to the year as well.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Charlie.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","So APAC was really strong year-over-year maybe the strongest we've seen in a few years. I wonder if there were any specific cause there in terms of any geographic expansion, door counts or were there any specific products that did well in APAC? And then, I've got a follow up.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Okay. Yeah. So, APAC definitely is growing from a smaller base. So the growth numbers are higher. They're doing very well in the wearable areas. Several countries are very strong in terms of wearables. And in that market the \u2013 even many categories in the fitness area including basic trackers are doing well.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then, Navionics, I wonder if there was any more specificity to give there on the Q1 impact both on revenue and OpEx? And then, Doug, are we still on track for the CapEx number you outlined earlier?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah.","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","So, regarding Navionics, as Cliff mentioned, majority of the marine growth was due to Navionics. And I also we're on track with that and it was accretive in the first quarter. In relating to CapEx, no adjustments to free cash flow or CapEx forecast at this time.","Charlie Lowell Anderson - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Kristine Liwag for Ron. If recovery continues to gain momentum for light and medium-sized jets and we see more orders for Textron jets, what's your ability to ramp up production? And then, also how should we think about incremental operating margins excluding mix in that business?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, we think we are very flexible in ramping up our capacity. We're currently investing approximately $200 million to more than double our production capacity for aviation. So, we're ready to serve when OEMs need to increase their forecasts.","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And the incremental operating margins?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Incrementally, I would say that as we grow with market growth, I would say we would get leverage as we bring on new aircraft platforms. We would need resources to be able to certify and develop the equipment for those aircrafts. So we may have to continue to invest some portion of that back into the business.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. And then how do you think about capital deployment today and what are your priorities for uses of cash?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, just the cash, our priorities first of all related to reliable (27:57) dividend. We're closer to increasing our dividend this year. Second of which is investments back in the business similar to the expansion we have here at Olathe (28:06) facilities and then strategic acquisitions such as the Navionics and DeLorme acquisitions in the past.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul J. Chung - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. This is Paul Chung on for Coster. Thanks for taking my questions. So just on overall units coming down year-on-year but your kind of blended ASPs up to around $240. Is this more of a function of aviation contribution or broad price increases across your portfolio? Looks like outdoor and fitness gross margins were up and you did mention shift towards advanced wearables. Can you just comment on the dynamics there and what do you expect ASPs to trend for the rest of the year and which particular segment you're seeing the most pricing power?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Well, to say the best way to understand that is simply segment and product mix across a very diverse and large set of product segments. So, on one hand on the very low end, the basic activity trackers are down and on the other hand, we have growth in many of our other segments. So there's probably not a lot that you can read into the number other than segment and product mix.","Paul J. Chung - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Power with Baird. Your line is now open.","William V. Power, CFA - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","Oh, great thanks, yeah. Maybe just starting on fitness. I know you've mentioned the new Edge product, just want to clear. Those will hit sell-in (29:47) in Q2 is that correct. And then just on \u2013 thinking about fitness gross margins, is this \u2013 given the continued shift towards advanced wearables is this kind of high 50 range is that a sustainable range kind of moving forward?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So Edge products were Q2 \u2013 those were announced and delivered basically simultaneously. In terms of fitness gross margin definitely we would see a trend upward as the lower margin activity trackers decline. But at the same time, we do want to caution that that the overall segment is competitive so we want to be able to promote our products and be able to maintain market share as well.","William V. Power, CFA - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","Okay and then then Doug on free cash flow, strong results in the quarter. Any updated thoughts as to how to think about free cash flow for the full year?","Douglas G. Boessen - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah, Q1 came in strong on free cash flow primarily due to some working cap improvements especially in the accounts receivable standpoint. And right now we're keeping our same guidance for the full year to $560 million (30:56) right now.","William V. Power, CFA - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial. Your line is now open.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Thank you. Congratulations on another great quarter and thank you for taking my call.","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Thanks, Ivan.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Can you go into a little a little more detail on the Connect IQ \u2013 the recent conference, and like year-over-year how much was the attendance up also year-over-year how many more apps around there and what is your vision to create an e-commerce, say, I know that, all the apps are free, but some of the app developers for an example, they will allow you to pay them if you like the app, do you see a more formalized process and what is the process to bring in some more commercial developers of apps to the platform?","Clifton A. Pemble - Garmin Ltd.","Yeah. So, in terms of the conference, we did see a significant growth in the number of attendees this year. We had 127 attendees that came for the attendees that we had last year, more than half of them returned to come to the conference again. And so we received a lot of positive remarks about the usefulness of the summit to them and the ability to answer their technical questions and to provide feedback to us on our product roadmap. So, we felt really good about it and something that we believe is helping us gain more momentum.","In terms of the features we rolled out, we rolled out features around messaging, around music, and also mapping, but we also work with our developers to give them a way to monetize their app. So that's something that they will be able to control on their end and there's not as much infrastructure required on our end, but we do have the hooks in place now for them to be able to do that.","Ivan Feinseth - Tigress Financial Partners LLC","Very good.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kerri Thurston. Please go ahead.","Kerri Thurston","Good morning, everyone. We'd like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd. Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Please note that the earnings press release and the related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the Internet. An archive of the webcast and the related transcript will also be available on our website until August 30.","This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and its businesses. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, market share, product introductions, future demand for our products and objectives are forward-looking statements.","The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2012 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Presenting on behalf of Garmin this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Rauckman, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Cliff.","Clifton A. Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin recorded strong second quarter revenue and margin performance, with revenue growth in each of our traditional segments of Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation. While consolidated revenues decreased 3% year-over-year, our traditional market segments contributed 50% in the total revenue mix in the quarter and grew 8% on a combined basis.","Gross margins improved sequentially to 55% from 52% in the prior quarter, as segment mix and product mix improved in the seasonally stronger second quarter. Gross margins declined from 59% in the prior year when margins were aided by a one-time royalty benefit of $21 million. Operating margins were 24%, a sequential improvement from 15% in the first quarter, but it declined from 28% in the prior year due to the royalty benefit. Traditional markets contributed 64% of the operating income in the quarter. These strong results allowed us to generate $186 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Kevin will further discuss our financial results in a few minutes.","Next, I'll walk you through a review of our results segment-by-segment. Starting first with the Outdoor segment, revenues grew 6% in the quarter, generating 3% operating income growth. Our newer product categories continue to perform well, with golf products and dog tracking and training solutions contributing to the growth. As we forecasted in the first quarter, margins improved as we entered a more seasonally robust period.","As we look at the back half of 2013, we continue to see significant opportunities for growth with the introduction of new products and new product categories. The recently introduced Monterra is one example. Targeting a new generation of outdoor enthusiasts and professionals, the Monterra is built on the Android open OS architecture and offers expanded utility through the availability of third-party applications from the Google Play store. In addition, there will be ongoing expansion into new adjacent markets.","Turning next to the Fitness segment, revenue grew 3% on a year-over-year basis, as our new cycling products and the Forerunner 10 performed well in the marketplace. Our level of R&D investment in Fitness continues to grow as we prepare for a number of product launches in the back half of 2013 and also explore new product categories. The most anticipated new product deliveries in the third quarter is the Vector power meter, which is expected to accelerate revenue growth in the back half of the year. Vector has entered mass production, and we expect to deliver the product to retailers soon. We are thrilled to finally cross the finish line with this new product and anticipate our customers will appreciate the unique features and value proposition that Vector brings to the cycling market.","Finally, as we have previously stated, we anticipate entering new adjacent markets in the future and continue to make investments that position us for long-term opportunities.","In Aviation, we posted robust revenue growth of 16% with both OEM and aftermarket contributing to strong gains in the quarter. Operating income was flat due to the acceleration of R&D spending, which increased by $8 million over the second quarter of 2012. We are making good progress in the completion of deliverables through the G5000 system, which enables our OEM partners to complete aircraft-level certification work. Overall, we expect our Aviation segment to perform well for the remainder of the year as the broader market improves and as we benefit from new platforms with our OEM customers.","Revenue in the Marine segment grew 7% in the quarter as we deliver new products to the market, including our GPSMAP 8000 series of glass helms and our new combination products as well. Operating margin came in at 20%, rebounding sharply on a sequential basis as new products and higher volumes contributed to improved performance. While this is still not where we would like to be in the long term, we believe it is a step in the right direction.","Market results indicate our new products are doing well, and strong shipments have continued into the third quarter due to pent-up demand for these products and aided by the delay that started the Marine season caused by unseasonably cool temperatures. As with each of our segments, R&D expense continues to increase, driven mainly by the increase in staff over the course of the past year. In the Marine segment, we believe our staffing levels are now appropriate and consequently, the rate of growth should stabilize going forward.","Finally, in our Auto\/Mobile segment, revenues were down 12% in the quarter, with PND market volumes declining at a global rate of approximately 20%, as we anticipated. This decline was partially offset by ongoing market share gains, growth in our OEM business and the amortization of previously deferred revenues. During the quarter, we launched our 7-inch n\u00fcvis, which have unique differentiators over competitive and substitute solutions, such as the larger screen and lifetime digital traffic. We also announced the expansion of our relationships with Volkswagen and MINI, offering factory or dealer installed solutions at compelling price points for the compact car market.","Overall, our expectations for the PND category remain unchanged, with industry volumes down approximately 20% on a global basis. As we focus on profitability in the category, we will continue to identify niche opportunities, such as fleet management, over-the-road trucking and our recently introduced head-up display for mobile applications.","Finally, as stated in the press release, we are maintaining our revenue and pro forma EPS guidance for 2013. While our performance is strong in the second quarter and our traditional markets are on a solid trajectory of growth, we continue to expect the declines in the PND market will be a significant headwind for our top and bottom line. In particular, we expect PND revenues to further decelerate as we compare against the period of strong selling during the third quarter of 2012, driven by the timing of new products and end-of-life promotional activity. We anticipate operating income and operating margin will tend -- trend towards the high-end of our prior range, which will be offset by an anticipated increase in our tax rate.","That concludes my remarks. Kevin will now walk us through our Q2 financials in more detail. Kevin?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our income statement and segment results, then move to summary comments on the balance sheet, cash flow, taxes and guidance.","We posted revenue of $697 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $150 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.76 per share, excluding the large FX gain. Our revenue represents a decrease of 3% year-over-year.","Gross margin came in at 55%, a 370 basis point decline from prior year, driven primarily by the $21 million one-time royalty benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2012.","Operating margin was 24%, down 400 basis points from the prior year. The components were gross margin unfavorable by 370 basis points and an unfavorable operating expense impact of 30 basis points.","Total operating expenses decreased by $4 million in the current quarter with strong reductions in advertising and SG&A, partially offset by a $16 million increase in research and development. Each of the operating expense categories will be discussed in detail on a later slide.","Our pro forma EPS, which is adjusted for the foreign currency gain, was $0.76, representing a 22% decrease year-over-year, and we shipped 3.6 million units during the quarter, which represents a 7% decrease year-over-year. Total company average selling price was $192 per unit, up from $184 in Q2 2012, driven primarily by segment mix and the amortization of previously deferred revenue.","Cliff has summarized revenue changes by segment, and I would just like to briefly highlight the charts on this page, which illustrates the Auto\/Mobile segment representing 50% of our total revenue during Q2 of 2013, as each of our traditional segments grew during the quarter.","Looking at profitability by segment, our traditional segments delivered 64% of operating income in the quarter, an increase from 57% in Q2 of 2012. Outdoor and Aviation each contributed an increasing proportion of the operating profit in the current year due to revenue growth.","I'd like to briefly discuss year-over-year gross margin changes by segment. Total corporate gross margin declined by 370 basis points in the quarter, with all segments declining. The biggest driver was an Auto\/Mobile gross margin decline of 620 basis points, which is primarily attributable -- attributed to the $21 million royalty benefit booked in Q2 of 2012. Marine and Fitness gross margins declined 740 and 390 basis points, respectively, due to product mix in the quarter. Marine continued to discount older products, which pressured margins, but they did improve sequentially as our new products shift. And total corporate operating margin declined 400 basis points, due to the $21 million royalty benefit booked in Q2 2012 and the increased R&D spending within every segment.","Looking briefly at year-to-date metrics, revenue contribution for 2013 is shifting to our growth segments with Aviation, Outdoor and Fitness each growing in contribution. A similar shift is occurring in operating income as well, with 68% of our year-to-date operating income coming from our traditional segments.","As previously mentioned, Q2 operating expenses decreased by $4 million on a year-over-year basis from $218 million in Q2 of 2012 to $214 million in Q2 of 2013, while increasing 30 basis points as a percentage of sales. R&D was the only expense category that increased, with a $16 million year-over-year impact. This represented a 260 basis point impact as R&D increased to 14% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce with a heavy emphasis on Aviation, currently.","Our advertising spending decreased $9 million over the year ago quarter and decreased 110 basis points as a percent of sales at 4% in Q2 2013. Much of the decrease was related to declining volumes in PND, and we will continue to scale our advertising expense to match our revenue trends.","SG&A decreased $11 million compared to a year ago quarter, declining 120 basis points as a percentage of sales to 13%. This decrease is primarily attributable to a legal settlement and related fees that were recorded in Q2 of 2012.","Moving next to balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of just over $2.7 billion, which is consistent with Q1 this year. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $484 million, due to the seasonality of the quarter. Accounts receivable accounted for 66 days of sales, compared to 64 days of sales in the first quarter of 2013 and 62 days of sales in the second quarter of 2012. Our inventory balance decreased slightly to $383 million on a sequential basis at the close of the second quarter. Our days of inventory were 116 days, compared to 119 in the first quarter of 2013 and 98 days in the second quarter of 2012.","And we continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business, as cash from operations was $204 million during Q2. CapEx was $18 million during the second quarter. Therefore, we generated free cash flow of $186 million during Q2.","Financing activities were $102 million use of cash during the second quarter due to the June dividend payment and the repurchase of $13 million of company stock.","There a few more items to discuss relative to our Q2 announcement. Our effective tax rate for Q2 2013 was 16.5%, compared to 10.4% in Q2 of 2012. The increased rate was primarily driven by unfavorable change in income mix by taxing jurisdictions. Similarly, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 15%, an increase from 13.1% in 2012 due to the geographic mix.","And finally, as Cliff previously discussed, we're maintaining our full year guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion of revenue and $2.30 to $2.40 of pro forma EPS. As the forecasted growth within each segment remains very close to our original guidance, we are not updating revenue growth by segment at this point. As a reminder, we forecasted 5% to 10% growth in Outdoor, Fitness and Marine segments; 10% to 15% growth in Aviation segment, offset by a 15% to 20% decline in our Auto\/Mobile segment.","Our current revenue forecast doesn't anticipate that Auto\/Mobile will be less than 50% of our total revenue during 2013.","This concludes our formal remarks. Operator, please open the line now for a period of Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Charlie Anderson, Dougherty & Company.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","First question on new products. I wonder, as you guys do your forecasting, how do you feel you sort of assumed the ramp of new products in the guidance? And obviously, it could be a pretty big wildcard here. So any color on that? And then also, I wonder if that was why we saw the days of inventory spike up versus last year.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. I think, Charlie, the new products' forecast has already been built into our guidance. I think, as you know, our Outdoor and Fitness has been trending a little bit below where we expected on the segment level guidance, but we believe that will come back as we introduce these products in the back half of the year.","Kevin S. Rauckman","And in terms of the days of inventory, I think it's the natural seasonality that we see from Q2 to Q3 if you look at -- we talked a little bit about what our expectations are in the upcoming quarter, due to the PND year-over-year differences. But with inventory being down and with just looking at the next few quarters, there was a nominal change in inventory days of supply.","Charles L. Anderson - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then R&D seemed a little bit elevated, and it looked like from the segment detail, maybe specifically in Marine and in Aviation, I know sometimes that's sort of a leading indicator of design, and I wonder if that was the case there in terms of new platforms maybe you haven't been able to announce yet or if it was more activity around the platforms you've already won.","Clifton A. Pemble","I think in terms of Marine, as I mentioned, we're experiencing year-over-year staffing increases based on headcount that we added during the past year, but we do believe that we are at a level now in Marine that will stabilize going forward. In Aviation, we've had ongoing program costs related to the platforms that we're working on. And so we're investing heavily to finish those and then move on to the next projects.","Operator","We'll go next to Ben Bollin, Cleveland Research.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","I had a couple of questions. So first, Kevin, what was the net impact of the amortized revenue contribution in the quarter for the PND business?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. We actually had a benefit of about $4 million of operating income, about $3 million of sales actually during the period, which is, as we've said throughout the year, we're expecting a fairly small impact each quarter, but it was about $3 million sales impact on deferred revenue that was positive for us.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And another one, when you look at Monterra, the product announcement in the quarter, it's the first alternative OS product that I can recall in the history. What's the strategy, as you look at other operating systems, going forward? Are there any specific segments where you expand on that? Or is this kind of a trial run and you'll see how it goes from here?","Clifton A. Pemble","Ben, I think this is a good example of a market that really wants to have an open OS platform in order to be able to do unique kinds of applications out into the field, whether it's GIS data collection or specialized kind of computations on a geographic basis. So I think we would approach the use of alternative OSs on a case-by-case basis. We feel like Outdoors is one great example, and there may be some others, but I wouldn't expect that it would go across our product lines.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And my last question, when you look at the legacy PND business, how would you look at expense management as those units continue to decline? You talked a little bit about R&D resources there, but what's the right way to think about headcount in that segment and other expenses as you continue to see declines in those units?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think we faced reality for the last several months and quarters on the PND business as it's on a trajectory that's down about 20%, as Cliff said. And we're not spending as much in that segment on R&D, so we have been able to scale that back and -- in some of the other operating expenses as well. And so we have been able to move resources within our business from the declining business into these other traditional segments that are in -- that are still on growth mode. And -- because we manage our businesses by the 5 recordable segments, we have good information on the size and then the scale of those businesses, and that's really how we manage day-to-day.","Operator","Your next question is from Tavis McCourt, Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In the Marine business, you're guiding for 5% to 10% growth for the year, and we saw a nice pickup in June. But I guess, I want to be clear on that. You expect kind of the positive year-over-year trends to continue in the back half of the year, I guess, which would be needed to get to that guidance. Is that correct?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, we're seeing, as I mentioned in my remarks, continued follow-through in the Marine market, and we're pleased with that. We did miss the seasonally strong first quarter due to the late delivery of our products, so we have some ground to make up, but we believe the overall guidance for Marine is reasonably sound.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And in terms of the -- I think in both the commentary related to Fitness and Outdoor, you mentioned about moving into new product adjacencies, which has kind of been your history the last several years in those categories. I guess, can you walk us through any -- like what are the costs of doing that? Are we already seeing the uptick in either research and development or sales and marketing to do that? Can you move in the product adjacencies and still realize leverage? Or are there investment phases that you'll have to go through in those product lines that might impact the margins near term?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think some of the investments have already been realized in those areas as we've been working on those new products and new categories for some time. We do see that we'll have to invest some additional resources in those areas, so I think I would characterize those as incremental at this point. And probably, it doesn't structurally change the overall profile that we have in those segments.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And aside from Vector which, I guess, I would classify as an adjacency, are any of these kind of this holiday season? Or is this -- that more commentary about next year?","Clifton A. Pemble","Probably, the biggest impact will be next year.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Coster with JP Morgan.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I ask the same kind of question every quarter, I think, which is, do you have a view yet on what the sort of end game is for the PND market? Will it -- at what point will it stabilize? And what kind of growth decline do you anticipate on the way there?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Paul. I think it's truthfully anybody's guess at this point. The people are prognosticated what the numbers are in the market both in the growth mode and now on the decline mode has tended to outwit some of the best guesses that people have had. So I think it -- we probably can't speculate. We do believe that it does stabilize at a point, and we're planning our business around stabilization. But at this point, we probably can't predict what it is.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, got it. The -- also OEM business. Can you just give us some sense of the shape of the ramp there and what the contingencies are regarding that ramp? I imagine it has to do with also OEM product introductions and car models and so on.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, that's right. We do see, as we've said in the past, that the OEM business is a long gestation business in the way that it develops. We've seen some good gains in the past year with our new programs at places like Chrysler and Suzuki. Going forward, the growth is contingent upon some of the newer programs, as well as winning new programs. But we would expect it to be -- to develop somewhat on a long-term basis.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. And finally, your latest thoughts on acquisitions, please.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, the acquisitions has been a key strategy of the use of the cash. This has either stabilized or grown over time. We have, across various segments, continued to look at opportunities, so that is still a part of our strategy in terms of the use of cash. Of course, we can't comment on anything -- on any specific deals. But there have been ideas brought to us across the various segments that we serve.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I mean, there's no specific preconceptions around it? There's not necessarily market share or accretion or whatever? It depends on the technology, it depends on the specifics of the situation?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think it definitely depends on the specifics. And I'd say if we're going to lean in one way right now, we'd be more focused on the technology that can help us be even more competitive in the various end markets that we serve.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Sue, RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","As the segment contribution changes, I'm trying to get a sense of what the new band might be for operating margins on a going forward basis. Can we see a lift, for example, back to the high 20s at a corporate level? It does sound much of the heavy lifting for the new products, such as Vector for Aviation is somewhat behind us. So -- and you're not investing in the PND side. So I'm trying to see what the steady-state OEMs might be or if the band actually tightened.","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think what we talked about this year now with our updated -- or slightly updated guidance, we're at the higher end of our earlier range, which is a 20% operating margin. And quite frankly, when we look at a couple of years, this is an area that we need to continue to challenge ourselves and do a good job. A lot of this will depend along what the growth rate on the top line is of our traditional segments. So if PND continues to come down, can we offset that with additional growth of each of these other segments? And if we see that growth with new product introductions and the like, then that can really help us with an operating margin. But are we going to get to a high 20s? I think that's too aggressive. Can we see expended operating margins over time? I think we'll provide some more formal guidance as we go into next year.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Likewise, Kevin, if I am recognizing that there are shared overhead expenses by segment by division. When we look at the cash flow and the concentration of cash flow generation from the Auto\/Mobile business now, how does that look like in the future over the next year or so, with that cash flow concentration from one segment to the others?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think that's one thing that we are pleased with in the results today because despite the fact that the PND has declined, we're still growing market share, and we're also still generating a lot of cash out of the Auto\/Mobile segment. So I think you will likely see similar numbers. We were at 18% operating margin on Auto\/Mobile during the period. I think -- will we be able to maintain that? Maybe not quite that high, but we do have strong margin contributions from each of the other segments, which will help the overall cash flow of the business.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So overall, do you feel that the other segments will generate more cash in the future and I think that's [indiscernible] on PND?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. You've been seeing that in the trend on operating income contribution. I think you'll continue to see that as we go forward.","Operator","We'll go next to John Bright, Avondale Partners.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Cliff and Kevin, I'm going to try to tie a lot of these questions together. The first one, Kevin, on your calendar '13 guidance, you're not changing any of the composition of the ranges between the segments. Is that correct?","Kevin S. Rauckman","That's correct. We still feel pretty comfortable with the earlier ranges that we laid out.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Secondly, you were talking about the new categories in the product launches. R&D certainly is up. Are you managing your sales and marketing G&A well? You targeted -- you talked about targeting adjacent market opportunities. Can you give us -- I know it's tough, any flavor for how meaningful this would be? Or how would you think about that? I think you've already addressed timing.","Clifton A. Pemble","Hey, John, I would probably characterize in the way we planned our guidance that these things are incremental to our overall business.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","All right. In Aviation, I think, in the slides or in the prepared text you talked about growth in -- '13 and '14 will be driven by OEM. What does this mean related to the aftermarket?","Clifton A. Pemble","We're seeing some incremental improvements in the aftermarket during the course so far of 2013, although it's been at a lower level than the contributions by OEM in new platforms that we've had in this segment. I think it's a little tough to call, because Aviation has been one of the slowest markets to respond to gradually improving economic conditions, but we would anticipate that aftermarket would continue to incrementally grow over the course or the remainder of 2013 and into 2014.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","All right. The R&D, a pretty good pickup this quarter. Kevin, the run rate for R&D?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Run rate for the remainder of the year? Is that what your question is?","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Kevin S. Rauckman","So we run at around 14% of sales, and we're expecting that our R&D will still be somewhere in that range between 14% and 15% of sales for the full year. So we expect maybe a little bit of an uptick for about -- but in some areas, like Cliff mentioned, Marine, we're pretty much at a level where we feel like we can manage that business without any other increases. So again, overall, I would say, R&D will be between 14% and 15% of sales for the full year.","John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Final question. You're -- again, you're managing this transition, I think, well. There seems to be light at the end of the tunnel. Given your expectations that Auto\/Mobile will be less than 50% of revenue in -- for calendar '13, should investors view calendar '13 as a free cash flow trough and there's a potential for total revenue growth in calendar '14?","Kevin S. Rauckman","I think that's a very difficult answer for us to give at this point. We had earlier stated that our free cash flow will be somewhere around 525 for the year. We have -- we really don't come off of that number. The question is, is that a trough? I mean, it's hard to tell. We'll -- again, we'll be able to update you, all, as we get through the back half of the year to see if we feel 2014 and beyond will have a pickup from there.","Operator","We'll go next to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You had some fairly good upside in ASPs, and I think you attributed to that to mix and the benefit from deferred. Can you just give us a bit more detail on the mix side, in particular in terms of what drove the upside there?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, I think -- I would think, in general, the PND ASP really didn't move much. We've seen just a very low-single-digit decline, which is really helping us because then when we have product mix from our traditional segment that is improving, the prices on many of those, like Marine and Aviation, have impacted ASPs. So that's probably all there really is to talk about in terms of the ASP trends within the business.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you talked quite a bit about the adjacencies you're investing in, in Outdoor and Fitness. But can you address a little bit more broadly this whole category of Fitness bands and watches? There has been a lot of attention in that category, a lot of upcoming products there from Google, Apple, Sony, startups like Pebble, et cetera. How do you view that strategically? And recognizing it's not necessarily directly competitive, but to what extent do you think it might be substitutive? And how do you guys intend to respond to that?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, Simona, I think speculation around smart watches has been going rampant. And definitely, the market is starting to see some products out there and some functionalities that we can expect going forward. I would view Garmin as kind of an early mover in the whole area of wearable devices. And so for us, we feel that we have some things that we can bring to that kind of market but in our own special way, so it is an area of interest for us.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the last question on the Aviation segment. Obviously, we had some issues cited both at Bombardier and most recently, at Cessna, related to the ramp of the G5000. That didn't seem to impact your guidance for this fiscal year. Was that because there was an offset to that, to the upside? Or was there just kind of no negative impact from those couple of issues and delay in the ramp of the programs? And then just looking longer term, are there any implications from these couple of issues either for your competitive positioning or the required level of investment?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. I think that, definitely, we -- the delays have probably muted a bit the OEM revenue that we had been anticipating for the year, although it's still within our guidance range for the segment. I would say that for the delays and our ability to win new business, definitely, it's not what we had anticipated in terms of when we started these programs, but we feel that, on a comprehensive basis, the OEMs will make selections based on a number of factors, and our equipment does bring a huge value proposition to the market. So we think that's going to be a big driver. And we feel like we've learned a lot in the process of doing these new programs, and so we should be able to execute new programs much more efficiently.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in terms of the level of investment, would that go higher partly in response to these issues? And do you think that there is further investment necessary?","Clifton A. Pemble","Well, we definitely ramped up additional investments over the course of these programs beyond, probably, what we anticipated in the beginning. So we're already seeing the effects of that. We would expect to see the investments continue to grow over the next year just from the same point of year-over-year comparables. But I think, at some level, we'll reach what we feel is a good level for the level of business that we have.","Operator","We'll go next to James Faucette, Pacific Crest.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just had a few follow-up questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the strength that you're seeing in the Outdoor segment? It seems like we were anniversarying some pretty meaningful product launches flash [ph] from last year, but continue -- you guys continue to do well. And it sounds like you're expecting to take a bit more of a step-up as we go into the latter part of the year. Just looking for a little color on how you're seeing the outdoor market developed for Garmin right now.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, James. The outdoor market, I think, has been driven by a couple of things. One is the golf market, where our products have been very popular, particularly at the beginning of the summer season and kind of the moms and dads and grads gifting season. And also, the dog tracking and training area has been an area of growth for us. So these 2 areas really helped drive growth in Outdoor. And our traditional product in the segment continued to be reasonably steady, so that's really the color behind what's going on in Outdoor. I think going forward, again, we're continuing to expand the category, so we will anticipate in the back half of the year that the growth will continue.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then when you look at the Marine segment, you talked about having missed an important window in the earlier part of the year, with a little bit of weight delivery but are catching up now. How are you feeling about that -- the product cadence within Marine is? Is this something where we should continue to see annual product introductions will continue to be important and you're targeting hitting the window better? Or are these longer life products where you don't feel like that's as important as it maybe has been in the last few years?","Clifton A. Pemble","I think my answer would probably be a little bit of both. We know that the product life cycle in Marine is definitely longer, and it typically tends to be in the 2- to 4-year time frame. But with that said, it is still very important when you introduce the new products to introduce in the timing of the season, so that you can take advantage of when people are buying and quipping their boats in the spring.","James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then last couple of quick questions. Can you just comment quickly on what you're seeing in terms of pricing of PNDs? You've been pretty clear about what you expect unit volumes, but in the past, you've talked about stabilization. I'm just wondering if that's continuing. And then also, could you remind us where you maybe at in any current buyback program approvals?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Yes. So I just mentioned earlier, as James said our -- we do not see much PND price compression. In fact, we're looking at this very small single-digit decline so far this year, and we had that also in the second quarter. So that's really our expectation, even as we go through the back half of the year as well. And then on the buyback, we mentioned that we bought $13 million of stock. In fact, we have $300 million approved by the board that will get us through, not only this year, but the end of 2014. So we really just kind of got going in the second quarter, with some additional buyback and we'll continue that as we progress.","Operator","We'll go next to Jonathan Ho, William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just wanted to get a little bit more color around the fleet management opportunity that you guys had talked about and maybe where you're seeing traction and potentially maybe some color on the distribution model there?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes, Jonathan. The fleet opportunity is something we view as incremental in the overall PND area. Over the course of the last few years, we have offered both hardware and software solutions to our PNDs that allow other fleet solution providers to integrate our PNDs into their overall solution. And so our most recent entry into this is an evolution of that, where we've taken what was a hardware interface between our product and the equipment that's onboard the vehicle and made it a wireless product that eliminates the need for additional equipment in the vehicle. So it's a step -- additional step into that market. But again, it's something that we would view as incremental and not material to the overall size of the PND market.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. I just also wanted to get an update in terms of what you're seeing in terms of component pricing, whether the volume declines have had a material impact there or whether that's just been offset by natural declines.","Clifton A. Pemble","I think our component pricing, we feel, is progressing as we anticipated. We typically anticipate about a 4% reduction in component cost. We're not seeing any pressure due to the reduced volumes. Our volumes are still very meaningful, and so we have many suppliers who are willing to compete for our business.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Spinola, Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Cliff, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the heads-up display. It seems like there's been quite a bit more press than I would have expected on that product. I think it's in the market already if I'm not mistaken. I was wondering if you could comment on just sort of the interest in that and the possible sort of benefit you could get from that product.","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. I think we were also pleasantly surprised by the interest in that product as well. We do view that product as an incremental opportunity in the mobile space. I think that the, excitement aside, we probably view it as being a more limited type of upside versus if you read into all the new stories. You might think that it's going to be huge. But that said, it's not yet in the market, it will be soon. But we'll be delivering probably in the next 30 days or so.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then on the announcement in Marine this morning with Volvo Penta. Could you give us some sense of -- are there OEM wins already in place? Or is this -- how is the revenue going to be realized with this relationship? And could you maybe remind me on what the OEM content of Marine revenue is right now? And do you think that this announcement, which I think is one of your bigger relationships, should accelerate the growth in that revenue line going forward?","Clifton A. Pemble","Yes. Our OEM mix in Marine has been a small portion. We've never broken it out, but it's a smaller portion of our overall Marine revenues. We would expect the relationship with Volvo to increase that proportion and thus, grow our sales. Volvo is very strong, as you know, in propulsion, and these systems are variations of our glass cockpits, which allow display of engine information, as well as the integration of systems on the boat. So we feel like there's a unique value proposition here with Volvo and they then take this system and their propulsion equipment to OEMs, which is a selling opportunity. So the revenue model is really like a B2B type of approach, where Volvo is taking the product and then selling it into their customers.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And one last question for Kevin. The Auto margin, I think, was better than I was looking for. And it seemed like there was some cost restraint in the quarter. And I'm just wondering, because I haven't seen the breakdown yet, did you pull back on advertising in the quarter? Or is there something else that maybe went on?","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, yes. We did have both SG&A reductions and also, advertising. And advertising, as we said in our formal remarks, had a lot to do with the volume of PND. So that definitely did sell -- sustain our strong double-digit operating margins within Auto\/Mobile, yes.","Operator","And we have no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Rauckman to offer any additional or closing remarks.","Kevin S. Rauckman","Well, again, we want to thank everyone for their interest in the company. We really appreciate the interest and also the questions, and we look forward to updating everyone again in the next quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Kerri Thurston. Please go ahead.","Kerri Thurston","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Limited\u2019s Third quarter 2012 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to send our warmest thoughts to all those on the East Coast that have been and will continue to be affected by Sandy. The Garmin family has made contributions to several organizations which are seeking with relief efforts throughout the region.","Looking now at the quarter please note that a copy of the press release concerning this earning\u2019s call is available at Garmin\u2019s Investor Relations site on the internet at garmin.com\/stock. Additionally, this call is being broadcast live on the Internet.

The presenters for this morning\u2019s call are Cliff and Kevin.","At this time, I\u2019ll like to turn the call over to Cliff.","Cliff Pemble","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As we announced earlier this morning, Garmin delivered revenue growth and strong margin performance, resulting in proforma EPS growth in the third quarter. Consolidated revenues increased 1% year-over-year to $672 million driven by gains in the Outdoor and Aviation segments.","Our traditional markets of Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness contributed 43% of the total revenue mix and 59% of the total operating income for the quarter. Gross margins improved to 53% in the quarter. Operating margins also improved to 24% from 22% in the prior year as operating expenses were essentially flat.","Revenue growth combined with improved margins resulted in both operating income and proforma EPS growth. Operating income for the quarter grew 9% to $160 million while proforma EPS was $0.74, a 4% improvement over the prior year.","We sold approximately 3.7 million units in the quarter, which is up 7% year-over-year as Auto OEMs and Outdoor volumes increased. In light of our third quarter results, we are increasing our full year proforma EPS guidance. We now expect our EPS to fall in the range $2.75 on the low end to $2.90 on the high end. Kevin will provide additional insights later.","Next, I\u2019ll walk you through the financial and strategic highlights for each segment. In the Marine segment, revenue declined 7% driven by weak conditions outside of the Americas particularly in the European market. In contrast, we experienced modest growth in the Americas. Favorable product mix led to higher gross margin and gross profit, which more than offset the impact of lower sales.","Our high end boat market continues to struggle due to weak economic conditions around the world. We anticipate these conditions will persist in to 2013, dampening the near-term growth prospects in the Marine market.","However, we are not allowing the poor conditions to distract us from our growth strategy in the segment. In the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Nexus Marine, giving us an immediate presence in the sailing instrumentation market, where Nexus is a highly respected brand. Additionally, we continue to invest in new product development in order to gain share and to better position ourselves for growth when economic conditions improve.","In Aviation, we posted revenue growth of 3% as improved OEM deliveries offset weakness in retrofit and portable products. As we have highlighted in prior quarters, operating margin is trending below historical norms as we invest in aircraft certification programs that will reach the market in 2013 and beyond. We currently have six announced cockpits slated for delivery in the coming year which will generate new revenue and growth for the future.","Note that this morning\u2019s past release mentions five programs that will be completed in 2013. With the recent announcements factored in, the number is now six.","During the quarter, we announced two additional cockpit wins that highlight the progress we are making to expand our presence in the OEM market. Just this week, Cessna announced that our G5000 integrated flight deck has been chosen for the upgraded Citation Sovereign. And early in the quarter, we announced a new relationship with AgustaWestland, who selected a G1000H for updated 119 model helicopter. Both the Sovereign and the 119 are scheduled for certification in 2013.","I also want to mention that Garmin was ranked number one in product support by Aviation International News for the ninth consecutive year. This is an incredible accomplishment and highlights that outstanding product support is one of our strongest differentiators as we compete against incumbents in the segment. I want to congratulate our Aviation product support team, the recognition by Aviation International News is certainly well deserved.","The Outdoor segment continues to deliver strong results in the quarter with 11% revenue growth and 17% operating income growth. The improved results can be attributed to our golf lineup, our dog tracking and training portfolio and our recently introduced f\u0113nix which is a GPS enabled watch for hunters, hikers and outdoor enthusiasts who generally like to place their own trails.","In the third quarter, we delivered our Alpha tracking and training system which combines robust GPS tracking and mapping capability from Garmin with proven electronic training from our TriTronics division. Initial reviews and field tests have been positive and we anticipate the product will be well throughout this hunting season.","Looking next to the Fitness segment, revenue declined 6% though we were able to generate gross margin and operating income growth on a year-over-year basis. As we have mentioned in the past, revenue and margin performance are linked to variability and our product cycle. In both the second and third quarter of 2011, we experienced strong demand for the newly released Forerunner 610 while discounts on the end of life Forerunner 305 drove additional volumes at the low end of the market, but negatively impacted margins. This year we saw continued growth in our cycling and multi-sport product lines. However, it was not enough to offset the year-over-year decline in running product.","During the quarter, we launched our latest running watch the Forerunner 10. The Forerunner 10 is a value priced watch at a $129 and is an affordable and intuitive solution for runners, joggers and walkers of all levels. Early response to the product has been positive with great reviews and strong initial orders. We are confident that the Forerunner 10 will have disclosed the gap led by the Forerunner 305 at the low end of the market.","In our Automobile segment revenue was flat; however strong margin performance and lower expenses in this segment resulted in a 16% increase in operating profit. Market share also improved in the third quarter when compared to 2011. We estimate our share in North America exceed 70%. Our European market share is in the low to mid 30% range.","Our outlook in the PND markets remains unchanged with units and value declining approximately 10% to 15% for the year. While the Garmin market has continued to decline, share gains have a lot of significantly outperformed the market.","During the quarter, we introduced a new member of our diesel product family with a large seven inch display designed specifically for trucks and RVs, where specialized needs drive higher ASPs and stronger margins. We also updated our StreetPilot and Navigon mobile applications with public transit features providing mobile phone users with a complete solution for both automotive and production and navigation. These additional features serve to further differentiate our applications and drive consumer adoption. ","Before turning the call over to Kevin, I want to provide a brief update on the auto OEM market. We launched the next generation navigation solution with Chrysler incorporating advanced features such as 3D mapping, trip planning and multi reviews. These enhancements will be available on select 2013 Chrysler and Dodge models. Also on the third quarter, we shipped our first fully integrated infotainment solution to Suzuki with a 2013 FX4 Grand Vitara and Kizashi models. We are excited to see these models reach Suzuki dealers in markets around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Russia. ","Now Kevin will walk us through the financial results.","Kevin Rauckman","Thank you Cliff. Good morning everyone. I would like to begin by reviewing our income statement. As I move to the balance sheet and cash flow statement finally concluding with the comments regarding our full year 2012 expectations. As Cliff mentioned, we posted revenue of $672 million for the quarter, with pro forma net income of $146 million. Our pro forma EPS was $0.74 per share, which excluded the foreign currency loss. Our revenue represents an increase of 1% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 53%, which was a 180 basis points improvement from prior year. ","Now I will discuss margin results in further detail by segment. Operating margin was 24%, up 170 basis points from the prior year. The components of this were the gross margin capability of 180 basis points offset by an unfavorable operating expenses impact of 10 basis points. Total operating expenses increased by only $2 million in the current quarter, with a $10 million increase in R&D offset by improvements in advertising and SG&A. ","Each of these expense categories will be discussed further on a later slide. ","Our pro forma EPS of $0.74 represents a 4% increase year-over-year, driven by the increasing revenues and improved gross and operating margins. Units shipped increased 7% year-over-year as 3.7 units were delivered during the quarter. According to US GAAP, we must defer revenue on certain products, and this table summarizes the net impact of the deferral and amortization of revenue and related costs in third quarter 2012 and 2011. ","In the current quarter, we deferred on a net basis approximately $20 million of revenues, resulting in a $0.07 of tax affected deferred EPS during the quarter. In the third quarter of 2011, we deferred net revenue of $24 million or $0.08 of tax affected EPS. While we are deferring revenue according to US GAAP, we are collecting the cash at time of sale as reflected in the statement of cash flows. We expect to have a negative revenue and EPS impact due to deferrals in the fourth quarter, but do not expect the impact to be as significant as the amounts that we deferred during the same period in 2011.","In total our revenues increased 1% during the third quarter with Outdoor and Aviation contributing most of the growth. During Q3 the auto\/mobile segment revenues were flat as volume growth was offset by a slight decline in average selling price. Volume growth was driven by market share gains and strengthening results with our auto OEM partners. ","Our Outdoor segment posted the strongest revenue growth at 11%, due primarily to our GPS enabled golf products, growth in our dog tracking and training portfolio and strong consumer reception for our Phoenix product. Business segment posted a 6% revenue decrease when compared to Q3 2011. This slowdown resulted from a strong Q3, 2011, when we were heavily promoting the Forerunner 305 as the product reach the end of it's lifecycle and [after] fulfilling orders for the Forerunner 610. We hope to see improving results in Q4, driven primarily and partially by the launch of the Forerunner 10.","Aviation segment revenues increased to 3% compared to Q3 2011, with growth in OEM partially offset by a slowdown in retrofit and portable products. Our marine segment revenues decreased 7% compared to Q3, 2011 as both the aftermarket and OEM markets slowed down due to a global decline in the marine electronics market.","During Q3, both the Americas and APAC both posted revenue growth with a partial offset due to the decline in EMEA. The decline in EMEA is the result of difficult macroeconomic conditions in most of the regions.","For Q3 2012, the Americas represented 57% of revenue compared to 53% in Q3, 2011. The EMEA decreased from 39% of total revenue in Q3 to 33% in Q3 2012, while APAC increased from 8% to 10% in the same period. ","The auto\/mobile segment represented 57% of our total revenue during Q3 2012, down slightly from 58%. Outdoor grew to 16% of revenues in the quarter, an increase of 14% in 2011. Due to the improved profitability of auto\/mobile in the third quarter of 2012, the operating income contribution of this segment increased to 41% from 38% of the prior year.","In absolute dollars, our traditional segments of aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness contributed 95 million of operating income in the quarter 4% increase over the third quarter of 2011, even as we invest heavily in future OEM opportunities in marine and aviations.","Looking next at margins, Q3 auto\/mobile gross margin and operating margin were 43% and 17% respectively. Gross margins were stable as deferred revenues became less at a year-over-year impact in the quarter. Operating margin improvement resulted from decreasing advertising and SG&A expenses in the segment. Q3 outdoor gross margin was 69%, up from 66% in Q3 2011. Operating margin was 46% an improvement from 44% in the year ago quarter, as improved gross margins were partially offset by a slight increase in operating expenses.","Q3 fitness gross margin was 65% up from 60% in the year ago quarter when we were heavily discounting the Forerunner 305. Operating margin was 33% again up from 30% at the year ago quarter, as improved gross margins were partially offset by increased advertising and R&D costs. Q3 marine gross margin was 64% compared to 55% at a year ago, as product mix shifted toward higher margin products and we participated in fewer promotional activities. ","Our operating margin was 19% down 21% a year ago, as the gross margin improvement continued to be offset by increased R&D expenses to support our long-term marine OEM strategy and new product launches scheduled for next year. And finally our Q3 aviations gross margin was 69% up from 66% in Q3, 2011. ","The operating margin was 23% for the quarter down from 27% in the prior year, as gross margin improvement was offset by increased R&D expense associated with the new OEMs programs that will begin to contribute to revenue in 2013, as well as increased SG&A cost due to a bad debt credit in Q3, 2011.","Q3 operating expense have increased by $2 million on year-over-year basis from $197 million and Q3, 2011 to $199 million in Q3, 2012. An increase of only 10 basis points as a percentage of sale. [RV] increased to $10 million year-over-year in Q3 and 130 basis points to 12% of sales as headcount increased and we continue to invest in OEM opportunities.","Our advertising spending decreased $5 million over the year ago quarter and decreased 80 basis points as a percent of sales to 4% in Q3 of 2012. This was largely driven by decreasing cooperative advertising.","SG&A decreased $2 million compared to the year ago quarter and 40 basis points to 13% of sales. This decrease is primarily attributable to reduced commission expenses. We have now anniversaried our major acquisitions in 2011 and are pleased to see this flattening of SG&A expense.","Moving next to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.7 billion. Our accounts receivable increased sequentially to $509 million that fell slightly on a year-over-year basis due to continued sale strength in the third quarter.","Accounts receivable accounted for approximately 65 days of sales when calculated on trailing four quarters, compared to 74 days of sales in the third quarter of 2011. Our inventory balances increased to $443 million on a sequential basis at the close of Q3 as we prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. ","Our days of inventory metric was 125 days which was flat to the third quarter of 2011. The dividend payable now reflects two remaining quarterly payments of $0.45 per share which was approved by our shareholders on June 1 at the annual meeting. ","Our deferred revenue balance has continued to grow, net of deferred costs, it represents approximately $1.43 of deferred EPS. We continue to generate free cash flow across our businesses as cash from operations was $165 million during Q3. CapEx was $9 million during the quarter therefore we generated free cash flow during Q3 of [$135 million]. ","Cash flow invested during Q3 was $104 million which includes the $9 million of CapEx and $93 million of net purchases as marketable securities. Financing activities were $87 million use of cash during Q3 due primarily to the dividend payment for September and we are at an average of 1.2% on all cash and marketable securities balances during the quarter. ","With our strong free cash flow generation year-to-date we are making good progress toward our forecast of $650 million which will continue to fund our annualized dividend of $1.80 per share or approximately $350 million use of cash. We also continue to pursue acquisitions in adjacent niche markets and tuck in technologies which fit with our core markets. ","As has been Garmin\u2019s practices, the acquisitions will be evaluated by technology, values compatibility and strategic fit within Garmin. Our tax rate for Q3, 2012 was 13.7% due to the revenue mix by geography and segment. We expect the full year 2012 rate to be approximately 13%. ","Finally, given our strong EPS performance in Q3 we are again raising our full year EPS guidance to $2.75 to $2.90. This continues to incorporate some uncertainties regarding the European markets and consumer spending as we head into the holiday season. This ends our formal comments for the quarter. We will now enter a period for you to ask questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Ameet Prabhu - RBC ","This is Ameet Prabhu calling on behalf of Mark Sue. Your P&D market share has been stabilizing in the US and in Europe. In the US, it seems there maybe limited upside growth but maybe could you discuss the share trend in Europe given the market has multiple smaller players and some of them might have to exit the market considering the macro?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah, so as you stated we do have very strong share in the US. It is up over a year ago. We are now in the below 70% range versus last year in the 60% range. You are right that the upside potential there is more limited in Europe, we are currently in the low 30% range in the big five countries and we do see opportunities to gain share from both the third-tier players who continue to show weakness and exit the market as well as from the bigger players as well.","Ameet Prabhu - RBC ","This is a follow-up on your cash flow. Free cash flow has been strong and you built up cash this year but could you maybe discuss cash contribution from the various segments because I guess the concern is that as P&D units decline year-over-year and the contribution from your other segment increases, would that have any impact on your ability to generate free cash?","Kevin Rauckman","No, actually we feel like our cash flow has been at or above expected and if you look at just the operating income results, those are really by segment. That\u2019s really what's driving that cash flow. So we still see you point out the automobile. We feel the strong cash flow generation trend from the automobile segment as we do from all the other business segments that we have. So, moving forward, we would expect continued strong cash flow even in through 2013 or maybe short-term or some nominal impact, negative levels just due to the deferred revenues as we discussed as those move from being a headwind against us into positive as we go forward in 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Just first a clarification overall, I think you updated the EPS guidance but I was curious if you might update or comment on the revenue guidance for the year which you had given before and then just some questions on the fitness part of the business. You commented on the gross margins improving partly because of the easy [comps] from a year ago when you had more discounting. It was a bit surprising because I would assume that Forerunner 10 might have lower margins given its lower end product. So maybe you can just comment on how you see the mix shift impacting margins in fitness going forward when you take into account the Forerunner 10 and then may be any another upcoming end of life cycle discounting?","Kevin Rauckman","","Okay, Simona thanks for the questions. The first question on revenue, we have really came in very close to our expectations during this quarter in total revenue and so we didn\u2019t believe that there was any reason to update our guidance so we still hold the $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion revenue for the full year of 2012. And looking at the fitness, clearly we did have some short-term impacts last year as you mentioned the Forerunner 10 while, it began shipping in Q3. We are really expecting a much stronger contribution from the Forerunner 10 product in the holiday season in Q4. So it had some impact but relatively small impact from that product. I think I mentioned $2.7 billion on revenue. So it\u2019s actually $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion on the total businesses revenue guidance.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Just to clarify on the Forerunner 10, should we expect that to mix margins down into the fourth quarter then for the fitness segment?","","Kevin Rauckman","I think as you naturally a holiday selling, we have not only on the Forerunner 10 but just in general, we have lower price and lower costs on that product, so we will have some impact on margins we would say overall focus fitness in the automobile segments typically have a lower margins in the fourth quarter.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","And any update on the Vector timing?","Clifton Pemble","Yes Simona, this is Cliff. We are making progress on Vector. We have been evaluating new design changes and we do feel like things are looking promising and are sticking to our early next year or first quarter or early second quarter deliveries.","Operator","Our next question from Yair Reiner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","TomTom yesterday when they reported results suggested that they are seeing more muted seasonality. Do you see the same going into fourth quarter may be we could just talk about promotional activity for the holiday season?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah, typically, we see a sequential growth from Q3 to Q4 and we are still expecting that but I would say in general there are some macroeconomic uncertainties and primarily even the European condition, European economic conditions which is why we\u2019ve tried to put in some level of conservatives in our fourth quarter. So sequential growth is normal but maybe a little bit below we would typically see.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","Okay, and then you mentioned that auto OEM was strong in the quarter. Can you give us a sense of how much that might have diluted auto margins?","Cliff Pemble","We really don't breakout, we don't breakout the profitability by the sub-segments there. Although, we definitely have auto OEM operating margins which are below our mobile and our P&D margins at this point, so.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","Okay, and then one another one if I could, on fitness it was down year-on-year, do you expect it to go return to year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter?","Cliff Pemble","We expect to turn around it would be a flat to up for the fourth quarter driven by the new product introductions.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Bright from Avondale Partners. Your line is open.","John Bright - Avondale Partners","Follow-up on a couple of questions, Cliff and Kevin, first regarding your guidance, do you have any impact from Hurricane Sandy or do you expect any impact associated with that?","Kevin Rauckman","Well, we don't clearly anticipate a significant impact. And our Q4 guidance takes into account some level of the global macro economic weakness and consumer uncertainties stemming from various sources including the catastrophic effects of Sandy, but at this point we feel like those would be pretty nominal.","John Bright - Avondale Partners","And then the discussion of auto OEM, maybe give us an outlook or thought process today for additional wins and how that progress is going?","Cliff Pemble","We are making progress John as you know this market has a long cycle in terms of product development, but we are working on some additional programs which we are not prepared to announce yet.","John Bright - Avondale Partners","Understanding you are not guiding for \u201913, but you made some positive commentary I think in the Aviation segment regarding some wins you had in place maybe you could, or how should investors think about the financial impact to Aviation in calendar \u201913?","Kevin Rauckman","I think as Cliff mentioned the six certifications and that the expansion that we are seeing, we are expecting this year to be 0% to 5% even though there has been some difficult environment, difficult industry. So we would expect that that would increase next year and again we are not deploying where we can give exact guidance, but we are optimistic about the Aviation business and the most recent wins that we've announced.","John Bright - Avondale Partners","And on the health of the channel inventory specifically in the Outdoor, Fitness segment and then maybe overall?","Kevin Rauckman","We don't really see any significant impacts on channel; the product have been moving as expected through the channel, so no expectations on any kind of sell in versus sell out discrepancies for outdoor or for automobile.","John Bright - Avondale Partners","Final question on Marine. On your OEM efforts there, how large of an opportunity is the OEM business in the Marine segment, one? And then what if any are the holes that you have in your new product offering?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah, John we, don't break out, obviously Auto OEM versus aftermarket and the same is true in Marine. I would say though that we've been under penetrated in OEM for many years and so we see it as a growth opportunity. Keep in mind though that both building is at some of the lowest levels that's been in many decades, so its not the same opportunity that it was four or five years ago.","John Bright - Avondale Partners","And regarding the holes in the product offering today?","Cliff Pemble","I think we have most of those covered at this point. We are investing heavily in R&D to fill some of those holes as well as refresh our product line which is some of the comments we made behind the margin compression there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company. Your line is open.","Charlie Anderson - Dougherty & Company","So I wanted to start with auto gross margins, sort of net of deferrals that have been very strong this year compared to last year and I imagine price stability have something to do with it. But I also wonder if you are seeing an up tick and maybe some of the App sales with Apple issues on their product and maybe some of those OEM gross margins are stronger?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah, Charlie I think some of that is due to product mix in the PND segment which is driving the overall gross margin picture. So that's probably the biggest factor. In terms of the Apple situation, I think our App sales are pretty much steady, some up tick that the result is really not significant. We feel the consumers that are looking for premium navigation are not impacted or influenced by the availability of free solutions that are on the platforms.","Charlie Anderson - Dougherty & Company","And in terms of the guidance and what implies for Q4. I think I am showing at the mid-point a high-single digit to revenue decline. When you say fitness is going to be flat I think that implies everything else pretty much down. I wondered if you could correct me on that if anything else is going to be up, and in terms of what is going to be down kind of degrees by segment, that will be helpful. Thanks.","Kevin Rauckman","Yeah, I think in general, your numbers are pretty accurate. Maybe the aviation gets a slight growth in the quarter, but in general flat up on fitness. Outdoor, probably has a slight growth as well, but given the expectations on PND we're being conservative there. We believe just due to some of the conditions, especially as I mentioned in Europe.","Charlie Anderson - Dougherty & Company","In terms of fitness, you mentioned in the press release, there are growth opportunities. You know, we're seeing a decline here. It's going to be up a little bit in Q4. I wonder if you can highlight what some of those growth opportunities are for us?","Cliff Pemble","Charlie, I think as we mentioned, the low end of the market has been left uncovered by us since the exit of the 305. So we feel like that is an opportunity for us to expand our sales again in that segment of the market. And then as we get closer to the vector release, we do believe that\u2019s an opportunity for growth as we're currently not represented in the power market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Sutherland from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Securities","Just sticking on that fitness segment, you talked about the multi-sport and the cycling product, which are usually higher end products, is most that revenue decline attributed to the low-end product and do you think you can gain back share from some of the smartphone or Nike solutions by introducing this new watch.","Kevin Rauckman","Yeah, Scott, definitely those products and bikes and multi-sport are definitely higher end. We still have a very strong presence in what we call the running market which is the Forerunner 610 and that\u2019s where the Forerunner 305 and now the Forerunner 10 moved. We feel that our share has been pretty much stable, some erosion due to the low end solution but we have done pretty well with the market that\u2019s been asking us is there something to replace those revenues on the low end.","","Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Securities","When you look at the marine segment I know I think you have a product cycle of over two years what\u2019s the timing of next product cycle there?","","Kevin Rauckman","Well we are pretty much there now in terms of refreshing our product cycle. The cycle in marine is probably a little longer than two years it tends to be two to three years, but we have been investing heavily and we will be refreshing our line in the coming year.","","Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Securities","And lastly on that revenue question for Q4, looks like you are guiding your EPS significantly lower. You have outperformed the first three quarters of this year versus last year in each of these quarters, now you are getting down the EPS. Is there spending or some margin inputs that we should take into account for this guidance?","","Cliff Pemble","If you look historically at what happens between Q3 and Q4 sequentially, we typically see a pretty significant drop in gross margin, so we are expecting the gross margins in the business to be below 50%. Secondly we are in a period because of the holiday season while we see a significant increase in advertising, so we will have some sequential growth and both media spend and cooperative advertising due to the higher volumes. So those are the two major impacts on driving our EPS assumptions in Q4.","","Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Securities","I guess putting it in a different way you typically see sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 and looks like you are guiding flattish to downish from Q3 to Q4. Is there something else on a sequential basis that which we take into account?","","Cliff Pemble","No, nothing else sort of that, just looking at the top line and our expectations across the various segments that I just laid out in our earlier questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Spinola from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo","Just I am looking at your Q3 auto revenue, it just knowing what we know about the PND market it seems like you had some pretty strength in the OEM business. Is there any color you can give whether it\u2019s something as simple as sequential growth, so we have an idea of how that impact to Q3 and also just if there was any one-time may be unusually higher than normal OEM revenue because of the Suzuki shipments, any color that will be great?","Cliff Pemble","Yeah, Andrew definitely our OEM is growing because of our Chrysler relationship as well as now in Suzuki. As we mentioned before, we don't breakout OEM versus PND so we are not prepared to give much color beyond that. In the PND market though on one condition that we faced last year is that the channel was a very lean and so this year the channel have been recovering and we believe we outperformed other markets to some extend because the channel is getting back to more normal levels. And then the second factor associated with our better performance in PND is that we are taking market share.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo","Got it. Is there anything one-time in nature to Q3 because of the initial shipments to Suzuki or is that sustainable level going forward?","Cliff Pemble","I think as the sustainable level going forward.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo","Great. And then just one other question. Just on the insider sales recently, I would assume it opens up potentially a window for share repurchases. And I don't know if one-for-one or anything like that but is there any opportunity possible to move forward with share repurchases?","Kevin Rauckman","Well, at this point, we have no approved buyback program, it\u2019s something that we could consider in terms of the use of cash but at this point we don't have anything to announce. It definitely gives a little bit more flexibility but we don't have anything that we can really discuss at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Faucette of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","James Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities","Just a couple of questions for me. First, can you talk a little bit about the retailer strategy for the holiday season around your core consumer products like PND, fitness and outdoor where you are seeing retailers being I guess maybe more aggressive or how retailers are bearing from what your plan was coming into the year. And then you mentioned in the last answer a little bit about PND inventories in particular coming back up to maybe more normal levels or at least that's what I understood you just said. You talked about how you are thinking about the ongoing decline in sell through rates and what you are thinking about going into next year? Thank you. ","Cliff Pemble","Yeah, James in terms of the retailer commitment and activities going into Q4, it\u2019s largely what we have seen in last year. There's going to be major promotions at all of the major retailers including Floor Displays and Black Friday advertisements and the Garmin is also doing a TV campaign as well. So we are really don't feel a lot of change in that respect, some of our other product lines are getting more attention during this holiday season. So there will be a lot of activity around golf and sports as well. So we believe that those will be also popular products in the fourth quarter. In terms of the ongoing PND decline, we would at this point expect to see the market continue to be in a secular decline position for 2013. We haven't forecasted that as of yet but right now rates are running in the range of 15% to 20% depending on the market and we would see that continuing into 2013. ","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.","","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","","Just a quick follow-up on advertising, it was down year-on-year in 3Q both in absolute terms and as percentage of revenue. For the fourth quarter, can you give us a sense of what its going to look like on a year-on-year basis?","Kevin Rauckman","Yeah, it was down primarily due to cooperative advertising. We did have a little bit of a decline in media spend as well and as we said in our formal remarks that put us down closer to 4% of sales. Typically, we would see that up between 5% and 6% of sales during the fourth quarter. So that's what we would expect in Q4.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","And are you going to have any major TV buyers?","Kevin Rauckman","As Cliff just mentioned we do have plans to do a TV ad campaign during the holiday season.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Cliff Pemble","Okay, thanks Stephanie, and thank you everyone for contributing and for listening in. We look forward to finishing the year strong and updating you at the next quarterly conference call. So have a great day.","","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day."]}}
